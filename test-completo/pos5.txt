 Lincoln   You deserve gold my friend      He does this every game at one time or another. Look for it every time you go to a game. I sit there every time and it happens every time   If you're in town you should show me some good spots!   It's a shame. The university kinda sucks but hey they got good pizza.   Flying out there December 22nd!   I went last summer and my friend and I had the park to ourselves after 8:00. It really is worth the trip.  It's a little jarring at first but trust me if you don't love to far (I live 4 hours away) it's totally worth it.   christmas at breck can't come soon enough     	10
 Hmmm, link?  I tried a small Google search and the top like 3 pages were about "de boss rooster"...   Haha, I have no idea if the "man" in that was thinking I am male, but I am not.  But I say "dude" all the time anyways, no matter who it is!  But never "bro"... never, ever "bro"... I think the thing that kills me the most is that I did this all to myself.  And I'm sitting here crying about my life when people affected by Sandy have no homes, etc.    	2
 You contaminate your food? That doesn't sound healthy.    "A talking rock" really made me chuckle.    Make sure the product key is registered to your account.

You know, it's nice to read things like this every once in awhile. It makes me, whom has been at 50 for awhile now, really look back at how far I've come. It can be awe inducing for players that have not yet reached that stage. Thanks for sharing your experiences!  	8
 Offer to do something she wants. or a fetish. only fair.   I'd rather share my opinion about the multitude of threads talking about the banning of FPH.    Yes, 100%. My depression was based on not knowing how to communicate, cope, express myself, because of my upbringing. And other things of course (genetics, imbalance). But yes, that's why I started to use. Some others here may say they didn't start because of this, but continued to use because of depression. Slippery slope. Fuck depression.  Edit: opiates have been 10x better for my depression than SSRIs/SNRIs.   This happens all the time. They just changed the packaging. One is newer than the other.   12 steps   Left my penis in the car, one of them melted slightly.   fuck her   To rebuild again and learn from this. To realize the compassion and similarities in others. To try and find the "highs" in life. To meet me.    I had one, and we fell in love. Now we don't talk and really would like someone that is in the same boat as me. They should have a depression dating site.   Yes, there is more risk vaginally, but I would of course make them wear condoms, which obv is still risky (this whole situation isn't ever going to happen), but does cut down. I honestly feel BJs are more personal and I would be able to have sex with a gross guy but I probably would not be able to give a gross guy a BJ.   Doesn't matter either way, imo. I think you're safe with just the shirt.   I'm F and yeah, it's a turn on because it means he's going to eat me out which is literally the best thing in the entire WORLDDDD.   I don't even understand what your job or company is...   come on down im broke   $300 vag  sex, $600 BJ.   Well black is sleek but who cares? I like the white too.    Good for you, not just for realizing you have a problem, but for getting your wife involved and putting things on the table.    Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences.   What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes.  Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above.  And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc.  This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things.   shia labeouf, jennifer aniston, Fat Amy, Leonardo Decaprio, Florence and the Machine...   wow. Just wow.   wow.   Draw Lucille Ball on top of a pogo stick, hopping on the stomach of a 400 lb man with an afro that is simultaneously playing the violin.   Um, probably people believing in me, telling me i'm talented, "the best", interesting, funny, etc. Encouraging me to make something of my life, I like those people and their energy.    Please don't tell me I'm not depressed because I'm not acting the same way you were when depressed. Ye, I'm clinically depressed and have been since my diagnosis 1.5 years ago. I'm both bored and disinterested in my job, because I'm bored and disinterested with every component in my life. I feel no joy or interest in anything and this is certainly not y first time taking a mental health day.   this is really hot, actually.   Oxford, England.   THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.  Seriously, I was you 6 months ago. Taking opiates because it was the only thing that worked. Some people get depressed and suicidal because of the pills, I was depressed and took the pills to stop the depression. It got out of control and I had to stop. Now I'm on antidepressants that barely help. They suck. Opiates are much better but I'm constantly debating if it's worth the risk.   Kratom is legal and similar to opiates for me, in terms of motivation and interest.   Tell him and make your life YOUR life.    WOW! I've been researching ECT because meds just don't seem to be helping. What's your timeline look like as far as first med tried and last? I've gone through prozac, cymbalta, lexapro, and then wellbutrin and another one I can't remember. Getting discouraged, I hate going to my doctor and having to tell him "Nope, still want to die." I hope he doesn't give up on me or get frustrated.   Oh my god, so many feels.   I've been meaning to check that out, thanks for the reminder.   Education systems.   Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job!  At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!  I'm sure some people hate it, however, and these people are probably those that hate their job, menu, or products.   "you just need to get laid" - anyone that has never had a major problem in their life,   hands are to cold, my meds don't give me any feeling down there.

All parties need to get off before you leave   Honestly, if you like her is suggest waiting until dating. Things might get funny with sex, it happened to me.  Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.  I despise guys that leave after they cum after 2 minutes. Nothing more disrespectful.

Just a guess    Hopefully he stays away from hip-hop but it doesn't look like thats gonna happen. I don't know if he thinks this kind of behaviour is acceptable but generally petulant childish behaviour is not tolerated from a white guy. he don't stand a chance    after i finish a season i usually take a few days off but i go through spells like you where i won't play for ages    Not that perceptive, it's a very good point but hardly difficult to spot   you're wrong about spike lee 'Do the right thing' '25th hour' are brilliant films.    iron your shirt   Fuck me   instructions all day   i've put on a few pounds over the past year. i can't wear t-shirts anymore otherwise i look like a dad taking his son to the game   rap 'Straight Outta Compton' by N.W.A    its weird haha they havnt come close to winning anything in near on 20 years now   currently the one at the moment I'm in 2032 with arsenal, my best save so far i'm an arsenal fan so its been fun. highlights of the save Brendan Rogers  has been England manager since 2014 winning a world cup and bringing England to 3rd in the rankings, Frank Lampard is a very successful manager and liverpool got relegated in 2016 and have been in lower-midtable ever since   gayest band ever   haha fair enough !   my god reddit if full of moronic cunts   clearly a ton of tough guys on here.   people usually sigh and say thats terrible. or they love it either way you get a good reaction !    haha i do love a good dad joke    or always a good one.    excuse me ? who the fuck do you think you're talking to   what prize did the inventor of the knock-knock joke get.. the No-Bell prize !!!!! always gets a reaction    Wow thats amazing thanks for the long post. it was a great read    jesus !

I'm scared of the future okay i still feel like i kid and i love that about myself i feel hopelessly alone like nobody seems to understand this might sound cliche but fuck it. I'm scared and alone everything about this scares me and in this society you're not a man if you talk about your feelings. i wear my heart on my sleeve yeah i cry i'm emotional but fuck it maybe i should bottle it.   Thanks for reading this. even more thanks if it made sense.    why do you pretend you are forced into making pop music ? bring out a mixtape if you're that desperate to make something else.   'well when i fingered her she shit down my arm'    i ended up waiting an hour, saying 'Thank you very much' when i finally got my food i ate my 'all day breakfast' in shame    for me the scene in the car going to Warwick is my favourite. such pandemonium in the car its hysterical        op you lying faggot    the blueprint 1- jay-z or licensed to ill- the beastie boys    its nice just to be around nice people. tbh   fuck fmscout dont spam us anymore   PREACH !    I'm disappointed in being critizied by others about a post not the best acheivement but thought this community would appreciate it since its one of the best communities. didn't realize this was /r/soccer turns out to post anything it has to be a league 2 success story    just thought this sub would like to know I'm not trying to brag, seen things get posted on here for a lot less so maybe if you don't have anything nice to say shut your fucking mouth. cunt   thanks mate   lonely      	75
 Your reply was pointless....   Is it that strange to want to talk about a future? Plenty of people so nowadays...   OH is other half...but thanks anyway    Make myself less depressed, and a lot more happy.    Yes, I like to know everything before I get myself into a deep, serious relationship. I'm not too bothered about announcing it to people, but I'd like myself and my partner to know where we are heading and if it is the right direction.    We've been together for longer than 3 months :) I understand how that may be annoying!   Other half...sorry will make it clearer  	7
 Chemistry. I love chemistry to no end and our teacher's a lot of fun. Or band, I like band too because it's band.   [This](http://imgur.com/Wpt1g9J) always could make me crack up for some reason.   41   Or Maybe O is just a Q without a tail  End alphabetism now   Holy cow I love this picture. When I first glanced at the title, I thought it said "Detroit smuggles harder" and I rolled my eyes but then clicked on the picture and reread the title and I have one of my new favorite posts, I love this a lot   THIS IS THE FIRST THING ON THIS SUB TO MAKE ME VERBALLY SAY "AWW" IN A LONG TIME OH MY GOD I CAN'T HANDLE THIS   I LOVE this kind of pixel art. I wish more game developers that tried to do pixel art didn't do a horrible job at it.   Orange juice, I'd rather not feel like I'm drinking piss with a bunch of sugar in it   It's like, the love/hate relationship you have with your best friend. You jokingly tell them they're horrible and you hate them but you actually love them a lot.   Because we hate the same things and we can act like lesbians together. Also she's gross and horrible and I hate her but she's my best friend and I love her so much   "Sorry I love my family" oh my god   I was actually discussing with my friend whether or not that happened yet. I guess my question is answered. Oh jeez.   Not only do I hate the taste, I hate the feeling of being intoxicated. I was with 2 friends last summer and we decided to get drunk (it was my first time drinking, not theirs) and I HATED being drunk. I could just feel things spill out of my mouth and I cried and lost control of myself and it's one of the worst things I've ever felt. So, yeah. Never again.   July 3rd. Overshadowed by fireworks and hot dogs every year. Sigh.   Landlocked Blues - Bright Eyes   It's been ENDLESS Brand New and Bright Eyes and Bob Dylan lately.   "Goodnight. You have scary friends, for the record"   Mm, just stay up all day then you'll be able to sleep at like, 8 :D   Poison Oak by Bright Eyes. The entire song. Every single chord and lyric in that song can make me weep. Easily one of my top 5 favorites of all time.   My state championship robotics competition next weekend :) also I'm on spring break now so no school next week and sleeping until 2 pm   I'm sure it's pretty common. I've definitely done it a couple times. I know it's kind of a not super great thing to do, but we want you to realize you did something that upset us and we don't want to have to spell it out for you. It's kind of childish and unnecessary but I think most girls do it.    Oh yeah, I'm definitely working on it. A few weeks ago I was talking to my ex who I'm still on kinda good terms with, we were sort of talking about getting back together for a while. Then he was obviously upset at something and it was coming off as him being mad at me and I was trying so hard to pry it out of him and it ended up in a HUGE argument. So learned my lesson a bit there.   Yeah, honestly I need to get better at that. I ask people not to do that to me, but in a relationship if I can tell something is wrong it is so hard for me not to pry. I get worried it's about me, and I just don't like seeing my SO upset. So I will bug them and bug them and it actually drives a wedge in between friendships and stuff. I don't do it in a malicious or mean way, I'm just genuinely concerned and don't want my SO to be upset, but I just come on a little bit strong.   That's actually kind of condescending and would probably just make me more upset if I didn't want to talk.   The Promise - Reel Big Fish. One of my favorite covers of anything ever. It's right up with Iron and Wine's cover of Such Great Heights.   The beginning of that actually sounds so condescending tbb   I think I found one of my new favorite pictures.   Best of You - Foo Fighters   I know it's not something people can just "get over" because it's an actual personality trait. But I am really introverted and I feel like it holds me back a lot. Like, I'm in robotics and marching band and sometimes I feel so alone and like I'm an outcast, then I realize it's my own fault. I'm terrified to talk to people, and when I do it's incredibly awkward. I have friends that I can be myself around, but lately I've been pushing them all away. I never feel like hanging out or texting them. I just want to sit in my room alone and listen to music or read all the time, and I know that's not how I should be spending my time. I should be out having fun with my friends, but I just don't feel like it. I know I'll never be perfect at socializing and having friends, but I really need ways to stop the antisocial and extremely introverted tendencies I have. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so done with being alone all the time because I don't know how to socialize.   I'm a girl and about 5'5" and it's a pretty good height I think   annamarie225  I'm from michigan and i like dogs and self loathing and sleeping and robots and music.       Mostly B's. I lose so much motivation this time of year, and I usually hold myself to a really high standard and am usually a straight-A student. So I'm pretty down about that.   Oh I can't dance at ALL, but it was kind of fun when I was tripping over his feet and we laughed. Idk, that was one of my favorite parts tbh. P.S. It's okay I broke up with him   Brand New, Bon Iver, The Tallest Man on Earth, Neutral Milk Hotel, Bright Eyes, Bob Dylan, Panic at the Disco, Shigeto, Jason Mraz, and Paramore. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting, but that's a lot of them.   It depends on what she's into, but my (now ex) boyfriend wanted to take me to homecoming really badly this year but I was really opposed to it, as I hate big dances and large gatherings of hormone-filled teenagers in the same room. So we just agreed that we would go out for a nice dinner then go back to his house. He knew I always liked just cuddling on the couch watching a movie better than going out somewhere. Then when he drove me home from dinner he went in the house first and told me to wait a second and that he would text me when I could come in, because he had a surprise. Then when I came in there was this song playing that we always listened to together and he was wearing a nice suit and he just grabbed me and started dancing with me. It was super nice and made me feel like I wasn't missing out. If your girlfriend is into cheesy romantic stuff like that then she might like being surprised with her own little "mini-prom" from you. Really though, it takes the right kind of person to enjoy it.   I know this is said all the time, but I hate how when women sleep with lots of people, she's a slut. But when men sleep with lots of people, he's considered cool and his male peers think more highly of them a lot of the time.   Miley Cyrus, not gonna lie.   Ohh yeah, it was pretty bad. Me and a few other people on the team said it was because the wrong team was losing. But ah well, we ended up winning anyway, even though that was a pretty infuriating rematch, lol. By the way, we love 573 :3 3   That happened to us at Southfield! It's the worst feeling.   I can't even imagine that frustration, omg.   Did you end up replaying the match?   I wish I had a video of the lights coming loose. At the end of the day, the red alliance ended up winning, but at this point in finals we had one loss against a powerhouse alliance, and were pretty excited to have almost won, and I think the fact that we replayed it when there were 6 seconds left was a little bit unnecessary.    At the Waterford competition, during the second final match, [part of the LED strip came off of the high goal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danielernst/13521802593/in/set-72157643084658745/) when the red alliance was ahead by a good 40 points, with **6 seconds** left on the clock. Understandably, they had to restart the match. Needless to say, we were all pretty mad. Has this happened anywhere else?   That actually looks a LOT like my ex boyfriend and I think it might be him...   I'm more of an algebra kinda gal   Sitting in geometry. Just took a test. Woo.   Jk I'm done being a freak now. What's up?   i am me. or am i you? who knows. maybe you aren't supposed to know. shhh.   ay what is u   That pretty much just made my day.   I didn't, I didn't watch the Grammys    Not gonna lie, I used to be on the bandwagon that she sucked, but I love her now to no end.   Really? That's one of my favorites on the album   annamarie225, 15/f  Books, marching band, movies, robotics, science, music   Oh he was terrified. It was fantastic.   And this all happened when he was in 8th grade and I was in 9th grade so he was telling all his friends that he was about to date a high schooler and thought he was hot shit oh my God.   My favorite is when my friend and I were sending each other creepy lyrics and I meant to send him "I SEE GOD IN BIRDS AND SATAN IN LONG WORDS" but I accidentally sent it to someone else with no context.   The one time they come to my state, it's $300.   This guy was also talking to me one time and he's like "I have a... you know what" and I legitimately didn't know, so he's like "Hold on" and printed out "BONER" on a sticker from his label maker.   There's this kid on my robotics team got the nickname Harry Pooter last year. That's not a typo. I don't know how he got it, but I don't like him so it doesn't matter.   I am. Trombone in jazz and euph in concert and marching :3   Well personally I'm against it. I had an ex who ended up in a coma and kept waking up for a few minutes at a time (it was bizarre, he was dead about 5 times). And every time he woke up, he said he wanted to die. He woke up for good, and he has some issues now but he's almost back to normal. When he was telling me about it, he said that if assisted suicide was an option, he would have jumped on it in a second just because he was in pain and was upset just at the time. He still has depression and isn't in the best state, but he isn't suicidal anymore. He said he's so glad that he didn't end up dying. Miracles like that happen.   Oh God is Funnyjunk still a thing? I thought it was a lot of fun when I was like 13 omfg   I was on Skype with this kid that liked me, and he was showing me this label maker he got and I'm like "Oh cool" and acted like I cared because he was really excited over this label maker. Then he called me back on Skype the next day and fucking everything in his room is covered in stickers of my name. Like, he must have printed out at least 250 stickers of my name.   Wounded Healer by Watsky   Try Watsky. My favorite from him is Wounded Healer. Too lazy to get a link   Well I was going to major in chemistry and minor in some kind of business or management. But chemistry is what I'm passionate about and my first business choice research or teaching. It's not like it's the only thing I'd learn. But I know what you mean, chemical engineering probably would be a better option. It's something I'll have to consider.   I'm currently a sophomore in high school, but if I play my cards right, I'll be able to graduate as a junior. I realized how much I needed to begin looking at colleges. I want to be a chemist for sure, so my mom told me that MTU is a good school for students studying the sciences, but I had it in my head that it was based mainly on engineering. MTU has been one of my top choices since I started researching colleges more, but my question is how much they focus on the sciences, mainly chemistry. Thank you!   Thank, I sure hope so! Lol   I'm a sophomore and just got my first college email. It was from Marquette university. It finally hot me I need to start actually thinking abut my future ;-;  	71
 You're implying that the President is directly responsible for the treatment (not just the policies regarding treatment) of certain minorities by different agencies in the government. "Treatment" is a very personal problem as well: even if we lay rules down, will it guarantee that everyone will be treated the same in all instances of personal interactions within these agencies? In my opinion the two issues you mentioned are completely unrelated.   Today I listened to MD rapper Logic's new-ish mixtape: [Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever](http://www.datpiff.com/Logic-Young-Sinatra-Welcome-To-Forever-mixtape.483644.html). If you don't have time to download, check out the song [Nasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVbTkFsCc24) (YouTube link) from his mixtape. Very lyrical with a sick beat.      My opinion:   Overall the mixtape has some solid lyricism and production. There are two skits which I found pretty hilarious. One involves his dad coming into the room while he's recording, and the following exchange is pretty hilarious. He recently signed to Def Jam and is planning to release an LP soon I believe. Worth checking out.   150 pounds or kilos? Also the less fat you have on your body, the better shape you'll be in to pass. You can buy self-test kits from a CVS if you live near one. If you take it in the morning, make sure you wake up early, piss, and drink lots of water to dilute your piss for the test. There is a certain vitamin you can take to help cleanse but I forgot which one; it's definitely worth a google. Good luck man.   Hello ents,  I come to you today with a problem. The weed I have right now is a very potent unnamed indica strain. I smoke out of a triple-percolated chandelier bong. The problem is, after taking only two hits (around 0.5g) of this stuff, I get a very strong body high and begin to feel drowsy.  Do any of you have any advice on how to stay awake after getting a strong body high? Should I change my method of smoking? I also have a bowl and papers if that helps, but I prefer the bong since it's smoother.  Any advice is welcome.   The title is very misleading. Causation cannot be established between the reclassification of a substance and increased rates of psychosis. This is because the latter implies usage, and usage implies possession. Possession is achieved through illegal means anyway, therefore the legal reclassification of a substance bears no correlation to increased rates of psychosis.   Cockroaches, as long as they aren't where you live. There is nothing inherently "gross" about these bugs, but having them in your home is obviously undesirable. I once asked a friend why he thought cockroaches were gross and he replied, "They can like, survive a nuclear holocaust dude." I wasn't sure how to respond.   I wish I had a table of all the techniques of differentiation,  integration, and construction of power series stored in my head so I could readily apply the most effective techniques when attempting to solve problems in applied math when calculus is involved.   Hadn't watched a truly "sad" movie until one fateful summer night... I decided to get relatively high and watch The Notebook by myself. By the end I was bawling my eyes out. It was a very powerful emotional experience and I would recommend it to anyone with a decent understanding of interpersonal relationships.   Great read, it really sheds some light on how hard it is to parse C. Edge cases are awesome   Superbad. The characters are so believable and it's so over the top you can't stop laughing.   That's pretty unfortunate. I can see why you were apprehensive when shaking someone's hand. Still not sure why my comment got downvoted though, I feel like it's a relatively civil approach to the problem.   Strong AI   If I'm at work or in a formal setting, ignore it. If it's a casual or random encounter, I ask them directly why they don't feel comfortable shaking my hand. The ball is in their court at this point.   Says Linus is using intimidation and violence. Uses an expletive and threats of "not being a nice girl anymore".  This is very unprofessional and her concerns have been greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately, immature people who can't understand mature humor are everywhere. Dealing with it is the hard part; just recognize stupid when you see it, don't antagonize, and move on.   this is a gif right dude [8[   Dat misleading title. Quote from the article: "Wyden said he imagines the White House is willing to reconsider the current surveillance policies in place"... This is nothing more than speculation. Move along.

It helps keep my mind off things, I hope it can help you too.   You're right. I think media outlets should have stressed the importance of providing troubled teenagers with the right kind of help instead of focusing on the age-old gun violence debate. It is a little known fact that even mentally stable people can benefit from therapy or counseling. I think the problem now is a combination of growing up in the information age as well as having to deal with stresses like school and work. Parents should be educated and made aware of certain signs that indicate their child is having a hard time. This should assist them in finding their teenager the right kind of help.      When it comes to giving actual advice to parents with teenagers though, it seems like a tremendously difficult undertaking; I wouldn't even know where to begin.   "the terrorists"      You use those words as if you're implying these people are acting as a group, which couldn't be further from reality. There are domestic as well as foreign terrorists, whose motivations range from hatred of the U.S. and its citizens to crazy, irrational reasons. I think the threat of terrorism has been overemphasized as well as blown out of proportion by the U.S. media.      "Their job", I would say, is dependent on the individual terrorist's motivation. Therefore, determining "whether they have done their job" wouldn't be proving anything.   edit: grammur   My personal suggestions: ArsTechnica and New York Times.      Already mentioned: NPR, BBC, Al Jazeera, Guardian, The Independent   In general, "are we better off than we would be if..."-type questions rarely seem to elicit responses that are based on more than mere conjecture. I suggest avoiding those types of questions when possible, and instead asking a more relevant, focused question such as, "What would be the implications of restricting the NSA's access to our personal information, and what role would this play in the NSA's ongoing mission of protecting America?"   Yeah most parents are idiots   The overall effectiveness of preventing unwanted surveillance using encryption is entirely dependent on the implementation of the software utilizing a myriad of cryptographic methods to secure any sensitive data involved.  eli5: If software you are using encrypts or exchanges data incorrectly, your data could be seen by other people.   Computer programming. Unfortunately, in the industry, managers will often throw more software engineers at a project instead of giving the existing team more time. But to be fair, managers are not always in charge of deadlines, and management style differs drastically depending on the person as well as the company. So yeah, try to code slowly folks. Doing so will help decrease the total number of bugs in the software and ensure proper functionality for release.  edit: grammar  	28
 I headcanon that as First Enchanter he's always been able to perform blood magic but never done so publicly because of the (justifiable) stigma around it. By enabling Quentin he had an outlet for these practices until he hit that point at the end of the game where he saw no way out. Not defending him though because it was really messed up, and further justifies everyone's concerns about mages.   Are you talking about the POP figures? Because looking at your link those are Fallout 3 figurines.   Am I missing something?   This manager is still in charge of our TripAdvisor page, every reply is littered with errors like this. IMHO it makes us look really unprofessional but the higher ups don't care so she's left to it.   Your/You're   One of the managers at my work was tasked with our advertising for Mother's Day (UK) and displayed signs all around the pub about "treating you're mum to a Mother's Day meal." I cringed so hard the two weeks they were up. I have a problem with this sort of thing.   Omg yes! I'm currently at uni and have just started bringing my laptop in to take notes as it is too awkward to write anything by hand.   Not had slap on the ass but something similar. I work as a waitress/barmaid and this particular night was on the bar. The pub was quite quiet at this point so I was chatting to some punters. Bear in mind I'm 25 and these guys were easily in their late 40's.   So one of the guys asks to buy me a drink, I said no as I was working but if I saw him in the pub when I was off I'd remind him. I then promised "hand on heart" that this would happen, while placing my hand over my chest. He took this as an opportunity to lean over the bar and make a grab for my chest "just to check (I) even had a heart." I leapt back and laughed it off, told him he'd just have to take my word for it and went back to work. I told my manager later what had happened and he told me to let him know if anything like that happens again.  	6
 I'm sure I've hid behind my intelligence in the past, but don't think I'd go so far as to say I use arrogance as a coping mechanism. I always figured I was probably pretty bright, but in the past 3 years I've had both psychologists and professors (several of each) tell me that I fit the bill of someone with a gifted level of intelligence. I can make small talk but I'd prefer to have a discussion. I don't assume that others are stupid or boring and am usually up for talking to just about anybody. That being said, I don't think its a stretch to think that a lot of people's interactions are pretty superficial.  I can also say that I really don't think most of the things you mentioned bother me, I'm comfortable in a crowd (I never have to withdraw or become overwhelmed) don't have any problems with loud noises or bright lights, Sometimes interruptions and disappointment can irritate me, but that's rarely and usually when I'm tired, hungry, or something else is impairing my judgement.   Hi /r/aspergers lately I've been going through a bout of depression and have been seeing a therapist. A few weeks ago I mentioned that I think I might have aspergers and he agreed that I do have "some" traits. The thing is there are a lot of things that seem so fundamental to the diagnosis that I don't seem to have. For example, I've never been over stimulated by sound, crowds, bright light, I have above average emotional recognition ( had this tested), I don't have any particular order of doing things and am very flexible as far as my daily routine is concerned, I'm not usually clumsy and apart from when I was growing never had any trouble, I don't speak in a monotone ( though I do sometimes raise my voice when excited), and I've been told that I have a very expressive face, people can read how I'm feeling easily.  At the same time, I've always had problems with social interaction. Extended eye contact feels intense and uncomfortable, I've always had a large vocabulary and constantly have to "dumb it down" for small talk, if I don't I sound pretentious. Sometimes a conversation will catch me off guard and I'll stumble over my thoughts (probably the worst part.) I also feel much more comfortable talking about weighty topics like literature, art, music, philosophy, history, politics, and science then I do talking about people and what I did on the weekend. I have an awful knack for steering conversations in the direction of these topics and can sometimes be pretty argumentative. I haven't had myself tested but my therapist and psychiatrist both agree that I probably have an IQ considerably above average. When I was younger I had a very hard time getting along with other kids because I didn't want to talk about sports and games I wanted to talk about big concept stuff. In addition I sometimes smile when people are crying around me, I'm good at comforting people but I have an instant smile response that I've never understood.  I think the thing that is probably most in line with the aspergers diagnosis is my obsessive compulsive tendencies. I'll get obsessed for a period of time about some concept or another and be stuck on it. These obsessions can cause me a lot of pain and when they were really bad would take over my life. Mostly they involve obsessing over philosophy and the meaning of my life. I have a few other past obsessions as well, for example I know a lot about Star Wars and its extended universe from when I was a kid/ teenager, probably more then anyone else I know. I'm not so interested in it now but I was when I was younger. When I was younger I had a huge interest in history and could describe a rough timeline of colonial north america, the world wars, and the rise and fall of the soviet union by the time I was 12. When I'm drunk or really tired I sometimes make irrelevant, or comments which the people around me might not understand referring to the knowledge I have about world affairs, philosophy, art, literature, etc.  I have had episodes of frustration and anxiety in the past, but this could have just as easily been a symptom of depression as aspergers. These episodes of frustration haven't gone a way particularly but often were the result of disappointment or (when I was younger) social rejection.   Anyway if you've read this far, let me know what you think.   Yeah I know, overall it was probably a positive that they know how I'm doing now and that there are other people in their lives dealing with the same problems. That being said, I feel like I need to learn to hold back a little bit, I don't like getting into the habit of having these sorts of conversations because they tend to get put off most people. I find I'm only really like this with people like my parents and my close friends but I've had people distance themselves from me after these kind of conversations in the past.   I used to open up to people who I probably shouldn't have but have since gotten a lot better. I think I still have trouble letting conversations sort of get away from me, where I'm talking about subjects that might not be appropriate in a given situation. I'm especially cautious of the relationship between me and my close friends just becoming a commiseration group, or that I'll say too much and not realize it.   Recently I spent a week living with some close friends and am having a lot of trouble with how I acted while with them. It wasn't very long into the visit that me and my two close friends started talking about the very personal stuff that's happening in our lives. I'm suffering from depression, and during a conversation that my friend brought up I told them that I'd been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. They then told me that they were dealing with similar issues and were seeking help. The thing is, that this was more or less our conversation topic for the remainder of the week while I was there. I feel like I was a little too open with my friends and that I may have said too much. I mean we had a full blown conversation about suicide while out at a bar (while pretty drunk) and I don't know what to feel about that.   I feel like every time I'm out with people I end up being too jokey, or too loud, or too eager to keep the conversation going. I don't know how this happens, but it always seems as though I'm joking around or participating more actively in conversation than those around me, silence amongst a big group just freaks me out a little so I feel like I almost need a to keep a running commentary going (not quite but sort of). How do I change my conversation style so that it encourages others to keep conversations going or joke around. How do I check myself when I'm running the conversation a bit too much?   Yes exactly, "Oh why did you tell your friends what happened?" maybe because you did the worst thing you could possibly have done to me and you deserve to be chastised by people who used to care about you. If you cheat on somebody you're a traitor and that's the worst there is regardless of gender.   Honestly, fresh wounds burn deep. Of course you aren't over the breakup if it happened the other day or the other week or what have you; a few years and then yeah you're dealing with some issues, but being bitter in the short term after a breakup is obvious.   I'll put on my nerd cap for a moment and user a tolkien analogy. After frodo spent so much time with the ring and after being stabbed by an evil blade he recovered but every year he'd become I'll and melancholy afterward. Some things never heal all the way.   I feel that for those if us who get better from depression the wound heals but there'll always be a scar. We'll always remember what it was like to be depressed, so it never totally leaves us.  Just my take   She's the only complaint I've had.   yeah, at least I can be confident about that (she isn't the only one who's told me this)  edit: I've had others make a comment about size, not complaints.    Let me count the list of things my ex said to me in a single breakup conversation.  - I only stayed with you because I was afraid of being alone.  - There's someone else, I cheated on you.  - I don't think I've ever been attracted to you.  - My parents think you're lazy and don't think you're good enough (translate: I think you're lazy and aren't good enough)   - Sex with you always hurt, sex with other guy doesn't  - I don't know why you're so beaten up, I'm not going to lose any sleep over this.  - You were my best friend   Great things to hear from the closest person in your life especially when dealing with depression.    Oh, this one I know.   In my personal experience, I had huge level of existential anxiety before my current depression. I'd say that I went through an "existential crisis" that was on and off for about half a year, the depression really started when I began applying it to my life.   All that being said, I'm sure that it can happen the other way too.    For the past few weeks I've been feeling better about myself, I was starting to feel I might actually have some worth or someway out of feeling horrible. Then this week was my ex girlfriend's birthday. She left me for a tall, handsome, talented, socially comptant engineer. All I've been thinking about is how unappealing I am, every horrible thing that I can think of about me. I'm short, scrawny, have acne, am socially awkward, insecure, argumentative, anxious, needy and boring. I basically have every unattractive characteristic there is.         I screwed up everything to the point where she was the only thing making me happy anymore. Things were looking good at the beginning of last year, then I went and messed everything up. We were even planning to move in together sometime this year, now I'm more alone then I've ever been.  I though I was feeling better, I thought i was moving past this and putting that relationship to rest. That's obviously not the case.   I have an awful time carrying on conversations via text messaging. If I'm not planning on meeting up with someone the whole conversation usually just goes absolutely nowhere. I find it limiting and almost impossible to have a decent conversation over any kind of instant messaging. Its seems to me that other INFJs might have similar difficulties and am curious what you have to say.   My depression fluctuates between insomnia and fatigue. At the moment I'm experiencing quite a bit of fatigue, sometimes I don't even notice how exhausted I am, but I can fall asleep at almost anytime and anywhere, it's not really helpful while in school.   I haven't written a poem or piece of prose in weeks, I keep meaning to perform at my local poetry nights, but I just don't have anything coming to me. Not to mention I haven't touched my sketch books in almost  a month. So yes It makes me feel creatively suffocated.    I think I'd have liked to have been born in the late 19th century/ early 20tu and have been living my prime in the 1920's.    Sorry didn't mean to imply that this doesn't happen for women also, just from what I've read that behaviour appears more often in men.   I like it for the first few drinks, but after 3 or 4 drinks I'm all filters off and usually get a little ranty; not about anything in particular but I do sort of go off on tangents. In the morning I usually feel a little embarrassed about some of the stuff I talked about, I don't like letting those filters down.   Everything I've read on the subject has said this. It's not every male. if you'd like to show me otherwise please do.   Yeah I think it's one of the biggest things that should be discussed in the depression community. I walked around j for months absolutely frustrated and resentful, then had a month or two with a very bad temper.  It's definitely a bit of a different beast and I think it would help a lot of guys dealing with depression to know that male depression can differ from female depression pretty drastically. Males are far more likely to become consumed in work/school and try to distract themselves by running themselves ragged. Males are also much more likely to channel their depression into anger than necessarily despair.   Have to say I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions of depression. Depression, as depicted in the media is much more similar to the symptoms of female depression, male depression can be quite a bit different.   Every time someone writes a comment like this I feel that it's more about the commenter than the O.P.. Don't get me wrong, I see where you are coming from, but the way you worded your response seems very personal..   I've been trying to surround myself with down to earth, well grounded people. I've been trying my best not to distract myself all the time, but escapism does offer itself easily as a way to distract me from anxiety/depression. I will out right admit that these thoughts consume me the most when I'm alone, especially when I don't have a lot of people around (I.E. friends go home from college.) My mind just tends to wander in this direction every time.  I have to disagree that the answer is simply "doing things" when nearly everyone around me is steeped in things that make my perceptions painfully evident. I've considered the possibility that I may have arbitrarily skewed the framework of my perception to fit anxieties that I'm having, but most evidence would suggest otherwise.  I interact with very few people on the internet so I think your comments on meeting people here are a little misplaced. Though, I have been working on meeting new people who do not share my hangups and it seems to be helping my situation to a degree.  Thanks for the reply.   I feel like "drinking the kool aid" is what it's going to have to come down to , either that or become a complete pariah. I just find that this conclusion doesn't completely satisfy me and its depressing that the way I perceive things will only cause me pain.        What you described, the whole investigation into semiotics and postmodernism, is almost exactly what I was getting at. To sort of paraphrase Nietzsche I feel like I'm wrestling with monsters. I don't fault people around me for not choosing to do the same. In fact I feel that this problem is the root of my depression, even though it is probably one of those questions that does not have an answer.   I've been having severe anxiety about my life for the past 2 years. Basically along the lines of how I conduct myself, how I spend my time, wether I'm living a life that is worthwhile and productive. Sometimes in the last 2 years it's been to the point that I wasn't going outside much and spent a lot of time reading.  My biggest issue was that I was having a great deal of anxiety regarding the media and how it affects people. After reading books like 1984, and to a greater extent Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, I became really fixated on how the media I consume affects my mind. I know this sounds paranoid, believe me many times I've felt I was losing my mind with how anxious I was, but many, many very well respected and intelligent people have written about exactly what I'm talking about. People have written whole books in fact  ex: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death]  I now get very anxious about what I read, watch, listen to, and generally participate in. I've become very aware of which popular news papers are directed at which audience and its not a very difficult thing to do. Writing style, content, advertisements are all indicative of the sort of people that the publication is being directed to.  In general I feel like I'm being shoehorned into a specific consumption and that my life is full of distraction. I feel as though me and everyone around me are being distracted which prevents us from reaching our full potential.   I've tried so many times to get out of this thought loop but I fail every time. I can't stop feeling anxious about it, I'm so afraid that I've wasted my life and that I'll never reach my potential because I'll always be driven to distract myself. The worst part is that every person speak to about this, college professors, my therapist, all agree that my observations have a great deal of truth to them, so I can't be completely deluded.  I wish I could stop thinking about it but I can't, I wish I could go back to not thinking about what I consume and just live a life of ignorance. I don't know, does this sound as off the wall to you as it sometimes does to me? Is my anxiety founded or am I walking a thin line of falling into an even darker arena than anxiety? I don't know I just can't seem to escape these thoughts, they're so fundamental to my life and how I'm going to live.   Laying in my old car with my ex, in the middle of winter at night. We'd driven to an camp ground that was empty for the winter and were parked next to a lake surrounded by trees. We were just looking at the stars. I've never seen stars like that before.      despairing, angry, overly emotional. I was feeling fairly numb and I'd do anything to feel something so I acted fairly extreme, if I felt anger I just sort of went with it. The rest of the time I was just ice cold cynical and negative, about everything. I had some pretty serious anxiety and angst going on as well.   Since I've been on the medication I've felt like I have more of a floor to stand on and that there's less chance the bottom will fall out of my life. I feel a little hesitant to say this but it might be that I have a little bit more hope these days.  	30
 I honestly don't know how to pick a name for what I'm feeling.  I'm certain I'm straight gray-a (I feel pretty much no sexual attraction, but I can feel romantically attracted), either that or my libido is just perfectly shot.  But I feel fine with the thought of never having sex-- or do I?    This is going to sound perfectly ordinary, but I only get off to gay porn or fanfic.  The part that I ponder over is why I feel like I would be better off as a gay dude.  I'm not transexual-- at least I don't think I am.  Aren't they usually pretty sure about it?  I never minded being a girl.    One thing of note is I find pregnancy personally abhorrent; the thought of *myself* being pregnant literally fills me with disgust.  I think it might be considered a phobia of sorts.  I don't think it is the cause of my asexuality, but it might be a contributor.  Even before all of that realization though, I never had an interest in dating while I was still in junior high/high school.  I couldn't understand why girls oogled at guys, I thought, 'sure that guy looks attractive, but why are you losing your shit over it?'  I literally gave no fucks.  It was only later after my second boyfriend, I realized I cannot feel sexual attraction (if I have, it was very temporary), and that I am probably asexual due to the fact that I just get disgusted with myself when it comes to the sex part.  I messed around with non penetration stuff, but ultimately it got to the point where it felt disgusting.  And I never actually felt connected when I was involved sexually with my boyfriend, despite how I felt toward him romantically.  Like, I removed myself mentally from the situation pretty much while it was happening.  Then I started thinking, and I just realized: you know, I'm pretty, but I've never really felt comfortable in my own skin, and not by an 'I'm ugly' standpoint, but mentally.  I just... don't feel like I belong in my body.  It's not overwhelming or persistent, I don't even feel like I would be strictly *male*, just... that I don't feel like either gender?  Male is the best fit maybe, but I don't mind being female.  It's just, there's this quiet and unnerving sort of feeling that something is wrong.  It's been there even since I was a little kid.  I don't mind being asexual and never having sex, but the part I do mind is likely being alone forever because of that.    I dunno, am I weird?  Sorry for this unstructured rambling.  Feel free to ask questions if anything has confused you.  I wouldn't think any of you are weird ever, it's just that experiencing this for myself is so very confusing and stressful and sad at the worst of times...

 The inverse of this (for nice little old ladies who are exceptionally polite and friendly): when they ask for the senior discount and present their senior's card, I take the card and squint at it and bring it close to my eyes and then look between the card and the old lady and say "I don't know.... you don't look like a senior to me." with a wink to go with it. Always gets a chuckle from them.    I think the comment was deleted because it revealed personal information about the guy. You can still see the comment on his userpage (http://www.reddit.com/user/connor-lj)   You can manually flash the update without having to root.    Its not really about the physical issues that arise, its a matter of principle. Nothing quite says "I think you're white trash and you don't have the right to touch me." than people deliberately avoiding your hand to place the money on the counter. You have obviously never worked in sales/hospitality because you would understand it if you had.   You'd be surprised at the amount of customers that will actually go around the hand you're holding out just to put it on the counter. If I'm in a particularly foul mood I'll hold the change/receipt out as if I'm going to put it in their hand, wait a moment, and then place it on the counter.   Its been explained time and time again, but people like you keep using the wrong argument. Skins exist not because manufacturers don't like the look of stock android and think they can do better. They exist to create brand loyalty. Blur only exists on Motorola devices, and if someone's mom only feels comfortable with blur and everything else looks different and confusing, what do you think her next phone is going to be?   How about just an update to Drive itself. Where is my automatic camera upload?! Literally the only thing holding me back from switching from Dropbox.   uhh, I think that's the point?   Being introverted and having no friends aren't the same thing.    Isn't this an android issue, not cm?   Perhaps when someone wants to try or install a Linux distro? Just a guess. ;)   Holy shit, this was TWO YEARS AGO?!   CM comes with this ootb, fyi. :)   So what's wrong with just installing the latest nightly and updating when you feel like it?   Why are you being down voted? This is accurate.    Why not install onto a virtual machine directly from an iso file?   ...except none of the money goes to the content creators, which is the point here.    Wtf? Did anyone else get redirected like five times?   Or solid explorer.    Have you tried this using the Beta? Once the site is fully loaded its pretty damn smooth.    I'd suggest the following alternatives that I feel are better: [Reddit News Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImZyZWUucmVkZGl0Lm5ld3MiXQ..) instead of RiF for reddit browsing and [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5lc3Ryb25ncy5hbmRyb2lkLnBvcCJd) for a file manager. It is also free and has more features than the one suggested above.  Onavo Count is useless since 4.x+ comes with a built-in data monitor (Settings  Data Usage)   Community channel.   Where does it say what movie this is from?   If you read the comments on the post about the Bug's Life one, it turns out that the colors were selected and put in order of a rainbow purposefully - as in, it still took the colors from the frames, but not in the same row of pixels each time.   Replying for later      Gameboid      The userscript also adds a link directly to the .torrent file as well.   You can disable them in the messaging app.    This functionality is available on torrentz.eu using a user script. (Search for magnet links for torrentz.eu user script)   Facebook, for one.   I think a lot of it works with the calendar as well. So maybe if you create an event "Dinner with Michael"  it'll pop up with a card for restaurants at that time? idk   This doesn't actually kill the app like the hold-back-to-kill does, it simply politely asks it to close. If the app is coded poorly it can still run in the background, but the back button method will kill it no matter what.    Misleading title. Ubuntu for Android and Ubuntu for phones are two different things.    The group messaging used by iphones and 4.2+ android devices uses MMS to attach additional info such as other contacts included in the message.   Ie if you send a group message as a normal SMS the recipients won't be able to see the other recipients and when they reply it will only go back to the original sender, not everyone in the group. Think of it like individual SMS versus a Facebook-like group message.    You don't hate Touchwiz? You should probably ditch this subreddit.    I actually really enjoyed this movie. It seemed to close to reality and just had this raw feeling about it.    Replace the battery and if that still doesn't work, get a knife or a needle or something and push the middle sticky-outy thing in the microusb up a little bit, make sure it doesn't contact the outer edges of the port at all. I had this same issue and this resolved it. Just be careful not to snap it off.   * Do a nandroid and a titanium backup. * Download desired cm10 ROM and equivalent gapps (remember, cm10 uses a different gapps package than cm10.1) from get.cm or goo.im or wherever else and place on SD card/internal storage * Wipe caches, flash cm10, flash gapps, flash anything else you desire (kernel, init.d scripts etc), wipe caches again to be sure and fix permissions  You should boot up and it should bring up the "optimising apps" screen. If you start getting force closes or get stuck in a bootloop then perform a data wipe and restore only user applications and data from titanium.      This is an alternative. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tvshowfavs   I did the same thing for my two sisters.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukeboland/7970256258/in/photostream  You can see how one takes after my father and takes after my mother.   Looks really slick, but for some reason separates my sent and received messages from each contact into two different conversations (one with all the ones that I have ever sent to the contact and one with all the messages I have received from the same contact). It also crashes when I try to send a message. :/   Anecdotal evidence.    Have you seen Wicked? It's a musical about exactly this. Definitely worth a watch next time it comes to a theatre near you.    blemish removal, curves, black and white filter, sepia tone, crop, content-aware scale and fill.

There are no 10.1 downloads on get.cm.    Wait what? 4.2? How?   "I'm just a swinging mess of sad~anger." Suggests otherwise.    Physical...   I disagree. It goes against Apple's walled-garden philosophy and for an app like Tasker to have full functionality it would literally require a full re-write of some aspects of the OS. You will never see an app with the level of control and automation of Tasker on iOS, ever.   Tasker is a 3rd party app not implemented by Google, so I don't see why Apple would be expected to implement something similar? While you're right about alternative apps and widgets, NFC is something that Apple are highly likely to introduce in the next iPhone. They would be silly not to.   I don't get why everyone is saying this... OP is talking about a combination of NFC and Tasker, the things he has automated are done with tasker and NFC is just a way to trigger those. Even if Apple were to implement NFC, there would never be a way to imitate this behavior on iOS. So yeah, this is a perfectly valid reason to never switch back.   An honest karma whore. They are quite rare.    Its prettier. Not much else.    It usually costs $20 - 30 less if you buy it online from certain sites. That's if you're okay with the extra week wait.    That's what I'm saying, a google search would have taken less time than a comment.   Implying that anything anyone posts on Reddit is posted for purposes other than internet points.    Wide angle lens on both eyes for use? Haha.    Holy shit I have been here way too long.    Follow the guide I posted.    You have to root your phone to install cyanogenmod. Why didn't you just Google it? http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S:_Full_Update_Guide   Stock is what comes with the device as default (stock firmware). In this case its Touchwiz. For an AOSP device like a Nexus device, stock would be AOSP because that's what it comes with as stock.     AOSP != stock.   flash a stock rom. otherwise no.   Can someone explain to me why this ROM is popular? Its buggy, slow and bloated.    http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II:_Full_Update_Guide   Its called bloat ware, and is the main reason why so many of us use and advocate custom ROMs. Welcome to android.    http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III:_Full_Update_Guide   Its not about predictions, its about shortcuts. On the iPhone you can have @email be typed and automatically replaced with your user-defined email. Now amount of predication can do that.    I think its just referencing the movie "Inception", where there is "a dream within a dream". The word has also become synonymous with "mindfuck".   imo what you just said then directly opposes the original comment. he just said its bad if you smoke it daily. the fact that you say you NEED marijuana every morning is a really bad sign.   Wow, TIL, thanks.    You last checked for an update on 01/01/1970  Wut.   Perhaps it just means another M release?   Create a folder on SD card called "ringtones" and put any songs you want there. They will show up in the same list as the default ringtones.   You can share directly to Gmail from both Dropbox and Drive.    Yeah lol, userscripts/extensions for this have been around for a long time.   [Cyanogenmod](http://get.cm/?device=i777).  Stable, professional, customizable, frequent updates. It's basically stock+. Cannot go wrong.   You continued to watch it, all the way to climax?    Am I the only one that can only go down on a girl if they're shaved? I hate getting hair all up in my mouth. That's the only reason I ask my SO to do it - it doesn't bother me if I'm not going down there though.   Photoshop.    If Google pushes source to AOSP before the release of the phone then there will probably be ROMs the day of, if not before release. If not, maybe a few days after (CM will probably get there first).   http://goo.gl/ypZk0   Just the 4.2 camera/gallery apk. There's been a [flashable zip](http://forums.androidcentral.com/verizon-galaxy-nexus-rooting-roms-hacks/220830-jelly-bean-4-2-camera-20.html#post2283346) available for a few days.   I really want to use it and uninstall Reddit News but I find Reddit News' comment navigation superior. That and the lack of being able to share/copy a link to a reddit post.    Are you joking? Reddit sync lacks so many features compared to Alien blue. Its comparable to using res on the desktop and many people I know who have it on their iPad would actually prefer to use Alien Blue than their desktop browser.   Reddit sync is good, and so is Reddit news (RN is better IMHO) but neither of them even come close to Alien Blue.    fyi, [app2zip](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=scd.app2zip feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInNjZC5hcHAyemlwIl0.) provides this functionality for free. :)   /r/mildlyinteresting    This is frequently discussed in this subreddit and various other related forums. For devices that don't come stock with AOSP, the stock ROM will *always* have superior camera quality. This is simply due to the fact that the manufacturer has access to hardware binaries that indie devs do not. There is nothing you can do. If image quality is important to you, then you best switch to a stock-based ROM.   /thread   What specifically do you dislike about it? I personally think it looks beautiful.   I like your style.   You went in your pajamas?   The ROM doesn't matter so much, since nandroids backup and restore the /system partition anyway.

Why do you need to use a dedicated app?   Not really. You can see where it loops after the 7th throw.   I didn't actually read the post. The whole issue doesn't actually bother me at all, I for one love the idea of including a File Manager and I'm in love with the UI. I was just providing the opposing opinion for the sake of discussion - and to say that bloat doesn't always mean a large filesize (although the two often go hand in hand).   Bloat doesn't necessarily mean size, although I get where you're going with that. It more about whether or not its necessary. CM has functioned fine without a file explorer for all this time and nobody has complained or asked for one (that I've heard of anyway). I personally don't mind but its about the philosophy that cm has had up until now - people put cm on their phones to *remove* bloat and only have the absolute bare necessities on a fresh install, with the ability to install what they need/want afterwards. Including a file manager in cm assumes that *every single person that uses cm* will want and use it. Its not a safe assumption to make.  Plus, when do you draw the line? Would having a lightweight PDF viewer be considered bloat? How about a full-fledged eBook reader and manager? By adding a file manager to the default install, cm have changed their stance about bloatware from very clear to blurry and uncertain. Its not about the file manager, or the size of the apk. Its confusing their philosophy.    Unzip the flash able zips with an archive manager. The apks will be inside.    Its an unreleased version that's been hacked to work on a version of android it wasn't intended to. There are going to be bugs.   I doubt its a problem with the actual alarm app and more with the fact that we're flashing a system app from an unreleased version of Android on a version of Android it wasn't made to run on.... The app will be fine on 4.2 release.    Direct quote from the link in your own comment: Android 4.1, Jelly Bean, is the fastest and smoothest version of Android yet. Jelly Bean improves on the simplicity and beauty of Android 4.0, and introduces a new Google search experience on Android.  Everything in Jelly Bean feels fast, fluid, and smooth. Moving between home screens and switching between apps is effortless, like turning pages in a book. Jelly Bean features improved performance throughout the system, including faster orientation changes, faster responses when switching between recent apps, and smoother and more consistent rendering across the system through vsync and triple buffering. Jelly Bean has more reactive and uniform touch responses, and makes your device even more responsive by boosting your device's CPU instantly when you touch the screen, and turns it down when you don't need it to improve battery life.  JB definitely *did* bring system-wide optimisations. It was the entire point of the release - to speed things up. Did you not hear anything about "Project Butter?" there was a 15 minute keynote on the damn thing.... JB should *definitely* be noticeably snappier.   short answer: no  long answer: nope.   Post a screen shot of settings  about?   Its supposed to be a 3d viewable image, navigated in a way similar to street view on Google maps.    Depends on your device and the dev community it has. Siyah kernel for the i9100 has dual boot capabilities. Check out the xda forum for your device.    yeah. haha?  	110

 It takes more muscles to have your mouth open than to keep it closed!  First time that fact has actually come in useful for me..!    Kick yourself in the ass to get up, be positive, and look at today as a whole new day of opportunity everywhere you go! No one is going to do it for you. You are the only one in your way. So what are you waiting for?  I'm 99% sure that you are not a working psychologist, though there must be a few bad ones out there. I'm 100% sure you have never been through depression. That is absolutely not how it works.. you are telling someone who appears to have a chemical imbalance in their brain to 'snap out of it'. People with depression will struggle desperately to get out of bed, take a shower or do some work for hours. OP even tells you he struggles for two hours each day to stand up- if he could just get over that don't you think he has tried it already?   As someone who was clinically depressed I thought I was lazy for a very long time, but it didn't make sense to me because I tried so hard  and wanted to do so badly the things that I used to do with ease. Shame on you for not admitting your ignorance and possibly making this guys struggle even worse. He needs medical help and therapy to assist that medical help, not this pseudopsychology 'just think positive!' crap.   As someone who has actually gone through clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder, I think it is fair to say that for most people it isn't laziness. I have had days where I have sat in front of a computer trying to will myself to work for twelve hours straight and just can't, full on wrestling matches with myself in my own head to try to get out of bed. After a while of this stuff piling up you deserve to acknowledge that you are mentally ill, give yourself a break and not be labelled lazy. I'm not sure the 'psychologist' really knows what they are talking about, no serious psychologist/psychiatrist I have seen has ever gone down that route with me.  Take some time for getting better. Keep working out. Try meditation for focus (its easy to learn a few techniques online and it helps to train you to take control over your own mind). Get into a daily routine as best you can. Most people go through 4, 5, 6 different medications to find one that works for them because everyone's brains develop differently so keep going with that. Most of all, stay positive. It will pass eventually, try not to focus on your depression too much, keep treating it and eventually this will pass no matter what shit you have to go through between now and then. Maybe you'll have to take a regular job for a short while, who cares? You will always have time to start another business in the future.  	3
 The adult face on the kid is throwing me off   I'm more interested in the political and scientific landscape now with the Reapers gone. That why in my continued edit1, the plot starts going into Metal Gear/political intrigue territory.   Shep never had a kid. The person you play in ME5 is the offspring of your ME4 character (who is unrelated to Shep).  ME5 they will be about 18 years old, while ME6 they'll be in their 20s.   I am a Line in the Cult of Kirrahe   The Prophet does not care for the Batarians. The appearance they have as Batarian sympathizers is just a cover. In secret, he wishes to cause strife by hiding within Batarian territory and attacking human and Citadel trade hubs, putting pressure on the Alliance to go to war with the Batarians for "harboring" a terrorist group.  In truth, the Prophet wishes a war to happen between humanity and the weak Batarians. He sees a void of power amongst the Batarians and believes he can manipulate himself to their leadership using political intrigue and immense biotic power. He is confident his adopted son will hold the throne and eventually, make the biotic humans into a new god-like apex race, with the Batarians as their slaves  All other races will serve or die under this new galactic order.  His long term goal is universal conquest through biotics and spacetime manipulation - he literally believes his son will be immortal as no other biotic has displayed the son's amount of power.  Of course the Prophet dies in ME4. ME5 and 6 take place decades after and follow this adopted son as he grows up and befriends your player character (who is the unexpected offspring from your ME4 love interest). The Sons are dismantled in ME4, but this adopted son becomes an extremely powerful biotic who (by the end of ME6) has the very power to move suns and create black holes  Albeit he is unstable by the end, the two games would focus more ln the consequences of your actions in ME1-4; as offspring of your PC in ME4, how do you deal with relationships? Will you be nice or antagonistix? Join a gang with your biotic friend, or join C-Sec? It will be about choice, growing up and finding oneself.   Hi all, I've been replaying Mass Effect again and have thought of an idea for the next ME4-6. Let me know what you think! I had the following ideas while doing my latest playthrough.  I just finished watching Place Beyond the Pines this past week too and thought "how come we never see the consequences years down the line of our choices?" Every RPG ends when the Big Bad Guy dies. The world is saved and that's it. Dragon Age tackled it a bit in DA2 and DAI, but it feels impersonal. You never see what happens to your character, his/her friends or family. ME2 tried it a bit as well, but apart from a few "Oh, Liara is on Illium now," it is not that fleshed out. What would happen if your character conceived with a love interest? Why do we take certain things for granted in a game like ME, like "where does this crazy biotic stuff come from?" I wanted to explore themes of religion, consequence, family  hope. So I hope you will enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. I did get tired mid-writing, but I plan to write more.  ~~  **Mass Effect 4**  We pick up about 15 years after Mass Effect 3. If you chose Control, the Reapers have finished rebuilding the Relays and have secluded themselves. Otherwise, the Relays were rebuilt anyways. You can pick your own race this time around.   Your brother (or sister, if Asari), is a C-Sec officer on the Citadel. You get word they were killed in a large biotic suicide blast that has caused severe damage to the Presidium. Your sibling was scared, and believed there was an insider working for said terrorist organization inside C-Sec, so they turned to the only person they could trust - you.   You are brought into the Citadel and take part in the investigation, having the only viable intel from your sibling. Your first squadmate is a Drell C-Sec offer named Roven (literally making names up on the spot), and close friend to your sibling. The bombing investigation leads you to a shipping manifest for materials used to make the same biotic-fueled explosive device. The manifest comes from Omega.  Roven used to work for Aria, and believes she may know who ordered the parts.   Before you leave the Citadel, an aging, wealthy businessman (with a dark past) named Dondarion wishes to join you to avenge the death of his two daughters and wife killed in the explosion.   Additionally, a Roven recommends tracking down Gaven, a Salarian explosives expert who may be able to help. After fighting through baddies who have taken Gaven prisoner for betraying a criminal organization, he agrees to join the team.  The Council gives you a small, cramped and rustic frigate called the Argonaut (a drastic change from the luxurious Normandy), for your trip. You now have a mission - track what group bombed the Citadel and killed your bro/sister.  If Shep helped Aria take back Omega, you arrive to find it undergoing reconstruction and renovation. Otherwise, it's a bit more worse for wear (like in ME2), but Aria still managed to retake the station on her own after Cerberus collapsed. Aria tells you the materials likely came from a renowned bomb-maker, a Blue Suns Batarian named Yosup. You fight through waves of Blue Suns merc before finally arriving at Yosup's compound. You defeat Yosup in a boss battle. You then ask him who ordered the bomb and then can choose to kill him or turn him to Aria. No matter which option you take, a human woman arrives and frantically tells you another bomb will go off on Omega. As she speaks, a violent explosion detonates in the heart of the city. Your party manages to survive as the woman shields you in a biotic bubble.   The woman's name is Kolinya - she is a former member of a mysterious cult called the "Sons of Shepard." She had escaped and was looking for you. Back aboard the Argonaut, Kolinya explains the Sons of Shepard are almost certainly the group behind the attack. On the outside, they are a human extremist group of Batarian sympathizers. The founder is simply referred to as "The Prophet," is a powerful biotic human who left the Systems Alliance following the Reaper War. The Prophet left the Systems Alliance territory in search of meaning and stumbled across the Batarian religion, Vhar'shan, which preaches of strength and unity from [ancient Batarian scrolls.](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Kite%27s_Nest:_Pillars_of_Strength) The Prophet began intense study and came to his own conclusions that the Reapers were an apex race, but with them out of the picture, a void became apparent.  Kolinya explains the Prophet broke off from the main Batarian sect of Vhar'shan and started his own "Sons of Shepard." The Prophet believes that the post-Reaper apex race must be biotic humans. The end goal of the Prophet's beliefs, is biotic humans can eventually control the forces of the universe and ascend to godhood. The Prophet believes Shepard ascended to godhood on the Crucible and is the first of this new apex race. The Prophet, a powerful biotic, believes he will be the second to ascend. The Sons believe that the invisible forces of the universe chose Shepard, a human, to be the first of a new godhood which will rule creation. The Sons believe that mastering these forces through biotics, will allow them to join Shepard and rule all creation. They believe biotic powers have the ability to change the very laws of nature, therefore granting them the powers of gods. The Prophet concluded that the Reapers, despite their raw power, were unmatched to that of creation itself. What is a Reaper's laser beam to a supernovae, or black hole?  Kolinya shows the party a brief glimpse of the Prophet's preaching, in which the group recites their code: "We are children of the cosmos, the apex of creation. The Earth is our mother. The stars are our family. Our thoughts belong to the cosmos and with these hands we shall shape its destiny. Glory be unto the Shepard. Amen."  **Edit/continued 1:** With Kolinya's revelation, it becomes clear who the antagonist in the game is at this point. Your party must stop the Prophet before he begins a full-scale war between Batarians and humanity.  While on Omega, you discover Aria T'Lok was killed in the blast that has left half the station completely destroyed. You gain the help of a female Quarian bounty hunter named Jeema, who seeks the bounty on whoever killed Aria.   The game continues in this fashion for some time, your party consisting of:  Roven - male Drell C-Sec officer. Similar to Garrus, he is a romantic interest for female PC.  Kolinya - female human biotic. A cross between a Liara and Cassandra (Dragon Age) personality. She is a romantic interest for male PC.  Dondarian - male human business magnate, on a quest for vengeance. He is a former smuggler and knows Zaeed Massani quite well. Possible fling with female or male PC, but no long-term romance.  Jeema - female Quarian bounty hunter. A cross between Boba Fett and that badass Tali. She is a romantic interest for male or female PC.  Gaven - Salarian explosives expert with eccentric personality. A bit of Mordin, Han Solo and Jack Sparrow rolled into one crazy package. He is not a romantic interest.  Over the course of the game, you discover there is an upcoming conference between Systems Alliance and Batarian Parliament leadership. The Prophet plans to bomb the proceedings and blame it on human extremists, hoping to instigate a war.  Your party arrives in team to stop the Sons of Shepard from blowing up the conference. As the members of government are thanking you, another bomb detonates and kills many. You discover the bomber, a rogue Spectre named Faraday, and he is not part of the Sons of Shepard, but is a member of the secretive Systems Alliance organization called SAICOM (Systems Alliance Intelligence Command).  Faraday says bombing the conference was necessary and will be blamed on the Sons of Shepard - his superiors believe a war with the Batarians is inevitable. Humanity needs a war with the Batarians in order to restart their economy following the post-Reaper recession. Faraday explains the Batarians inhabit many resource-rich worlds, but as the Batarians lack the technology or expertise to extract much of said resources.  The overall plan was to have the Player stop the Sons of Shepard from bombing the conference, as SAICOM knew they would succeed. Faraday therefore planted a *secondary* bomb that SAICOM *blamed* on the Batarians, in order for the Citadel races to be sympathetic towards humanity.  The Prophet was a former SAICOM employee who headed a project called BioHuI, or the Biotic-Human Inquiry Project. Faraday says the Prophet was originally going to be a human martyr - the public would rally behind a kind, caring biotics teacher if they discovered a Batarian was behind the attack. But the Prophet converted to the Batarian religion and was shortly fired from SAICOM, where he vowed vengeance and took off into Batarian space.   The player then can decide what to do with Faraday; expose the truth, which would most certainly make humanity into the galaxy's black sheep. Or the player can hide the truth, thereby avoiding potential war and accept Faraday into their crew (as SAICOM believes Faraday died in the blast). An alternative is to still hide the truth, but murder Faraday. If you accept Faraday into your crew, he agrees to change his name and live under the radar.  **Continue Edit2:**  The player is now on the run from SAICOM agents, as well as tasked by the Citadel to track down the Sons of Shepard and eliminate their enigmatic Prophet. Faraday manages to locate the Sons headquarters - a large spherical station orbiting a Batarian red supergiant star. But the Argonaut is no Normandy - approaching the base directly would be suicide. Faraday proposes that the Player, Faraday and one other crew member pose as new converts to the Sons and infiltrate through a new recruit meeting, where you will see the Prophet himself.  The Player, Faraday and Crew Member get into the Son's headquarters and are shuffled into the main room. The Prophet emerges as a talking head on a TV monitor. The Prophet points out to the crowd of the Player's treachery and a fight breaks out. You battle your way through the Sons of Shepard base. The Player comments that many of the murals and depictions on the walls depict something resembling the Christian trinity - a "father," in the form of Shepard, a "Spirit", in the form of The Prophet, and a "son," in the form of an unknown young man.  You reach the end of the station to discover the Prophet had actually died many years ago, after the Reaper War. The Prophet now is a self-aware Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to control the universe through biotics. In its possession is an infant child, presumably the "son" depicted in the murals.  The Prophet AI, knowing full well it will be terminated, explains its origins to the Player if you have a high enough charisma/renegade/whatever.  Prophet was originally a man named Paul Sutton, a powerful biotic employed to combat the Reaper threat. Sutton worked for SAICOM, and was promoted to head of the BioHuI Project with the task of unlocking biotic abilities in children (very much like Jack and Cerberus), in order to combat the Reapers. When the Crucible emerged and SAICOM no longer needed BioHuI in its current form. SAICOM modified the Project's goals - unlock human biotics to help secure human dominance in a post-Reaper political environment. SAICOM believed humanity has a great chance of advancing itself to the forefront of politics, and biotics could help with war reparations.  Sutton became disillusioned with SAICOM, saying that BioHuI Project was just a cover for SAICOM's human extremism. "They are no worse than Cerberus, no more dangerous than the Illusive Man. Just now they have no Reapers to stop them and everything to gain," the PROPHET AI explained.  SAICOM fired Sutton, but that was not enough. Sutton threatened to expose SAICOM's extreme nature, so they attempted to assassinate him through a toxin. In a desperate attempt, Sutton fled and found refuge with the Quarians and Geth. But it was too late - Sutton knew he would succumb to his poisoning and, seeking revenge against SAICOM, pleaded with the Geth to upload his mind onto a machine intelligence. The PROPHET AI was born, with the goal to destroy SAICOM.  PROPHET rapidly learned more of biotics through its vastly expanded neural AI network with the Geth. PROPHET discovered the potential of biotic abilities - they have the potential to change the structure of the universe itself. PROPHET realized that the universe itself would end, even after trillions upon trillions of years. **PROPHET explained it's end goal was to stop death all together - both for organic species and the universe itself.**  "I would establish a new covenant in this creation - a perfect symbiosis between creation and life. With everything under my perfect command there would be no death, no gnashing of teeth or endings. Our universe would be eternal and perfect."  The PROPHET manipulated (or indoctrinated...) the first Sons, using Shepard as a religious icon to gather together the meek and desperate. PROPHET then bred himself a biotic son - a vessel unto which PROPHET could control the physical realm, while PROPHET controlled the digital.  The Player is disgusted by said revelations and had to option to destroy PROPHET through a virus provided by Faraday, or convince the AI to kill itself. Regardless, PROPHET becomes no more. The Player discovers the son, crying in a nearby crib. The Player can decide what to do with the child - kill it (in which case ME4 is effectively the end of the trilogy), hand it over to Jack's academy, or adopt it in secret.  Mass Effect 4 ends with the destruction of the Sons of Shepard base and the end of the terrorist organization. You are thanked by the Citadel. Finally, you are given the choice to oust SAICOM yourself, or let Faraday do it. Regardless of this choice, the Systems Alliance becomes embroiled in political scandal and war with the Batarians still looms as a possibility.  Thus ends Mass Effect 4.   Coming up next in oodbot's trilogy, we'll explore the consequences of your actions. 18 years after ME4, your son or daughter, whom you had with your love interest (or off-screen lover, if none chosen), will be the Player in Mass Effect 5. What happens to the biotic, tank-bred boy? Will there be war with the Batarians? What happened to SAICOM? Was PROPHET correct - can one really control mass effect itself? ...and more in **Mass Effect 5: Generations.**   wow, thanks!   The only mods he should use are the texture packs   I love gaming so much i dropped out of uni last year and I start game dev college next week!!   I always go for Liara first - best squadmate for her biotic abilities.   Commander Shepard, assuming he/she has survived the Star Child encounter, is now living life as a recluse with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He/She (let's just use "He" to save time) has gone off to live on his own. He has not seen his last love interest in years, nor ever fathered a child with said love interest. Shep has developed a drinking problem and (if male) has a gnarly beard because he doesn't give a shit anymore. He lives alone, reminiscing on the glory days; watching old vids, writing down his thoughts and replaying the events in his mind over and over (much like this very subreddit...).  Despite the destruction (which is the only ME3 end that allows Shep to live) of the Reapers, they still haunt his dreams every night. He remembers the death of all the people under his command; despite the trillions of people Shepard saved, he still feels immense sadness over the loss of loved ones (Miranda, Thane, those in the suicide mission, etc.).  In Mass Effect 4, set several decades after ME3, our player character is facing a new threat. He/She travels to Shepard's home - in a remote part of the galaxy - for assistance. Shepard offers some advice, but is too old and depressed to get off his/her ass to help. Shep, whos now this reclusive drunk, tells the player to give up. No matter how far they go to save the world, the world will slowly forget them and all their friends will die. All the killing and death will haunt them, so they should give up and go live a normal life and raise a family. Shep regrets being the saviour, as he feels isolated and elevated to this psuedo-demigod status where he is completely alienatesd from your average person. Most of his old squadmates have died of age, or gone off to do their own thing. He awakes every night, screaming of reapers and collectors, then cries himself back to sleep while trying to forget the next day with another bottle of scotch. Shep tells the player to forget him - he's a useless relic. He's just a man (or woman), not some invincible hero the universe has made him.   Later, a main mission requires you to head to Eden Prime. Shepard volunteers to help - he wants to come, to finish off old demons. For one final mission, you play with the aging Shepard, as he battles valiantly through Eden Prime for whatever the particular objective is. You reach the spot where he first encountered the beacon in ME1 - where the entire series began. Your team is ambushed there. Shepard offers to stay behind, giving you time to escape. You eventually agree and escape to your ship with your two squadmates. Shepard stays where it all began and fights to the death. As he dies, he looks to see the escaping ME4 squadmates, but they've taken the form of his old crew. He smiles, then dies - peace at last   If shep died in your ME3 playthrough...you get Garrus or some shit instead.     You big stupid jellyfish   But why are they doing kickstarters? Did their other games not make enough money or something?  I smell bad business practices - you can't keep going from crowd-fund to crowd-fund. Learn to make a good game and set it at a profitable price point.   Are they doing another Kickstarter? Isn't Shadowrun Returns already a released product on Steam?   Because I believe in and follow Jesus Christ, I must be a science rejecting retard.  Thanks for the daily reminder, Reddit!   Quit being so fucking melodramatic. They're computer games. Grow up   Thank you Batman's Joker.   I think the red line indicates a type-1 civilization, or a planetary civilization that controls all the energy output of one planet. We're on the cusp of achieving this, through bio and geo-engineering. But if we don't stop our rapid over-consumption and disregard for the environment, and learn to work together, we may not make it past that red line.   For me it was: spend $400 on a 970 no one gives a shit. Spend another $400 on the same GPU for SLI...they perk an eyebrow then don't give a shit after 5 seconds.  You guys seriously are over-thinking all of this shit. No one fucking cares about your weekend or gaming habits. They really don't - they forget in 10 seconds unless you live with some overprotective mother (in which case, you're a teenager so who fucking cares)   Oh they will. OP is just a teenager who has never actually done a 5AM bar hop, and most people in this thread are also whiny little twats   IIT: 16 year olds who are making this into some sort of "deal."   My bro watches 10 hours of football on Sunday. I game for 10 hours on Sunday. We both get equally chewed out by our parents for being lazy fucks, even now when we don't live with them  You guys sound so fucking whiny.   I got a huge panic attack when I went to Sagittarius A* the first time. I tend to stay near our home system too - I went to the edge of the universe once and completely NOPED out of there.   But if you met an alien you wouldnt know of they had a soul. How could you tell an alien "animal" apart from a "smart" alien? Our idea of intelligence is completly unique to our own human experience. To say whether an alien has intelligence or not is absurd at best, idiotic at worst.  What if they are a form of life beyond your human experience can comprehend? Some sort of multi-dimensional being, or a creature that communicates through a special kind of radiation? What if the very planet or stars were intelligent beings? It doesnt matter - they are beyond our capacity to understand and therefore, irrelevant to our salvation. Let God worry about the other entities out there.   According to the fermi paradox, an intelligent species should have evolved long ago and would have colonized much of the known universe (including earth) by now.   OP have you read any Stanislaw Lem? He deals with aliens in a more realistic and alien way than most sci-fi. I think your OP assumes aliens would be your typical Star Trekky or Star Warsish "humanoid" aliens, like the Klingon or Asari from Mass Effect.  Stanislaw Lem's novels treat aliens as entirely different entities - creatures so strange, so beyond our comprehenson, we cannot begin to understand, let alone empathize with them. In Lem's Solaris, the human crew finds out the alien they are studying is a planet-wide "ocean-organic," where each wave of this planetary ocean is actually a muscle contraction ( or so they hypothesize). The organism begins reading their minds and projecting their past, dead, loved ones into the world as ghostly abstractions. The crew starts going insane, but never in the book do they realize why the organism is doing this - is it communicating with them? Is this its way of speaking? Does it have goals or objectives, like a human would? What are those abstract shapes it creates with each [wave?]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Symmetriad_3.jpg/250px-Symmetriad_3.jpg)  Lem leaves these things open ended in his novels. He is easily the master at creating truly exotic/alien life.  My point is that i don't believe the great commission extends beyond our own species. We don't preach to apes or dolphins, yet they show signs of intelligence. The organisms in Lem's novels are many millions or billions of years older than man, sgowing intelligence too, yet how can you begin to proselytize to such alien life? The core of Jesus' teaching is on love and empathy - how could I have empathy for the billion-year old, planet-encompassing nanobot alien in Lem's "The Invincible"?   That part took me 2 hours and killed the entire momentum of the Circle Tower quest   Cannot upvote this enough. Enough with the le Gaben shit - GabeN doesnt know how to do good fucking customer service.   Hold onto the credits and use it to buy the future modules.   Not enough to do SLI, but thanks for offer   Well they're not free, unless you got an Omega from buying a 290 GPU   You didn't add the 315p to 325a upgrade path for $5   Everything these days is too damned expensive. Look at this Bible I bought: fifteen bucks. And talk about a preachy book; everyone's a sinner. Except for this guy.   But they were more subtle than this.  Marge: How would you like it if in 20 years, people were laughing at the things you did?  Bart: Not likely...   Cartoon's don't have to be 100% realistic.   Logitech G710+?   One more thing - how many SATA ports are there? I have a HDD, CD drive and 2 SSDs   Ok - so how much for it with shipping to Ontario?   And it comes with all screws, risers, cables, like it would be in a closed box?   Oh, you haven't tested it?   On NewEgg's site there's loads of bad reviews - are these justified? http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131833   Is there any difference from an ATX to mini ATX board? How is the board's overclocking potential?   The FTW has small overclock room, but it's already near the limit set by Nvidia anyways.   ~~MOBO bought.~~  Still looking for good 970 deals.    Done. PMing.   PMd for GPU. New Years Resolution is 2560x1440.   Want to latch onto OP - I too, need a 1155 MOBO, same CPU as OP.    I got fired, not for my lack of computer skills and repair quality, but for not selling enough.   That sounds very odd. Our in-store technicians do shit sales, because they're in the shop all their shift, but management knows that so these guys have very low firing rate (the current main guy is 25, has been working there since he was 18).   I work at Staples Canada as a Tech Salesman, so Staples Business Depot (US) may be entirely different. I don't do much of the easycare (tech support) side of things, but I built my own gaming computer so I am pretty confident in my tech abilities.  But for what it's worth, Staples has given me the best job training of all my jobs thus far. I have worked as a telecom engineer, government data  inputter (wow that was exciting job), fast food, grocery stores...  Staples gives you excellent sales training, through role-plays, videos, product knowledge quizzing, etc.  I just posted my stories cause it's fun to blow off steam.  There is a Best Buy right near my store and I know a few of the guys there. They always say our customer service and training is 100x better than theirs and they would rather work here after finding out how shitty Best Buy really is behind the scenes    When I was in retail I actually preferred this kind of stuff. It was busy work that would help pass the time and made it easier to avoid interacting with people.  Yuppp. My thing is getting printers down from overstock. Get to rid the picker for an hour or two.   Staples Employee here, also work in tech. Similar stories to OP with a couple I'll add.   Many customers think RAM is the be-all-end-all of computer hardware. The more RAM you have, the faster your computer/laptop will be, period. Some look stunned when I tell them they're 12-year-old daughter doesn't need more than 4GB of RAM (standard in any laptop now) for her school work.   Customers paying for $2000 Macbook Pro's in cash, when you can tell they're living off government subsidy.   Customer couldn't understand why his onboard laptop GPU wouldn't support a 1440p monitor when a) it simply did not support WQHD (I googled it), and b) he didn't even have the right port on his laptop. He was there in our store for 3 hours trying to make the fucking monitor work.   Got yelled at by a guy who claims we sold him faulty monitor cable. Turns out he thought his DVI cable would work as an HDMI cable, as his monitor did not support DVI.   No, we don't have that Boxing/Black Friday Doorcrasher in stock. Stop fucking whining. Get here at 7AM like everyone else.  I like to complain, but I will be honest that our store doesn't get that many idiots compared to the rest of the retail employee's I've met.   Only thing I'd change is get an SSD if you could afford one, otherwise looks great. Nice case    run triple 1440p monitors, hopefully 2 of the 27in korean ones, and one of the 34in widescreens from LG.   Jesus.  Good luck.  295x2 Crossfire out the butt.

Get the same kind of questions.  Today was good though - I converted a young (10 y.o.) padawan into a mechanical keyboard convert.   if you find a cheap one lemme know, bought another 970 myself. already own a 970 ftw.         egads, if only my mobo could do sli....    BUY them at a store in Skyhold.  Please tell me how. I am overloaded with useless currency.   if you do everything there is to do.   Like collect 10 hides or return a runaway Druffalo? These are literally quests I'm encountering 20+ hours into the game.  The only activity I semi-enjoy doing is closing Rifts, since it's easy, combat-focused and rewards good Power Levels.  Let's take a look in my journal right now actually...  Kill 2 guys for Cassandra in each zone.  Kill Venatori agents for Dorian in different zones.  Visit a grave in Hinterlands for some asshole in Redcliffe Village.  Kill wolves near a farm.  Close 0/2 or 3 rifts (x2-3 for each zone).  Is this WoW or a BioWare game? I don't recall doing this mindless shit in Origins or Mass Effect. I know Mass Effect had some grindy, shitty MMO quests, but you could skip them and do the main quest right away without grinding power level.   No, the game requires you to get a certain "Power Level"^over^nine^thousand in order to access the next main quest. It's padded as hell with fetch quests and repetitive ~~Oblivion gates~~ [Rifts.](http://www.riftgame.com/wp-content/themes/riftgame_2013/library/images/RIFT-og.jpg)  In order to do some of the companion quests (e.g. Kill Dorian's Venatori agents), you are required to return to the gimmicky, cow-clicky War Table in order to open up more areas of the map. Fuck off BioWare, let me explore at my leisure. If an area is too hard for me, idgaf, let me die.   I'm on the second last main quest with 40 hours in. Don't tell me I haven't really started it.  Fucking idiots downvote me all you want; defend your overrated generic Tolkien clone that shits on Origins.   Because his writing while he goes "insane" is so fucking terrible. It's fanfic bad.   You may enjoy Pixel Piracy   Might want to avoid Inquisition after your first paragraph   I think a cool idea would be a Oregon Trail-style game where you play Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt.   Until the cringe-worthy final conversation   I never even beat Inquisition. Between the boring combat, fetch quests, empty open world, and shitty main plot, no desire to finish the game. Game of the Year, my ass. Aliens Isolation should have won.   I just went back and have started another Mass Effect playthrough under "the man with no name...Zapp Shepard at your service." He womanizes and never prepares for anything. Looking forward to ME2.  Edit; thanks for the downvotes, ^fucking^idiots  I have 40 hours in Inquisition, more than my Origins or DA2 playthroughs. I am on the second last quest with no intention any time soon of finishing.  The game requires you to get a certain "Power Level"^over^nine^thousand in order to access the next main quest.

No bring everything with you   I work at Staples and we have it for $30 too right now. Return the one you bought and re-buy it to get $10 back.   I had the 670 and upgraded to a 970 FTW for my new 1440p monitor. Its awesome, and only $420 canadian, whereas my 670 was $370  The alternative is SLI 2 670s which would be very powerful and arguably better than a single 970 for most sli-supported games   Those are both DVI ports.   Yes   Look at getting a 270x or 750ti   Does it have 2xDVI?   Get a third monitor or return it for something cheaper. 2 monitor gaming doesnt work as you would have the screen split in half   Best bang for buck is 970 - third best card on the market and only $350.   2xHDMI or 2xDVI   Unless you go big with the CPU (like some monstrous i7 or xeon) you won't see much difference. Save some money for a better GPU like a 970   What is your budget?   Get  280X for another $30-40 with the cash you save on the OS   You don't need that monster of a CPU. I have a i5-3570k overclocked and it was half price, along with my 970 I get 45-60fps max in Crysis or Dragon Age at 1440p.   Did you put them in the same color ports?    Bought my bro a chromecast. Mom loved it so much I got another for her iphone   F   I always buy the parts myself and my Dad says "Okay I will give you the monry back, happy birthday/christmas."

And I try to sell people my company's (Staples) full Windows clean and setup that is only 150, rather than spending $400+ on a new laptop they likely won't see a huge difference with if their old one was bought 2-3 years ago  I built my own PC 5 years ago, just upgraded GPU and another SSD, but a good Windows reinstall makes it seem like a new PC every year   Did you tell him he can download more ram?   If you find a 970 for around 350, no. The 290X is notorious for high power consumption, heat and cooling issues   I work at Staples in tech and have these people trying to buy i7s and 8GB ram laptops for their grandpa who uses it for email and web surfing. I explain they don't need that much, but I won't stop them from giving us more money.   And having the most RAM is the most important thing   I got a Dell XPS with the same i5 and other specs as a macbook pro but it cost $500 less.   Why?      http://www.homerswebpage.com/  	104
 I take him out everyday so he can run around in the yard. I also play with him at least two times a day. I try to wear him out but he's still young-ish (1.5 years) and it seems he never runs out of energy! I wish I could get another cat but that won't be feasible until next year.   I've been busy lately and admittedly haven't been spending enough time with my cat. He pretty much demands constant attention. Anyway, lately he has been nibbling on my arm or leg. It's like a gentle bite. I would get mad at him because I really don't like being bitten no matter how gentle. Anyway, lately now whenever he does it he'll start to get... aggressive? It's like he's playfighting but it's doesn't feel playful and I've never encouraged him to playfight with me ever before. I usually play with him with his lure toys, etc. Is he mad because he feels neglected?   I had two jobs where I was under qualified. The first one was when I was 21 maybe and it was as an onsite administrator assistant. It was a small company and I felt they really really did not need an assistant because I had nothing to do all day. I also had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.  Then there was the summer job I had recently. I was a coordinator of sorts. I was in charge of a dozen people from 9-5 and my job was to supervise them but also coordinate their training program. I had to make up their schedule and hire people to train them. I think 50% of the the job was knowing the right people and networking. I didn't know the right people and I had to learn quickly how to network. It was very stressful and has honestly led to my recent depression. Though I felt I could have done a thousand times better in so many ways my bosses are happy with my work so I guess it wasn't all bad.   He's probably in his 80s. Drinks a lot. I hear he's sober now which is surprising. But before he used to drink with his alcoholic friends on his porch and yell obscenities to the women walking by. He also passed out with a pan on his hot stove that caused a lot of smoke. He was fine and so was his house. My town gets some sick entertainment whenever they hear firetruck sirens 'cos the town is otherwise dead and nothing is going on. So quite the crowd. For awhile he didn't have proper sanitation and I'm pretty sure he used a honey bucket lined with garbage bags because those garbage bags he left for the town's garbage collectors to pick up was pretty squishy. My dad calls him the world's best neighbour.   He did help me though when I was taking my dog out on a walk. My town lets their dogs run loose if they're not tied up year round. I make sure mine are collared and leashed when I take them out. Well a vicious dog was too interested in my dog and they were both getting aggressive with each other. World's best neighbour came to my rescue and scared the other dog off with a few rocks and kicks when I was struggling to keep my own dog in check while scaring away the other dog.   I think he'll just have to be happy with my company until I can get a second cat! Thanks for the advice.   Cats are REALLY weird.   For some reason I thought cats were social animals! I guess I've spent too much time with dogs to know the difference. I think I'll just stick to what I'm doing then and next year when I'm able I'll just get a second cat. Thanks for the advice and info.   I live in a townhouse that has a shared fenced courtyard. I recently adopted a cat and he's settled into his new home. I've started taking him out everyday with a harness and leash. At first he was scared but now seems to look forward to his daily outing into the courtyard. I just follow him wherever he goes and if he's up for it I'll play with him with one of his toys. But I've noticed that my neighbour lets her cat out everyday too. The cats notice each other but don't walk up to each other and if my cats becomes too interested in the other cat I pick him up and distract him with something else. My parents have a small dog that tries to pick fights with other dogs so I have a bad experience of introducing dogs to each other. I'm wondering if it'll be the same with my cat? Is it okay if my cat wanders towards the neighbours cat and say hello? Honestly, I just want my cat to have a playmate, he likes his new home but he's very playful and at times seems lonely.   The only grocery store in my town doesn't allow dogs. When I first got my dog I would walk him to the grocery store but I didn't want to leave him outside because there is a ton of stray dogs in my town so I took him into the store with me. I carried him through the aisles. Anyway, they now have a no pets allowed policy.   I actually had this conversation with a friend of mine. I told him didn't exactly have standards but was looking for someone who shared my values. Someone who believes in God, is a moderate Liberal and has strong family values since I do love kids and would love to have a big family one day. But I think I would also like someone who plays video games (BF4, Skyrim), doesn't mind me dragging them to the latest romcoms, and laughs at my dry-ish humour, and someone who has shelf full of books. I really don't like people who smoke or smoke up and prefer someone who is a social drinker who doesn't become dramatic once they've had a drink. Also, I'm fairly spoiled since I'm the youngest girl in my family, so someone who can accept that about me and doesn't make me feel guilty about it.  Edit: Forgot to add liking country music. It's 90% of what I listen to and I go to a lot of country concerts.   I like country music so whatever is on country radio.   Yep. Scared of driving but only because I'm pretty sure I'm the bad driver.   Dixie Chicks (Natalie Maines), Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood. So many really.   I don't mind her music but her voice is great and the only reason I buy her albums.   I'm not familiar with the newer Pokemon but Jigglypuff was always my favourite.   I have a few: Dixie Chicks, Rilo Kiley, First Aid Kit, Miranda Lambert. I have a ton more but when it comes down to it these are the singers/bands that I'll never tire of.   Divergent and City of Bones. The movies aren't great but they're a helluva lot better than the books.   YES. It drives me crazy when I hear kids/teen saying they are bored. My grandma would lecture me as a kid/teen whenever I said I was bored. My mom would lecture me as well if she heard me say anything about being bored. "Read a book then, there's a bible right there." Uh, no that's okay, I found something to do.   All of them. Except uniforms. That I understand.   Yes, this. When I worked at a movie theatre it was the people who demanded fresh popcorn when they had just been popped not 5 minutes ago. We just put them in the display to make it easier to grab.   I told my sister of the sin of the vertical video. I have yet to tell my mom.  	21
 Mine's 16, and I'm the second ranger, what do you want from me?   For my own input...  Wolves do not require regen unless you lower their durability, because they are able to 3 shot any dwarf outside, and if they can't be set back by low health, then they will absolutely destroy.  I can see skeletons taking more than one hit, don't get me wrong, but to give skeletons infinite arrows, does two bad things, allows hackers to use auto fire, and gives no hindrance to skeleton assaults, they can just continually push uncontested.  Creepers should not take more than one bow shot, they deal 7 hearts of damage up to 4 blocks away, 3 creepers can destroy a wall, and they can move rather quickly. Super Creepers should NEVER take more than one shot, if they are 4 blocks away from a dwarf under or on equal footing as him, it will just kill the dwarf 99% of the time.   The digging zombie has enough pick to get through one wall, that is quite enough if you ask me. Really Digging zombies are near useless, since going through a wall doesn't do anything much, so really I think they should be removed.  Spider Kings, afaik, are being removed, and if they aren't, they can take you to half a heart in 20 seconds.  Spiderlings, they have a high maneuverability, so they should be able to dodge hits, not take them. I don't contest higher poison if the spider king is removed, but if it's not, spiderlings can take you to half a heart in 35 seconds, and every time you heal, you delay your mana regen.   On Bruce's Gym, the format for the website was nearly the same, and what was on that tab was a server-wide Quest to slay 1,000,000 zombies. I would assume on PMC, the logistics would be the same, and it would be a server wide quest covering some or many of the gamemodes of the server.    hopefully as a result, we will get more fictional heroes, that would be awesome, maybe even something like my ShepherdOfFire, but that is tooting my own horn :L   mhm, makes me sad :(    I do not know myself, I have never seen anything to indicate this, and if it's true, I'm sad I'll never get to be Guude, or have a second change at a one shot bow again :(   What other explanation do you need? :P   Some cool ideas I had to heroes abilities were like, for instance, Lance's axe would do a ton of damage, and swing really slowly, but when he procs, the mining fatigue becomes haste, and swings incredibly quickly. I had two entire ideas about heroes, because that is what I like to do when I'm bored :L. But I couldn't really tell you who I think would make a good hero, since my ideas are more along the lines of Lance.   To elaborate on who all the old heroes were: BruceWillakers, LanceWillakers, GoldfounderPause, CaptainBoulderFist, NisovinsIllusion, Deadbones, LadyKedemonia, and RoaminThePaladin.  * BruceWillakers had possession of Virendra, a bow with Punch 10 and one shotted all monsters except golems, and Excaliju, a weapon with greatly increased damage and proc time. * LanceWillakers did not have a special weapon, but it is speculated that he will get his (axe?) that he uses in Death Fears Me. * Pause had a bow that one shots all mobs, like Virendra. * Guude had Frostshock, which I believe was a chain lightning weapon. * Nisovin had the Tinder Flame, which was meant to do splash damage, when hitting a mob, but was never completed/fixed, and the Wriggly Wrench, that acted as a melee weapon, and when used on another dwarf, repaired all his armor. * Deadbones, as you may have guessed, had his EZFIX SLABS, which placed a large temporary wall in front of himself and could also remotely place blocks. * Lady Kedemonia had the Regrowth Star, which could remotely heal dwarves, and death grip monsters, pulling them to her. * Roamin had the Holy Purifier. It's a flamethrower.   Yetii*      DEADBONES4LYFE   The problem with the enderman is that its character model is 3 high, however, because a player model is 2 high, arrows would bounce off its head. DvZ used to use wither skeletons instead of normal ones, but this was changed for that very reason, the character model just didn't work.   Thanks for the geegees Ageegee, maybe see you soon sometime, have fun, and good luck.   The "Death Zone" has a bit of leverage, it isn't like the instant you pass it you die, it's maybe like a 20 - 30 block range.   To add onto the updates of last night, some minor tweaks and changes were made to the game, and one big one:  * Invulnerability has been reduced (10 seconds) * Creepers **do not** receive invulnerability. * Wood working has been redone: 1. Torches take significantly longer to make. 2. All wood products are **transmuted one to one** (I.E. One plank = one stick **except in the case of sticks to bowls, which is still one to four**). 3. When a bowl is used in oil, it will produce 4 mortar. * The only ~~map~~ **maps** at this moment are Mount Willakers, Oasis, and Dogekac as the other maps need to be changed to accommodate multiple shrines.  * **Multiple shrines have been added:** Instead of one shrine, there are several, which must be captured **in order** (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for the monsters to win. It seems to take **less time to capture** each of these points, and once one is captured, the **monster spawn is moved on to or close to it.** * A monster **cannot** pass the shrine currently being attacked, else it is struck by lightning, and dies. **I'm unsure on this, but this seems to have broken the "Infection" plague, because the instant the infected turn, they die to the shrine's fail safe.** * **All maps** now has starting supplies, of about 20 - 40 of mortar, cobble, and torches. * At least from what I could tell, past shrine 2, monsters that turn into Super Creepers will do so on the spot.  I figured I would write another one of these to go into detail of the changes, but if Rob and Nis would like me to remove/stop these in favor of the Trello list system, I gladly will if they ask.   * Link to the Trello here: https://trello.com/b/Wi2Di0qF/playmindcrack   More features, yay!   * Oasis returns with 2 shrines. * Dogekac has 4 shrines.   Nis actually does not have two items, his bow, the Tinder Flame, does no extra damage, and was originally meant to be AoE, but never was implemented that way.   If you look to the Changes thing Rob posted, it's actually a complete change of flow, as seen by the "multiple shrines" card. You can't really have squid when the shrine is outside right infront of you, kinda defeats the purpose.   They have been removed due to a new upcoming feature, that I will post about when it is fully instated.   I had the purifier in it's overpowered version, and my god, it made zombies melt into it, can't wait to see it return.   Thanks Juhdas :P   I always liked being Nis, and when I was Nis with Virendra, that was heaven. I in general just like class stuff, I could eat that stuff up all day.   So many people won't ever know the satisfaction of killing a dwarf, as a squid xD.   I myself do not play as monster that often, but do the golems spawn with their picks? If they do not, then they do not do any more damage than one heart, which is unfortunate.   Nisovin, as I stated above, Holy Blades do not do 10 damage, and still do 8. Thanks for the clarification though! :D   eh, maybe, I would totally do it for the Hero update though, love that stuff.   So, as you may know, DvZ is still a WIP, as heroes are not finished, sounds still need to be added, and new maps are still needed. However, there was another "balancement" update rather than "content" update today, and these are the changes I observed:  * Procs are now limited to within 5 blocks of your person, so basically, **bow proccing is removed.** * Golems are readded, ~~however, spawn with only a seppuku, so they do not have much of a function other than a walking damage soaker.~~ **They now spawn once again with the ancient pick.** * **Healing ale now uses 150 mana** rather than 200 from before. * Mount Willakers has invulnerability added upon monster spawn (18 seconds). * As of this moment, ~~I did not see any instances of squid (maybe rarer?)~~, ~~wolves (also rarer?)~~, ~~or the map oasis (removed?)~~ ~~and have not played on any map other than Mt Willy to see if they have arrow invul too~~. * ~~WE GOT FANCY SPECIAL MONSTER MESSAGES, I LOVE YOU ALL.~~ **SPIDER KING MESSAGES ARE MESSED UP, PRAISE REDACTED.**  I myself enjoy these changes, it makes indoor combat easier, shields have more use outside, and spawn camping isn't devastating anymore, at least from what I observed.  As stated by nisovin below:   * **Sword damage was increased to 10** rather than 8 (~~**PALADINS, USE THE RUNEBLADE, THE HOLY BLADE IS NOT UPDATED**~~ Fixed.). * All map's invulnerability was increased (18 seconds). * Squids are, in fact, removed. * Oasis, is in fact, removed. * Holy Blades and Longbows are shiny again, keep in mind they **DO NOT** do anything extra, just shine.  In a speculation: (as per substitutemyown): An event, rather it be randomly occurring (most likely this, as if it were a special monster event almost) or admin controlled, that occurs during the day known as the Solar Eclipse will block out the sun, and cause havoc among the dwarves, as the zombies regain their buff.  Side note, I would gladly make more of these if people want, it's kinda fun, always pondered the idea of a constantly changing guide, maybe one day... :P   No no, the kills recorded fine, the time the game took did not, which is why my longest game is still about 1:20 and not 1:40 :P   My *longest* and *highest total* kills game was a game on Mount Willakers in which SlyiceT100 was Bruce, and the game went on for about an hour and 40 minutes, reached 2700 kills, and didn't even record on my stat page, because I was last to die. However, my *best* game was one that only reached about 1200, but 450 were my hand as Bruce, on Mt Willy. And my most memorable game? I was nisovin....with Virendra, Bruce's bow, the props of a ranger 3 (also, do note, all of these are on the gym :P)   Heroes, if there is one thing I want to see, it is demonstration of hero abilities. As well as showing what is more effective at killing mobs, aka no mazes. The basics too, of course, so people don't think procs are hacks and to show bow procs are allowed :L   Who plays as monster?  But in all seriousness, I love to be anything that isn't a spider or digging zombie, due to them having the least lethality.   it's you're, can't, kyle's, and all your "i"s should be "I"s   Maybe I can stop by and say hi :P    It takes a lot to hold up the 4th place title, but maybe sometime I'll stop by. :P   That's because I haven't been in one in ages. I've been in another community, and its nice there. Didn't think anyone actually missed me.   huh, weird, Its been a long time I guess, not as long as sk8, but a while.   ,.   I'm not missed either, no worries :P   Even if this is lag, a video from Scorpion is going to be posted soon enough of this guy on ttaylorr's, of him literally flying around.   Infinite*   I love it   :3   No one even knows me :P   I wish I had any. :(   Ultra Hardcore, no crafting table usage, and hardcore mode. There is a challenge.   * Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold  * From the Dust - Rouge  * To the Stars - Braken   PA, 6:33 P.M.   not much, playing games. listening to music, doing (procrastinating) homework.   What's up?   Hi o/   Gifted have and A, Math have an A, Spanish have an A, Web Page Design have an A, I'm really not that interesting :P   A few years ago we had like 5 of these in our own school a year, it was just bad, luckily they solved the problem, but those idiots took away some of our freedom in the mornings.   Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold   The letter Q   Maybe the Back to the Future Trilogy?   Rouge - From the Dust or Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold, been stuck between the two.   Literally anything I listen to I could listen to over and over as long as I initially liked it. It's almost a curse really, I will listen to some monstercat or Avenged Sevenfold and won't listen to anything else for weeks, the flip to the other and have to dig up songs out of my Youtube favorites if I want to listen to them.   Check to see if someone logging on has a name longer than 16 characters.    There is no need to lower the slot number, someone nicknamed themself over the character limit, just disable /nick. Probably want to clear the player files too, if that guy joins back with the nick he will crash it again.    He does :P   OMG this is amazing, wonder if you could do that in a game, guess you would need a resource pack for it, but on the DvZ server they have it when you level up a thing flashes on your screen, so maybe its possible.  	61

I ended up with a 2 inch splinter of wood being jammed up my middle fingernail...all the way. I had to go to the nearest urgent care facility to get shots in my finger and get it pulled out with tiny tweezers.  If I had any secrets that someone wanted to know at that time, I would have yelled them at the top of my lungs.   If someone tickles me, it makes me angry.

The scene in The Patriot when Mel Gibson's character is about to ride off to fight in a battle and he asks his daughter (who is traumatized from earlier events and hasn't spoken since) to give him just one word before he goes. She refuses, he goes to hug her, and she pulls away. As he's riding away, she stares him down and then says "Papa!". He jumps off his horse and runs to her. She says "I'll say anything, just please don't go" and hugs him.  I cry like someone has just replaced their testicles with onions and then teabagged my face for two and a half hours.

[Probably the most relevant video in all of reddit.] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY1yzbekg_M feature=youtube_gdata_player)    The afc system seems to cause misreading on the resistance.  Me and a friend were stumped when it came to this problem. However, we found that he was not adjusting the airflow. He was loosening the 510 connection - and this caused the trouble with reading resistance. Screw your 510 tight, and look for a little notch to turn just outside the circumference of the 510 connection ring. There is a separate notch there for adjusting the airflow - not the flathead screw 510 connection.

Sorry for referring to permalinks, reddit mobile made it hard to copy the full comments back and forth.   No thanks needed, I'm happy to be able to share some knowledge on my favorite hobby!    Yes. It's remarkable. That's why I bought one. That was not my point. If they were bumping up the wattage I'd expect them to bump up the voltage as well - otherwise I don't really see a difference between the 50 60   Still only goes up to 10v. Doesn't seem like that'd be right.    Happens to me. Pretty normal.    Is your 510 pin on the Lemo tight?    If you keep the wattage low, you can surely run the protank on your istick. The beauty about  these regulated mods is that while you can run them at high power, you can also run them at the same voltage that an evod battery would put out (3.7v).  There is a known health issue with formaldehyde which is hypothesized to happen when you run a lower quality tank at higher wattage, so if you were to run that protank at 50w, you may risk heightened formaldehyde levels in your vapor. Dr. Farsalinos Konstantinos hypothesizes that heightened formaldehyde levels can be caused by devices whose wicking speed can't keep up with the heat of the coil - so if you're getting excessive dry hits, you may risk formaldehyde production.    Even if the tank doesn't crack, these liquids can decompose the polycarbonate plastic of the evod tank, so you run the risk of vaping broken down plastic that has leeched into your Eliquid.    Where did you purchase from?    The 50w has two cylindrical 18650s as seen in Pbsuardo's review   Yeah, mech mods are one thing you don't want to cheap out on. You really need that high quality machining and butter smooth threads or you're gonna have a bad time.    Upvoted 'er  Good luck!    Sup, guy. Found you.   You check /r/ecigclassifieds?    I never said that I thought it was in one take. Ive watched a few videos in my day, I understand when something could be one take and when it may not. Regardless of this, it's pretty cool.    Additional note. The parts you want to separate are the two metal rings - the one with the tiny pinhole and the one above it.    Yup. When I saw this video, I must've replayed this part 20 times over.  The sound of the hit and her smashing through the glass is just fucking awesome. I don't remember whether this video was World Star or had something to do with Ferguson.    This is incredible. I really wish I had gotten high before watching, would've blown my mind.

[Here it is!](https://www.mediafire.com/?58ydz669y61hxyy) It's long, but if you have a highlighter handy, I think you'll really find this useful!   Hi there!  I spent quite a bit of time last semester and on my own before that point researching electronic cigarettes. My research project for my college english class was on vaping, so I've put quite a few papers together on the subject. If you'd like, you can find my paper [here for viewing or download](http://www.mediafire.com/view/5ev46znw9etboyk/ResearchPaperFinalMyVersionComments NamesRemoved.doc). (Please note that if you're viewing in Mediafire's document viewer, the pictures are going to make the essay look like shit.) It's a Microsoft Word file hosted on Mediafire. All sources are cited.  Also, I found one really solid source from CQ Researcher to be the most helpful in finding a lot of my information. It's not free to access, but if you'd like, let me know and I can probably get you a copy of the article. It'll essentially have everything you need.   Hey, man! Last semester I did mine on vaping as well. If you'd like, I can send you some of my papers. All sources are cited, and I got an A- in the class.    What is MBV going to do? Damn.    Damn, sun.    Their major complaint is that it draws in kids.   So does smoking. Science says that if you start smoking after the age of 18, that you are much less likely to become addicted. People start smoking at a hella young age, but you never thought about banning cigarettes.   One thing I noticed about vaping is that it blows smoking cigarettes out of the fucking water. After you make the transition from smoking to vaping, you cough up all that loose shit in your lungs, regain your smell and taste, if you try to go back to cigarettes, you're going to have a damn bad time. You WILL feel that tar again in each and every single drag, and you will most likely not pick smoking over vaping after that experience, and while knowing that vaping doesn't feel that shitty.   These kids aren't going to pick up smoking from vaping. If they vape, they're not going to smoke, because it's simply not nearly as good of an experience. Vaping renders smoking useless.   We'll learn to tell our children not to fuck around with it even if it has awesome flavors, in the same way we tell them to do that with alcohol, even though it has awesome flavors. If parents and teachers engrain into these kids heads to be vape free in the same way they tell them to be drug free and alcohol free, they'll be afraid of it until they reach age.  I just don't understand how these politicians can so blindly, all over the country, outlaw something they know absolutely nothing fucking about. It enrages me.    And what is this    Weird.

Hi, I'm test_subject5880 and I had an electronic chip implanted into my brain to alert me whenever SmogLA makes a post or comment with the words "iStick" or "50W."   Things on reddit don't usually make me laugh anymore, but this definitely did.    That's TN for ya.    Incredible.    For what it counts, I ran both this image and the cropped injury image through three different reverse image search engines and came up with no results, so it doesn't appear that this image has been posted anywhere else that is easily accessible.   I still don't know that I believe the situation, as a user of only mechanical mods I've never had any dangerous experiences, however this doesn't seem to be simple copypasta.   I only get a gag reflex/almost throw up when my vape gives off a dry hit (when there is little to no eliquid on the heating coil that vaporizes the eliquid, and you're instead heating resin/cotton). Maybe the vape you are using isn't very great?   I recommend getting your round Kanthal from here.

F   Ohhhhhhhhhhhh my god [10]   Aren't bright lights/flashes dangerous for a newborns eyes up to a certain # of weeks?    Should've just decreased the sensitivity of his joystick.    I'm sorry to hear that he is dealing with all that. I asked if he had started medication, because I remember that certain medications can really send you spiraling downward and have you throw away everything good youve got in life.  Is there anyone else around him that you can get involved? Parents/family/friends of his that can just make sure he isn't completely withdrawing socially? I know you said he's against the idea of therapy, but from what it looks like he struggles with, I feel he could definitely benefit from it. Is there anyone that could convince him?    Shhhhhh   Right there with you. Bummed out, sad, and perma-tired, with nothing to do and no dependable friends to make plans with.   Maybe you can roll blunts and play with kittens :)?   Best of luck with what you're going through.    Why do you want to?    Hi friend, fellow college student here. It's a horrible testing struggle-filled time. You said youve got an appointment for a therapist and that is EXCELLENT and very crucial to overcoming this. The one thing I was thinking reading this, is that if you can't afford therapy, does your college by chance have a free therapist on campus? Most do, I believe.   As far as medication goes, it can make or break you. One thing you can expect is for each and every medication to have a radically different effect on each and every person. What works for one person can increase depression in another person. I wouldn't recommend starting an SSRI during a really busy time in school, and until you feel comfortable with your therapist. If you have a break coming up in college, try starting a med exactly 2 weeks before that break. You'll start to see a change in how you feel on an antidepressant after that 2 week period, and in the case that the med affects you negatively, you then have time to work it out with your therapist outside of school.   Best of luck! Let me know if you have any other questions.    Yeah, I'd recommend giving him some space on this one. If he's saying those things and treating you poorly, I'd let go of showing support for a bit.   Has he recently started any new medications that you can think of? This is sort of really important when it comes to depression and life changing decisions.    Medication and therapy -  but more so therapy, have more benefits than one could imagine. Very, very helpful. Never in my life would I have thought that I'd have such control over my anxiety, and for a good period of time after I quit the meds and graduated therapy, I felt absolutely normal - depression free.   It's definitely worth a try.    You might find a more educated answer in /r/drugs or /r/mdma  Personally, yeah. I've heard of Molly and X affecting serotonin levels, causing sleeplessness and depression.    If you are more depressed than ever, try a new medication. Buproprion (wellbutrin) worked for me in terms of depression, but spiked my anxiety and eliminated my ability to eat anything.   Generally with antidepressants, there's like a two week period where your mood will slowly start to change. If you feel after that period like you want to end your life, and you can't really pinpoint why, it's definitely time to come off that med.   I've tried about 8 different meds (SSRI's don't work for me either), and this has definitely become my rule of thumb after I've had some dangerous low moods on a couple of meds (citalopram and sertraline)    Your problems are just as significant as everyone else's. Don't be down on yourself. Everyone has a different threshold and spectrum of emotion - one person's loss of a family member can feel like another's stub of a toe :)   Welcome, and Good for you for getting on here and venting. This is really the first step to getting it out of your system completely.  As to why she might admit that to you, I don't know - that's pretty low of her to do. If you are the only real person she talks to about that stuff,  she might have that real lack of judgement and just want to share her exciting new experience no matter how much she's stepping all up and down your feels.  She could also be testing to see if your jealous.  She could also be heartless.  Many possibilities, and I hope it works out for the best.    Hey. You're not in the mental state to be able to make the biggest decision in your life right now. It's natural for liquor to make you want to kill yourself, especially when you are mixing it with other drugs.   I have an idea for you. You want to commit suicide, I understand. But why tonight? If you commit suicide tomorrow, it will have the same result. Why not wait 24 hours or more, and at that time, see if you still want to make this decision. What's one more day?   I think that if you allow yourself to go to sleep tonight, that you're going to wake up tomorrow with a completely different mindset - free of the liquor and the pills.   I've been where you are, friend. I know how it feels to have that sudden onset sadness and strong urge to end your life, but it's NOT you talking right now. It's the liquor and the drugs, man. As soon as they wear out of your system, you're going to feel differently.  You CAN DO THIS! Please hang in there.    There is no need for apology. I understand how it is! Is there anything you'd like to talk about?    Horrible, nasty, waste of time finale. They couldn't get Charlie back on for the final episode so they made an animation of him to fill in, reamed on him horribly the whole episode (making jokes about how he's psychotic, fucks goats   men) , and then killed his stunt actor again at the end of the finale. They attempted to break the fourth wall (too many times) but it was with horrible meta jokes that either no one got or highlighted how much the show actually sucked.   	104

 I need more friends on MFP. Just added you. :) I'm Anthliel if someone else wants to add me.    I just added you! I don't know how friends work on MFP but if you can se my diary then it probably won't make much sense to you since english is not my first language and I tend to log most of my food in swedish. But calories are the same in every language. :) I'm going to try to log my food in english when possible.    This is me! I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old, just changed career (used to be at teacher actually) and trying to find out who I am. It's so inspiring to read about people like me who have made the change.  I started logging yesterday and today I have already prepared lunch and logged it (it's morning now where I am). If you wan't to add me on MFP my username is Anthliel. :)   It's seems like I'm writing this to everyone but this is just what I needed today. I used to see a psychologist last year and she told me exactly this. I need to start to forgive myself and recognize that I'm only human. It's hard but I think I can do it. Thank you!     And there really is no end. This is a life long journey and I need to accept that. There is a reason that I have always gained back everything I have lost. The end is just the beginning.   	5
 "Newest big patch that was supposed to FIX the game? Yeah, all our saves are gone. Thanks."  That's how I read that, you guys are so sassy with your Master Race Rage haha   "I keep losing track of my pockets. What do all that I own? Can somebody help me find myself???"  I'm a mess when I trip.   I thought I might've been the only one experiencing the volume issue, thanks a ton!      Oh definitely aha It's funny because it can be a little boring to watch sober, but overly intense to watch tripping. He should save it for next time then if he's iffy about it haha   Well yeah haha But I'm saying, I can't really tell what's too loud you know? It's hard to describe. I can recognize volume differences but I don't know when the volume is too high   Oh, and Wolf Of Wallstreet was actually pretty trippy. Lots of metaphors, motifs, interesting things you can catch when you're tripping.   Haha I feel you dude. I'll have everything planned out and then I'll just be like "Wait, this is all so bland." It's like, the things you think are gonna be cool when you trip aren't as much so when you're actually in the headspace.   Lots of people will tell you "Just go outside, it's way better". While being outside is incredibly enjoyable, sometimes people's interests lie elsewhere (Like myself) and that's okay. Do what you wanna do.  I'd definitely recommend Enter The Void: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKRxDP--e-Y  It's completely first person, which makes it very cool to watch when tripping. You notice his eyes blink, you hear his thoughts, his voice is even muffled as it would be when you hear your own voice. It's cool. He's a trip junkie and he takes DMT, then he dies and you journey through the after life and observe the past and future of the lives you left behind. I think everyone should see this at least once during a trip.  A chiller movie I'd recommend would be Disney's Fantasia. Definitely a beautiful thing to see during a peak.  As far as games, I find that roaming around in GTA can be funny and just odd at times. Hotline Miami is a very colorful game, really tailored for tripping. Another favorite would be Destiny. Also very colorful aha I'd suggest more based on your tastes if you'd like, I'm just into anything pretty much.   At times, usually during my peak, I'll notice that increases and decreases in volume are kind of weird. It's like, I notice the volume going up and down but I can't tell what's too loud or too quiet. Does that make sense? Anyone else get this?   I just realized that's The Son running toward Tony.   Call it whatever you want, dude. We all know what you're taking.  GRATEFUL DEAD.   So I started out with the intro, it was definitely dark for me. Darker than it was playing sober. I felt like I was experiencing it how the developers intended. The intended emotional reactions from the scenes, I felt tenfold. The first thing I noticed was that I completely forgot to play. At the same time, it was almost second nature to me. Hard to explain. The Xbox controller was hard to handle and my hands were sweating. Somehow I managed to do relatively well. Oh, when I did the Apocalypse level... That was really something. It felt new again. I remember when I first played the level and I was like "What's happening? Why are things blowing up?" This time, I had those same thoughts. Lots of confusion. Plus, I really didn't want to kill anyone... Which was strange. When I got to the first "Boss" (Mark) the growl terrified me. Every boss after that was a bit frightening as well, but in a good way. Very intense aha   There's been a whole new meaning to "Gotta get a grip" for me...   Still waiting on that story man!  And you definitely should, I really spoke to me during the trip. I highly recommend giving it a trippy listen. His unique beats and sounds and mix of styles just really flows well. It keeps you interested and always changes up in the most pleasant ways. Plus when he gets really serious or emotional or presents questions or ideas to the listener it really gives you something to think about. Something valuable in my opinion. It was great on my headphones though ;D   I usually get everything cleaned, take a shower, shave (Love having the smooth face when I trip), and eat a meal roughly an hour before I take the tabs. With the tabs in my mouth, I lay in my bed and either play a simple game that's not too intense or try to watch something animated on YouTube or Netflix. Then I let the magic happen (;   Yeah I was loving the window view but I just felt caged and really hot, kinda claustrophobic aha Everything worked out though   You mean at the place with the drinking?  I dunno, I don't like drinking and I've had a lot of issues in my family dealing with it. Just a lot of bad memories and things like that. Plus, I have this hatred for it really. All I see in my mind is a bunch of apes and aggression fuel. Not something I was interested in being around. Plus, the guy who lived there is really paranoid and it was making me paranoid. Not to the point where I'd freak out, but just an annoyance really.  	18
    This is too accurate..   With all the buzz about the issues with Unity, the frame rate issues in particular, I'd expect Ubi to say something about it. Have they said anything about upcoming patches or anything?  	3
 how would you make Stormbringer in shadowrun?      Stormbringer is the name of the infamous black sword featured in a number of fantasy stories by the author Michael Moorcock. Created by the forces of Chaos, it is described as a huge, black sword covered with strange runes carved deep into its blade.  This powerful enchanted black blade is a member of a demon race that takes on the form of a sword, and as such is an agent of Chaos. Stormbringer's edge is capable of cutting through virtually any material not protected by potent sorcery, and it can drink the soul from (and thereby kill) an unprotected human upon delivering any wound, even a scratch. Its most distinctive features are that it has a mind and will of its own, and that it feeds upon the souls of those it kills.   I suggest posting some examples.   fantasy,science-fantasy etc gibe plz.  post a short description of supposed appearance, behavior,etc.   I never played it but i very much enjoy games who emphazise roleplaying and while i know the base setting dosen't have magic. there was a supplement with more setting and did that add the possibility of magic to the game?  how does it work? alternativly if not how would magic be implemented?  http://www.pelgranepress.com/?cat=222   To me the game scream freeform-magic system how would you make  it work?   how often does it happen to you?  i did it all the time worst was with gurps and nwod i just freeze when i have to come up with stuff on the spot ,encounters are by far the worst experiences i had, maybe i'm just not made for GMming   stating up stuff just stops the game and the players just stare and that's when the doodoo hits the fan in a panic i just blurr out something stupid and try to go around the issue in the stupidest ways as in nwod i just rolled for health and hit die for combat. or had to bail them out because i threw a monster too strong that they couldn't handle i guess in that aspect it's their fault aswell for not trying to go beyong i have stick and want kill dragon hit dragon with stick until dead.   lol yeah could've said a little more than that.   what were your experiences with it, how fast does it play and how fast is it easy to come up with stuff on the spot such as stating enemies and stuff.   Nobilis chuck the "estates" away if nevessary.   my main worry is that the characters will feel very much the same power wise by having the same abilities and such,Nobilis each character had a diferent Estate and that helped keep them apart, amber only had Pattern,Logrus,Shape-shifting (which seems very underpowered),Trump and Magic(all three) which sounds like the players would know what to expect.  	10
 It means Trans Excluding Radical Feminist. I assume you're confused about the meaning.   I am a feminist and I did back peddle to explain a mistake I had made, so I suppose so, though this topic has little to do with feminism. Feminists, those who aren't TERFs anyway, do pay attention to trans* rights, but that doesn't make trans* issues only feminine issues. Sort of like, a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't a square.   Well, as you can see by my edit, I confused gender identity and gender roles. Gender identity is hardwired by brain "maps" if you will that dictate how the body should be lined up. I'm not really a mechanics type person, but I don't think transmissions have anything to do with biology.   Gender roles are a social construct, so in a sense, no it doesn't exist. However, traffic laws are also social constructs and they exist, in a sense. As long as we recognize social constructs, they exist.  Edit: my mistake, confused gender and gender roles.  Edit 2: confused rolls and roles.   "Faggot" is actually only used for gay men. There is a separate derogatory term for lesbians.    Wow... Usually I check on stuff like that. So much for helping.   As a lesbian and a gay rights advocate, it would be quite troubling if I were a homophobe.   No, I haven't experienced racism. Though, I am a genderqueer lesbian who presents fairly masculine, so I have experience the bad side of bigotry for being a minority. I wasn't rude to you, I simply explained a conceptual difference. I once made the same mistake myself and the person who explained it to me wasn't so kind, so I thought I'd do it nicely before that person showed up.   I'm not denying anything. Also, denying something doesn't make someone a bigot. A Holocaust denier is most likely a bigot, but if they rely just don't believe it happened, they are ignorant, as they ignore facts presented.   Yes and no. What you defined is institutionalized racism. A person's remarks can still be racist without real power, though words have power. It's an easy mix up.   More homophobia. How attractive!   If she were having phone sex, she could get hearing AIDS.   /r/homophobicbigots is available as well.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophilia?source=app  For everyone else who didn't know.   Have you ever been asked to sit on a cake?   At least they're little. The deer look right at you and it's awful. Also a suspicious amount of cats and dogs and once a guinea pig near me.   (No regrets) I dislike the American military greatly. They waste money throwing "freedom" where it isn't wanted. Members are not heroes. Unless you were drafted, you took the job and knew the risks, just as you would to be a teacher or a Wal-Mart cashier. You're free to disagree, but that's my opinion. Though, I have a soft spot for families that are reunited. I don't know if it's the feeling being shared with the people in the video or if it's the fact that I know they don't know If they'll ever see their soldier alive again or what, but I cry every time.   "Brothers".   I'm an amateur lesbian, not a professional or anything, but if you put a pussy in my pussy I'd probably cry.   Yo dawg, we heard you like pussy so we put pussy in your pussy so you can pet your pussy while you pet your pussy.   Ignore that. I'm an illiterate asshole. You don't need to apologize for the behavior of others. Keep doing you and making the male population look good!   Well, many if not most cishet men are sexist. They also are terribly objectifying. I don't want to deal with either. No, you can't watch, no I'm not thinking about experimenting.   My best friend is a straight guy, but he's trans and doesn't do that stuff. I have several straight male friends but really I'd rather hang with girls who want to chat and talk girl stuff. Also, there is weird competitive energy between dudes and lesbians.   I figured out the problem! You can't read!   P.s. the kid is a daughter. I bet it matters less now.   Talk of rabbit consumption isn't allowed here.

He was in no position to be a dad or provide for a child. She tried to make the best choice for her kid's life. It wasn't to hurt OP. You guys try to force fifteen year old girls to abort.   I seriously doubt she had the means to contact him and ***had not really had a chance to decide what to do when she later ran into him.***   Most likely they didn't exchange last names, numbers, Facebooks or Twitters.   First off, warts are hardly life or health threatening. It's not like he hid AIDS from you.   We don't know if he would have done the same if it were a dangerous STI. We don't have a way to know that. Perhaps you could communicate about it.   I don't think something like this is worth a break up. You have a right to be upset but I don't think your guy was being malicious at all. I think he was just being stupid and didn't think through the consequences of you getting it, too, since no one else had.   He was a 15 year old kid who had met her once. I seriously doubt she had the means to contact him and had not really had a chance to decide what to do when she later ran into him.   DD is rarely considered big. It's only 4 inches of boob total, so more like two each.   If you can admit you have a problem, get help. You can do it.    Check out /r/abrathatfits. It won't help you get a girl but a lot of dudes who need the support are going for bras. Maybe you can make a man bra, call it a "bro" put dragons on it, sell it to other perky breasted men, make the big bucks and get a girl that way.   I absolutely love muffin tops. Don't be like the cake boss with a cupcake top all up in there but a cute little muffin top really gets me. I'm totally unattracted to people without it. There is hope for you out there!   Wow. That's like outright stating no one poor or disabled can be prom king or queen.   At my school, popular kids are always nominated and recognized as such, but the kids who did the most work and were dedicated always got elected.   I have a preference (Kotex U super for tampons and Equate overnight ultrathin with wings for pads) but when I'm broke it's not a big deal to get something else.   But gay marriage is all about gay men and their scary buttsex. I mean really. They do blowjobs. Beardy blow jobs. And they do rimming. Sexy, bearded rimming.   /^ homophobic politician thoughts.   I'm a fifth generation East Stroudsburg graduate, so I may be a bit biased here, but while Stroudsburg isn't a bad district the way other local ones are, they are going through some bad financial stuff and closing schools. They also have a strict dress code if that matters to you. East Stroudsburg South high is a US News ranked school and the dress code is no jeans or sweats, shirts must be school or college related or collared.    I don't know... It sticks our from the body, maybe it could get cold like hands and feet often do.   What if it's on your mons?   The only song post Folie a Deux is Young Volcanos and it doesn't even sound like them.   Since gay marriage devalues marriage, more women will be unmarried. Unmarried women have more abortions than married women.   Though, you actually have to buy into the idea that same sex marriage devalues marriage as a whole. Makes sense, huh?   Oh god that sounds awful lol. I prefer glass and the harder the better so that sounds boring and I also like cold toys, not warm.   The goal isn't to orgasm as quickly as possible. The goal is to have fun.  Especially true on the bus.   Not a virgin but a lesbian; how does dick feel compared to dildos?   Go for stroudsburg or east stroudsburg. Better schools and civilization. They call pleasant valley high school pregnant valley for a reason. West is outright ghetto and Pocono mountain east is just high class ghetto.    /r/randomactsofpizza /r/assistance should be able to hook you up with some food.   Protip: cut onions in the kitchen, not on the Reddit.   From experience, marriage doesn't fix the problem. You have to know that it's not going to get better just because you said "I do." Work on your relationship. If you love her, it's worth fixing. Don't be afraid to try counselling.    I don't know if you guys are at a level for marriage talk, but something that has helped open My wife's eyes is to point out that, in wedding vows, you say "to have and to hold" which means "I promise you sex and cuddles". I give her as much of the hold part as she wants, so she needs to do some of the have part.   Also, you need to find out why she hates going down on you. If it's uncomfortable, consider getting throat numbing spray. If it's a trigger to a past abuse, find out how to get around that trigger. It's her fault she isn't keeping up her end of the relationship, but it's a partnership and if you help her it'll be easier.   I know you aren't quite to that point yet, but check out /r/deadbedrooms. It helped me a lot in figuring out how to deal with this. Some people there like myself are trying to prevent a dead bedroom, others have been in one for ten or more years.   I wish you luck in talking to your girlfriend and don't ever feel guilty for wanting to have sex with her. You love her and that's a great way to show it, but also don't intentionally make her feel guilty for not wanting to, it's her body and she gets to make the decisions on what she does with it.   We communicate on it regularly. She has extremely low libido and doesn't like to be pressured at all. We have talked outside the bedroom about the issue and I have given up on trying to initiate. When I do, she cries and then I have to comfort her and then we go to sleep. I love her, don't get me wrong, but if I had known this would happen at 6 months in, I would have either addressed the issue or gotten out.   I'm not trying to judge you, but you said that in two other relationships you miscarried. That means this is the third relationship you are trying to have a baby in. You referred to your SO as your girlfriend, not wife or partner or fiance. Before you do this, please make sure you are certain about this relationship. Its not fair to the kid If you aren't.   Been with my wife 4.5 years, married 4.5 months. In my experience, it won't change. I love going down on her but she does it for me maybe half as much and almost never gets me off that way. Before we got married, we had sex about twice a week, sometimes more, and after we got married, we had sex like 15 times the first week and now we haven't had sex in two and a half weeks. Prior to this it was about every other week but apparently is become even less often.   What I'm saying is that you can still get pregnant from anal. It does mean condoms if you don't want babies.   Everything is really close and drippy.    My wife and I are married. We both are working on getting our degrees. She works full time and I'm taking time off to cope with my depression. I graduated high school a year early. I worked for a year and a half as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. I take care of my physically disabled mother.   Four days ago, my wife's sister had a son. She is 19, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, has no life plans and has cut the baby's father out of his child's life. She lives with her father because he will pay for everything since it's a boy.   I want a baby more than anything. So does my wife. We don't get to have one because we aren't "stable" enough but this stupid kid and plenty of other stupid kids do. Its bullshit.   But it should be. Where my SimCity3000 Unlimited trolls at?!      More so having the wrong kind if friends.   If you rented the place with a washer and it no longer has one, you pay less in rent. Call the landlord and find out if he agrees that 50 or 100 a month less is fair. The washer will be replaced by Tuesday.   I don't think time travel is possible. If it were, the technology would have always existed, as it would have been brought back.   I've tried to look at stuff about quantum physics and string theory and whatnot and it all gets mixed up in my head and I have to read it at like a first grade level. I'm not really good at science type stuff.   Oh my god, nobody here is being racist you stupid nigger.   Gilded.      This is a part of it, too!    Not sure if human or robot...   Talk about a baby boom.   Maybe in Finland shelters only have mutts but plenty of American shelters have more pure bred dogs. The three shelters nearest me have about 80% pit bulls, 10% other pure and 10% mutts. If your theory were true, fewer shelters would be needed because more people would want the mutts.    Most divorces are not first marriages. Your stat on women initiating makes me think you have personal trust issues. I hope you can sort it out.    One generation of inbreeding does not equal many generations of inbreeding. Most people also don't just pick up a mutt from a random farm.    I take some comfort in "knowing" that somewhere, sometime, I'm still with My grandmother. I also think that everything happens simultaneously and repeats simultaneously.   I'm assuming that your concern with fairness is same sex marriage. I'm a married gay person, in part because my wife's family wouldn't let me see her or make decisions if she were hospitalized. Consider that if your girlfriend is your son's other "parent", marriage may help in a lot of ways legally. Just make sure your protect your family.   Lol totes fuck poor people!   Nope but plenty of racism from you.   I know you tagged /s but there are a lot of reasons this is an awful idea.   For one, I know I have gotten up to get a drink and left my player fishing or whatever. Secondly, I like to play with my shirt off sometimes. I'm female. I don't want this being viewed. Third, not everyone has a webcam. Fourth, they would lose a lot of players who refuse to allow that sort of spying.    Guys, don't just downvote, explain why he's wrong.  That is extremely unlikely to the point of being almost impossible. Selective breeding is often inbreeding. This passes recessive traits along instead of letting dominant, better traits show. It is extremely unlikely that very many recessive will show. Do a little research on genetics. Start with basic 8th grade Punnet Square type stuff and see if it helps you understand a bit better.    There are zillions of alternate timelines. Every single decision sparks a new one. There is a timeline somewhere in which my cousin wasn't killed in a drunk driving accident because she made a decision not to get in the car. There is a timeline somewhere in which I got sprite instead of lemonade at Wendy's and it took less time so my car got hit on the way out.   More tinfoil-ish; everyone but me is a robot and I am the only remaining human.   Woah woah woah. Let's not get carried away. Manual as an option.   Damn... Well I hope it was worth the buy for you anyway!   Serious question; are you a lesbian? If so, is it really worth the buy?   I have camped my whole life, though we had a pop up when I was a kid. It didn't have a bathroom or a kitchen big enough to actually use, though, so it wasn't a big step up. My wife and I are looking forward to camping this summer and we have a tent. It's just the two of us and perhaps guests periodically. We live in the Poconos and will be camping in local Outdoor World campgrounds with full facilities for bathrooms and showers. What should I know about tent camping?      I don't think you have a very good understanding of how elections work. No, the only two choices aren't great. However, it's pretty useless to invite the one who will do the most bad to sit down to dinner by default. I'm a liberal and a married gay woman. If we get the wrong republican in office in 2016, I run the risk of my marriage being called invalid and having businesses be legally permitted to  discriminate against me. We all run the risk of bathroom bans for trans people, no more healthcare for everyone, and supreme court judges being appointed that will ensure that that remains for a long time. By voting for a third party you are basically saying "eh, fuck it. Who cares what happens to the country?" you aren't actually taking a stance, you are simply throwing a fit and not contributing.    Except by voting third party, you take a bit from a candidate with actual potential to win and do good and throw it in the dirt.   This is a reaction to have if OP asks and she says no. To start here is a bit counterintuitive. You aren't totally wrong, just a little trigger happy.   Mom?   Probably hamstering, amirite, Eltek?   You aren't a dumbass. We all know that your respect for him isn't why you said it. You said it because it's hilarious.  What's black and sits at the top of the stairs?  Stephen Hawking after a house fire.   Do fuck with the babysitter.   Gilmore Girls?   payed    /r/actuallesbians  /r/dykesgonemild  /r/lesbianfashionadvice  /r/boifashionadvice   Not my opinion, just the reason. Cis people are *real* men or women and just man or woman is enough, since trans people are fake versions.   Having babies doesn't stretch a woman out, yo.   She was a bit too abrasive about it. Her intention was probably not to hurt you just more to say that she doesn't want to be badgered not to after her sister just badgered her into it.   You are a bit wrong. If we assume mom is heterozygous A, meaning genotype AO and dad is heterozygous B, meaning genotype BO, then kids can be AO, meaning type A, BO, meaning type B, AB, meaning type AB, or OO, meaning type O. A and B are codominant. If you have both, both will present. O is recessive. If you have one O and one of either A or B, the other will present. If you have two Os, you will be O. Understand or should I clarify?   I just talked to my wife about this and we are both in agreement that it's not really OPs choice here at all.   In an experiment with fruit flies, a previous partner's sperm could alter the genetics of a child. TweRPs believe people are equal to fruit flies. It's bad anatomy.   /u/miss_clarity was really just being nice and trying to offer more info to OP. She didn't come flipping out that he was a dick for not using that phrase. Not everyone needs to be politically incorrect all the time, either.   I'm 20. I have twin 15 year old sister in laws. They are the age I was when I lost my virginity to their sister. It's horrifying to me that they could be having sex. They're still little kids.   Being an SJW is nothing to be ashamed of, despite Reddit making it a dirty word.    Mensrights would be for me.    There really isn't, though. With the blessing you may defy his wishes anyway, but you are still asking if it's okay by him, when really it only matters if it's okay with the woman you are intending to marry.   My brother and I would "save our farts up" for until we could fart in the bath or pool and make bubbles. Obviously it didn't work. We would also pick each other's noses and feed it to each other and we would put our cheeks together and wiggle our tongues, basically making out without touching tongues or lips.   Well to be fair that tradition kind of says that the woman is "owned" by her father and, if he agrees to it, then "owned" by her husband. Literally all that's missing is a thousand bucks and a goat for the trade.   "M-marriage, sir?"   My mother in law was pregnant with triplet girls and one of them was miscarried. During the c section she had her tubes tied. 15 months later she gave birth to another girl.   You're not supposed to think anything. The person I initially replied to was asking for stories of weird coincidence surrounding miscarriage. I provided that.   No, it doesn't. The baby had no heartbeat. It died.   The baby didn't have a heartbeat. The baby died.   Oct/Nov 2007 - Brother and sister in law get pregnant.  Nov 4 2007 - cousin dies  Nov funeral - b and sil tell family privately that they are pregnant  Mid Nov - baby dies; no heartbeat, sil has fetus removed medically.  Feb 2008 - sil gets pregnant again  Nov 4 2008 - nephew is born   I live in the Poconos. It's red neck central up here.   The first baby died really early on. It was extremely traumatic for my sister in law. She had to have a D E (basically an abortion since the baby wasn't viable) and was really torn up about it.   My cousin died on November 4, 2007. At her funeral, my brother and sister in law told us that they were pregnant. The baby didn't have a heartbeat when they went for the appointment. On November 4, 2008, they had their son.  Edit: since reddittors can't read, having no heartbeat means the baby died.   I speculate that people don't recognize until that point. My mom has it and has had symptoms since childhood, including visible ones like dark skin, and it wasn't picked up on until her brother started having issues when she was in her thirties. Since my mom has it, noticing it for me was much easier. I started having trouble with iron when I was 17. It's possible that my experience is just extremely rare, but I think more research needs to be done.   I buy men's. I'm nonbinary and if I want to pack they provide the space but once I got used to wearing them I don't even notice that there is so much extra.   Boxer briefs from Aeropostale are my go to. So comfy and they fit me well.   I know a lot of you don't share underwear but my wife and I do. It just makes times like this one easier. Typically she runs out first and uses mine. However, I stupidly procrastinated forever on laundry and these suck. Whenever I do this, I remember why I switched in the first place.   It relates to red blood cells which women have less of naturally and they lose some more with menstruation. Just a quick Google search for that, though. Men are also more likely to have hemochromotosis than women.   You realize that, from the title, we can only really infer that OP had sex twice in ten months, right? If that's a lot to you, go to /r/deadbedrooms.   I had '89 740GL that I paid 275 for in 2013 last me six months and then a '97 850 cost 800 that ran great until it got hit last month and was totalled. I love Volvos.   They also let your child stay with you.   One person can love a nonbiological child, the other can't. It's not really that complicated.   It's not cheap for lesbians. It can take multiple cycles and sperm isn't exactly cheap either. There are better success rates if you have a doctor inseminate and better yet with ivf, all of which costs money. Someone else's struggle isn't any less real because yours is worse.   No, it's not. Not everyone has the capacity to love an adopted child the same way. It's better if those people are honest and don't adopt.   Not dead, but sick.  My grandfather was an alcoholic so my mom has avoided drinking for her whole life. In my 20 years I have seen her drink three times, each time was one glass at a wedding. On Valentine's Day she was diagnosed with cirrhosis.   We love you, too, ANUS_POKER.   A lot of people don't know the difference between the two terms. Most people who say conception is the start of life mean that fertilization is.   Fertilization - sperm enters egg.  Conception - fertilized egg attaches to uterine lining.   I hate getting in but then I hate to get out.    That's a bit different; you initially left out the ADD.   Kit Kat bar!   I took care of us and she took care of the chores.  I'm going to just let you think about that statement.    Even if not exact it should be similar. Thanks for sharing!   Huh. I saw a chiropractor for six months and am still in pain since they are huge. I need to get this shit written down.   So you're one of those "I make more money and change the oil so you can do the lowly chores that I deem myself too good for" types.   The point is that, as a member of the household/family unit, he should do it on his own and not need coaching like a child.  	136
 Well I should specify that by "like these" I mean articles that are about sharing experiences from people who are from oppressed groups about their experiences in order to promote better understanding about their group, or articles people write to clear up common misconceptions perpetuated by the media about certain groups. Here's some other ones that I thought were pretty good:  * [5 Things Movies Don't Tell You About Mental Institutions](http://www.cracked.com/article_20897_5-things-movies-dont-tell-you-about-mental-institutions.html) * [7 Things No One Tells You About Being Homeless](http://www.cracked.com/article_20720_7-things-no-one-tells-you-about-being-homeless.html) * [Mathematical Proof That The Media Is Sexist And Bad At Math](http://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/mathematical-proof-that-media-sexist-bad-at-math/)   I have no idea why your gyno would say that. Yeah, using speculums and getting pap smears can be a little uncomfortable, but putting in tampons should never be painful. You need another doctor who will actually listen to you. I would suggest asking friends or family about who they see, maybe they can give you some good recommendations?   [Spoilers ADWD] (/s "Stannis' men probably ate it on the way to Winterfell.")   The first time I did it I think it took me like 6 or so hours? I was so frustrated, ended up looking for a guide, too. Really that level has absolutely no flow and gives you barely any cues about where you should be going or what you should be doing and when. Just poorly designed in general.   So it was over modding practices? Ok, I see why that could be a problem. I don't really want to open old wounds either so we can just leave it at that.   I'm glad that Cracked has started publishing a lot more articles like these. Unfortunately there are still more than a few not-so-nice comments, but not nearly as bad as I was expecting. Tried to correct a few people who were very adamant about how your DNA should dictate which bathroom to use because otherwise it's not fair to the cis people, but not sure if the effort was worth it.   Or you could, you know, just stop assuming people's sex based on their gender presentation.   A little off topic, but what exactly was the whole schism between /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow about anyway? I didn't start redditing until a little while after, so I keep seeing people mentioning it but I really don't get it since as they are now the two subs seem pretty similar to me.   Seriously. The only thing that could make that situation worse would be if the manager was also shitty about it.   Being open certainly makes my relationship with my SO easier. I'm asexual, he's straight, so if he can get sex somewhere else it really takes a lot of pressure off of me.   I've been pretty stressed out lately. In the short term, I just got back from spring break but my professors scheduled two exams and a paper to be due right afterward, which to me seems silly because the whole point of a spring break is that *you are taking a break from school,* not "oh you have so much more free time to study now so giving you twice the usually amount of work shouldn't be a problem, right??" Ugh.  Of course, I'm also having long-term problems because right now I don't have an actual job job so much as a I sell things on Etsy occasionally job, but our lease runs up in May and my roommates and I will be hard-pressed to make the money last long enough to make down payments and our new rent throughout the rest of the summer, even if I do get a real job. I just feel like time is constantly running out for me and it's really wearing me down.  Honestly, on days like today I sometimes wish that I could just quit school and work full time doing costumes and props and stuff and have that actually be a viable financial option, but it's not so I just have to tough it out.   I think that is probably the key. Sure, everything should be able to have jokes made about it, but whether you personally are knowledgeable enough about something to make an intelligent joke that gets everyone to laugh at it is a completely separate matter.  For instance, a lot of people get up in arms about rape jokes (and apologists for the comedians who make them). And for good reason - a lot of the jokes made are by male comics who have never been threatened with sexual violence. In their ignorance, their "jokes" merely perpetuate casual sexism. But then there are also quite a few well-made jokes about sexual assault done by female comedians that address the issue in a way that doesn't make anyone feel icky or guilty for laughing at it. One of my favorites is probably [this one](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=video cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CDMQtwIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJv5pjSRSLGQ ei=6CopU5HrBKKT0QGjnoCYBw usg=AFQjCNEL8ux845yL89JRK5UGUmXXFRdkwQ sig2=_usgXErvnWnZKN3c_iec1Q bvm=bv.62922401,d.dmQ) by Wanda Sykes.  So yeah, no one should be excluded from humor. But how you frame the joke and the person who is telling it also matters.   Well, I don't know about that - there are some people who are paralyzed and lose use of their legs but retain their sexual capacity. We have no way of really knowing though, since I don't think Bran has really gone fully through puberty yet if at all ...   /internet hugs/ I know the feeling. I'm glad your SO's family is so supportive and nice!   At the Chinese food place by my university campus I'm the "sweet and sour chicken with sauce on the side, white rice, and a coke."   Wow. What a pig. I hope he chokes on his chocolate.   I don't normally tell people what to do in their relationships, just offer options or say "well this is what I would do if I were in the same situation." However, in this case I will make an exception.  You should probably leave him. Sooner, not later.  You should definitely go see a doctor, and I would also file a police report (of course, if you go to the E.R. and it's bad enough the doctors will call the cops). Seriously, that sort of behavior is not at all okay. Not only was he being incredibly rude, but he assaulted you and in typical abuser fashion later decided to both apologize and try and shift the blame onto you. Don't fall for it. You are not at fault here, he is definitely in the wrong. He has no right to your property, nor does he have a right to throw things at you or hit your or kick you, and he definitely doesn't have the right to try to keep you from leaving. That's at least three different criminal charges. Do not take this lightly. You're not overreacting for being scared or confused. What he did was wrong, you were in an awful situation, and there are a lot of potential problems facing you in the future.  As other comments suggested I would also recommend seeking legal advice to see about separating your name from all the stuff you cosigned with him. At this point I wouldn't even consider the possibility that this is a one-time thing and you might be able to "work things out," this sort of behavior is toxic as fuck and I don't think I've ever heard of someone doing this sort of thing only once.  And again, I have to emphasize that you should report this to the police as soon as possible. Having the assault on record would certainly help matters whenever you try to separate your assets, also if you do turn out to be pregnant it will be important in determining custody.  I'm so sorry that you had to go through this, I really hope that you are able to sort things out and he never hurts you like that again. Just remember, your safety is the priority here - you shouldn't feel guilty about taking legal action against him.   It helps if you play something so completely different that you don't even compare it to Bioware stuff. For instance, I'm really into the Etrian Odyssey series. Not much in the way of plot, the main drive to play is the challenge and the mechanics. It's a test of your strategic skills. So naturally I classify it in a totally different category than DA:O which is more narrative-heavy.   Yes, especially if you can get the Ultimate edition. The DLC is a lot of fun. Although the Mage's Circle quest is pretty much the bane of the fandom, the rest of the game is definitely enjoyable. Also, the potential party members are all rather varied and pretty interesting and/or funny. I would certainly recommend it. Not my favorite game, but certainly up there when it comes to medieval fantasy RPG.   Yeah! More PSP VNs would be fantastic, especially otome games!   The last game I spent a lot of time playing with my SO was Rayman Legends. We both enjoy platformers a lot, finally beat all the main levels and started on the back to origins levels.   Video games. I still haven't finished (or even started) so many of the games that have come out over the past year, but I keep buying them because I know I definitely want to play them at some point (most likely whenever I go on break from school).   Because horn that is obviously old and magical, would be my guess. I entertained the idea myself, I will admit. Not really sold on it, though.   Also, his injury kind of leaves Bran in a bad position when it comes to inheriting his lordship/kingship/whatever title the Starks eventually get. It's not impossible for him to come back and rule, and there are plenty of other examples of lords who aren't very physically strong for whatever reason (Doran Martell, for instance). However, I don't think ruling would ever appeal to Brandon, and even if he did return to Winterfell he would likely give up his title and pass it to Rickon anyway.   I dunno, I feel like after reading ADWD his identity is much less built around being Ned Stark's son and more associated with his identity as a Brother. After all, he still has a lot of resentment toward the Stark family; as with Theon, he was never truly one of them, no matter how much he wanted to be. And any time he questions himself, he always reminds himself of his vows. The Wall is his anchor now, not Ned.  Also, regardless of what name he decides to take, I'm pretty sure he'll always be "Lord Snow."   The only contention I have with this is that Arya doesn't kill completely without remorse. Especially with her earlier killings, she expressed shock but dealt with it because if she hadn't killed someone she would have died herself. She also expressed worry whenever the Hound was bringing her to what would be the Red Wedding that after learning about all the things she did Catelyn and Robb wouldn't love her anymore. I'd say that's not killing "without a hint of remorse." She is definitely burdened. But she moves on and deals with it. I think the turning point is probably after the Red Wedding. For all she knows her entire family is dead, so she wanders around lost for a while, but becoming a faceless man is her way of building resolve. She's learning to accept death and starting to develop a new world view - although her vendetta against the people who have wronged her certainly hasn't gone away.   Yeah, actually, I have two or three times. It's not very frequent, and usually the dreams are pretty awkward. Most of the time the stuff I dream about is not at all realistic so I usually wake up going "well, that would never happen!" and laugh it off.   You need to have a frank, honest discussion with your friend. To be honest, even if she is bi, if she told you she's freaked out by penises you should probably stop pursuing any sort of physical relationship with her. Clearly, she is uncomfortable with it on some level, and while she doesn't seem to have a problem with other physical contact such as kissing she seems to realize you are attracted to her. If you want to put her at ease, talk to her about this.  If you really value her friendship, then show her that. Talk to her as a friend. Just tell her you want to clarify how things stand between the two of you. She's probably nervous about this and is afraid of confronting you. Show her that you won't freak out or get super angry or stop being her friend just because she doesn't want to have sex or anything like that. Just ask her to explain how she feels about you so that there are no more misunderstandings and you can both move on with less trepidation. Ask her about boundaries. What sorts of things are okay? What kind of contact is she comfortable with? If you establish boundaries and follow them, that will help put her at ease and build trust between the two of you, which is really important if you want to continue your friendship.  Hope this helps, good luck.    This isn't about asexuality, though  Problem is, asexual people are often treated pretty badly for not wanting sex, the same way that people will harass those who choose to be abstinent before marriage for whatever reason. I am 99% certain that if the post in AA had said that OP's partner didn't want to have sex because they were asexual, the comments would have gotten much worse than they already were.   I would suggest you have a conversation about this sooner rather than later. I'm sure that if you bring it up he'd be happy to talk about it, especially if you show how supportive you are. Just shoot him a text or give him a call and say you'd like to get together and talk about it sometime, maybe discuss it over lunch or something. It's not exactly something that should be kept private (at least from partners), so you shouldn't feel afraid to bring it up. Are you just nervous or embarrassed? That's okay, don't worry about it! It's important for people to share this kind of info with their partners, and afterward you'll probably feel closer than you did before. I'm sure he'll appreciate your candor and the fact that you're so open to an important part of his self.   I've only had one - same one, started off as high school sweethearts and now we've been together for 5 and a half years.   I think you win this subreddit. Probably the only time I have actually declared "WTF?" after viewing one of these images.   My only complaint was the font color. I guess OP went with red to fit the whole murder theme, but it would have looked better in white imho.   Well I'm not really sure why translation is an issue here, but whatever.  Yes, it is true that there are obviously going to be some changes during the localization process for any medium that crosses languages and cultures. Not everything can be translated perfectly from Japanese to English, and some cultural context is always lost. The best thing we can do in these situations is to find a decent cultural analogue for the new version.  However, I would argue that while some dialogue changes are to be expected and some minor changes are acceptable, but changing the core part of a character is not. Especially if you're doing it at the expense of a marginalized community.   Yes, it does happen. You're right.  However, I think it should also be acknowledged that as the character was originally intended to be ambiguous, it's a little alarming that they are being progressively feminized with each new iteration. At first there was no indication of Hanji's gender. Then the Japanese anime started using female pronouns. Now the English dub is using a stereotypically feminine voice. If the character looks feminine, sounds feminine, and is referred to as feminine, they can no longer be called gender ambiguous - Hanji is now being portrayed as female.  And as a person who also sounds naturally feminine but is more androgynous, this is kind of disturbing to me. They're taking a character that lots of marginalized folks could really relate to and are now warping them into just another average woman. Not that having woman characters is bad, it just sucks that they're taking away literally the ONE CHARACTER that people who don't fall neatly into "male" or "female" can be represented by.   I have no idea how this comment is even relevant.   Yes, but the author also said that they weren't supposed to actually confirm whether Hanji was male or female. To quote the people [translating the manga](http://kodanshacomics.tumblr.com/post/73207971230/hello-i-wanted-to-ask-you-guys-a-question-about-attack):  Isayama has confirmed that were not allowed to confirm Hanges gender. He has instructed us to avoid gendered pronouns when referring to Hange, or at least to use he AND she with equal frequency.  In other words, Hanji is NOT supposed to be a "she," Hanji could be a "he" or a "she" or neither, this is intentionally ambiguous, and to deliberately use an obviously feminine voice is misrepresenting the character as that defeats the whole purpose of gender ambiguity.   Well I can't definitively tell you because I'm not the writer, but the implication is that Hanji is not male or female but rather gender neutral. How it might be important to the plot or character I can't say because again, I'm not the one writing it. Maybe the author just felt like having a nonbinary person in their comic. And it certainly can work in English, although it is slightly more difficult to do than in Japanese it is possible. There are ways to write around it, the easiest to just refer to Hanji as "they" instead of "he" or "she."   I would say that the Japanese voice actor didn't sound as feminine. Slightly, but the English actor seemed much more so. At least to me. Anyway, the point is Hanji is meant to be more ambiguous, and even the Japanese anime messed that up a little - they used female pronouns when the original creator intentionally left out gendered pronouns.   Except that Hanji is supposed to be nonbinary, and they make them sound WAAAAY too feminine. So no, actually, they picked wrong on this one.   Ah, yes, because if we just ignore all the shitty people in our lives then they will all go away and everything will be happy sunshine and rainbows!!   My relationship is really similar in a lot of ways. I'm a female panromantic asexual dating a straight male. I'm not really that into sex, at all, but we still have it fairly regularly (few times a month usually). I'm generally sex-neutral, and although I don't get a lot of personal fulfillment from it, I still enjoy it on an emotional level. I view sex with my SO not as a chore to make him happy, but as something we do together as a couple - just like going to the movies or snuggling on the couch watching Netflix. I enjoy it because I'm sharing something with him.  However, it's still not as often as he would probably like, if he were to have sex as often as he wanted. And I do sometimes struggle with feeling guilty that I can't fulfill all his needs. But the important part is that we love each other, even if we aren't entirely sexually compatible. He doesn't mind that we don't have sex too often, because to him making me happy is more important than him getting off. He's never pressured me to do anything I don't want to do, and I appreciate him for it. I feel like this attitude is really necessary if you're going to have a relationship with an asexual person and you're not asexual yourself.  Obviously you recognize the importance of communication in such a relationship (although communication is important in any relationship). My biggest advice to you is just to be honest, about everything. Even if you're feeling something selfish, even if you think it might hurt your partner's feelings, you need to be honest with her, and she needs to be similarly honest with you. Don't try to hold things in for your partner's benefit; that can lead to resentment, which can easily kill a relationship. It's better to tell your partner even about the less desirable or convenient thoughts and feelings you have, so that both of you can work out how to deal with them together.   Honestly, if you don't feel the burning need to come out and you feel like it's wasted effort since you won't see most of those people again, then you shouldn't have to come out. Coming out is an incredibly personal decision to make. You shouldn't let what anyone else thinks influence that choice too much, because you are the one who has to face the potential consequences of coming out. If I were you, I would weigh the pros and cons of doing it. If you feel like there's not a lot of risk in coming out (which it sounds like you have a lot of support already from loved ones, so that helps), it's worth considering. However, if you don't feel like there is any benefit, or the risks outweigh that benefit, then you don't have to force it.  I understand how you feel about letting people believe you're something you're not. If you don't come out, you can feel sort of dishonest or awkward, especially when people make assumptions about you that aren't true. However, at the same time you have to remember that the assumptions people make abut you aren't your fault. Our heteronormative society is to blame here, not you.  To sum all this up, I guess I should just say that you shouldn't have to feel ashamed of who you are and everyone should be able to live freely as themselves. But you also shouldn't feel guilty if you choose not to share that part of yourself. At the end of the day, who you love is your business, not anyone else's.   Yeah, I took that test. I score somewhat toward masculine but mostly in the middle for masculine, feminine, and androgynous. Pretty much lines up with what I identify as; female sex but gender nonconforming. It's interesting because a lot of cis people never question their identities, despite the fact that nobody fits 100% into only one category. But then a lot of people turn around and judge trans* people so harshly because they don't fit 100% into a given category either ... seems rather hypocritical to me. Honestly, I think that gender doesn't dictate your personality and is totally irrelevant to what you want to do with your life. You just identify with what feels right. Why is society so hung up on all these silly details? Why can't we all just be what we are and enjoy the things we enjoy? /shrugs/   Bi erasure is super shitty. As someone who is panromantic and in an opposite-sex relationship, I feel that pain.   Nope. I don't want my own kids, I'd rather adopt if anything. Plus, if either party changes their mind vasectomies are reversible.   Yeah. His family has all sorts of crazy drama and despite the fact we've been together for over 5 years, I still don't know half their names. Fortunately we only see them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the occasional wedding/funeral. So it's not so bad.  At the very least, I feel relatively okay with his dad and brother, just not his mom or extended family.   So ... take tampons with you when you go hunting?   I've never cheated, although I'm asexual and in a poly relationship so not only is there no desire to cheat I also don't have to regardless.  I have been cheated on, though.  Edit: I'm 21, forgot to add that.   NOPE I was definitely not encouraged.  I remember one of my earliest gaming experiences was playing Pacman with my stepdad on an arcade table at our local pizzeria when I was six. We played once or twice, but I found out from that how much he loved Pacman (he was pretty good at it too). It's what got me interested; it was something to do, and clearly it had impacted my parental figure, so I was intrigued.  However, my mom was really against me and my brother having video games when we were little for typical mom reasons (they'll rot your brain, playing outside is better for you, go read a book, etc.). We didn't have any game systems until I was 12 or 13 I think? We got a Gamecube from my grandma for Christmas. Mom wasn't happy about it, but too late.  It was soon afterward that my younger brother started dominating the game system. Whenever we played we were limited to an hour a day, but lil bro was always spoiled; when I was reaching my hour limit, he would constantly pester me (even if I had plenty of time left) and sometimes even told my parents I was playing over my time and they would make me get off. However, whenever he played it was "just one more level ..." until he'd been playing all afternoon into the evening and wouldn't even come down to eat when we called him for dinner.  On top of this, despite putting "I want a Gameboy" or one or two games after we got the Gamecube on my birthday and Christmas wish lists every year, I got tons of gift cards to bookstores while my brother got nearly every game he wanted (this was mostly grandparents' doing). Every time my brother wanted a new game they took him to the game store; despite repeated requests to go along or to be taken at some point they never found time to take me or ask me before taking him.  Also, at one point someone opened up a gaming store similar to a net cafe (pay an hourly rate to use their PCs or consoles and have any game from their library type setup) near where we lived. It ended up closing within a year, but despite this my stepdad found time to take my brother there three separate times. They didn't tell me about it until after they got back the first time; I asked to go with next time but they never told me when they were going, I'd always hear about it after the fact. After it closed I expressed regret at never getting to go and my stepdad made some comment about how I never told him I wanted to - I just sat there dumbfounded because *I told you every single time after you went to take me with you next time.*  Even to this day, despite the fact that I am just as much of a gamer as my brother, stepdad's side of the family conveniently forgets this fact and may or may not get me one game while getting a whole stack of games for my brother. At least my mom has accepted my hobby now; she actually consults me whenever purchasing games for my brother because he has behavioral issues and she wants to make sure there's nothing too violent in anything she gets. For instance, she usually outright vetoes anything with guns, but asked me if Assassin's Creed II would be okay Christmas before last. I told her how the ESRB ratings work, and how they usually specify types of material that might be inappropriate for certain audiences (cartoon violence, sex, drugs, etc.); with that knowledge she eventually decided that she wasn't going to get him ACII but that the latest Sonic game would be more than okay.  Of course stepdad's family continues to spoil him and bought him every single other game my mom went out of her way to make sure no one on her side of the family would get him because they were too violent. They basically get him whatever he wants because he's the only boy - they've never shown any sort of spoiling affection toward me, and my little sister (she's the youngest) still doesn't get spoiled hardly at all, especially compared to my brother. It's pretty gross.   As I'm not an expert on locks specifically I'll just speak on cultural appropriation in general.  White people (or any privileged group) appropriating from oppressed ethnic (or other) minorities is shitty because it's basically white people saying "we're going to vilify you for doing this thing, then take that same thing and wear it (badly) as a costume." For instance, the feathered headdress thing - First Nation peoples in the Americas have suffered from genocide ever since Columbus first set foot here. Native peoples have been enslaved, deliberately infected with disease, massacred, forcibly removed from their homes, and robbed of their ancestral lands, languages and cultures. There are still people alive who were taken from their parents on reservations and forced to go to boarding schools or live with white families where they were literally punished for doing anything from their original culture (speaking their language, wearing their traditional clothes, etc.). BUT YET there are plenty of people, white people, who have historically perpetrated this genocide over and over again and who continue to perpetuate systemic racism, who like to dress up like Pocahontas every Halloween or wear headdresses for fun or have offensive caricatures for sports team mascots. You see how this is incredibly problematic, right?  It's the same thing with black culture. Black people were enslaved, brutalized, raped, tortured, and even after slavery was abolished by law they were still exploited in just about any way possible by the white majority in the U.S. Despite all this, they have managed to maintain their own unique cultural identity and have produced many great cultural feats - in music alone you have the origins of Jazz, Swing, Blues, R B, Hip Hop, etc. all from the black community. Despite all sorts of adversity, the black community has developed and continues to develop. But white society vilifies black people for doing these things. If black people wear natural hair or locks, listen to rap, etc. then they're called "ghetto" or "nappy" or "thug." But when a white person does it, they are unique or worldly and people pat them on the back for being so aware of other cultures. Violence against ethnic minorities is still a living reality here and in many other countries around the world. The idea that white people can appropriate from other cultures in this way is completely unjust.  So to address your questions about what we can do about it, one of the reasons why cultural appropriation is so offensive is because white people stealing from ethnic minorities often involves a) stigmatizing the original culture they took it from and b) using whatever they take out of context. The headdress thing is a good example - usually, only leaders who have proven their worth to a community are allowed to wear a headdress in First Nation cultures; the asshat who buys a cheap plastic version at a costume shop and wears it to a party hasn't earned the right to do so. They are wearing it out of context. In other words, they're doing it wrong.  So I wouldn't say that making sure all ethnicities can wear something without stigma is the issue. The real problem is the context of how they wear it. I would personally argue that we shouldn't necessarily bar white people from ever doing any of these things; after all, a little cultural admixture is healthy and often necessary for continued development (example - Chinese plows brought to Europe sparked the agriculture revolution which then fueled the industrial revolution). However, most people I've talked to tend to agree that people should earn the right to borrow whatever it is they're borrowing. If something is merely a cultural fad with no important deeper meaning to a culture, borrow away. But if it has some sort of religious or other cultural significance, treat that with respect. Don't use it if you don't know the story behind it or haven't done what anyone else of that culture has done in order to use it.  Edit: Wow, gold? Seriously? Thank you kind stranger, I never would have expected to get that sort of appreciation.    Yep. I totally agree. I happen to be a woman who cross dresses and likes a lot of "masculine" things, but that doesn't mean I'm any less of a woman than you or anyone else on this planet. You don't have to be masculine to be male, or feminine to be female - in fact, I'd say pretty much everyone has some mix of both kinds of qualities, so even dividing qualities into the "masculine" and "feminine" categories is pretty arbitrary.   Not gonna like, Dr. Girlfriend is my favorite character. Second favorite is a tie between Brock and Dr. Orpheus.   Why would you wanna get rid of that talent? Lol   Not trans, but my roommate and close friend is FTM. He struggles a lot because he isn't stereotypically masculine, and I always that it was really awful. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you have to buy into every gender stereotype there is. It makes me really sad to see people say things to trans people about how they aren't being feminine/masculine enough to pass and that they need to change all these things about themselves to fit into society's gender boxes. That's stupid and shitty. If you like your voice, you shouldn't have to change or "fix" it! Just be you :   Well, there is usually a little bonding between protag and whatever heroine during the sex scenes, but it's not so important that you'll be confused by anything if you skip them.   Most likely. Will doesn't really strike me as the type to just thrash around and throw a tantrum; he thinks things through. I'm sure he's probably biding his time and focusing on doing what little he can, given his incredibly trying situation.   I lean more toward extroversion.   Yeah. I definitely don't want my own kids. But if I were to have kids, I would adopt some older kids from foster care. There are a lot of older kids, especially teens, that are less likely to get adopted and I would rather give one of them a home than have my own baby.   I dunno, I feel like you can only be super angry about something like that for so long. Considering how incredibly intimate and subtle Hannibal's influence over Will is, I think he's probably feeling more disgusted by Hannibal than anything. This man violated his home, his relationships, his body, and his mind. Of course Will would be angry, but I know if I were in his position I would be less likely to react by yelling or physically attacking him and more likely to just want to throw up and go take an acid bath.   It looks sooooo adorable!! I'm a little jealous :   That's only slightly creepy ...   I'm from the Southern U.S., for context.  1) Not very important. Generally, in my group of friends, you are expected to notify everyone else if you start dating someone new, within the first month or so after you start going out with them. We are all free to comment on what we like or dislike about each other's partners, but just because they don't get along with someone doesn't mean I will stop dating them. My friends' approval is appreciated, but not necessary.  2) For the most part, yes. Usually I'm the first person someone asks when they need relationship advice (despite the fact that they all started dating before me). However, it's hard to distance yourself from your own circumstances, so sometimes it's important to get another person's perspective. That's where my friends come in. I ask them how they interpret things to see if I'm totally off base or if I'm being unreasonable about certain things occasionally. Also, if my partner does something that frustrates me or that I don't understand, they can sometimes help me think about it in a different way that clarifies the problem.  3) Yes, definitely. For one thing, there are certain topics we just don't go into detail about when all our male friends/boyfriends are around. But also, if we know they're listening in we sometimes exaggerate our opinions or behavior just to tease them. It's all in good fun.  4) Yes. Most of the friends my SO and I have are mutual friends that we both know. However, there are still several people I hang out with that he doesn't, and he hangs out with people I don't hand out with too. Also, even among our mutual friends, there are several people who are better friends with one of us than the other. Still, when we go on group outings it's expected that I bring my SO along and we all have fun together, unless it's specifically a girls' night.    Every time I hear someone ask a question like this, my knee-jerk response is to ask "why were the Europeans so far behind the Chinese in terms of technology 300 years before that?"   Childcare experts pretty much agree that the best way to get your kid to behave is to put them in time out or take away privileges (i.e. TV time, their favorite toy, etc.) when they do something bad, explain to them that you're giving them time out/taking something away because they broke the rules, and then keeping those rules consistent and always giving them the set punishment whenever they break the rule. As long as the kids know what the rules are and what happens when they break them, and the punishments for those rules are consistently applied, they behave a lot better than if you just yell at them for doing something you don't like.   You do realize that flirting with someone doesn't automatically mean you've signed a legally binding contract with that person that you will have sex? You can say no at any time if you change your mind - anyone who then proceeds to have sex with you regardless is wrong. Drinking and flirting do not explicitly tell someone you want to have sex, it tells them you want to drink and flirt. Telling someone enthusiastically that you want to have sex is the important part.  Also, there are plenty of people who don't say no but are still raped. If you're coerced in anyway or were somehow incapable of giving consent, even if you didn't say no, it is still rape. For example, if a date rapist slips something into a person's drink. Or if they threaten them with a weapon or say they'll attack someone they love unless they agree to sex. Or if they are in an abusive relationship and don't feel safe enough to say no. Or any number of situations.   People who don't have/have never known someone with a severe mental illness.   Wow. A lot of that is seriously unnecessary rudeness. It's like militant atheists who tell anyone who follows a religion that they're "backward" or stupid or whatever. People have different preferences; the whole idea of fighting for queer rights is that EVERYONE should be able to express their gender identity or orientation freely. Of course ces/het people already have that freedom, but that doesn't mean that they're wrong for being the way they are any more than queer people are for being the way they are.  Speaking as a queer/poly woman, I can definitely say that if someone said the same comments to me every time I commented on a man's appearance or something like that I would be pissed. There is no one "right" way to be attracted to people. Saying things like "maybe you do have something correct in you after all" is super fucked up, because that implies that only certain sexualities are "right" and everything else is "wrong." NOPE sorry try again.  As for the whole idea of berating someone for being monogamous, I personally believe that people aren't necessarily monogamous by nature. But just like sexual orientation, that doesn't mean that everyone is a certain way. I have lots of friends who are monogamous and in relationships and they could never imagine themselves living any other way. *And that's fine.* There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to have only one partner, the problems only start when you try to force your viewpoint on other people. Saying that everyone should be poly and that monogamy is unnatural is like saying that everyone has to like Neapolitan ice cream. What if you're fine with just vanilla, or only chocolate? That doesn't make you wrong, or a horrible person. It just means you have different tastes. Just don't try to keep anyone else from having Neapolitan, and everything should be good.   I'm 21 and met my current SO when I had just turned 16. We'll be celebrating our six year anniversary this summer. That's longer than most of my peers have ever been with someone; in fact, I'm friends with a couple that's married in their mid-twenties and we've been together longer than they have.  So yeah, I definitely get how you feel. Sometimes you meet someone and you just know that you want to build a life with them - it doesn't matter how old you are.   Well I hope that I've cleared things up for you.    If you have sex with someone doesn't that mean you physically attracted to them?  Not necessarily, although that is usually the assumption that people make. But in reality, there are any number of reasons people might choose to have sex with someone. Haven't you ever met someone that had sex with another person they aren't particularly attracted to because they just wanted to have sex and the person was available? Or what about sex workers who have sex because someone paid them to? I'm fairly certain that most prostitutes have had at least one client they weren't attracted to in the slightest, but they had sex with them anyway.   MFW I believe you when you say you're British because you said "series" instead of "season"  https://tattoosandtherapy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wasnt-expecting-1.gif?w=640   That's a fair point.   Yes. But at that age, a lot of kids don't even know what sex is, they just talk about holding hands or kissing, which is still a physical act even if most people associate it more with romance.  Anyway, there are different types of asexuality. The general consensus is that you're asexual if you aren't physically attracted to anyone regardless of their sex or gender. However, asexuals also separately categorize their romantic attraction, or sexes/genders they form emotional attraction to, and they are just as varied as sexual attractions.  In addition, there are also varying degrees of asexuality; there are people who are strictly asexual and never experience physical attraction, people who are allosexual (in otherwords, would identify as straight/gay/bi/pan/whatever), and people who are somewhere in between (demi, asexual-ish, gray-a, etc.).  And asexual people also have varying attitudes on sex; some of them hate or dislike sex and don't want to have it ever, some of them are sex positive and actually have a sex drive that just isn't directed at anything in particular, and some are neutral and don't care either way (I'm one of those).   Then that person would be a trans woman.   Well, basically attributing adjectives to actions is wrong because that's not what those words mean.  * Heterosexual: someone who is physically attracted to someone of the opposite sex/gender * Homosexual: someone who is physically attracted to someone of the same sex/gender * Bisexual: someone who is physically attracted to two sexes/genders * Pansexual: someone who is physically attracted to all sexes/genders * Asexual: someone who isn't physically attracted to any sexes/genders  Nowhere in these definitions does a particular sexual activity come up. It depends entirely upon your attraction. For a different example, how do you know if you are straight or gay if you're still a virgin? Because of who you're attracted to. What about people who are in the closet? Are you less gay because you don't tell people about it or even have an opposite-sex partner? No, this does not change how you feel. There are plenty of people who don't come out until later in life after they've been married and even had kids with someone. Does this mean they aren't really queer? No, it just means that they weren't acting on their preferences.  In that vein, I know that I am asexual because I'm not physically attracted to people. I've had sex before, but the act of sex is not strictly associated with attraction. It can be a way to express attraction to someone, but it does not determine attraction.  Saying that having sex means I can't be asexual is like saying that just because I've tried sushi once, I can only eat Japanese cuisine from now on. For one thing, it makes no logical sense because you're taking one action to its logical extreme. For another, it totally disregards how the person actually feels about what they did. What if I hated the sushi? What if I thought it was okay but didn't particularly feel the need to eat it ever again? Eating sushi once doesn't make me a sushi lover. Just like sexual experience doesn't dictate your identity.   I've pretty much known I was asexual since I was about eight or nine years old, because that was the time that all of my peers suddenly started gaining interest in romantic stuff and a lot of them had crushes, but I never did. I didn't really have a word to put to that feeling until high school, though.   Is it possible he could have flavored it with her blood serum or something? I don't know that much about brewing or cooking, no idea if this is actually possible, but the thought just occurred to me.   Being on the receiving end of butt sex does not make you gay. Being a dude who is attracted to dudes makes you gay. Actions do not define your identity, your feelings do.  As another example, I'm asexual, but if I have sex with someone that doesn't mean I stop being asexual. It just means I've had sex.   Actually KS came out in 2009 ... was translated to Japanese by 2010, at least according to vndb   Not first few, thanks, also yes it is somewhat general but I'm saying that the two games follow a very similar pattern. That's all.   The worst I've ever played? Probably [The Nettestadt Troll](http://www.renai.us/game/nettestadt.shtml). I didn't expect that much since it's one of those free Ren'py games that's essentially the equivalent of a bad fanfic, but this one is especially bad.  For one thing, the art is terrible. All of the women are drawn the same, just with different hair and colors. The backgrounds look like something you'd find in an elementary or middle school art class. It is thoroughly mediocre.  Also, the plot is super contrived and full of holes. It takes places in some random German village in the 1500s-ish. In the beginning the guys that are all your love interests get involved in some sort of uprising against the local lord, then there's a time skip and the village is being terrorized by a troll that threatens them with ... something (to be frank I don't even remember what the threat was). In order to appease the troll, the entire town decides to let the protag get dragged off by him to a cottage in the middle of the woods to be his sex slave. And then suddenly she is his waifu ... it makes absolutely no sense.  But what tops it off is the whole German thing. It's obviously made by someone who doesn't know that much about the German language or culture, because for most of the game there are no indications of such and then occasionally it's like the person who wrote it went "OH CRAP I NEED SOME GERMAN STUFF IN HERE" and it ends up coming off a bit like that scene from Evangelion [where Shinji climbs into Unit 02 with Asuka](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion#Asuka_Strikes.21_.5B1.8.5D). I think the kicker was when the troll is trying to seduce the protag and he asks her, "if I were a bratwurst, would you be my bun?"  At that point I about died laughing. It was pretty bad.   Ah, so there was some influence. I never saw any articles or anything from the devs of either game, so I was wondering about that. Perhaps I should do a google search and see if I can find some interviews with the Grisaia devs about it.   I know Yumiko's route did that, can't say for Makina as I haven't played it yet.   I won't lie, I really liked doomfest's art. I think it fit perfectly with the overall tone and theme of the game. That said, I also recognize the difficulties involved as an artist trying to adapt to another artist's style that is very different from your own. I think that considering the circumstances, you did a pretty good job, and I know that you will do your best to improve and make the art for this game to the best of your ability. So don't stress the community reaction too much, just work hard on making a good game that you can be proud of.   That looks so great so far! I'm really excited to see how it turns out :D   I already have resources for most of that, except for statistics/academic research (I need more) and famous people.  I don't know that surveying before I start will be helpful, at least at this point, because like I said in another comment I don't know how much time I have to present yet. We have the option to work by ourselves or in groups, so the time given will depend on how many groups there are.  I definitely plan on making a post with a general outline for my presentation before I give it, though. For the most part I'll probably be working from my own experience but I know that I'm representing the entire ace community as well and I want to a good job for everyone. So there will definitely be a chance for community input later on down the line.  As far as the questions, I've been asked a lot of weird things and I'm pretty well practiced at explaining this to people, so I imagine that part won't be an issue.  Thank you for all your suggestions and support :)   Thank you :D   LE GASP~~~ I don't believe it!!   Huh. Never knew Yahtzee wasn't into sex.    Lol I get mistaken for a man all the time on reddit ^I ^^wonder ^^^why   Yes. This happened to me quite frequently in high school, since I cut my hair super short and I dress androgynously. Then in college I got bigger boobs so it doesn't happen as often but I still make people wonder occasionally.  It doesn't really bother me. I like to cross-dress, so looking like a man is sorta the point.   According to the anthropology field, knitting is classified as a folk art and it totally a valid art form. But that "folk" part is probably the reason why most people don't recognize it as such - because it's not formally taught, people assume it isn't "real" art.  Next time someone says something about handcrafts not being art, you should tell them about the [Gee's Bend quilts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quilts_of_Gees_Bend).      Well like I said, it isn't entirely up to me - I don't know if there are any rules against it with the university (although I would assume not), and since I know I'll be fielding questions from people I don't want to record anyone without their permission, even if they will just be talking from off-camera. But assuming that those aren't issues, I know that I can rent a camera from our university's library so I probably will record it.   Aw, thanks! :   Thanks! I'm also thinking about recording it and posting the video online as well. Haven't decided yet, I'd probably have to get my professors' (and classmates') permission first.   That's a pretty good gif for how I feel right now xD   Oh, I had seen it but I totally forgot about it! Thanks for the link (and for reminding me) :D   Indeed! But I have no idea how much I'll include yet, since we have the option of working alone or in groups and the amount of time we're given for our presentation will depend largely on how many groups there are.   That's not a bad analogy, actually. I usually use types of food, since everyone can generally relate to food.   Yeah, I think that's pretty awesome that they added new gender categories.   I wouldn't say that everyone's SO needs to be their best friend too. After all, some people (myself included) need our own space and friendships apart from our SOs so we don't feel like we're becoming the same person.  However, my SO is definitely one of the closest friends I have, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing :   I actually thought he did a really good job of staying in character and not being a total idiot about it. Also, by feigning (?) ignorance, it keeps the dialogue going and a lot of people who watch his show and know nothing about trans* issues probably learned something.   I already posted about this in another sub, but I just wanted to share with you guys since everyone here is super supportive and awesome!  I'm a university student, and this semester I'm taking a communications seminar focusing on TED Talks ). We started discussing possibilities for final projects yesterday, and we have a lot of freedom with topics how we format our presentation.  The whole theme of TED is spreading "ideas worth sharing", and one of the biggest things I think is worth sharing is my identity - asexuality. I decided I wanted to do my own TED Talk for my final project focusing on asexuality: what it is, coming out, discrimination, etc. I brought up the idea to one of my professors (there's two for the class) and I was a little nervous about it since I don't usually come out to people in classes. But not only did she already know about asexuality (huzzah for getting to skip the lengthy explanation!) but she also immediately got really excited. She thought my topic was a great idea and really encouraged me to go for it.  I've gotta say, I'm not used to this sort of treatment when coming out to people. I've dealt with a lot of confusion, some disbelief, and even some really nasty comments and hostility from people, but never have I been encouraged by someone like this to share my identity. It felt really good!  I usually dread finals week like most college students, but now I'm actually looking forward to it. I'm still a little nervous because coming out to a room full of people and then allowing them to ask you anything about your identity is a little daunting. But I know that my professors will have my back, and I hope that by doing this I can help educate all my classmates on asexuality and perhaps a little more about queer issues in general.

I have until the end of the semester, but I gotta say I'm really excited about this, everyone! Thanks for reading :  	106
 Marth's unavailable, but Wii Fit Trainer is.   I've already got Villager, which other ones are rare enough to get before December?    It's one of the Super Smash Bros. Brawl ones, I think.    **1. What amiibo figure would you like to see in the future?:**   I'd definitely like to see some more varied characters to fill up what Smash Bros. doesn't already have, such as Captain Toad, Waluigi, Ridley, Tom Nook, etc. Plus, third-party figures like Rayman and Bayonetta would be cool.   **2. What other types of amiibo functionality do you want?:**   I'd like to see a sandbox-styled game where you can use the characters o build your own games based off their franchises. Think Disney Infinity and LittleBigPlanet combined. Plus, using amiibos as the playable characters, combined with unlocking specific parts/textures/items/vehicles would be cool.   **3. Thoughts/Suggestions for /r/amiibo (if any):**   I'd like to see some sort of way to find the amiibos and where they're in stock, such as if they're out of order or if they're exclusives.     3DS was basically "Make sure to play as all of the characters! Do you know about this mode? Try it out! Collect all the trophies! Have fun!"  Wii U is "You're going to know every character inside and out. You will have to know EACH FRAME OF EVERY ANIMATION or else you're screwed. One wrong move costs you EVERYTHING. You're going to effing bleed if you want the Knuckle Joe trophy. Welcome to 20XX, bitch."   I got a Villager, and the Toys R Us had everything but Marth.      And now I feel like an idiot. Thank you.    We've experimented with several menus, but we've never been able to load the amiibo on. We can't find any specific sub-menu for it, and it's been bothering us all day. How do we scan the amiibos in Hyrule Warriors?   Villager is "Destroyer", based off my brother's previous Destroyer shtick.   Link's "HeroOfTime".   Mario is "Gonzales." Like in Thousand Year Door.    I really think that Sakurai needs to look at some other resources for Ridley, considering that PM fan model we saw a while back. With a fanbase that big, and a slightly smaller hatebase, you'd think he'd try a bit more to incorporate him.   A bit off topic, but I'm really hating the fact that 5-6 morons are being used as the definiton of "Ridley supporter" and anyone who does want Ridley is a delusional maniac. I'd appreciate it if every time I get into a debate, people stop pulling the same cards on me and telling me I have no idea what I'm talking about.     http://www.ssbwiki.com/series_symbol  This should have everything.    They mentioned being in quite a few tournaments in the state, and making it to semi-finals. I don't know their names or usernames or anything, just that.    This is beautiful. I fully approve.    I believe he probably used it and then opened up the Pocket to grab Pit's arrows.    They chose Palutena's Temple to see if they could do the Palutena's Guidance. When they weren't able to, they opted out and just fought.    Villager and Toon Link. He's also looking a bit at Mega Man (Because "lemons") and Ness. He seems to gravitate towards the younger characters, considering he also liked Lucas in Brawl.   	15

    As long as its just stating HP, I feel fine with it, It's not like you're saying its a rare model or adding cobra badges to it.   I can only dream of seeing one in person.   We can all take turns owning it, I get it all of May though. ;P      Yeah you do. My friend posted on Facebook from BT      Not really..  The Bullitt Mustang was offered in only three colors: Dark Highland Green, Black, and True Blue.  According to Wiki.   You mean if I actually went outside today I could have seen these?   He said no financing on the Fiero since its old. And since me and my friend look like we're 12 he must have thought they just want a joy ride, which if we wanted a joy ride we'd go look at Roush's or GT's, not a 135hp Fiero... :P   Do you have 11 grand? ;P  The guy wouldn't even let me and my friend ride in any of the cars unless we had the cash right then. Silly.   Welcome to how things are ran.   Well, she didn't pass it. So..   Arizona won't let that happen. She's not THAT stupid..    Hopefully I can get one sooner rather than later!   Jeez, how long have you had it and how old are you now? If you don't mind me asking, I'm just trying to figure out how long it took you to get your dream car :P   How much did it cost for you? Jeez, I'd do anything just to SIT in one, let alone own one!   You literally have my dream car, a Torch Red 10th Anniversary Cobra.  Gah! Do you have any numbers? I'm so jealous of you right now. Has it been modified, and if so what ways?   I got an email a few days ago saying I signed up for it. The thing is, I've never touched anything to do with BitCoins, and I went to look at what it meant and it had my name, first, middle, and last. It also had my birthday almost to the exact everything, but was off by 1 day. They also had my email. So I went in and changed everything, thankfully they didn't have any proof of ID, so it wasn't a full active account.   We can hope it will get struck down, no one here likes it.   ooooh something without support fell and it happened to be under your car. WTF man! Wow!   yes!

 Yes, I'd say social anxiety goes with it.  Off the top of my head, a few factors would be:  -  Normal thinking people don't GET IT.  It's virtually impossible to explain it to someone that isn't experiencing it.  Even people who HAVE experienced it eventually stop truly understanding where you are coming from.  Because your brain wants to block out the bad shit most times.  - Being around other people increases your chances of having them say something hurtful, do something hurtful....  And admittedly we depressed people tend to be more sensitive about potential negative comments or thinking things have negative connotations when they really don't.   That's just a screwed up perception seeing all the bad and not much of the good...dwelling on the bad more...saying the good was a "fluke" you can't depend on.  - And then you have the thing that people in general just suck.  They dont want to deal with your shit, but they want you to deal with their shit.  1v1 is much easier than groups, because it's so........shallow in group settings most times....and people dont want any negativity or dissent.    It's an experiment they did on a dog in a cage with an electrified floor, eventually it stopped trying to get away from the electricity/pain because of how they designed it.  So basically what the therapist is saying is that you learn to not to try for things as a defense mechanism until you basically learn to become helpless toward issues that are making you depressed, etc.    I personally don't believe that's a 100% accurate description of everything people deal with, but it definitely has some aspects that can be true.  Now if it was described more like you learn that everything you hope for turns out bad for you, so you learn to hope but never try for those things because YET ANOTHER failure would mean that you'd have reached as low as you were willing to go and ended your life.......  Because depression IMO is basically the equivalent of having chronic physical pain but for your emotions/soul/brain.  Eventually you learn to deal with it, get it treated, or finally say enough is enough.  People can understand chronic pain, very few people can understand that deep loathing/pain/fear mix that makes up depression.   I find a lot of my thoughts are fear driven, because it isn't natural to want to kill yourself.  So you naturally want to avoid things that may lead to more feelings of suicide, and there's where the fear kicks in.    I wonder the same about any goals or wants I have.  That if I get there if it'll be worth the effort, and if I dont...will the failure push me over the edge to actually killing myself.  Therapist calls it learned helplessness or something very similar.  And I think you need to be there and experience it before you can call it learned anything.    You should try more regular masks, most people don't like the dental devices....and if you brux I believe you can chew it up fairly fast.    To the woman who messaged me and then deleted account, please message me again.  I'd be happy to chat.   Second of these I've posted, hoping to get more results this time around.  36 year old guy and I'm lonely.  I am white, brown hair, blue/green eyes, overweight (working on it), and am pretty inexperienced at dealing with women in general.  I'm open-minded, like to hear about new things.....told I have a pleasant voice and that I'm intelligent.    I am looking for an ongoing conversation with a woman, let's say 20-40, light skinned, nice smile, medium/long hair.  I'm into larger chested women, you being overweight is not an issue, I just like proportionality.  In fact it really bothers me to find out there are so many good looking women who think they are nothing special roaming the planet.  I don't lie when it comes to my opinion on looks, outfits, hair, etc....   Ideally I'd like to get a lot of pictures from you and you'd want my opinion on them, but really not necessary.  The IMPORTANT part of this is that you WANT to talk and contribute to the conversations, or even kick off a days conversations if we've lapsed due to whatever.  And if you are not interested in talking anymore, let me know...as simple as that.  Interests:  Reading, mostly fantasy.  Series include Dresden files, Stormlight Archives, Codex Alera, Mistborn, etc.  TV.  Supernatural, Workaholics, Sleepy Hollow, Tosh, Grimm, lots of others  Movies.  Behind on movies, but I like comedies and action probably the most.  Video Games.  Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands, FPS and other type of games only game on PC.  I have a Computer Science degree, and am currently looking into options for going back for a masters in something to open up some job options...still doing my research.  Was looking at jobs for longevity and growth, something like Healthcare, Financial, or possible network security types...so if you're in any of those in the tech side....would be interested in hearing about your experience with them.  The generic descriptions on the web don't do much for me overall.  I have frequent depression, and some experience with other mental health stuff if you would like to talk about those with someone with a little experience it.    Just be genuine, hold up your end of the conversation, and open up a little when appropriate and we'll get along fine.  Like I said I really enjoy getting pictures from women, but no pressure there beyond an initial confirmation photo swap possibly.  I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video. And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first, maybe with a picture exchange to at least avoid catfish/troll scenarios.  PM me questions, kik name, etc.  Can go from there.  And if you read this post and it's old, chances are Im still looking.  Guys on here don't get too many replies from these things.   Sounds right.  I had an appt to get it treated, but it went away and stayed away but for like a day or two...so ended up cancelling the appt.  I also have sleep apnea, I dont know if it's related to the crystal becoming dislodged.  But the mask straps could have some impact on it being that they tight up on one side or the other often when you roll over.   I can't remember the name of it, but there are calcium crystals in your ear that can becoming dislodged and go into a canal in your ear filled with fluid that controls your balance.  So when that crystal disrupts the liquid moving, you get the spins and vertigo really bad.  It's really bad if you move your head, bend over, or lay down.  It will come and go as the crystal gets lodged and dislodged in various places.  There are some head postures and movements they teach you to basically try to stick the crystal at one of the ends of the tube.    Lovely.   I watch porn, have social anxiety and other issues.  Porn might give you unreasonable expectations toward relationships or the opposite sex and AMPLIFY your social anxiety.  But no, I dont think giving up porn, fapping, or whatever else is going to give you what you lack.  It might make you be less sexually....I want to say aware, but I dont think it's the right word.  Basically make you less likely to value sex/whatever you find sexual over other qualities in the opposite sex that are important to you as well but are .......diminished by the sex drive portion.  That I would say I agree with.  I just know that watching or not watching porn is not going to affect my confidence, comfort around others, feelings of inadequacy and general worthlessness.    Waaaay too many factors to take into account, and just trying to think of all that stuff adds to the depression and anxiety for me.   I'd just like to suggest that you may want to wear clothes with wider waist bands, or where them higher than you normally would.  I think your hips proportions are being distorted due to how your clothing as changed the way your fat deposited around the waist band.  To give your normal wear location a chance to smooth out and be more natural looking.  This coming from a big fat guy working on his weight and noticing how my clothing has "shaped" the fat deposits to be irregular looking when not clothed.   Well it amazes me to see pretty people with body issues.  I realize it happens, but what caused it...lack of compliments, taunting, etc?  I know it caused a lot of issues for me, the teasing and what not earlier in life.  Hopefully it gives you depth and empathy for someone who might have body issues themselves.   It's nice to get compliments from pretty girls.    You should not feel bad about anything you have going on.  Obviously you're not going to be everyone's type, but you are attractive, nice smile, hair, body shape, etc.     While the post is 5 days old, and ancient by internet standards.  If women come across it still, feel free to contact me.  Might post another one this weekend.   The place Im looking at for surgery doesn't recommend lap bands anymore.  They also don't recommend or do duodenal switches as far as I have heard.  I THINK, it's because the results aren't as good.  But also because it's a foreign object in your body and if you dislodge it or have complications they have to operate to remove it and usually dont put another one in due to trauma or whatever caused by the one that came loose.  I know of at least one person who had the lap band and had major complications with it, resulting in them having a herniated stomach, where the stomach moves up into the ribcage area.  And then because of that, the bile of the stomach would collect in their esophagus when they slept....   They are getting a gastric sleeve as a replacement for the removal of the lap band to go along with the surgery to fix the herniation.   Im looking at getting the gastric sleeve, I am......150-200 pounds over my "goal weight" depending on where I want to end up.  Your weight loss should be based on your BMI as well, a short person 70 pounds over weight is worse off than a very tall person 100 pounds overweight.  The tall (man presumably) is going to lose the weight faster just due to their size and will take less a calorie cut to see results.  Where a short woman will have to cut pretty significantly to see results most likely.  Also my surgery choice also does not recommend exercise at first if you are higher on the BMI scale because of possible injuries.  I think it also helps you to better determine a diet you will lose weight on no matter what.  Then add in exercise when you feel your energy levels and ability to more easily carry the rest of the weight increase.    A number of people post surgery talk about their energy levels being crazy high, I guess due to the hormone changes and more protein intense diet.  But I've lost about 30-40 on my own so far and havent felt any major changes in energy levels, in fact I think the weight loss might be causing my depression to become worse due to the stored fat being burned containing hormones and them being released.  Plus you don't get those little "food highs" if you cut out your trigger foods.   For surgery, IF you struggle to lose and keep weight off, get the surgery. It'll depend on your BMI, but if you keep going back and forth, eventually you're going to get tired of it and say screw it.  Plus wouldn't you like to be skinnier and healthier, earlier rather than later?  I wish I had the option 10 years ago, and so does everyone else I've talked to.  They wish they could have did it much earlier in life and the majority of them say "I was fat for as long as I can remember."  Or at least since their teens, it's no way to live if you're unhappy with it and it only gets worse as you age and your body starts to have medical issues due to it.     Disagree, dig the leash.   I prefer lighter skinned women,  medium to long hair, nice smiles....medium to large boobs a plus.  I want your thoughts, pictures, videos made specifically for me.  I can give you prompts, talk you through it on voice chat or just stick to text.  Nudes, outfit decisions, whatever.  Simple as that, if you want more from me we can discuss it but I pretty much just want to tell you what to do and have you do it.  Snapchat, kik, skype...     Man I love seeing chicks in collars.   When you think killing yourself will "teach them".   Funny you mention that therapist thing, I usually go through a bad spell after seeing the therapist then getting better as it gets closer to seeing them again.  I thought it was me pushing stuff down so I don't seem to "off" or strange to people.  Because I know they pick up on that.......anger underneath.  Depression is just anger turned inward.  I DO NOT have it all though heh, Im not totally screwed but yeah...definitely closer to the bottom of the pit than crawling out of it.  I feel like I've had some kind of depression for about 20 years.  And I believe Im a bit more emotional/sensitive than "normal" guys, I see them blow shit off like it's nothing all the time..like rejection means nothing, etc.  And it just eats at me, causes me sleeplessness, etc.  But you definitely want to stay off the booze if you want to figure out the depression portion some, it amplifies depression.    So, I've sent a lot of PMs to women on here asking for friends, whatever.  Havent gotten any responses, and Im sure they've had a lot of applicants.  So will try putting up a post of my own to see what shakes out.  36 year old guy.  Depression, extreme loneliness.    Haven't had any "in person" female relationships in .....20 years or so.  So it's a confidence issue at this point.  I know I want one, but I'm an oddball apparently.  Read...mostly fantasy.  Dresden Files, Stormlight Archives, etc. TV...Supernatural, Workaholics, Tosh.0, many others. Movies...I'm behind on them. Video games...Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands and others...all PC.   Computer Science degree, but really haven't found that job that seems ideal.  Might be a case of location, might be something else really dont know.  All my friends are moving on to wives and children, and I'm left trying to figure out what to do with my time.  Overweight but working on it.  I feel like my life is more up in the air now than it was in college if that speaks to you.  Can discuss whatever, would prefer to stay away from politics and religion.  You being well spoken/written would be a plus.  Im a fan of bigger chested girls, long hair, nice smiles.  More into white girls than others, but I really don't want to limit myself in that regard as you just never know.  All I can do is try at this point I guess.  It's discouraging to say the very least.  PM me with a little about yourself and prove you read this.  I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video.  And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first.    Wish I could find the motivation.  I can't even stand being out in public where people can see me trying to do it.  Thinking about it makes me want to just be fatter so I can die sooner and suffer less overall.    There's a setting on my machine that's on or off.  Basically the machine detects you are exhaling it drops the pressure down until some period has passed or it detects you breathing in again.  You need to figure out what you machine calls this setting and turn it on.  Because I had this issue during the actual sleep test, with asthma and everything it felt like the thing was trying to suffocate me trying to breathe against it.   	23
 My 10 is probably about a 7-7.5 for most of you. For others, it would probably be considered higher, and for the rest, it could even be a 3. Pain tolerance is dependent on the person, and I know for me, a 10 is when I can't walk (Early-Onset Arthritis.) My knee is in so much pain, I have to judge just how badly I need to use the restroom before getting out of bed just to walk across the hall. My SO has on more than one occasion had to go to the kitchen for me just to get me some water because I'm at a 6 for me. A 6 cripples me, a 10 just means that I can't move at all, for fear of passing out.   Unfortunately for me, if I'm having a day when I reach a 10 and still need to go to work, I have to push through due to the fact that my job requires I be on my feet all day. Those are the worst days for me, because no one at my office knows that I have arthritis in my knee.    If there's a chance the treatment won't work, I think you should try the surgery. No one likes to be in pain all the time, and I for one would do anything I could to help the recovery process. I'm willing to put down good money that your insurance would cover this kind of surgery. I say go for it, OP!!   So that "foreign" language looks and sounds Enochian to me. That would be the language of the Angels for anyone who didn't already know. Those are very dangerous spells, OP. Be careful dealing with those.   Yeah, I pressed it. Couldn't stop myself. AMA!!   I currently have a Turtleship Brass, but it's getting old, been dropped one too many times, and it's just overall time for a new mod. However, I'm broke as all hell. Can someone suggest a good mod that's fairly inexpensive? I'd like to spend $150 or less if possible. Thanks guys!!   I honestly can't read the books or listen to the audiobooks without feeling like this. This universe is just expansive and including that I always feel as though I'm a part of it, and it's so well written that I just get sucked in and have a really difficult time leaving. That being said, NO REGRETS!!!!   All demonic entities have a dark side. That's why they are considered demons. That being said, not all are pure evil. In fact, some try to do good, and bad things happen as a result. Some try to help, and things just go awry. Try to focus yourself on what he wants, OP, and remember this. Maybe he's trying to help. Maybe he's trying to rectify his sins of past.   Always acknowledge him when he wants it. It's when they get angry that the bad shit really goes down. That's when they strike that hardest, and the strongest.   They are always there watching, waiting for the right moment.    Can you ask this "site" why the shadow people only went for those with souls? I feel as though those without souls (such as yourself and myself) would be of more use. We could cause destruction, mayhem, and chaos.    I also work at Starbucks, and I must say, being burned by coffee is usually the least of my worries in a day. I usually burn myself a good three or four times a day. My hands and wrists are so used to it, I just don't feel it anymore xD   ANYWAYS!!!! I digress. Honestly, I feel for you :/ It's really shitty when you burn yourself at work. Did you supervisor at least let you go to the back to take care of it?   Simmons. The chick that plays her is fine, and the accent, oh god the accent......  	10
    Light grout is not a good idea. We have it in our house and cannot keep it clean. But looks great otherwise!!!!!       Must be digiorno.          OH MY GOD THATS RICHARD. I'm from Ames too!!!!!!!  	7
 I know right? I'm not Communist and I understand that it's a "oath" but really? A felony, with a minimum of 1 year! That is straight up bullshit.      Doesn't mean those are things he SHOULD try.. I was wondering what else there is too...  	3
 I've tried Atkins, LA, Weight Watchers, and a few others. Nothing really took. Came to the realization that when I'm ready, I'll just need to watch what I eat for my own self.    I appreciate that but I hope you don't really give up. It's hard to find the right method of treatment, and there is no magic bullet, but you have to keep plugging on to make things better. Let me know if I can help.    It's my pleasure. I would recommend starting with a therapist. They generally are more counseling oriented as opposed to medication, but if the two of you decide that's the best option they can recommend you to someone. Generally I think that's probably your best start.    Computer, Tv, Playstation, yeah pretty much. I just need to work on my discipline and dedication.    I'm not crazy about the idea of taking anything illegal, but I appreciate the advice   Thanks for sharing. Prozac seems like it will help, I'm looking forward to feeling like a person.    Woke up not remembering doing anything/getting home/sleeping.   Oh it has been mentioned. One of the things I was looking forward to when I decided to do this.    LOL. No worries at all man. Thanks.    I monitor all those things. Drugs arent for everyone, but neither are the alternative lifestyles. Thanks for the good wishes though!   Better than being tri polar...   Doc advised that prozac can make you go limp, not that that matters in my current life, but that can be treated with meds.    I dont precisely know what happened but probably the former.    Repost: A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.  The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right.  We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming.    Hadn't ever heard of them, I'll start dropping by thanks.   Absolutely. That's part of why I did the AMA was to talk about different peoples methods.    What's our vector Victor?   Not saying that at all. There are people who have it much worse. Again, just felt like starting a conversation.    And most people do. My weight has fluctuated all my life and I have no doubt taking it off would help, but that's also not the magic bullet for it all.    You are both clever and the first one to make that assertation. Good for you.    There's not an official way that I'm aware of. Treatment with drugs working to balance things out I think is really the marker.    I was the same way until I got to the point where I was thinking about ending it. If you think you might have it and things aren't getting better, I cannot recommend going to see someone highly enough. Even if it's a school counselor, you can't always do it on your own.    lol.   Not a problem. let me know if I can help at all.   Many thanks for the well wishes!   Well for one not that many people do but for 2 They are two of my best friends and are usually considerate not to "shove their happiness in my face" when I'm in a lonly swing.    I have tried healthier living before, though not to that extent and it didn't help as much. I think if I go back to it with a combination of what I'm doing now, it'll work a lot better.    I want so badly to disagree with you...    Ok, that's cool. Like I said earlier, saw a topic on the front page and felt like starting a conversation.    1. Often. I do not have a good diet, and never have. I'm trying to correct this but habitual behavior and budget tend to get in the way. Will be working on this in therapy.  1b. 330 with a 6'2 Frame. very overweight  2. I've been told I don't snore often. I am getting tests done in a few weeks to see if sleep apnea is a possibility.   3. Yes. I am in my house roughly 10 hours of the day in total.   4. Not as much as I'd like, I'm planning a big move in a few months and need to budget better than I have been, however I do treat myself from time to time.    I lold in the literal sense. Well done. Have an upvote.    Much appreciated! Thank you for reading.    ... no   Apologies if I've been mistyping, been wading through a lot of replies. I'm currently seeing a Psychiatrist and a therapist.    It's a specialized name that will help narrow the treatment field to get me better. Knowing that I have Dysthymia with secondary MDD gives a therapist a better idea of what they're dealing with.   And I know you were being sardonic but seeing what you know is a beautiful day and not being able to enjoy it can be pretty damn soul crushing.    First let me be clear that I am not a medical professional and so my advice should not be taken with the same weight as one.   That being said, from my experience, those of my friends, and talking to counselors, the normal key things can be triggers, unusual amounts of stress, family problems, relationship problems etc, can all trigger what may have been under the surface for a while.    It depends on who you are seeing and if you have insurance. It's a specialized field so it can be pricey, but some practices are more willing to work with you than others. If you have insurance, find out if it covers mental and who is in your network. If not, start looking around. I go to a baptist behavioral health clinic. Those bigger clinics will be more able to help with prices than private practice in my experience.    It's a bitch aint it?   Whoops, thanks.    Yes, Yes, and Yes. Things work differently on different people.    Thank you very much, and I'm glad to hear you're doing better. That's encouraging.    I'm just starting the meds/therapy. I just developed a really dark sense of humor to help me cope when I didn't  know what was wrong with me which has been a gift and a curse. It can be off putting to some people, but it helps me get by.    Unfortunately, as I said earlier, there is no magic bullet. Just remember your family though. Suicide is never the answer, believe me I've been on the edge, maybe over it, you are loved and there is a way out of the hole, it's just a different path for everyone.   	43
 Maybe try Glasslip? It isn't a straightforward anime though, like Akatsuki no Yona (which I also loved btw). I really enjoyed it though! Or maybe Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso? It was AMAZING   On Shinsekai Yori, I can understand why some people may say it started slowly. For the most part, a lot of the story is told quite subtly, or even not at all and we are left guessing. What makes SSY so good are all of the silences, where we're left grasping and guessing at what really happened and why.    I agree with everyone here recommending Shinsekai Yori - IT'S AMAZING    Is it more important to you to work a high-paying job which enables you to do heaps of awesome things and look after your family or work a job where you can follow your passion and enjoy your work without necessarily earning very much money? For example, I want to earn a lot of money one day so I can buy my mum a house, and afford my own house and take care of my younger sister and afford holidays and stuff.  	4
 Thanks for doing this contest! This is my boyfriend's favorite movie, and the movie we watched together when we had our first kiss :) So here is my [inspiration.](http://i.imgur.com/8HHM6g5.jpg) :)   I figured that since it was a romantic scene, I would do a romantic look. My phone's camera sucks, so you cant really see how vibrant the colors are, but I loved the amount of color and life in the movie, especially the oranges and blues and purples. [Here's mah face.](http://imgur.com/a/VW05s) Hope you enjoy!     I LOVE MA FACE!!  Here are my[ pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/9qWZy#WKGXawB)  First off, I have a scar (that's barely noticeable anymore) on my nose. I got it in Kindergarten when I had the chicken pox. I ran into a wall face first and it scraped off! I love telling that story. I used to hate it because it was a little deeper back when I was young but I think its cute now.   Second, it might be hard to see but I have three beauty marks on my face. They're close to my hairline on my temple and the third is higher up on my forehead.  Third I have just one dimple! I like this because I never discovered this until I took some senior photos when I was 17. I hardly have any pictures of me actually smiling because I used to be very self conscious about my teeth.  Fourth, my teeth. I always hated them until I got to college. I never wanted to smile with my teeth. My parents couldn't afford braces and so I never got the front two fixed. But now I appreciate that it makes me unique. My boyfriend always tells me I have a cute smile and so I had to put this in here, because I know he will see this. Love you!  Fifth, and lastly, my nose. I used to despise it because of the chicken pox scar and because of how wide it is, but I have learned to embrace it. People never believe me when I tell them that I am part African American from my mother's side. I am proud to be black, and the only features I have to show for it are my dark eyes, darker skin tone, and my nose. The other parts of me, French, German, Irish, and Native American, have definitely managed to shine through as well, haha.   Hmm. I would say I'm special because I care about everyone and try to help everyone with everything, even if I can see that sometimes they're taking advantage of me. A little kindness goes a long way, I say.    Thanks! I only have my ears pierced once, so I'm going to start on those. I want to have my ears double pierced with a cartilage piercing on one ear and after that get triple forward helix piercings on both ears :)   Not to give any discredit to the piercer, but she seemed to be in quite a hurry when she did it. I came in and already knew that I wanted a horseshoe. She just picked a size, pierced me, gave me some directions on how to clean and sent me on my way. I was so excited and it all happened so fast that I didn't even realize that she didn't tell me what size mine is :( and now I'm not even in Eau Claire anymore, so I have to go to the place I usually go and try and have that place size it.   I wish I could help you out more!    Thanks :) I'll have to ask someone about that. I haven't had any problems so far, but I'll look into it.    Thank you so much! :)         Holy crap I went in the comments to see if this was the tiny town where my University is located by and sure enough.   The other people who commented already said what I was going to say about your contour, but dang, you remind me so much of Adele!   You picked the wrong sister.   Jaja, gracias! :) Eres de los Estados Unidos, u otro pais?   Darn it   yeah, it takes me directly to my album. I don't know what's going on!   Wait a minute, for me it doesn't look like it didnt link correctly       Thank you!   Yes! Well at least I think so. Even my boyfriend's brother noticed how smooth my face looked and heaven knows that's some kind of miracle   Gracias! He listado mis productos favoritos en otro comentario!   Haha I appreciate the Spanish.   Oh goodness. If I had to pick one it would be Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer. I have pretty dang oily skin, so it really helps with that. It feels kind of thick going on, but it tones down the oiliness and helps me maintain a dewy finish. It's probably one of my favorite finds because I had searched for months for a good primer and I finally found it. Also, Clump Crusher. I can't live without it, and I can't find a mascara I like more. Another one would have to be Revlon's Colorstay Matte Balms, because they are so easy to apply and I can't be bothered some days to whip out my lipstick and my lipstick brush and try to perfectly line my lips and all of that.    So, I kind of broke a rule (oops) as I've posted before without doing an intro. /u/blanksy was kind enough to remind me in chat that I needed to do one!  Anywho, I just wanted to say that I love this subreddit, and love the idea of having contests and being able to commit random acts of kindness within the context of makeup. This subreddit is so supportive and kind. I reaallllly love makeup and have a growing collection. My friends think I'm crazy obsessed, but they don't mind so much when they need someone to do their makeup, haha. I've only recently had the ability to start feeding into my hobby more in terms of finances and RAoM really makes me feel like I have a home and a comfortable place to showcase what I have learned over the years. Thanks for that!  My other hobbies include singing, reading, and listening to music. I also study Spanish so if anyone here speaks Spanish or is also learning we can practice together. I think that's it! Keep being fabulous!   I would say that my biggest thing about doing makeup on other people is that I might have to adjust some things according to who I am putting the look on, even if I'm trying to achieve the same thing for several different people. This is especially true for different eye types.   When I do makeup on other people, I realized the thing that gave me the most trouble is doing their liner, especially wings, which I have a feeling you are going to be making use of. On yourself, it is much easier to close your eyelid or start from the inner corner or the middle and draw the wing out that way. I suggest that you have them look straight on at you, and you draw the wing first, so that you can draw a wing that is appropriate for the type of eye they have, otherwise it could look a bit cartoonish or just flat-out ridiculous.   Also, I would say if you have someone with hooded eyes, you might want to search a couple youtube tutorials about maximizing their lid space. I have friends with hooded eyes who feel that eyeshadow is a lost cause on them when it really doesn't have to be that way! One important thing I always try to remember is to make sure that if you do anything sparkly or dramatic on someone with a hooded eye, you should try to put whatever crease color you are using (if youre using one) a little bit above their actual natural socket, because otherwise the shadow gets lost.   If you would like a little bit of advice about different eye shapes, [this eye shape video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bdkpypZKElist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA)  is very helpful because he provides examples of celebrities with those different shapes. He also just did [a smokey eye tutorial for hooded eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq3EB4NepKYlist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) which you might also want to take a look at.  Hope this helps a little! Have fun!    Why thank you! I guess that's what happens when your mother is half black and your dad is a blond haired blue eyed German! haha.    Thank you, I'm always worried that there are too many colors on my face haha    Thank you so much! Wow, what a compliment. She is absolutely gorgeous.    Thank you :)   Thank you! I used Clean and Clear Morning Burst moisturizer, Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer (which really gives me more of a dewy look because I have oily skin) and Maybelline's FitMe liquid foundation in the shade 120. I apply the foundation with a stippling brush, which gives me more of a smooth finish! I also used a little bit of blush that's a really generic, cheap brand that I don't even remember the name of anymore, haha. The primer is awesome...its really thick and I find it fills my pores and keeps my makeup from slipping around all at the same time.   Thanks so much! I actually use Elf's Cream liner in Black and an angled brush to apply. I used to use liquid, but I find I like the more matte look of the cream better :)   Thanks!   	29
 Artie, Bailey, Hero or Simba. He is so cute!   Nothing of importance? I thought 1984 was wrote there? That's something I guess. Plus when famous people visit the islands they tend to skip over Islay and go to Jura which annoys me because I just think 'Come to our island, Jura has like NOTHING on it!' but yeah.   I am no for independence. There is too much that could go wrong and the SNP haven't nearly began to give good answers to queries and such. This is how I'll be voting unless things drastically change and we start getting some god damn answers.   If you have been diagnosed by a medical professional then they should damn well do that. Surely they have support for those with a physical ailment so it should be the same for a mental ailment.   	4

 I always thought this was why guys pissed standing up.   I just got a new windows machine (Dell XPS 13 '15 edition) and I LOVE the snapping feature.  Prior, my primary machine was a 27 inch iMac, so never really hurt for screen space hehe.   An app would be awesome.  Besides that, I stopped playing in Nov. 2012 and only just picked it back up this month. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Even the popular NC items are the same.    Yeah, but I think it's more socially acceptable for us ladies to tell people to stuff it for commenting about what we like.   Yep yep yep 10000x yep.  This is my biggest grammar pet peeve, because I feel like when people use 'I' when they should use 'me,' they are incorrectly patting themselves on the back for 'remembering the rule.'  Thank you good sir.   Well, it's not from Season 1.   [Youngster would](http://i.imgur.com/n37Ef7u.jpg)   The one wearing shorts must start the conversation and wax poetic at length about the awesomeness of shorts.   There's speculation elsewhere in the thread that may answer your question.   Ambiguous 'natural' flavors in some flavored teas.   That was Arvel Crynyd. The female A-Wing pilot who was redubbed was Sila Kott. It's an easy mistake though because they look similar in their gear.   [Yeah she was awesome.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dine_Ellberger)   An excellent point!   Porkins bein porkins.   AND the guy who gets Indy to go find the Ark of the Covenant. Dude gets around.   In the Outer Rim, I'd rather be dead than maimed to be honest lol.   Natural flavorings can still be ambiguous. There's a natural flavoring in one of their raspberry herbals that doesn't agree with me that in no way comes from a raspberry. That said, Adagio is my preferred tea retailer!   I'm not sure. There is one reference to a female pod racer by Anakin in an EU novel, but it's to describe how horrifically she died.    Nope. None whatsoever. :(   [She was. Then overdubbed with a male voice](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott)    I have never had a problem with Adagio and their customer service is quite good. I think they use less artificial flavors than Teavana, although they are not completely 'clean.'   So useful. Go for it.   There were some in the Battle for Naboo! :)   The comments in that article make me a sad panda. [Also](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott)      Thank you.   "It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to, and in direct contact with, an infected case,"  Yep so people will be fear mongering with this even though the scientists admitted it was impossible to control for.  Also  Thursday's study examines the idea that minuscule droplets of body fluid containing the virus could hang in the air and be inhaled by others, providing an unrecognized, if minor, pathway for the virus.  Not the same thing as an Ebola mutated to be airborne!   If you read the books, you learn that Picard is fairly unpopular with the brass and that it has a lot to do with the time he spent as a Borg.  Edited to add- The Federation govt. LOVES him. The admiralty is where the problem lies.      You are fine.   I'd actually recommend this documentary instead. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/video/  Watch it by yourself first though then decide which parts you want to show him.   Thank you :) It makes saber sounds when you wave it around and hit it against things too!   You can get a hell of an Obi-Wan saber at Ultrasaber.

Archaholic alkeyologists   In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.  As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.  I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education.   Best of luck with your project!  Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it.   Your home scale might not be calibrated the same as the one at the doctor. If your clothes feel the same you did not gain ten pounds.    This is my favorite picture of her :)      42 hours last week, 38 hours this week. It works out, but it's shifty.   No worries. I'm an archaeologist and I understand taking a shit job early career on the other side of the country to get your foot in the door. Best of luck.   I really like Atlanta. The area around GaTech is pretty cool and they have a lot of music festivals in the area. Some great museums as well. Can't comment on the dating scene though. Oh and the bars in Buckhead are EXPENSIVE.    Are you an archaeologist?   Ultrasaber makes the one he got me. It's Obi-Wan's hilt with an LED you can change to be any color you want.    LOL   That is the correct level of enjoyment as indicated by the manufacturer.    My cat Abby playing with the lightsaber my boyfriend gave me for Valentine's. :3      An intriguing hypothesis. This requires more field testing. :3   I was wondering the same thing!   They just published a new one so it should be findable.   No kidding. I just started watching it because of how much I am enjoying Rebels and holy crap.   I love lotso! I have to really bust it to get more than two activations per game, because not only does it take a while to charge but he appears less often in the game.   I only got 5 :(   I just started watching it. Make sure you find the chronological order! I was just saying last night how I couldn't believe I thought it sucked for so long.   LOL :)  	55
 Bought this razor on a whim without knowing what type it was, after searching online I've found that it is a gillette slim made in 1966. I did a quick clean up just to make sure it twisted and turned in all the ways it should, and everything looks good.  Currently I use a schick krona (which I really like), but I've noticed that the gillette slim is a bit heavier and has a shorter handle. My little sister has shown interest in DE and I want to give her a starter kit for Christmas. Would the shorter handle and the heavier razor be okay for a female beginner? Or should I keep looking for something with a longer handle and lighter weight?      You absolutely can profit from working on the island. It's all about knowing how to budget and save - same as any job anywhere. The Jamaicans were some of the hardest working people and mostly friendly.   Source: worked on the island the past six months and brought home a good chunk of change.    If by garbage trucks you mean horse drawn vehicles.   The test is very much flawed. I only took one year of Spanish in high school and wasn't very good at it. The test placed me in 202 and I ended up dropping down to 102 and not receiving retroactive credit because I choose to take a course below what I tested into.    That's awesome, can you use other fruits aside from apples? Thanks so much, I'll have to try this.    Thanks :)   How do you know how much to use? I put some of the peels in my apple butter.    Make it very similarly to apple sauce, but you cook it longer and make it a smoother texture, comparable to an apple jam or apple spread.    I worked with a Welsh girl, a Scottish girl, and an English boy this summer in America, they all sounded completely different. Although if I met someone from the UK I'm not sure I could pinpoint where they were from.      Awesome! Thanks for the response. I'll probably crack one open later today anyways, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I should look for.    Everything on the outside looks like it worked, do I need to open one to make sure it is good on the inside?       I saw that as well. I think for now I'll just use something cheap since I won't be actually using the pot to cook in, just for the final canning process. Thank you!   Dated a kid named Sean for almost four years, called him Seen the entire time. First time because I thought was how it was pronounced, after that it just became a pet name.   Currently work at a coffee shop and I say the same thing, it amazes me how confused people look when they try to figure out how to put cream and sugar in their coffee.    I would have looked at a thrift store first if I could, I love them and they are my go to - especially for cooking things. However, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, I am currently living in a place with limited resources. No thrift store, no big chains, basically I need to order it online. I did find someone that is willing to let me borrow a stock pot of theirs though! So for now I'm doing that, but first chance I get I want to get my own.   Thanks!   Only reason I was looking for stainless steel instead of aluminum is because you can't cook acidic things in it.   For the actually canning process, there is no difference in what container you use then? As long as it covers the jars and you can heat it on the stove?  I'm in the process of getting a book :) I'm currently living somewhere with extremely limited resources, so I've been relying on friends, family, and internet advice.   I've been told to start with something easy the first time I can, does it really matter seeing as how I'll still have to go through the same canning steps? My plan is to make apple butter this week and can that as my first item.  Thanks again for all your help!   I am new to canning and am in the process of gathering all the equipment I will need. I've ordered [http://www.amazon.com/Norpro-6-Piece-Canning-Set/dp/B0000DDVMH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1381440440sr=8-1keywords=canning+tools] and I've ordered a rack for the bottom of the pot, however I still need a pot. I have a flat stove top so I want to avoid the granite ones. I started looking at stainless steel stockpots and found this one [(http://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Heavy-Stainless-Steel-Savezoneusa/dp/B002GE5GYI/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)]. I've heard good things about it, but is it really necessary to spend 60 dollars on a pot. Does anyone have any other suggestions of good ones that maybe are a bit cheaper? Thank you!   These look amazing Nolan!   Could you post the list of books you received?    Has a book been choosen? I'd love to participate.    I'm in the act too old group. :/   That's why I loved hoodies in high school. But then they made it against the dress code to wear them. :/   Applying for everything isn't wrong. I'm completely white, and applied for a scholarship my senior year of high school that was supposed to be given to an African American female that played sports and had a good gpa. I was a perfect candidate for the scholarship, except for the whole being white issue. My principal, who was black, told me to apply anyway because the foundation rather give money to someone than no one and hardly anyone applied for this scholarship. I ended up being one of the people who received the scholarship. I was honest on my scholarship application and checked the box saying I was white. I know this doesn't explain why it isn't racist, but several other people in this thread did a good job of that already. Just wanted to encourage you to apply to any and all scholarships, it isn't wrong and you might get lucky. :)   Made a world of difference! :)    I just shaved my underarm again and I tried more passes in different directions, this seemed to help, but I'm still not 100% satisfied with it yet. I keep trying to shave the way I used to with my old razor, but that isn't right.  Yes the lather helped with my legs. I ended up doing two passes against the grain. I've tried and tried to go with the grain, but it is the most awkward thing to shave away from my body.   	28
 Sometimes I sit down and re-watch a few episodes of Avatar: The Last Air Bender, just to feel nostalgic.   	1
 Which city? I might see you there.    I feel that I would have a lot more luck in a foreign country. There's so much more to talk and joke about.    Beware, it destroys latex condoms!   Braces bro. I'm 19 and about to get some. You're never too old.    Just because a nation is rich doesn't mean its population is. For example, Guatemala is the world's fifth largest exporter of sugar, coffee and bananas and rakes in a shitton. But *half* of its population - 7 million people - are below the extreme poverty line.

Alpha as fuck   I don't even know what Red Lobster is and it's probably not even in my country, but still, I want some.    Here's your hat and coat   I don't think I was ever a truly horrific 'nice guy,' but I struggled (and still do) with the idea that some selfishness or at least putting self-interest first in a relationship is not only healthy but almost required.    I'm from Australia, it's basically required   I think you're going to get downvoted for this because your wording is a little aggressive, but it would be worth noting that this is the impression the comment's OP receives from reddit, not necessarily her opinion on the world.    Yeah I did, OP clarified it for me.    I said it in the other thread and I'll say it again: I think that /r/seduction, despite its flaws, actually teaches men to treat women better and be less misogynistic by dispelling the myth of the friendzone and showing them how to be genuinely attractive.   Perhaps a better example is /r/faimprovement.    My mistake. It's a little different then, but I still think it would be a shocking idea to say I love you regardless of how he feels about you. On one hand, even if he does feel the same, I'd say you haven't been back together for long enough for it to withstand that level of serious commitment. If he doesn't feel that way about you, sheer and utter disaster.    EDIT: I derped and missed the fact that they're back together now. Keep that in mind.   I think the fact that he's not your boyfriend and hasn't been in a year would have been a nice inclusion in the title.   I'm actually not going to go back and read it all because this question is very, very easy:  1) does he feel the same about you? Do you know this for certain? If yes to both, get back together and be happy. If no to either, proceed to step 2.  2) he no longer wishes to be in a relationship and has moved on. There is *absolutely nothing* you can do about this, and you need to move on as well. It was good while it lasted, and now you need to pack up the memories and think about someone else. Continuing to dwell on this guy will only hurt you, and telling him you LOVE him will stir up all kinds of trouble (even if he still has genuine affection for you).   When you phrase them in a way that makes men feel manipulated by the big bad nasty women, of course they will.    PSA: 'whoosh' has been so used and abused that it is now downvoted regardless of context and usage. Please stop trying, for your own karma.   I think you're the female version of the 'nice guy.'   I find it incredibly ironic that (it seems to me) the type of people who think that the best way to be attractive is to be nauseatingly nice to women are usually the most casually misogynistic.   In this way, as someone who regularly reads /r/seduction with their doucheometer primed and their salt shaker at the ready (just in case, it's usually a fairly nice place), that subreddit actually teaches and encourages BETTER treatment of women - usually by turning jaded and misogynistic 'nice guys' into people who are accepting of their own flaws and of everyone around them, regardless of gender.    ... yeah that's a bit messed up.   Let's hang on a second. From what I've read (and please correct me) we have no indication of whether this Cheyenne KNOWS the man is taken, let alone married.   She might think this is a perfectly legitimate relationship. Yeah, a 16 year old going out with a 25 year old is weird (and seemingly illegal in OP's area of the world). But I've seen weirder, and young girls have a serious boner for older guys. This isn't going to change. Let's not crucify her as a manipulative, husband-stealing bitch just yet.  EDIT: for some perspective - and I know this isn't quite the same nor the same level of magnitude, but I'm currently 19. When I had just turned 18,  my first kiss was with a 23 year old girl. It didn't go further than that and we're now friends. I don't consider it a negative experience at all, and though it's a little different because I was legal everywhere and male - and thus completely impervious to all forms of manipulation or sexual abuse (sarcasm) - I think OP's case could be viewed in a similarly more generous way. Teenagers will be teenagers.   The 25 year old man, though, is just a cunt.    how to make friends better than normal people do   Her: I have a boyfriend You: I have a maths test tomorrow Her: what? You: oh, I thought we were talking about stuff we can cheat on  EDIT: Not seriously suggesting using this, it's just a joke I heard.     I suppose that if everybody is equal in value there are a lot more options, and an increased chance of securing another partner. Interesting idea.    I might add that relationships at your age usually last for a few months at best, so the whole dramatic declaration of undying love is probably going to be moot a few years later.    Bro, there are many, many people in the world who didn't 'get a girlfriend' until 18 (like me) or even 21.   If you tick off the years on your calendar and worry that you are x age with no relationship, then you're treating it like external validation of your self-worth, and as a status symbol. That's quite unhealthy, and when you do find a girl at whatever age, that's the only way you will see her. As an achievement, something you get points for on Xbox live.   Relax, wait for someone you are comfortable with and genuinely wants to be with you - more importantly, someone that YOU genuinely want to  be with - and then go for it. Not before.    It's also fairly evident from all the threads about men receiving compliments - there was a good one last night - that even for the attractive ones, it's basically impossible for them to think someone might be interested in them or find them attractive. I think men purposefully ignore a lot of hints and put them down to accidents or vagaries of behaviour.   There's also the fact that it's much more risky for men to act on a hint than it is for women. The terms 'creepy' and 'potential rapist' spring to mind.    I'm 19, and believe me, people change at the end of school. They get tossed out of their established social circles and comfort zones into the big wide world, and they grow up real fast.   As far as the dating world goes, I've noticed people become more mature and less selfish in their relationships - less likely to dump someone because they know they can get another due to their social status (as the quarterback, cheerleader etc).    Or we don't know that we are because no one ever tells us   Pretty sure singing that song actually makes you more manly   I'm a big hit with female octopi?   Squishy and round? Like the rest of me?   I don't know why people would bother trying to pass fake off as real when we have /r/eroticliterature. Plenty of good stuff over there.    You're not forever alone. You're not ugly. You're awesome, and everyone here thinks so.   Don't let me hear you say any bullshit in return, because a) every 'forever alone' I've known usually finds great happiness as soon as they stop using that as their identity, and b) self-confidence and assurance are the most important qualities in being attractive to females. Bottom line, if you label yourself as forever single, YOU WILL BE.   But I highly doubt that at 27 you've gone through life with no female attention whatsoever - even some that you haven't noticed, probably because you're busy convincing yourself that you're not awesome.   So go be awesome.    This doesn't mean at all that we don't FEEL this excitement. With my ex, I couldn't get over the fact that she was a concert violinist and incredibly intelligent and into all the same books as me and blah blah blah.  But I'm not allowed to tell anyone, because let's face it, guys aren't socially allowed to feel those things about ourselves or each other, let alone another human being that I'm only allowed to publicly view as a piece of meat I have sex with. So for most of us, if the only thing we care allowed to say is how good the sex is or something equally demeaning to her, we'd rather say nothing at all.    Yeah, you don't want to scare him off. Especially if it accidentally all goes south and his response is a solid no (for whatever reason) - you can come back from a 'let's go out some time,' but you can't recover from 'I've loved you since I was seven.'    Dicks can be as wide as coke cans?  Well now I feel self confident   Most people shame Size Queens because a guy who says "I won't sleep with a woman unless she has large breasts" would be drawn and quartered. It's only fair.    Moooooo   If a relationship is essentially being really great friends plus sex, then you'd think the majority of the personality qualities you look for in a relationship are also found in your friends.    That's absolutely fascinating. Thank you.    If the female masturbation thread over in /r/sex is anything to go on, my friends (who are mostly female) aren't attracted to me (nor do I want them to be). How could they judge?   Trouble is, we have no frame of reference for comparison. I *think* I'm really into my hobbies, I *think* I put a lot of effort into being well presented and fun to be around, I *think* I work really hard at my career - but what if I don't? How will I know?   Soon there will be a reddit financial crisis from all the lost upvotes.    ... does this mean that males have or are willing to have a great deal more imagination in these things?   Extremely.   I think this is also fairly well known in the gender subreddits. Probably not worth a thread on.    Sex with slenderman?   Not all of them do. That's a huge generalization. I'd actually say quite a lot don't, and that reddit is a biased statistic to draw on.   Both of my best friends are female and I will never sleep with them. This is my *own choice* (as well as presumably theirs) because I value their friendship.    This is actually a very interesting comment. I know the 'friendzone' is an utter load of shit - basically Nice Guys who are emotionally and in personality unattractive whining about how they don't get laid - but the counter argument to it is usually that "it's the same for both genders, of you're not attractive you're just not attractive" etc - which is some merit.   Here, however, we have direct evidence that the genders do actually have different potential-sexual relationships with their friends.   Dude, you have so much self-confidence, self respect, determination and charisma. When you lose a bit more, you're going to be beating the girls of with a stick. Seriously. Hell, you probably do now.    A further point to take from this - you know that guy over there at the bus stop, who looks really serious and intimidating and unapproachable? He's just as afraid of you as you are of him.   This also applies to approaching the opposite sex. At the end of the day, past all the seduction techniques and the game and the self confidence and the blah blah blah, the girls and boys you talk to have just as many insecurities and fears as you do. They're trying to hide them and put on a brave face just like you - but they still really just want someone to love them just like you do. They're not so terrifying after all.    Congratulations. I'm really happy you're still with us. PM me if you ever need to talk - if you feel that way again.    concerned for my physical safety  I'm sorry, but don't you think that's jumping the gun a bit? So he comes off as rude and immature. He doesn't pick up social clues. I'm hardly an expert, but that all sounds like he's on the autistic spectrum to me. To be assuming he's a physical threat to your well being because of some sarcasm is a bit offensive - and that behaviour and attitude is, in fact, dangerous to him.   If all of this behaviour was coming from a female, would you label them as a potential murderer or rapist?   Damn right man. That's the correct attitude.   I lost mine when I was 18, and while it was fun and I've done it again since (... a fair bit), you're not missing out on anything vitally important.    Jesus loves you more than you could know, wow wow wow   How was that an issue?!   I wish everyone has this kind of tolerance. I got dumped by my ex girlfriend because - I quote - "I wasn't enough of a dickhead to her."  I know exactly what I did wrong, I was a bit too nice and not 'exciting' enough - too easy to be in a relationship with - but it still seemed pretty unfair to me.    Noob question, how are you achieving that particular look with your cuffs and that jumper?   Would you please elaborate for the noob on Barney's anti-PUA?   Hi mate. I broke my laptop a few days ago, and I've just realized AlienBlue doesn't receive PMs. So I won't be able to read what you've sent me until I've got access to another computer, which shouldn't be too long, but please don't think I'm ignoring you or that I don't care.    That's no problem. I'm sure I'd be equally offended if someone said that men don't have body image issues or a damaging media stereotype to live up to like women do.    Thank you. However, somebody evidently disagrees with you.    I'd say the reason for this is almost exclusively a focus in media on chivalrous and kind, door-opening, dinner-paying men, with a lot less representation of the dominant aspects that make them attractive, so as not to appear superior to women and offend the vocal and relatively new feminist community.    You're absolutely right. If they're not attractive, it's just not going to work. I think it really should come down to *awareness* of the exact things females find attractive (as opposed to the things that males think females find attractive) - ironically enough, I had no idea until I ventured into these parts of reddit.  I actually think a discussion of what both genders typically find attractive should actually be a core part of sexual education classes.    The first one at least is something they just to man up and deal with to get past, just like we do.    I never said women don't have dating struggles. I just don't know what they are, probably due to the fact that I'm 19 and reasonably inexperienced.    The reaction to a female showing her vagina would most likely be much less legative than that to a male displaying his penis.   	67

 Every single day for the past few months the thought of death has popped in my mind and I visualize as well too. Recently I decided to get these feelings off my chest and let someone know what has been going on in my head. Telling someone a friend that you feel comfortable, going through the sane thing or talk to a professional. I've been talking to one since August but it wasn't until almost a month ago i confessed to how i was feeling. It sucks waking up every day with nothing to look forward to, but telling someone how you feel and maybe meeting others that experience what your going through will help. I'm 21, you are so young do not give up! Keep your head up! Find something that distracts you. I watch movies and tv shows all the time. its the only thing that keeps me have a real smile on my face you are not alone    Correct    Which actress was originally casted to play Tiffany Maxwell in Sliver Linings Playbook, before Jennifer Lawrence was casted? (Hint this actress won an Oscar)   That's what movies are for! Guilty pleasures are the best. I have so many movies that I love that arent the best films but I love romantic movies. Some of them are not the best but I love them anyways like Something Borrowed and some are good like Sleepless in Seattle etc. As long as you enjoy them that all it matters.    So I watched the episode, I was wrong about Jeannie being somewhat involved with Lukes death. Look like Dre and his wife worked on it together (wasn't really clear). Overall, it was kind of a filler episode nothing really happened until the end with Marty and Jeannie. But, I saw a preview it looks like the aftermath of Jeannie telling her friend is going to happen next ep season finale. My guess someone gets put to jail.    His role in Sliver Linings Playbook, might not have been his best performance but I loved his role and Sliver Linings Playbook   Frozen no joke you will be singing the words after   Jennifer Lawrence in Sliver Linings Playbook the part where Pat (Bradley) is running after Tiffany after the diner scene where Tiffany said something like "I opened up to you and you judged me" basically I loved everything from that movie    Adam Sandler- I do not like his movies anymore.    It's hard, but it keeps me going. Find something even minor, it will help.    Every week I have something to look forward to. It can be a little thing like a bubble bath or going to see a movie or watching your Tv show. But that keeps me through the week knowing that on that day I'll be doing something fun   Yes!I'm excited for the next episode!    Now that you mention it, It looks like he planned the shooting    Your probably right!    To be honest- its just a theory I'm not sure but from what I got from the ep is The DA or whoever Jeannies friend was saying something like are you sure you want to do this, it will cause trouble etc. Then Lucas got shot? HMMM I think Jeannie might of said something that should of been kept a secret and it end up lucas being killed    I would just watch the whole series because in the show the characters do mention things that happen in the series and just knowing everything makes it easier    I thought the ep was going to be about the shooting because they showed it in the preview from last week. This ep only showed it at the endbut I guess we'll find out  about the aftermath this upcoming week. I like that the writers are finally going to show whats the whole deal between marty and jeannie. I think Jeannie caused this to happen because it looked like she told her client dirt on Dolla Hyde.    i was a bit disappointed too, but its hard to fit all the characters in the movie and get decent amount of screen time. I hope it does well because I do miss the characters and the show. I wonder if there is a new movie it will be her being a FBI agent. That was the plot for season 4 if it was picked up and it was kinda hinted in the movie with the Leo and Veronica scene    I thought it was good! It was nice to see many of the characters. I do hope more movies come from this. What about you?   Im def looking into getting it at the bookstore or amazon    I recently watched the series ever since I've been super psyched to watch the film. So I liked the film, but I don't know if it loved. I thought it was neat to bring everyone back to the reunion. I do hope for more movies because Veronica Mars is one of my favourite characters ever and I do hope more movies are made.   I just joined  lol i'm up for discussions    I don't know if this counts, but I was shocked that Sandra Bullock got nominated and won for the Blind Slide    Sleepless in Seattle    Pitch Perfect   She sounds crazy   50/50   You'll feel relieved after   That's okay, good luck on your stats assignment! It's good to let it all out!   Thank you for the comment, I'm scared because in the past I had told people about my dad having cancer and they don't respond so I'm scared that they are going to have the same reactions but I want to join a support group where I can meet others in similar situations but I will tell my friends I just got to get the courage too   At least you told your friends which I have to starting doing.   You should tell a professional, I haven't told my friends but I will soon because its important to have support group. It wasn't a easy thing to do, but now I know that i have it i feel a little bit better   CORRECT!    Walk to remember   Young-adult movie where the main male character makes a bet with his step sister who he has lots of sexual tension with and tries to sleep with this girl, but he ends up following in love with her. GUESS the movie!   Emma Stone- Oliver Penderghast in Easy A Tiffany Maxwell and Pat in Sliver Linings Playbook    I think Matthew won also because he has been known for his romantic stupid movies and he reinvented his career. He has been doing dramas recently and this is the first one that caught our eye and the academys   American Hustle   I would make the presenters be more entertaining, some of them are great but some are boring.    	39
 I have some hobbies, things that I used to think that I liked to do.   But I've come to realize that all of those things are really just distractions. I do them and I can't forget about feeling like shit for a little while.   I don't derive any happiness from the act of doing those things.    I've have bouts of depression since I was a teenager (I'm 33)  I've only recently recognized that I have depression (after hospitalization because I wanted to kill myself) but looking back I've had it basically forever.   I started taking medication 3 months ago and I feel better. But only just. I'm not great, I'm not happy.  I'm 'ok'.  I don't even remember a time when I was happy.   What's the point if I'm only going to be 'ok' for the rest of my life?   ^ This  I'm running his build and it is sweet   This is a huge change for both of you. It's totally natural to be stressed about it.   I think you'd be more excited if you guys had been together for a bit and he was coming back from a trip or extended stay somewhere.  But, as you said, you guys don't have that experience yet. You don't know that it's something to look forward to.   The thing is, it IS something to look forward to.  It's going to be stressful and you're going to argue and you're going to have bad days but you're both going to be with the one that you love and get to see them everyday. It's not going to be super happy times every minute but you guys can make it work if you want it (and I think it's obvious that you both want it).   You don't have to lay all your stress on him now but I'd suggest that you make sure to communicate when he's there with you. That's the key to keeping things smooth.    I used the one for the 360 and loved it.   I hadn't realized that they came out with one for the One.   That's getting shipped to me immediately.    Just because he doesn't have a plan for the future doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't want you as a part of his future. Some people just aren't planners.   You should talk to him and ask where he sees you guys going in the relationship. Does he even want to get married?  You don't need to give him an ultimatum but you need to tell him that you need this conversation to happen even if it makes him uncomfortable.   You have a right to know what his plans are for the future of your relationship. Or, if he doesn't have specific plans, just a general sense of where he wants it to go.   Does he want to get married? Does he want to get married but not right now? Does he just want to date you long term?  And then, you need to decide, based on his answers, if that's acceptable to you. Would you be ok staying with him knowing he wants to get married, just not immediately? Would you be ok if he never wanted to marry but still wanted a family with you?  Good luck, I hope everything works out well for you two.    I understand you feeling boring because your boyfriend hasn't had a 'first' with you.   But, you should listen to him when he says that he doesn't think you're boring. That's just your low self-confidence talking.   Also, the thing is, a lot of times the first time you do something, it isn't that great.   Instead of being caught up in being his 'first' whatever, you could try focusing on being his best something. Look at his interests and find something that you're into or would like to try. Something that you can really get into and do with him and he can have the best time ever doing it.   I'm not just talking about sexual things, it could be any interest.  He has chosen you as the girl he wants to be with so believe me, he's already having a great time doing some things with you. Honestly, doing things with someone you like to be around is so much better than doing it by yourself.   The flip side of this is since he is more experienced, think of all the first that you can have. Even if he has done it before, you haven't and that makes it special.   I would also suggest to him to stop telling you that he's done things before and if you're asking him, stop that.   It doesn't help your confidence and it also doesn't matter.  So what if it isn't your first slice of pizza, does that make it any less delicious?  I say no.    Of course you have a right to be jealous, you always have a right to your feelings.   What you need to ask yourself is if you think the jealousy is coming from a place of truth or just a feeling you're having. What I mean is, are you jealous because you think your boyfriend is thinking about/planning/already doing something inappropriate or are you jealous just because he's talking to pretty girls.  From your post I think it may be the latter.   That being said you need to talk to him further about this. Tell him that you are feeling uncomfortable that he only talks to pretty girls and you'd like it if he talked to you more (in French).   I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for his practice time to be split between you and his Skype conversations.   Maybe suggest that he have a Skype conversation with you if in person is too intimidating right now.   I would like to add that I am inclined to believe that his preference for talking to French-speaking girls is probably innocent. My guess is that he feels more relaxed speaking with them than men or older people and so he's able to get better practice.    Or you could find a book and order it online.   I enjoy going to bookstores which is why that was my first thought.   I think it's really great that you're trying to make things better instead of just letting things go on the same way.   And your fianc sounds like he really supports you which is AWESOME.   It sounds like you have a great relationship and I wish you guys nothing but happiness and orgasms.    I think #1 you need to talk to your fianc about these things.   Let him know that you get distracted and that you want to not be distracted. Maybe you guys can come up with a solution together.   You could try setting a time limit like you're only going to touch each other for 5 minutes and then you take a break. It will add a component of anticipation to your play.   Additionally, the research that you are doing into more interesting things, I'm going to suggest that you involve your fianc. Ask him look at what you're looking at. Go to a book store and pick out a book that you guys can read together. You guys can discuss things that look fun to both of you that you want to try (now and later).   And you could incorporate those fantasies into your current play. Find a position or act that turns you on and then you guys can talk about it in bed. Thinking about that could keep you in the moment.    I should say, in no way do I think he is deserving of anyone's time.   However, I can't make that decision for her which is what I was trying to say.   My wife cheated on me and I would never consider reconciliation with her but not everyone feels the same as I (or you) do.   I know two different couples who have moved past infidelity and are still together but I don't know that I could ever do that.    You can't get stuck on the what ifs.   All you can do is look forward.  I think it's good that you have your own place away from him. You need time to think on things and what you want to do going forward and it will be easier if you're not around him.   You need to figure out what YOU want to do. Not what he wants or what his mom or friends want. Not what your family wants, what YOU want.  You're the only one who can make this decision and that's the way it should be because you're the one who has to live with it.   I understand things are shitty now. I totally get what you're saying about your chaotic emotions.   I'm going through a divorce right now and in many ways I'm in the same place.   But things will get better. I'm not saying you'll feel better about what he did but you will find a way to move past it, either with him or without.      As you stated having learned from this sub, communication is key!  You did what you could to keep the lines of communication open. Asking about new things he wanted to try, making time in your (understandably) busy schedule to be with him and have sex, etc.   The thing is, he didn't do everything that HE could.   I can totally understand you feeling like a failure because of what he has done but what you need to remember and what you will believe in time is that it is not your fault. At all.   This is his failing. He had insecurities, as we all do, but instead of dealing with them maturely with a therapist or by discussing them with you, he sought sex from strangers.   He probably is sorry and his willingness to open himself and his movements to you speaks to his regret.   What you need to decide is if you think you'd ever be able to trust him again.   If you decide to continue the relationship you guys definitely need therapy together. You need to figure out how to move past this and you need to learn how to communicate with each other.   But, if you don't want to continue the relationship then no one can fault you for that decision. And making that decision doesn't indicate failure on your part.   I repeat, this is his failure.   Good luck.    You are definitely not wrong to want to be in touch with your sexuality.   It is as much a part of you as your eyes or fingers.   I am not a religious person at all but humans are sexual creatures, we have to be or none of us would be here. It's how we reproduce!  I don't see why there's any reason you can't be comfortable with who you are both sexually and spiritually.   What you need to do is find people who you can talk to about things in a positive way. Maybe a therapist or your school counselor. Also, your friend that you mentioned (the veteran) might be a good choice since you've already spoken with him about your history and he's been supportive.   Whatever you do, know that there is nothing wrong with wanting or enjoying sex. There's nothing wrong with you, no matter what your family/culture are telling you.   Good luck!    So I found a note book my wife is writing to her boyfriend or lover or whatever he is.   Apparently it's his birthday today and she's been trying to come up with something special to do for him and her idea is to write down song lyrics that remind her of him and 'bring him closer to her heart'  Here's the irony: the last song she's written in the book (so far) is I Won't Give Up by Jason Mraz. She's writing to him a song about not giving up on someone at the same time that she's cheating on her husband. Here's the lyrics if you've never heard the song:  When I look into your eyes It's like watching the night sky Or a beautiful sunrise Well, there's so much they hold And just like them old stars I see that you've come so far To be right where you are How old is your soul?  Well, I won't give up on us Even if the skies get rough I'm giving you all my love I'm still looking up  And when you're needing your space To do some navigating I'll be here patiently waiting To see what you find  'Cause even the stars they burn Some even fall to the earth We've got a lot to learn God knows we're worth it No, I won't give up  I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am  I won't give up on us Even if the skies get rough I'm giving you all my love I'm still looking up, I'm still looking up.  Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up) God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved) We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved) God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)  I won't give up on us Even if the skies get rough I'm giving you all my love I'm still looking up  	15
 That's about the 4th repost I've seen today. And I've only been on here for about 10 minutes.    Your life must be so awesome   If I had a penny for every time I've heard or seen this phrase on reddit I'd probably have 14 cents.   Just as I thought OP was a cool guy   What has reddit become...    Fucking hell reddit, grow up! You all sound like a bunch if 12 year olds... When did it come to this   To be fair, OP never said the turtle was alive...    Stupid people piss me off   The fact that you claim it's yours when it clearly isn't makes me more mad than it probably should.   Would you rather I have a username such as "childrapist4004"    You're an awful boyfriend.       Why so much One Direction on reddit?   Repost   Galaxy *   Kill yourself    You mean.. there are other ways?   Repost. OP, you are a fag   you mean find this kids parents.   Happened to me way too many times...    What is this? A screenshot for ants?       I just saw this on my news feed and KNEW it would make its way to reddit. It's the little victories...     	24
 When I read meter I think of a parking meter.    Aw didn't see that!    The article from which I stole the title: http://www.msn.com/en-au/news/world/nilo-the-donkeys-petting-zoo-escape-foiled-by-unexpected-manhole/ar-BBdb4zH?ocid=iehp   I used the other one because it has more details.  Also the donkey is fine!!      Beggars can't be choosers.. someone's giving you something for free. Suck it up if you occasionally get something you don't want.   My husband started going for evening walks with me. He is a good listener so just listens to me while we walk. The fresh air does me good and although I don't feel 100% it just calms me a little. It kinda makes each day just a little bit more bearable.    Yeah I know, just wanted to try it out to see how it was.   Whenever I lift up things in the garden it's always redbacks.   I used myGov for the first time this year. It's faster to fill out but having done my tax with e-tax for as long as I can remember it feels like I'm missing out on possible tax deductions...   I also really missed all the useful help buttons and the depreciation calculator.    Thanks for sharing this. I hadn't read it before. My family has been unlucky and had lots of cancer deaths in the last 2 generations from bowel, cervical, lung and leukaemia. One aunt on each side has had breast cancer and both survived when none of the others have, so I do wish there was more funding for some of the other areas.   Thundamentals rocked it. They did do their brother cover! They also got a verse in Cosby Sweater along with K21 who has an amazing stage presence. Apparently the first time they've done that together on this tour. I filmed it from my phone tho its not as good as being there obviously - http://youtu.be/I-AjnIapqCY   I was actually at the hospital earlier this week getting a scan and the nurse was injecting a cannula into my vein to deliver the contrasting agent.   As I'm clenching my fist waiting for a needle she turns back to me and looks at my arm and says very thoughtfully "Ahhh it's good to be young and have nice healthy veins..." and then jabs me with the needle.  My response was "uhh yeah, I guess so... I've never considered that before..."    I saw Hilltop Hoods last night along with K21 and Thundamentals! It was awesome. I've never been to a hip hop gig before. Love Australian music.    Where most of the west has been bended.  Do you think, do you think we'll mend it?  No I guess it's only Perth we'll just defend it.   (Just kidding. Perth rocks.)    I didn't know this before but oreodory fish are a bad choice of fish to eat. They are not managed well from a fisheries point of view.   http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/what-we-do/publications/the-best-fish-guide-/fish-species-/oreos/deepwater-dory  Oh and E is bad.  "Description:Oreos are deepwater fish that are long-lived (up to 150 years) and slow growing, making them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure and overfishing. There are three commercial species in New Zealand, but they are all managed as one quota management species. They are predominantly found in deep waters off the east and south of the South Island and off the Chatham Islands. Jointly with snapper, mako shark and southern bluefin tuna, oreos have the second worst ecological ranking on the Best Fish Guide of any commercial fishery in New Zealand.  Ecological concerns:Management of the three oreo species as one, a declining stock trend, uncertainty over stock boundaries, lack of stock assessments in some areas, unknown sustainability of catch limits and lack of a management plan. Attempts to improve research in the oreo fishery have been hampered by the seafood industry challenging and preventing the Ministry of Fisheries from commissioning research surveys.   Also of great concern is the destructive impact of deep sea trawling on seamount habitats and high levels of non target fish bycatch. There is also a bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds.   Economic value:Key markets are the USA, Australia, Germany and Switzerland, with smooth oreo being the main market species. Exports were worth $7.47 million in 2008.  ASSESSMENT OUTPUT  Biology and risk of overfishing (score E) Status and sustainability of fish catches (score D) Impact of fishing method and protected, threatened and endangered species captures (score E and D) Management and management unit (score B and E)     There was a well written back story on ebola including the efforts from Samaritans Purse in our paper today: http://m.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-world-let-ebola-spread-20141007-10rh8r.touch.touch.html   To the people going to West Africa to help. Thank you. The truth is that so many of us are cowards - too scared for our own lives to risk them in helping others. You are the best and bravest of us. You are probably scared just like the rest of us, worrying about the moment you might make a small mistake that would be the difference between life and death, but you go anyway. You go because you believe that without you, someone might suffer and die alone. Without you, there might be no one else to care for someone who else who was unlucky enough to catch the disease. While the media continues to discuss avoidance, you know they are a person just like us - a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a daughter or son. Instead of running away you run to those who need you most in the world. You are someone's true hero.    Great photos.   One question though - how come two people didn't lift the mattress to wherever they are taking it rather than dragging it across the ground? Wouldn't that [spread any bodily fluids on the mattress](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/)?    I believe UNICEF are doing a range of things which include education within communities, supply of hygene products, medical supplies, medical training, protective equipment, vehicles and assisting with burial. They are also helping kids who've lost both parents to ebola and have been abandoned by their extended families to be cared for. They are training medical and support staff.   They are a large organisation with more resources than some of the others so may not get as much specific attention, but they are doing their bit. For the record I have no preference for a particular organisation - they all need our support. I'm just hoping to provide more information here.   Some examples from http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/world-bank-group-ebola-fact-sheet :  * World Bank Group funds have already financed a first shipment of 100 tons of essential health and hygiene supplies (worth $1.6 million), which were procured and delivered by UNICEF to Liberia on Aug. 26. Among the items in the shipment were hundreds of sets of personal protective equipment, latex gloves, thermometers, syringes, and other medical supplies to restock depleted stores at many of the countrys health facilities.  * On Sept. 5, UNICEF procured and delivered 48 tons of materials and essential drugs for Ebola treatment centers (antibiotics and other essential medicines, cannula, coveralls to protect health workers, 7,440 pairs of latex gloves, and body bags) to Sierra Leone (worth $850,000), also financed by the World Bank Group. On Sept. 17, also with World Bank Group financing, UNICEF airlifted a second delivery to Sierra Leone (worth $1.7 million), of 100 tons of drugs and equipment, including personal protective equipment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and chlorine.  * On Sept. 9, UNICEF procured and delivered 28 new, all-terrain vehicles to the Guinea Ministry of Health (worth $880,000). These vehicles will provide much-needed ground logistics support to treatment, supervision, contact monitoring, and burial teams working in Guinea. A second lot of vehicles will include ambulances for patient transfers and motorbikes for contact monitoring in remote, hard-to-reach villages.    More examples from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_75900.html :  Examples of such effort by UNICEF and its partners include:  * With support from the World Bank, Japan and USAID, airlifting 544 metric tonnes of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with almost 50 flights since early August. These supplies include protective equipment, hygiene items and essential medicines.  * Supporting the Government of Sierra Leone in conducting a three-day public awareness campaign, 19-21 September, by helping train volunteers and providing accurate information on Ebola.  * Installing water and sanitation facilities in Ebola treatment units in the three countries.  * Training community health volunteers, teachers and others and help spread life-saving information on Ebola.  * Working to avert non-Ebola disease outbreaks and provide basic services to women and children.  * Providing psychosocial support to children affected by Ebola.  Another example from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_76239.html :   * 10 October 2014  A cargo plane with nearly 100 metric tons of essential medical supplies left Amsterdam today en route to Sierra Leone as part of UNICEFs continuing response to the Ebola outbreak ravaging parts of West Africa. Similar flights are planned for Liberia and Guinea, part of a 1 million donation from the European Commissions Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO). Todays shipment includes protective equipment such as masks, gloves, aprons, coveralls, body bags, goggles, face shields as well as medicine and hygiene supplies to be distributed to households and health centers. This supply has been funded by donors, such as the World Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DFID).  To date, UNICEF has flown in more than 912 metric tons of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in what is now the largest airlift operation of Ebola supplies.

I didn't see this but I gave money to Unicef earlier. They're a large organisation and I think they have more resources. They put a similar perceantage of your donation into field work (Not sure what it is where you are but in Australia it's 78% of the money you donate goes to field work, while doctors without borders puts about 4% more ie. 82% of the money to field work).   Refs:  http://www.unicef.org.au/Donate.aspx  http://www.msf.org.au/donate/what-your-donations-help-us-achieve/how-your-donations-are-used.html     I just look at the taps and bottles and pick something randomly.    The actual bill can be downloaded here: http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/s969_first-senate/toc_pdf/1417820.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf  And there was an article in the smh a few days ago highlighting the main changes you should be aware of: http://m.smh.com.au/digital-life/consumer-security/terror-laws-clear-senate-enabling-entire-australian-web-to-be-monitored-and-whistleblowers-to-be-jailed-20140926-10m8ih.touch.html   Nice one. A smile is something most of us take for granted. You look so much happier now :D    Lol yeah. The piece of prawn was the same size as him!    Reminds me of this crab we unintentionally fed when going fishing... http://i.imgur.com/nPqdD.jpg   If you frame the ratings in the context of a terrorist warning system it kind of makes sense. http://www.fire.tas.gov.au/Show?pageId=colFireDangerRatings  Catastrophic = leave early  Extreme = leave early  Severe = prepare to leave early  Very high = prepare to leave  High = prepare   Low-Medium = continue as usual    If I had a piece of rubbish after leaving the office I would have to wait until I got home around 1.5 hours later to dispose of it. No bins at my city stop, 1 hour train ride, no bins at destination stop, 10 min wait for the bus, 15 min ride home, 5 min walk from bus stop. Yeah, so I'm going to leave it at the station. Because at least cleaners will usually come along and pick it up there as opposed to throwing it on the street. I suppose that makes me irresponsible but it's the truth and why my station was always littered with people's rubbish.    It doesn't mean people hate you though. It's hard to find people that you can connect with. It also takes a lot of time and effort to build up friendships.   Aside from friends, do you think you could change anything to make things better for yourself?    You would love the big pineapple! http://lettiemusic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-big-pineapple-near-nambour-queensland.jpg   Yeah true, but I was really referring to this particular incident, where they were driving dangerously and probably didn't mean to harm the person in the car but did as a result of their dangerous driving.    Well I think you only get charged with manslaughter if you actually kill someone accidentally. Otherwise you get charged with endangering someone's life.    If you are in Australia there is an organisation called "R U OK?". It's been around for a few years.   They did some advertising a couple of years ago but I haven't heard anything in a while. They were trying to have a regular "R U OK? Day".   I think it's a great idea to remind people to be there for each other.  Is there anything like that in the US and UK?    Our next R U OK day is 11 Sept, but it's just a yearly awareness reminder to look out for other people and we should be doing that all the time.   I don't know if it is true for you but for me sometimes it is just my thought process and how I view the world. What someone might see in one way I see in a completely different way.   I was told to try to capture when I am sad, unhappy, angry and so on, and try to identify the triggers. In doing that I can understand what my thought process is and potentially redirect it more positively. I am still struggling with this and need help to see the flaws in my thought process. Most of the time I am really hard on myself. I guess this is going to take time.   No problems at all. I hope that if I can pass on some things that have taken me years to learn about myself, maybe it will give you a different perspective and/or make it easier for you to learn about yourself.   It took a while for me to get out of the mindset of being isolated. I am not saying to follow my path but explaining where I came from and how things changed. If I could have changed things earlier I would have had a better life sooner.   I've always been a bit different to other people and when I was in high school and university that was really to my detriment. I was very lonely for a very long time and also very depressed. But the hurt that I suffered made me strive for a better life so that I could be independent financially and have more control over my own life. That was my #1 priority. I struggled and worked really hard to do that. I wasn't successful at first, in fact, the opposite, so I worked even harder. Years later, I got there and got the independence I wanted. You'd think by then, being successful, I would be happy right? But by this point I'd gotten into a habit of striving for perfection, and I was not at all happy with myself. I was always thinking I wasn't good enough and putting myself down in my head. Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself. And that is when I let other people in, once I could be okay with myself and not always judge myself in a negative way. It was hard at first and people did let me down occasionally but I suppose in the end I learnt my own self-worth and it made me more resilient. I am still closed off a little bit and don't let people in so easily and freely as other people but I feel comfortable at this level of disclosure. :)  What I hope you can take away from all of my lessons is that you are a worthy person. People always say "nobody's perfect" but it's become a cliche and it's almost a throwaway comment as it doesn't really matter about everyone else, 'cause we're talking about you. You're not perfect, and that's completely okay. You are a valuable person who matters. You can live your life in a way that means something to you. You do need to be careful with your trust but not completely abandon giving trust to people. How do you know who you can trust? You said you had a friend who asked about you? Well think about what's in it for him? It seems to me like probably not much, except that he cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay. If you ask yourself what's in it for the other person it can ease your mind a little bit that they don't have an ulterior motive. If you're not sure, then proceed with caution, until you have time to learn more about them.   I know that was long winded but I hope it helps.     It could be. When people hurt you it's hard to trust anyone. Opening up is about trust because you're letting someone get to know you and you always feel there is a chance they won't like you and the rejection can hurt. Really though I think it takes a lot for someone to honestly dislike someone. The people who did that to you are mean but they're not the majority of people. I think there are more people like that in school and I'm not sure if they even really know how much they hurt others.  I think the point I'm trying to get to is trust comes in degrees. There are some people who you should be able to trust enough to talk to. From what you said it sounds like you already know who that is. Some people you need to be more wary of. I think it's important to differentiate between those people. It's hard to trust people but it's also hard to live life alone.   I was also hurt but in a different way and I think all the same things as you sometimes. I have changed though from isolating myself and can open up more now but I am much more selective who I trust these days. I like having people to share my life with but it's all about having the right people. I'm not compatible with everyone.    Sounds like a lot of stuff has been happening. Maybe it's the uncertainty and changes that are causing you to feel unsettled?   Being around other people is different to feeling like you have companions. Sometimes I have walked through the city and seen hundreds of people but felt completely and utterly alone. I start to think it's sad and then I realise that I don't want to know them all because I like my anonymity. But then I'm alone and I want someone to be with me but not just anyone...  Whoever this person is online they don't sound good for you. Sometimes people who want something from you are the easiest to talk to but not the best. I don't know how, but try to find someone else to talk to. There are people around who will listen and not try to manipulate you while doing so.      What happened? :(   In terms of what impression you give you can't really know without asking. Even then it's a bit murky. I think you just have to reflect yourself. Think of ways other people act that you like e.g. giving compliments (if you like that) and try to do the same, and of ways people act that you don't like e.g. being too direct (again, if you don't like that) and try to avoid that. It's not really black and white - for example, most of the time I like people being fairly straightforward but the timing is important. Giving me very direct critical feedback when I'm under a lot of pressure and asking for help is possibly not the best idea.   If you think people are intimidated to talk to you maybe it is just your manner. Do you think perhaps you could be coming across as arrogant? Or maybe just not open to continuing conversation. It's pretty hard to talk to someone who doesn't add details to the conversation or respond with questions. One thing some people do is talk about themselves but forget to talk to others or take any interest in the other person's responses.   I'm not sure why you think you might come across as a jerk? Did someone say something to you?  Maybe you're just going through an introverted cycle. I go from being extroverted and really gaining energy from social interactions to an introvert who really loses energy from being around other people. It goes in cycles and really depends what else is going on in my life. Could this be the case with you?   It's good you got to talk to her.   Maybe you need to process the depressive thoughts you have before they pop up out of the blue. I know for me if I ignore them then I actually start getting really vivid and horrible nightmares. Some have been so bad I have woken up crying or throwing up. So I have to write stuff out and try to process it while I am conscious or else the emotions come out when I don't want them to. The weird thing is sometimes I don't even feel like anything is wrong while I'm awake but I'm sure I'm stressed or anxious and I'm just suppressing it.  I mean you might have a different result than me, but maybe it could help?   Yeah :( I have heard other people on here mention community or church groups if you need someone to lend an ear? Sometimes it just helps for someone to listen to you so you can talk about it and process all the thoughts and feelings you are going through.    That sounds exhausting for him.    If the pain is temporary I suppose just remind him that it'll be over soon. It's not a way to live but I really hope the specialists and doctors he is seeing can provide a way forward for him that isn't so debilitating.   I don't really know what else you can say or do, except to be there. I think it means a lot to have someone there supporting him so he doesn't feel alone.     You can talk to me?   Can you apologise to her for saying whatever you said? It sounds to me like you're genuinely sorry about it.  Was there some event that made you feel depressed or was it just sort of out of the blue? For me it's usually both :(   You've been through a lot and suffered a lot of hurt so I'm not surprised you are feeling low. From what you have said it sounded like you were in a toxic relationship and it's good that you have walked away from that. Nobody deserves to be treated like that.   And also, there is no way you deserved to be raped. It's crazy that people would say that to you! They're outright wrong.   You need to give yourself some time to process everything you've just been through. I hope you realise that however bad you feel, you deserve to live a life where you don't have to feel alone and where each day doesn't feel like a struggle. You said you moved in with your mom, can you stay there a while until you feel more stable and can start to pick the pieces up again?   It is terribly sad when someone dies, and knowing that the world will continue without them feels like a horrifying prospect. Some people I have lost I wonder why the world didn't just end right then, and just not bother to continue existing.   But then I remember other people in my life, and although I am terribly stricken and sad that I have lost someone who is so important to me, I remember the other people I love and who have shown love for me and I hold onto that, and I try to be a kinder and better person for them.    Sites like  www.freelancer.com or www.elance.com. I think there are a few others but I can't remember their names.  There's also other things like www.airtasker.com or www.taskrabbit.com where you can do little jobs for people.     What about looking at some of the jobs on some of the online freelancing websites? They don't pay very much but then it's something you can add to your resume and it might help to show you have some initiative?    Wow that sucks. They sound completely unprofessional. :(   I had a really bad one when I was younger, who gave me horrible advice. It's good you recognised this early and can walk away.   Is there anywhere else you can go instead? Like not a different doctor, but a different facility altogether?    Nope. It sounds like you have been busy with other things so I don't see why that would be a problem. My first job was when I was 21 and it was at Kmart.    One thing that has taken me ages to accept is that it's okay to not be perfect, or even far from it. Before I was always frustrated with myself and I always felt like I would never be good enough. I don't know why, but knowing that gives me a level of confidence.   When people reject me in interviews, I try not to take it personally, although it always is a bit. But what I try to do is to see an interview as a performance, and if I do that then it's something that I can work on, rather than it being a rejection of me as a person. If I can't find a good reason for the rejection then I blame them and convince myself that they're a company I don't want to work for anyway. :D    Yeah I wish people would do that more often too. Do you have any friends or family that might know of jobs? The job I have now is because a friend recommended me.    The first full-time job I got took ages to get. I had an undergraduate degree but didn't have good grades. I started applying for receptionist roles because there weren't any positions in my field. When I started getting rejected from those it was really hard to take. I felt like I'd wasted years of my life and achieved nothing. But I kept trying anyway even though it felt hopeless and eventually someone gave me a chance. I think it took 6 months to get that first job. I think the first job is always the hardest because not many people are willing to take a chance. I'm so grateful to the person that gave me my first full-time job. It's not just you, it's a difficult first step.   Oh and tips for getting a job - mainly just keep trying. Also I don't know if you have already but try to get a character reference to support your application - seeing as you have no prior non-military experience that will help. Maybe after you've been turned down by someone, try asking for feedback. Not many people are willing to give it but if they do it may help you. I don't think not having used a cash register is a good reason - maybe there was some other reason? I'm not saying to probe for it but if you reflect on the interview do you think it could it have been something else?   What about reading a book? Or listening to music? Or going for a jog? Watching a movie? Playing video games? Drawing? I'm not sure. Just something, anything really, to get your mind off it. Is there anything you used to enjoy doing? Maybe you could take a course or something and learn something new, and meet new people?  I guess none of us ever really learn with love. I think we all want to have someone in our lives and we can't help but keep taking those risks and even though we know it might hurt like hell, we hope that it works out - sometimes it doesn't, but then maybe you only need it to work out once.    I had the same thing the other day. I wanted to call but I didn't want to block up the line from people who really needed it.   I think you just need a friend to talk to. It sounds like you have the tools to do it but need someone to lend their ear so you can reason it all out.   If you want to chat I'm all ears.   It's hard looking at other people's lives and comparing yours. The thing is nobody will ever have a life just like someone else's. How do you know if someone else is going to be happy? Why aren't all those people with lots of money and a loving family happy? What about those people that seem to have it all? A lot of stuff happens that other people don't always see.   In terms of catching up, I honestly think people are busy/lazy/preoccupied, and until they have really gotten to know you, they mightn't go out of their way to catch up. Even friends that do know each other don't catch up as they should sometimes. I know I do it sometimes, and it doesn't mean I don't care, just that I'm not perfect and I kinda suck at doing things in a timely way. It might be up to you a bit.   One of the hardest thing for me was moving jobs and realising when I moved that all those people I thought were my friends seemed to have no interest in keeping in contact with me once I left, which felt really weird seeing as I'd seen them every day for 3 years. I even spent lunch hours talking to one girl about all her problems. The first 6-12 months after I left and joined the new company I was so lonely. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I didn't know why people didn't try to contact me, even an email, anything. I'd joined a consulting company and everyone was out on clients and too busy to talk to me, so I was basically by myself. I am on projects by myself often and I often eat alone. After a year I finally made a couple of friends though, we still aren't that close, but that's ok. I think that is going to take a long time.   But I did contact my old work friends, and not all of them, but some of them made the time to see me. It just took me to take the initiative. After doing that a couple of times now they do ask me out sometimes.   Would you consider trying to see the other friends again?    :( That is really tough. You took a risk with your heart and it hurts. If I could hug you through the internet I would.   I suppose the best advice I can give you is to try to do things to keep your mind off of it. Sure you're going to think about it sometimes but if you're busy then hopefully not as much.    I think most people want to be in a relationship and be close to someone, and of course rejection hurts. If you feel hurt by that then feeling dislike towards someone else is entirely natural.   It can be hard to find someone who is compatible with you in life. From looking at friends I have, it seems to be entirely random. It's not that one person is better than the other, it's just that things happened in their life that led them to meet this other person who also felt the same way.   I don't think there is a secret formula to finding that person. I know a lot of people who are older and single and entirely unhappy about it, and also entirely undeserving - they're nice people - and it's not like they wanted that, just how their life turned out. What I'm trying to say I suppose is that to some extent it is out of your control, and I know this is hard to take, but you might have to figure out how to be happy with yourself and on your own before you find that other person that can make you feel complete.    Hey I think amp3rsand gave some good advice.   It's going to take time to get through the grief and you don't want to have extra stress hanging over you. What's a "good" job worth if it's not good for you.   I also think travelling could be a great idea once you have sorted out the legal stuff. Travelling made me feel free, when before that I had felt so trapped. If that's what you want to do, go for it.    Sorry, I should have read that from what you said.   Well, for me, I just tried lots of different things. Some I liked, some I didn't like. I think pick one thing that is with other people, and one thing you do alone to begin with. Sometimes I like being around other people, and sometimes I really just want to be alone, so it's good having different types of things to choose from.  Some things I have done on my own are: * I wanted to learn how to crochet, so I just bought myself a crochet needle and some wool and learnt from youtube. * I wanted to learn how to make my hair less boring, so I got a straightening iron and learnt how to curl it on youtube.  * I wanted to learn how to write a phone app, so I tried that out, and that's fun. It's good to see something on your phone when you get to that point. It's also something that's a bit more involved so keeps me entertained for longer and stops me from thinking too much.  * I also really like writing, so sometimes I write stories, fiction and non-fiction. I also like writing blogs about stuff I know about and people are actually pretty grateful when you help them out with stuff. Some of my most successful blog posts have been about really simple things.  Some things I do with others are: * I started volunteering with a friend. I don't like sitting around in cafes that much so it's good to keep yourself busy while being able to talk to your friend/s. * I play field hockey, and it's good but it's only half a year. Still, I enjoy it. I'm no olympian, it's purely social but it's great like that.  * Next week I'm going rock climbing with a friend. I haven't been for a very long time but I figured why not try it. I don't really think I'll like it but I'm going to go anyway and see. Sometimes I change my mind.  I guess when you find the thing you like you can invest more energy in it. I think that sort of happens naturally. And then because you invest energy in it you get better at it and it becomes your thing.   Hey, I'm glad you shared your story.  I read the whole thing and really feel for you.  Why did you and your girlfriend split up?   Is there anyone else you would consider to be close in your life right now?   There's nothing wrong with feeling better and telling other people about it. :)    Beautiful. Reminds me of the waterfalls at Treble Cone a bit, but more magnificent. :)    Is there anything you enjoy doing right now?   I don't think happy is the right word, but yeah, better for having talked about things.    Have you tried the Google Translate app? Apparently you can take a photograph and it will translate the text in the photograph for you. I haven't really tried it but you sound like a good tester! :) There is another one called Photo Translate.   It sucks that the expat community wasn't nice to you. I heard sometimes it's better to help you integrate into a community to try to make friends with locals anyway. Is there any chance of that? Are there any korean people you could hang with?   For some people, depression comes and goes, and for others it is a lifelong battle. The latter is true for me. It never really went away, and it took me so long to realise that it might not. When I realised that after about 15 years I was horrified at first. But resigning to that fact meant that I had to deal with it, as much as I didn't want to. Having depression doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't moments and things that are worth living for, even if the world is dark and you can't see that right now. I hope you do get to see that.   One other thing I want to say is that while drugs and therapists are there to help, I do sometimes think that ultimately it is down to you to figure out what it is that helps you get by and what it is that makes life bearable for you. It might not be a short battle but it sounds like you have caring family and friends and resources available to help you in whatever way they can. I know you resent that you can't make that choice, and I did too, but those people care about you and they're just trying to help.    Glad I could be there to listen.   Oh I can see a tinge of blue in the light. That's going to look great. :)   Good luck. I hope it goes well.    Yay. What color did you make it? I always wanted blue streaks.    I'd give you money for lunch. I would never be too tired to make sure a friend could eat. :(   First, congratulations on finishing one of your goals. You don't have to feel overwhelming joy about it. You can recognise it for what it is though - an achievement. You've done well.   Happiness is separate I think. It isn't about summing up success and subtracting the failures. I remember finishing something that was important to me and not really being that happy about it just feeling like.. ok great... what now? And then feeling a bit lost cause I had no idea, I'd never thought that far ahead before. I only had a plan up until that moment. You know what that means though? Now you can try doing other things and see what excites you. And it doesn't have to be achievements or stuff other people value, just stuff that you value.    Can you do your own cooking? Sometimes it's hard to find exactly what you want if you're eating out often.    Maybe you can find a hobby that lets you meet other singles like yourself. And I don't mean necessarily for the purposes of finding a girlfriend. I mean people who enjoy being single who you can hang with.    How about some adjective that doesn't describe that it was good/bad. That's what I generally do with questions related to asking how my day was. Like saying it was busy or quiet. This doesn't work that well if people want to ask more questions about it. Generally just saying "good" is the easiest way to have no follow up questions.    By the way, sorry about the slow replies. My reddit connection kept dropping in and out for some reason. :(   Yeah I agree that person is a dick.   You don't need to be entitled or have specific problems to be depressed, you can just feel crappy. Also, who says your problems don't matter? Let it out if you want to...   I think you do need to talk about it not just bottle it up.   Sometimes it is hard talking to friends though because then you are letting them into a very personal part of who you are and it takes a lot of trust in another person to do that.  But I also think that's what friends are for. Maybe you just need to find that person who is non-judgmental and who you can trust.  Another option is maybe talking to a psychologist or counselor? Then it's private between you and them.   It does sound like you are doing the best you can. And you're helping. You have taken on a lot of responsibility in taking care of your two little sisters. It does sound like he doesn't appreciate it but that's not to say it shouldn't be appreciated.   I can't say why he is yelling at you but it sounds like it might be more to do with him than it is to do with you.   It's hard to not care when you're faced directly with the situation. You sound like you just want it to be better and it isn't happening.   Is this a once off thing or has this been going on for a while? Could you talk to your mum about his behavior and how it is making you feel?   I don't think you're just being emotional and overdramatic. Your feelings are real.   What makes you feel like you're a failure? Is part of that because you feel like your parents don't value what you have to say?    You can talk to me. What's on your mind?    I used to sleep in my car sometimes. The worst thing was the seat belt plugs. This is a great idea.    I switched to Pepsi Max and it made me pee urgently so now I'm back to coke zero or diet coke with no caffeine. I should really stop :(   I did this for a short time and the doc said that binge eating like that can be a thyroid condition. If you are doing this a lot you should check out if you have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A blood test can tell you.   I ate maccas everyday for 6 months cause I was working full time and studying and didn't have time for a lunch break. It was so convenient to drive through and eat at traffic lights. I got pretty sick :(  Recently I hadn't had maccas in months and then I got it the other day and sat next to a really stinky homeless guy. Now I associate maccas with smelly people and I don't crave it. KFC is so much better :) Luckily it's not convenient for me.   Drinking coke zero. I know it's stupid and it should be easy to stop but it's everywhere. It started out as a way to have a break from the office for 5-10 mins and now it is a fully ingrained habit. It's not even supposed to be addictive. It's just delicious.    I did this. It's so painful. You gotta just keep trying to let go. Think of the months or years you are wasting on someone who is not reciprocating. If you keep enjoying life and doing the things you want to do you will hopefully meet someone more worthy.    There are some guys who hand out leftover bread at Central Station near the tram stop around 7pm. Does anyone know what charity these guys are?    Edit: Didn't read that properly   What? 60km? As long as you're in Australia I'll post you them if you want them that badly lol.   I also want them that badly but it is more like 1km away for me. :)   On second read they only store partial credit card details. Some companies do this for fraud detection.  E.g. last 4 digits and expiry which is enough to identify you but not to use your card.   I think they are allowed to store your credit card details if they are PCI compliant: http://www.cio.com.au/article/400300/what_pci_compliance_/  Although my understanding is that they can't store your CVV.  They probably just did it for your convenience, but maybe that was a bad decision.   I think the biggest problem is that this is so long ago... and they didn't tell anyone :/   Ah thanks for that. I remember now. I think your advice is pretty good. I am 31 and time does fly when you're older but it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think the main thing is being busy due to spending a lot of time in full time work. My advice would be to always make time for yourself and for the things that are important to you, and especially to organize some down time for yourself. Always being busy makes it feel like it's going quickly... but it doesn't have to be that way. When you're younger you can try lots of things and have lots of time for random stuff. When you're working full time you need to be a bit more selective. One thing that changes is when you have a job you have more freedom over what you do with your time and the money you earn. I try to live a life of experiences.    The original post was deleted and now I can't remember what this was about :/   If you are fortunate enough to have a good life, give a little. Help a friend or family member out or volunteer. Thinking of others in need and not always about yourself gives your life some perspective.   Don't worry if you're not perfect. It's okay. You're perfect as you are with all your imperfections. Don't spend your life trying to live up to someone else's expectations. Live the life that you want.  And if your family isn't happy, well that sucks, but you're not alone. And people do care about you.   	95
 gender is neurological/psychological, so it exists (it is not a social construct) even observable behavior patterns for each gender are real  but yea, if there is no 'defined sets of genders, there is no 'transitioning,' you can be born and well what gender are you?? we can't define it if we didn't have male or female.  people think gender roles are checklists, when i see it as more of a guideline. and it just happens, no, someone did not sit down and said, girls will like to shop and boys will prefer sports. Rather, it just happens that these trends are true.   in all other languages, the masculine version just gets used in a group of male and female  no one seems to have a problem with that  why should English?   I met a girl, in a club space. She explicitly told me she was cis (I hate that term by the way) and then a week later turned genderfluid. We don't talk anymore.  transtrenders claim that dysphoria is not necessary; they might change pronouns on a daily basis. Moreover, you can tell they're just doing it for oppression points or whatever.   Serious question  If you are talking to a transgender (person), you would refer to them using you (as you should unless you have quirks that make you use third person referencing in a conversation).  I might refer to a transgender(person): friend (gender neutral), person (gender neutral), but almost never use he/she/they?   and even if I do refer to them in third person pronouns, they wouldn't be in audible range (to be offended)? (note I'm not saying I want to misgender nor do I not respect their pronouns, I'm speaking theoretically)  for example, I met this person the other day, he was nice and she bought me ice cream. Afterwards, they went home safely. This person doesn't know I'm talking about him/her/them.  so yea, I've almost never had to use their pronouns. Now if you are going to tell me, I just used it here, I would argue I could've used any and they wouldn't know about it.   she asked for advice on reddit 2 months before it happened   that guy is just putting words in my mouth, things I never said and claims I have misconceptions when he's the one inventing them and accusing me of them  yea, transgenders don't usually have dysmorphia   body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria are not the same, they might be connected at times   I never indicated all transgenders undergo SRS   okay that makes a lot of sense, thanks!  	9
