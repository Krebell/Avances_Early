Masturbate on an airplane   I think it should be AB. He's really grown as a player in the last couple years in terms of scoring. He's stored off a little bit recently so I think making him captain would really get his confidence back up   Hey LD. Huge fan! From one kike to another, I was wondering if it's at all scary constantly knowing the cops are after you because you're such a white criminal? #whitecrime   that's why when I first listened to it I was skeptical but it's so great for some reason   Acid Rap album by Chance the Rapper. This on repeat throughout the day is oddly satisfying      I'm just very upset that we blew it somehow. You can understand why     	10
 I took six years of French... but 6 years ago.  My mom is even fluent, but I don't remember a lick of it.   That was a very nice poem.  I'm saving it for future reference for myself to look at later :)  	2
 Curtana Zenith is really easy to get; as others have pointed out, though, I don't see why not both.   Super ecstatic about this! :D   I'm rage quitting already...   That's the correct one!   I heard he was actually a very cheerful person and was fairly happy with his life.    I'm actually really glad to see this; Heavensward "DLC" as Steam has called it has been on there for a couple weeks now, so I figured any minute someone would mention being it being available for pre-order soon. I personally don't mind, considering we still get early access, and I'm out of college by June 19th anyways. Nbd.   Thought this exact same thing when I went through it!   Having never heard this or seen the trailers, I think I know my new favorite dungeon.   	8
 Yes because I was horny and stressed and bored. I'm in a private cube anyway.    You're right. I'm a female and wouldn't go home with him.   I'm Italian so im hairy. I pluck my toe hair   Thanks. Where is he??   Because they're formal but here to get their hands dirty.   Requiem for a dream. Can I just get high instead?   Try gofundme then post to /r/borrow /r/assistance and your Facebook   I'm not sacrificing anything for a job. I can't let it get in the way of life.   Stuck their dick in someone's eye   Yes. Just as annoying as your face.   Utopia   New England is expensive!   Yeah you should get on that. You should poop every day. Get yourself 2 bottles of magnesium oxide and clean yourself out!   You sound very passionate and angry about sneakers. You should try flip flops.   Never thought about it but I agree. Isn't their skiing though?   Read this whole thing as if you were talking about brownies. imagine my confusion. Never heard of this show though.   I'm no bro. But I am a 4.   Well well well this sounds fun.   Nostalgia   That looks like something that crumbles off my wall.   No because there are no leagues below me.   My desk   You're going to want to get her to a therapist. You have to do so in a way that's supportive and shows how important it is to better deal with this, to make things like watching a movie easier. It's not because she's crazy, but anyone that has went through this should have counseling. I suggest you go as well. I feel like her mom needs to know. But you can't be the one to say anything. If she was a good mom, she wouldn't let her daughter feel uncomfortable with the man together.   Don't go to a dealership.   I think you're a cop.   Yes. Why do you ask?   I think you should take the new job. I don't support jobs that make you miserable, but the only problem it seems are the hours. I think you can arrange a way to plan your activities. Plus, laying off workers isn't a good sign, even if they don't do it twice. Just my personal opinion based on what I would do.   Tattoo someone. Graffiti something on public display. Have children. Visit Sicily, India, south Africa. Take my baby cousin and aunt to Europe on my dinner.   Yes. Better than me. I was top of my class, honors classes, took review courses, blah blah blah. Did horrible on the SAT. I think for SUNY schools, 1200 and 1600 get you scholarships. Take a few practice exams and retake your junior year. You'll be good to go!   Nope but it's slightly better. Sorry you're going through this. I don't wish how I felt on even my worst enemy.   This past year. Depression, anxiety, no self control, friends, interest, job. Fucking up and ruining good things.    Get another job or hobby. Say yes to anything if someone asks you to do something. Hit this girl up again. Hook up with her, you'll feel better.   Yes and no. I used to be really shy and when they stopped talking, I felt like a loser. Like I couldn't keep their attention or they didn't like me because I was boring. I mean, they have every right to stop talking but it made me sad when we'd just sit in silence. If you grasp at straws long enough, I'll open up.   Ask about something they love. They'll talk more because they probably like sharing. At work, I picked the role as the weirdo so I could make people laugh and ask them questions like playing the favorites game. Seeing me get silly loosened them up.   Depression.   They spotted you. You're doomed.   When faced with an obstacle, you probably think to yourself, something has to get better and I'm not the one that can do it, yet. It's when you lose hope in yourself and need something from the universe. If I say something to god, I am thinking of energy. Something needs to align. God should be a broad term, not one guy in heaven casting spells.    Something about the climate I'd suppose.   No. Hollywood studios and an all star resort. When I was there a Chinese cast member from haunted mansion got hit by a car outside our apartment.   Huh?   Well for a guy, its tighter and the "taboo" feeling probably gets you intrigued.   As a female, I kind of liked it. You know when you release a giant turd and for a second it feels amazing? That's how it kinda feels but for an extended time. I think I said this during anal sex and it was probably a mistake.   The blue or black dress.   Apples to apples and cards against humanity are definitely fun even when sober lol   Can you link me? Or I can send paypal   Idk talking about sexx   No. Because. Is taco a sandwich?   Disney world lol.   I feel the same. So I don't put up a picture. Id say post something where you're dressed decently, at some kind of party, and crop out anything bad. Or get a plain room with a dress shirt and take a photo with a timer.   I say soda because I worked at a place with a lot of international travel. I think it sounds better.    what state are you in? Marriott by chance?   Maybe want to visit /r/asexual   Cut the grass. Everyone here says pop. Upstate NY.   Looks amazing! Don't change a thing (for now).   I see what you mean, I'm just more interested in obstacle courses and adventure. Maybe I should just start hiking and making my own workouts at the park.   I don't really like working out. I prefer strength training to cardio. What I don't like is making everything seem like exercise. I was to do natural things to make myself stronger, toned, and thinner. Like moving boxes, tires, carrying things. I like when I had jobs that made me physical because it felt natural. What should I be looking for? Is it called something? Any ideas would be great.   Naturally or artificially? Carbs and grains are amazing. Quinoa, kamut, barley, oats. I like sugar free jello too.    Yeah but the fact that this guy came out of nowhere was nuts. Just like something off of long island medium. I couldn't believe it.   I'm writing this from my new phone that seems to be malfunctioning so forgive me if it's hard to read.  He said I would move to somewhere with palm trees soon. (I was moving to Florida the following week). Said I would get into trouble with someone named ****. And that this guy was talking to other people and that would get me in trouble. (Not sure on this one. I had met a drug dealer with the same name, a month later I was supposed to pick up and the day of our plans he got arrested, lost big money. Then later found another guy with same name --all within the same week-- as soon as he told me his name I called it quits because of what the psychic said. Could have put me in jail for a felony). Hmm what else, he said I'd have to make a big move in march and id be deciding between 3 places. It'd be a big decision but the decision I would make would be the best one (I did end up moving mid march because something bad happened. Was deciding between living in Florida, home, or with a relative.) Also, said I'm one to "cover my mouth" and not speak up. But I will and it will get me to a better place. Well, what happened during those rough months was due to me speaking up to my boss, which may have been bad to say but it turned out for the best.  Basically said I'd be okay and that I was kinda fucked up be okay.   A guy that looked homeless (lack of a better word) came up to me while I was with my friend at a coffee shop. We were there gossiping about who knows what, never saw him come in or sit down. Then told me he was a reader. Then proceeded to read me, tell me my future. Everything has come true, including dates and names. He was very modest, left abruptly, didn't even let me say thank you (I was like WTF, what do I even say to this guy? Made sure to keep a straight face and not really respond to what he said to lead him on). He left. Just disappeared. I have no idea if he had a car or just walked in to talk to me. Very strange but cool. I've been a mess this past year so I'm sure I have a lot of energy and emit some interesting waves.    People with art majors are the easiest to pick out. It's a different breed. I loved my time as an art major. People are amazing but I can't describe them in one particular way. Not hippies, just floaty.   Better yet, eat shit so you clean and fuel yourself at once.   Stolen money/gift cards.   I work at an extended stay as well. It's fun to make friends with guests compared to a regular hotel.   ChapStick. Pliers. An exfoliant. Coconut oil. A foot scrubber for dead skin. I'm a bit so girly girl but these are stereotypical female items that I actually use/need.   Car charger too  	65
 i guess it depends on the type of person you are. for me i need to share things I'm a very emotional guy so its tough for me to keep stuff bottled up, but i believe talking about things with someone can always be some sort of help. I'm all for therapy !   Great advice, thanks a lot !   i want too i just find it a little tough getting into situations where i can meet new people if that makes sense ?   Okay so let me first start of by saying this was stupid of me and the rule of 'don't shit where you eat' i truly believe now but i recently split up with my girlfriend she broke up with me. normally i would cut all contact but the thing is she's my next door neighbour and part of my friend group so basically i have to see her near enough every day. how would you guys cope with it. because I'm finding it really tough     hey guys bit of a silly one. i got diagnosed with depression recently and I'm trying to learn to live with it but in the back of my head I'm thinking some mystical girl will come along and it will all go away. how do i make myself believe a girlfriend isn't the answer ?   whiplash    yeah i really want that feeling again haha   Holy ghost, there fucking amazing ! i've been getting into a lot of synth-pop lately    nothing i can say will make anything better but i'm thinking of you bud   my god you're amazing ! at the risk of sounding like a basement dweller can i pm you ?    thanks I'm more optimistic now than i've ever been   citalopram    yeah i've felt like i've had it for a few years now i feel almost good that somethings been done, i've been put on some anti-deppressions for 2 weeks then i have some blood-tests now its just dealing with it i guess, thanks for caring !   yeah i've felt like i've had it for a few years now i feel almost good that somethings been done, i've been put on some anti-deppressions for 2 weeks then i have some blood-tests now its just dealing with it i guess, thanks for caring !   yeah i've felt like i've had it for a few years now i feel almost good that somethings been done, i've been put on some anti-deppressions for 2 weeks then i have some blood-tests now its just dealing with it i guess, thanks for caring !   how can i be more like you, you're the best   im all for it !   thank you so much it means an awful lot   i really cant thank you enough for this message, i feel like as the cliche goes really alone right now, thanks for caring you don't know how much it means    [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DswBily.jpg) Hey everyone !   thanks for listening ! its been a shitty 2015 so far    aww thanks :) it means a lot, it seems like because this happens to everyone that it means it doesn't hurt. like I'm allowed to be upset !   my girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago, and i just feel kind of worthless kind of like I'm in a blackhole. i wasnt perfect but man i loved her   Just being able to see her always made me feel better, I'm quite an emotional person so i have a lot of really good days and a lot of really bad days. but whatever happened when she walked in and looked at me with those big green eyes and gave me a hug i felt like the most important person in the world. it didn't quite work out as she broke up with me a few weeks ago but maybe i'll find someone special again some day    open ! why would anyone close them ?   i've been called charismatic twice over the last few weeks, just been through a terrible break-up so being called charismatic is awesome    being happy   thanks mate your right !   what makes you so sure ?   seeing an old friend on my way through london tomorrow. cant wait !   well i've had a few girlfriends and a load of shitty one night stands but this girl was the only one i really cared about. its gonna be very tough getting over her, feeling like I'm in a blackhole right now and i don't know how I'm gonna get out. but I'm sure in time i'll feel better. plus she's in my circle of close friends so I'm gonna have to see her everyday. but everyone on here has helped a lot :). thanks for caring   think i misread your comment. sorry haha   Hey everyone i don't post a whole bunch here but i've been through a real tough time recently with a break-up and being the time of year its been rough and lonely but i just wanted to thank everyone. everyone here has helped a whole bunch. so i just wanted to say thanks a lot for helping a silly heart-broken kid like me haha   jesus christ   yeah i don't understand sometimes haha cant we just have a chat about films with no ego involved    why are you getting so defensive ?   anchorman    try catch 22 or i am legend when i wanted to get into reading i started with them.    shouldn't have read this just after a break-up man I'm all upset again    knowing the person you love doesn't want you anymore    Great suggestion !   Hey guys I'm looking to do a save with an old squad that would need rebuilding. so what I'm looking for is a team with good youth facilities preferably in one of the big leagues but with quite an old squad. thanks for the help    well then...   its like we're already best friends   i don't know your scottish I'm from london I'm not sure how long i'd be able to keep up    if you're gonna drink something with red bull it might as well be your own self respect    fuck all these red-bull vodka bullshit. thats for sissies am i right !   haha i go to uni in stoke. probably not the best idea    good advice    like i do that but like i never usually meet new people that way i love reading and i love film and i don't really meet people at the cinema or at the bookstore if that makes sense    Hey guys this isn't a forever alone post or anything but i've recently went through a break-up and i have kind of figured out that i don't have a lot of friends and i want to make some more. now i know how to socialise i consider myself funny-ish and i'm pretty friendly and caring but  the problem i have is making the first move or putting myself in a position to meet more people. basically i want to meet more people with the hope of making friends.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DgHbRTh.jpg) Heres one of me my mum and my dog :)   because my girlfriend left me a few days ago    http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/frankfurtmarket   going to the german market in Birmingham with my lady. cant wait !   i think the use of lighting in the film is really special as well. really amazing film.   Drive easily drive   Carnage by Roman Polanski    if its the truth and its a good thing then its the best thing I'm going to hear all day.   moving into a new house with people i don't know forced me to be social and make new friends and it has resulted in a group of friends I'm really fond of and an amazing girlfriend that i really like for the first time in my life.    i think its more about natural chemistry with a person so when they say funny i think they mean someone they will naturally get along with and find funny   HOT !   eye contact is crucial ! its the difference between a good blow job and a great one    last night, been going through a rough few days when it comes to friends and family and i got on a rant about my knob step-dad and yeah. my girlfriend understood and made me feel better about it.   this cracks really morish   being totally comfortable  with who you are and with acting like yourself.    for me i use cinema to help get me through tough times, the art of the motion picture is a great tool. i always watch musicals when I'm feeling low. i understand mate i've been in a very similar situation just find something that you enjoy even if its listening to a great album then at least you have something to look forward to wether its your favourite meal or just watching some t.v always have something to look forward to. and try and get as much exercise as possible. hope this helps at least a little and if you need someone to chat to. you can PM me anytime. i've been there mate you're not alone   reddit is generally full of hate, i try and stick to the smaller communities where people are actually pretty nice.    watch them all and then watch them all again !   i really want to do hull and port vale this year !   FUCKING DRIVE !   funny people, i thought it was a great comment on friendship,ambitions and relationships   ohh i see now. thanks a lot for your help !  	75
 I quite like chest hair, and the snail trail under the belly button but cannot stand a hairy back!   I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting!   Thank you :)    Usually me just overreacting and being dramatic. Never about anything serious.    I've been depressed for a very long time, and I've been with my boyfriend for quite a while now. It's been a a tough time, I won't deny that, it has not been easy and we often argue. Very recently, it's been amazing but last night I spent a few hours laying awake whilst he was dead to the world, and just looked at him and my mind was rattling on about how he should be with someone stable, someone he doesn't have to look after and deal with all the drama. I am actually worrying about whether I should let me go and be with someone 'normal'. I feel like I'm holding him back, and I know I need him, and am completely head over heels for him. I do try hard, but I don't know how much longer I can fool myself with thinking he's actually happy with someone like me.   I don't know what to do :(    I have a very balanced diet, but there is always room for more fruit and veg!:)   Thanks :)    Tell him what you want and want to try, maybe create a checklist of things you'd both enjoy or would enjoy trying and then a list of things that are a complete no no. I usually rate the activity out of 5 when doing checklists so then my SO knows what I enjoy more and what to do regularly.   I introduced my vanilla boyfriend to this lifestyle by showing him what I liked, showing him techniques and giving him a pain rating every time he hit me. Also, I'd you have an abusive past that he knows about, that could be why he is hesitant...reassure him that it is consensual and you would tell him if boundaries were crossed.   Initiate things such as put your hair in his hand, lay across his lap in the spanking position, kneel at the door when he comes into your bedroom...  Good luck :) x  	7
 Mature.   In all honesty, I agree for the most part. I still don't use it because I know many people are still offended by it, and they have a right to be. A lot of people don't agree, and I think the n-word still has too much of a negative connotation to be used in a public setting like that, especially at school.   I definitely still think it's offensive and not appropriated but I realize that not everyone thinks that way. If you're going to use it, then it should be around friends that you know won't be offended, not a public place. I don't use it ever, but I'm trying to make my point that it's completely different in a public setting like that. I shouldn't even have said that it's    I think that it's okay to say around friends and people who you know will not be offended, but it's completely different once you display it in a public area like that. The banner reflected badly on the school and I personally think it should be common sense not to use a racial slur in a senior prank, especially one that is public like that.   Seriously? It's using the n-word and that word is offensive in any context. It doesn't matter if it's in a Drake song. It doesn't matter if they "didn't mean" it in a racially offensive way. It's a racial slur and it's not appropriate in any environment.   Too much. Always. In every context.   I wish my school offered IB.  *sigh*   I'm really digging the tie dye one 3   In all honesty as much as you guys are joking about it, I do think it was offensive and uncalled for.  EDIT: So I'm getting downvoted for thinking it's offensive to display the n-word in a public place. Uh, okay.   Swing Life Away is a GREAT song.   [This masterpiece captures every hardship and triumph I've faced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP3sffVKbYM)   I'm a sophomore. Hoping to go to Michigan Tech for chemical engineering.   I have the SAME problem then wake up with 5 minutes to get out the door. I set 2 different alarms, sleep through them most of the time, AND have my mom wake me up. Still doesn't work. What worked for me was putting in headphones so it blasts the alarm in my ears about 30 minutes before I actually have to be awake. It's horrible and unpleasant but it's the only way.   What do you consider a dealbreaker, physically? Is there any kind of personal trait that just makes you find a girl unattractive?   Funny and quiet and smart   If you're dumb, there's no chance. Even average intelligence is fine but I couldn't be with someone who was just dumb. Also I tend to fall for guys that are kinda cocky and have a big ego and I need to not   THOSE THINGS ARE LITERAL SATAN SPAWNS.   Please Don't Stop The Rain by Jim Morrison. Beautiful as hell and relevant to me right now and great.   Backseat Serenade - All Time Low   I woke up and found pizza on the counter 3   My mom. Had a borderline mentally abusive mother, and ended up dropping out of college because she couldn't afford it. Met her fair share of abusive guys before my dad. They had me then got divorced but still stayed best friends, even though he was in and out of jail, but then he passed away almost 3 years ago. So she had to raise me almost completely on her own since I was 2, and even though her life had all of these issues, she doesn't dwell on them and she devotes all her time and energy making sure we're happy and comfortable. She never gave up on me, and despite everything she's been through, she's a damn good mother, and I hope to be half the woman she is some day.   Tom Cruise   Got denied this big leadership thing at my school at my school I've been wanting since 8th grade :c   I'm really horribly introverted   Buuut I'm also a good listener   The names Sean and Jose. Unf.  (Really any Hispanic name tbh but mostly Jose)   I started really young, probably about 8, but didn't actually "hit" until 13.   I think In My Life by The Beatles is super fun to play   That sometimes I just want to be alone and not talk to anyone for a while, and it's not because I'm sad or angry or depressed. I just  want alone time once in a while, and that's okay.   Pompeii could work   Like: I'm really caring and compassionate a lot of the time  Dislike: I'm TOO caring and compassionate a lot of the time   Ay   Well one time my 8th grade English teacher told me I look like a cartoon character so    Me   I can't even remember.   I have an iPhone 5 because I'm an honorary white girl, and I like the phone and all but the battery doesn't even last 5 periods of the school day. I just spent 40 dollars replacing the battery and that didn't help either. Next phone will probably be a galaxy or something tho.   Sleeping, or the song Come On Eileen. That song specifically.   3.7, might go down to a 3.6 though after this semester.   But that's implied. It's the REASON for dress codes. A lot of schools don't enforce dress codes for boys like they do for girls. At mine, guys can have tank tops with the arm holes so big their nipples are showing, but a girl can't have a tank top with thin straps. As stated above, it is understandable if your ass or boobs are hanging out, but it's ridiculous to send girls home for things like thin straps or lots of thigh showing because it *distracts the poor boys*   That's not even remotely what the petition is saying.   I realized how toxic certain people in my life are, and it's like a weight off my shoulders :) Also, I got a 95 on my last chem test   I want to be a chemical engineer. I love chemistry and I love engineering so it combines my favorite things.    Week was awful  Weekend so far is good and I get to drive around   YES.

Worst feeling ever, I know. But I promise it goes away with time and eventually you'll see her like someone else's picture and not care at all.   I don't know why I find that so funny. I'm in class and saw that have been giggling to myself for about 30 seconds and everyone thinks mom an idiot   When I'm just waking up I'll hear my mom in the other room dropping something and just yelling SHIT or screaming my name to yell at me. My mom doesn't normally have an annoying voice, but when I'm just waking up her voice just irritates me more than anything. Like, it makes me irrationally mad.   Where did you get that picture of me?!   I'm thinking that my "seasonal depression" that I just stopped taking medication for might not be seasonal.   Good luck! That's awesome :) I hope you feel better by then!   What the hell. How does one write an 8 page essay on teen culture in the 60's? D:   About a 3. Got denied some leadership positions and had a sad night and rough morning. Meh.   I have... No idea what that is.   That essay looks painful.   Not only do I have chipmunk cheeks, but my front two teeth are slightly bigger than the other ones so I look like a literal chipmunk. But I still get mistaken for a lot older than I am so idk    I guess so :) thank you! I hope you have a good week too!   "Better start this essay!" *opens Microsoft word and browses reddit for 5 hours*   When You Can't Sleep At Night - Of Mice and Men   No idea why not the marching band position, but for the other one its because I'm "too quiet" I guess. Even though the girl who has sat next to me in chemistry all year and has never said one word the entire time got accepted. So maybe my application just wasn't good, who knows. Oh well .-.   Same here. I think for me it's just that the last 8 months have been so draining and I feel so sick of this school year. I normally do really well and turn in all my homework but these next 5 weeks are going to be pretty awful. I know what you mean.   Marching band and this program that's basically like "upperclassmen get assigned a few freshman to make sure they don't majorly fuck up throughout the year". But it's okay because I came home and found Oreos in the pantry.   /r/marchingband /r/frc /r/wtf  Yup.   Basically me the past three weeks I feel your pain   I got denied two big leadership positions I've wanted since freshman year today after an already bad week. Not my day tbh   SERIOUSLY. It's almost physically painful.   My eyes are really cool, they're mostly light green with a tiny bit of brown in the middle and a tiny bit of blue on the outside. But my favorite eye color on other people is dark green or brown. I looove big brown eyes.   I draw the line when you bring your best friend and they're sitting next to you. Bonus points if the theater is crowded.   How close to her are you? Like how much have you hung out with her before?   They're 16. You'd think they'd know better. _   Hell yeah I have. I'm close to the boyfriend's family so my friend and I were invited to his little brother's 12th birthday and we were all in the basement playing video games and I look over and they're sitting on the recliner with a blanket over their lower halves obviously going at it. I went home early.  	71
 Heroin least??? Lol bang that shit   I'm looking forward to trying 3-fluorophenmetrazine, 2-FA, diclazepam, etizolam, MXE and U47700.   I seriously doubt it considering caffiene is not a TAAR1 agonist and does not release any significant amount of dopamine or norepinephrine.   Just thought I should add that when methylphenidate is taken with alcohol, not enough ethylphenidate is produced  to result in any significant effects. Any increase in attention or focus would be due to the methylphenidate alone.   A Primer of Drug Action by Robert M. Julien. I have some background knowledge in neuroscience and biology and I'm really enjoying this book so far (3 chapters in).   "[The neuroprotective effects of methylphenidate] may include 1) direct interactions between methylphenidate and the neuronal dopamine transporter which may attenuate or prevent the entry of methamphetamine into dopaminergic neurons and may also decrease the synthesis of cytoplasmic dopamine through a D2 receptor-mediated signal cascade process"       Does this imply that co-administration of methylphenidate with methamphetamine will decrease the dopaminergic neurotoxicity associated with the latter? If so would it be "safer" to take methylphenidate and methamphetamine at the same time?   Alcohol and/or weed my friend. I am under the influence of this combo currently. It can be overwhelming but I find it pleasing overall.   This sounds like a great addition! But can someone explain why supertypes will not be removable at runtime, and whether it's a bad idea?   Take a different drug that inhibits the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the drug in question. This is a simplification though.   Immaculately written. I had to stop at certain points since I was laughing so hard. Now I'm curious to hear the rest.   No. I was prescribed Effexor XR for a number of years and smoked weed enough to know that serotonin syndrome does not result from this particular interaction.   Thank you for reiterating this point. The top comments in this thread all make excellent points regarding why the White House is incorrect in their analysis, but at the end of the day it boils down to politics. And given the current situation for Democrats, this means walking a fine partisan line to appease the party's usual voters (and corporations/institutions that support the party), especially as midterms draw closer. It seems to me that it's just one of the unfortunate side effects of the influence of money in U.S. politics.   Great post! You have me wondering about the LSD and coke combo though. Could you expand a bit on your experience/dosing with that combo?   Thousands of hours into Super Smash Bros. Melee. The competitive scene is amazing and I love going to tournaments.   "I go 0 to 100 days in jail real quick"   This is incorrect. It may be true for some people, but in general it depends on each individual's response, the dosage, and the quality. But moreso on how much you enjoy it.   real men drop sheets   Great experience report. You mentioned that you've tried Adderall before - do you think 100mg 4-FA is less shaky than, say, 60mg Adderall administered over the same time period?   Start with 10-15mg for a sub-breakthrough dose so you can test the waters. To break through you'll need to hold the smoke in your lungs for a while, as well as use a dose more in the range of 30-40mg. This is assuming your friend has N,N-DMT, not 5-MeO-DMT. I would also recommend reading the DMT FAQ in the sidebar and reading a few DMT trip reports on Erowid. Good luck!   We makin noise   At first I read this as "I was out campaigning for Bush..."      I'm glad I read it wrong.   Very well said. I think your writing style emphasizes the irony of your username.   Anyway, I tend to think of people like McKenna as folks that inspire others to think in very unique ways, regardless of the scientific accuracy of their claims. He seems to embody the fact that taking psychedelics is much more than just a selfish, hedonistic pursuit.   100mg is too much. Start with 30mg.   If I take a break for a few days then take a bong rip every 15 minutes or so, I tend to get there within a few hits. Just don't forget to repack the bowl!   A friend of mine who does light shows (gloving) gave me a light show to the song Do the Astral Plane by Flying Lotus. At the time I was tripping pretty hard on shrooms. I was completely detached from my surroundings for most of the song. It was an extremely intense and immersive experience. I would definitely recommend FlyLo and light shows in general to anyone who's tripping.   Wow this is really surprising coming from the same guy who was handcuffed while tripping on 300ug LSD! Great story by the way. I'm not religious but I wish you the best with your career choice.   I don't understand the appeal of these new languages that mix paradigms such as functional and imperative programming. It seems to me that the popularization of languages such as Swift will inevitably lead to code that incorporates both paradigms within the same program, which can be confusing.      With that said however, it looks to be a big improvement over Objective-C considering the supposed speed and new set of features.   haha how did that interview go?  	28
 All cats were female and all dogs were male.    "Vanity Fair enough to be had on the consequences of convictions for football players and the make up artist did my trial based on my natural skin care products and services try the box below and we will be in the UK but I can try explain an issue here to view the locations of the posts prior to last night and had been okay with it I'll do it for a while to get the best way."  Apparently my phone creates essays.   I've had good and bad experiences with zero hours. A club I used to work at would let us pick our shifts a week in advance, the only caveat being that we had to work a Saturday night.  The pub I'm currently working in also operates zero hours and it can be hit or miss. Last week I earned over 200 for working 30hrs, next week I'm only working 17hrs so I'm looking at just under half that. It can be a struggle to budget, especially as I don't get student funding over summer.  Ideally zero hours shouldn't exist, but I can see why these contracts appeal to certain industries.   Not had it with pineapple but I can heartily recommend cheese and apple toast. That stuff is amazing.   Thanks! :) Sometimes it's really cathartic to actually get the words out of me rather than internalising my feelings.   With it being Father's Day yesterday and after reading the [following post](https://m.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ao0qv/serious_fathers_who_abandoned_your_family_whyd/) on AskReddit and the stories of fathers fighting desperately to see their estranged children it made me think about my own relationship with my father. I realised that even though we've not spoken in over 18 months and will probably never have a normal relationship that there were questions that I still carry to this day.  Why did you drag my brother and sister into your leaving and make such a production of it? (He had them help carry his things into his mistress' car and left them with a letter to give to our mum)  Why did you make no effort to keep in contact with us, besides a passive aggressive status on MSN messenger?  Why, when I eventually reached out at age 18, did you have our entire relationship revolve around money? (He helped me out financially in my first year of university but after that would always bring up how much I would owe him when I graduated)  Why, despite hearing from EMum how sorry you are for hurting us all, is the only apology we've ever had a CD telling us to forgive you or 'get the fuck over it'?   Thank you RBN for giving me the opportunity to work through my lingering issues and FLEAS and to my wonderful fianc and future in laws for giving me the love and support I so desperately needed.  Sorry that this post didn't really have a point but it was stuff I needed to say.  	6
 How are supposed to act when you, not necessarily in a bad way, are the subject matter of a joke? Today  some coworkers were teasing me about the fact that I use both my first and middle names (I used to go by my middle name, but got tired of explaining it to people) asking if the reason was because i was in witness protection, or if I was an escaped criminal. One of the girls said "Here we are thinking Heavyheartwolf is a nice normal guy, when he's actually a criminal on the run from the police." I played along and said "Well you know they say sociopaths, that they always seem so nice on the outside" She laughed, but I felt maybe it was a little an awkward or strange thing to say.   Is it best to play along in these kind of social interactions, or just play it off in some other way?   I don't know what you should say, but she's giving you a, not so subtle, indicator that you talk about your ex too much with her. I'm only starting to read into seddit and it seems like not talking about exs is a good rule.    I've found that it helps a bit, especially when you're meeting someone for the first time. From my own experience, people like to interact with others who are like themselves and have a very fine tuned sense for detecting otherness. Using a different diction can be alienating to people, because in their subconscious they identify you as not like them.   I know I default to more complicated language, and it can be off putting to people who aren't familiar with that type of language. In casual conversation being concise seems to work better. When I'm speaking with close friends, family, or a formal setting I don't worry about using my diction because it's appropriate and accepted there.   I'd say try be aware of it in casual conversation, but don't let it stop you from speaking well. Knowing your audience is a good thing to be aware of in a social setting. It's certainly a hard thing to do (because if you're anything like me some of your wording is second nature), but it's a good skill to have, and it'll help you communicate better with people who might not have as large a vocabulary as yourself.       I've just come out of a depressive episode a few months ago and have been steadily improving since. I'm still a little shook up from the episode that lasted almost two years. What I'm finding is that my motivation is taking a long time coming back. I've been leaving things till last minute and being generally pretty irresponsible. Anything that has the least bit of anxiety attached to it, like studying for a test, I just try to avoid like the plague. Has anyone else experienced this?   I'm going to school for journalism and creative writing. I've become very interested in story crafting and film, so I may go to film school when I'm done my degree.   For a long time I've been thinking about a tattoo, but could never find something that would mean enough to me to have put on me permanently. I've been reading a lot of old literature, and while reading up about Goethe's Faust I found some book illustrations that were exactly what I was looking for. Faust's moral about how you can lose yourself in the pursuit of knowledge is a meaning that deeply resonates with me. [this](http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/2/88505/1527676/02-clarke-faust.jpg) is what I'm thinking about getting.   Lately I've realized that I've spent years talking about myself. When I was young I spent a lot of time alone and became very introspective and self-conscious. Now, in my early 20's I've begun to try to change my behaviour and engage other people more, but I'm running into some road blocks.  I'm not very good at asking people about themselves and engaging their interests into general conversation topics. I'm really interested in getting to know people and connecting with them, but I draw blanks as to what I should ask them. I also don't want to sound like I'm snooping into their business, just that I want to get a little closer to them. How do you come up with on the spot, thoughtful, and interesting questions to ask people? Everyone asks each other how their day was, but what are some good ways to get passed that without the conversation becoming heavy or awkward?   Yeah it definitely feels like a fog, and it makes it difficult to connect to other people. I haven't always been this way, because I can remember having my emotions flow normally. When I sit down and think and try to relax I have an easier time identifying how I'm feeling and becoming grounded in the moment, but it takes conscious effort.   Interesting, I'll have to look into this if I'm not diagnosed as asperger's. But, seeing as how the symptoms are very similar there's certainly things I can gain and contribute here in the meantime. Also, as I said in another comment in this thread, I do have similar traits when it comes to special interests, so a diagnosis of asperger's isn't out of the realm of possibility.    Yeah, I guess that I should say I'm alright at picking up on other people's social cues, but there are sometimes where they just fly over my head. I have other things that seem more autistic than just social anxiety. I've don't really know what to talk about with people outside of my interests. Haven't been diagnosed yet, but it's a possibility, and at the very least I have a lot of the same characteristics as someone with aspergers.    Lately, I've found that my anxiety is causing an emotional cloud that makes it difficult to make sense of my other emotions. If I'm experiencing another emotion it feels like it's just blurred by that tight feeling in the pit of my stomach. It feels like I'm out of touch with myself all the time, and because of this I feel like I'm not really interacting with the world around me. I think I've felt like this for years,   Thanks , I'm glad you think I handled it alright. I've never been very good at handling these sort of awkward/confrontational situations, and have only lately started to change how I deal with them. I've been finding humor and taking things to their logical end in an absurd way has been working well. It takes the momentum away from an awkwardness or confrontation, but it's taking some getting used to, and it doesn't always fly. are trying to be confrontational or passive-aggressive.    I got a 32, I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I have a lot of traits ( told by my psychologist) I'm good at picking up on other people's social cues, I just don't know what to say to people in real life, generally.    I was going to say this Stalker specifically, but many of Tarkovsky's movies fit the question. Everything about stalker is so carefully done and beautiful. It might just be my favorite film.   Yeah I definitely did it with the appropriate body language and chuckling. I wasn't just mumbling to myself or anything. I just felt (like always) that I could have dealt with the situation better, I need to think on my toes more.   I know, it was bad. I just can never think of something properly clever to say or when I try it comes out half baked, like that. I'm horrible at defusing situations like that. I can never keep a cool head.   Today at work I had what was quite possibly the most awkward encounter that I've had in months. I work at a coffee shop where I usually get along well (albiet awkwardly) with my coworkers, except my assistant manager. She's a naturally passive aggressive, in your face sort of person, and she just sends my social anxiety through the roof. Sometimes she's fine and we can have a pretty good conversations, but other times she just saps all my energy. Last week she put in her resignation and the week after next will be her last week working. I'm not particularly pleased about this, more relieved that my anxiety won't be triggered so much at work. Today she was joking around about leaving and said "Well I know HeavyHeartWolf won't miss me!", and this caught me totally off guard and I just said whatever came into my mouth.   The exchange went something like this.  I immediately (without thinking) said in a sort of joking voice and a smile "ah Assistant-Manager that's harsh, you've got me figured all wrong!" To which she responded "haha don't you be thinking that I don't know what goes on in that pretty little head of yours" Then I turned and said "it is a pretty little head isn't it?" I didn't mean to come off as an ass, but I feel like I did anyway. Every time I'm thrown into a situation like this I just say the most idiotic things, because I don't know what else to say. Silence probably would have worked better looking back.   What can I do to get myself socially on my a-game for when things like this come up. Every time something like this happens I feel like I botch the whole interaction and leave everyone feeling awkward. Do any of you have advice for getting better at this?   Yeah, I haven't seen it in a few years, so I my opinion of it might have changed. I think the idea of just going out and trying to authentically connect with people outside of the expectations that society places on us struck a chord with me.    I suppose if I'm diagnosed with asperger's then I'll have to learn to accept that I have some limitations socially and work on coping strategies to deal with and accept them. If it's not autism then it seems to me that what I'm dealing with is probably a result of severe anxiety and that I'll need to work on ways of building confidence and managing the anxiety through therapy, exposure, and medication if I need it.   Yes definitely, if I don't receive a diagnosis there are still a lot of things that I need to work on personally. I know that I have trouble socializing with people sometimes, I have a lot of anxiety, and I struggle with some obsessive tendencies. I'm really looking into Asperger's because it could explain a lot and as far as I'm concerned it's something that either is on the table or isn't, but I need to know moving forward. If I an aspie then there are some realities that I'll need to work with, if I'm not, then there are other reasons for some of my characteristics that I need to explore.   I've been trying to find reasons and solutions for some of the things that are causing problems in my life. I don't think there's any harm in taking a look at the possibility of being asperger's. If I am I learn something about myself and move forward in one direction, if I'm not then I'll reassess somethings and move forward in a different direction.   If I get a diagnosis then it'll mean I have to manage my problems one way, if I don't get a diagnosis then it'll mean that I manage them another. What it really comes down to is finding out whether or not autism is on the table for me. I know I have some trouble socializing, I know I have some obsessive tendencies, but I'll be dealing with them in very different ways and mind-frames depending on whether I receive a diagnosis.   I'm currently pursuing an official diagnosis and have been dealing with a lot of anxiety about it lately, so please, bear with me. I've been being treated for depression for the last year, I had what I call a nervous breakdown and moved back in with my parents. I've been seeing a psychologist and brought to him the possibility that I might have either bipolar disorder or asperger's. He told me that I don't show many signs of bipolar, but there are some behaviours and thinking patterns that I have that might indicate asperger's.   Now I've been studying up on it and while some traits are me in every colour, some just don't seem to apply. I've asked to do some screening tests with my psychologist, and have founds some credible ones online. The results of the test don't seem to indicate that I'm an aspie, actually I scored fairly low in a lot of categories. I can apparently read people's emotions better than average and am fairly good at deciphering people's intentions.   It's a really confusing mix of indications, on one hand I fit the bill in many ways, but on the other I just don't seem like someone with asperger's.   Did any of you who've been diagnosed deal with mixed indicators before getting your official diagnosis?    I think Into the Wild is close to what I'd consider an INFJ movie. I've that there are more films that involve similar themes in foreign cinema. Wim Wender's film Der Himmel Uber Berlin (Wings of Desire) and the films of Andrei Tarkvosky spring to mind. If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind subtitles then I'd recommend giving those a watch.   For english movies I'd say that Spike Jonze and Wes Anderson are two directors who explore a lot of themes that INFJs can relate to. Where the Wild Things Are is one of the best children's films I've seen.   I've been told that I'm a bit intimidating on first introduction, but only because (I've been told) I look and sound like an intelligent, confident person. I was surprised by this at first, but I take it as a real compliment. I've had people tell me that the reason I seem intimidating is that I'm an attractive young person who seems to talk about things and hold stronger well thought out beliefs than many people my age. I actually have quite a lot of problems with being self critical and insecure, so the idea that I can seem confident and collected means a lot to me.    Actually, I wrote this entire post about how I'm really self-conscious and actively avoid sounding like a pompous elitist in my everyday life by bringing in topics that don't interest most people. I don't reject other people or their interests. In fact, I could listen to someone talk to me about their passion almost regardless of whatever that passion for as long as they were willing to talk.   I think you read my post thinking I have no interest in the people around me when that's far from the case. I'm not resentful of other people or have low expectations of them, I'm just trying to avoid being condescending or seeming pretentious, because I know that sometimes I can be unintentionally. I tried to make it understandable in my post that I like to interact with people and chat with them about things and other interests, but I haven't found a way to incorporate this large piece of my life into socializing without seeming like I'm doing it just to flaunt.  I hope that makes sense. I didn't mean to imply that other people are inferior to me, just that a lot of people have no interest in that sort of thing. Other people reference things like TV shows in everyday conversation all the time, because those around them can relate to those things. My problem is that some of the things I'd like to reference aren't as easily accessible and I have to check myself before throwing references to things that it might be difficult for others to relate to into a conversation.    Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning.    I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation.   I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues.  Do any of you feel the same way? Do you have any experiences to share?      Both of my parents are working professionals. My mom took ten years off after finishing her degree to raise me and my brothers. For the first ten years my parents were very loving and involved. After my mom went back to work she become completely focused on her professional career, and me and my brothers have definitely suffered for it. We moved towns a few times because of my parents work, they never really had any concern for our development or whether we were okay. We lived in a series of small towns where it was difficult to fit in socially as an outsider. My teenage years were spent in an isolated, northern rural town.  My parents basically stopped being invested in me and my brothers when I was 10 and sort of left us to our own devices. Now they're surprised that me and my brothers have problems connecting to people and all suffer from anxiety and depression. I've been struggling with depression since I was 12 and my parents tell me that they never noticed anything until I had to move home to get help.   So no, my parents weren't abusive, but I feel they emotionally abandoned me and my brothers to focus on their careers. This involved throwing us into a lot of bad environments because they didn't do their homework i.e. really crazy babysitters and subpar schools. They never made much effort to make sure that my brothers and I were socializing normally and that we were emotionally alright. I can only guess that I've become an INFJ because I had to deal with loneliness and sadness for a long time without much emotional support. Maybe it's that I turned to religion, literature, and music at a young age to try to manage my pain. I've since become an agnostic, but I can remember taking solace in religion when I dealt with depression as a child. Now I'm a little jaded, a bit poorly adjusted and have a lot of anxiety, but at my core I'm very empathetic and yearn for a deeper connection and understanding with people.  It wouldn't surprise me to hear that other INFJs have suffered some form of desertion early in their lives. Maybe it's why INFJs want deeper meaning and connections with others.   I've noticed that with certain people I always end up having the same conversations. It's great that we have similar interests and that we get along, but I really want to get a little deeper and talk about something other than just our common ground. How do you start a conversation that doesn't seem obvious, and how do avoid getting stuck in a conversation rut? I like talking about the things we talk about, but sometimes I wish we'd talked more about each other rather than just things we enjoy.    I'm like that. It makes me feel good to share my passions, experiences, and opinions. Lately I've become a little self-conscious about sharing too much because I'm trying to engage other people about themselves more.   With money and possessions I share too much. I buy for friends sometimes just because I like too. If I have extra money, most of the time, I'd rather spend it buying drinks for friends than buying things for myself. I like cooking people for people. There's something primevally communal about making a meal for friends.    	30

 Advice from just a kid maybe but, please listen to me on this; you need to take some time for yourself. Find someone that you trust to take care of your kids for a day or two, and go to the beach and just let the grief take you. Let it wash over you, let yourself experience it. Do what you have to do, cry, scream, break things - so long as you do not harm yourself (excessive drinking, drug use or self harm or probably not good ideas).  I guarantee allowing yourself a moment to truly take the loss will help you be stronger for your children. Because the last thing you ever want is to break in front of them, and take it out on them. I watched this happen with my ex-girlfriend's mother, and the effect it had on my ex-girlfriend was terrible and caused a few lasting issues between them.  Lastly. Take a breath. You can do this. You did childbirth, this is nothing. Stand tall and proud, and live the life that you know he would have wanted you to have. You are strong, and everyone here is rooting for you.   Is there some scientific reason that your memory becomes so muddled from those dark periods? I have legitimately lost close to 6 months of my life because the only thing I can recall from that period is the crushing darkness that I constantly felt. There have been entire events, parties, even my own birthday, that I have absolutely zero recollection of.   Kelpie?

For those that didn't know him it may have seemed inappropriate but those that were close to him knew that ACDC was his favorite band and he wouldn't have expected anything less. My exgf also showed up in a bright pink and yellow dress and got me to wear a brightly colored belt. We got some looks from people but fuck them, it was a celebration of his life and he was never a serious man. He would have been so proud of her. :)    Why not just wait until the factory images drop - usually within the hour there are flashable zips that come pre-rooted.    Yeah this is kind of like using a memory editor to get into an unfinished level in a game that you were never intended to access, and then complaining because the room subsequently has bugs...   iMessage works exactly the way as Hangouts works now, it just threads iMessages and SMSes in the same thread *on the device*. When you send an iMessage (blue) that message is viewable on any iDevice, including computers running OSX - this is because it is sent over the data network, through Apple's servers. If you disable data on an iOS device and send a message to someone, it will send as an SMS (green) and is *only* viewable on two devices - the device that sent it, and the one that received it.  To reiterate: **iMessage on OSX cannot send or receive normal SMS** - messages sent and received on the desktop are iMessages. With this understanding, Hangouts is already operating exactly the same way, and matches iMessage in functionality on the desktop - that is, messages sent and received on Hangouts are viewable on any device where you have access to your Google account.  edit: in reply to your statement about the Verizon messaging app - the reason this works is because, either way, Verizon handles your message. Your phone will send your message to Verizon over the GSM network and then Verizon will either:   a) send it directly to the appropriate # (if the # is also on the Verizon network)  b) send it to the relevant carrier, who will then send it to the device  Because they are handling your message *anyway*, you can send and receive SMS on Verizon's website, and because they can match your account info with your #, it sends as your number. The way Google voice works is that you send your message to them over *data*, and then they send it from a # that *they* own (but is uniquely given to you as per their service) to the relevant carrier.   [rascarlo](https://twitter.com/rascarlo) has builds up on [fitsnugly](http://fitsnugly.euroskank.com/?rom=rastakat device=mako) as well, and they are the first builds I've seen that have any custom ROM tweaks (slide notification bar for brightness, clear all recents button etc). Quite stable aside from some wifi issues.   ART doesn't work on anything built from source just yet, only the N5 ports. Not entirely sure why, but apparently has something to do with the gapps.   This has been asked numerous times in this sub. **You will never see this happen.** For this to work, Google would need to send every single SMS you send and receive to their servers and then serve it up in Google hangouts on the desktop - meaning that you would have to have a constant data connection for it to work, and SMS sent and received may appear in a different order on the desktop Hangouts than they do on your phone (unless the Android version of hangouts syncs with Google's servers, meaning that Google would get your SMS before you could even read it). There is no graceful or efficient way to do this, *unless* they do it in a Google-voice-esque way; which again would end up only working in the US and would require you to change numbers.   Ah, was just about to submit this, you beat me to it. Scary stuff, I can't believe it happened within just a few kilometres of where I live.   You need to install it using cwm. Twrp has been having issues with flashing 4.4 Roms.    That's actually incorrect. When you flash a ROM it will always overwrite your kernel, so you aren't running Franco (Franco wouldn't even work on 4.4 anyway).    Don't try to turn it on for at least a day. You will make it worse.    What are you asking here? Just try the launcher and see if you like it.    Nobody knows what device you are talking about.    If you're after good battery life I wouldn't flash Kitkat until the official images drop... right now, although it is quite smooth, its a hacked-together mess using 4.3 binaries on what is essentially a Nexus 5 port. Franco kernel is pretty good in terms of battery life for 4.3.   I doubt we will ever see this functionality in stock.    Has something to do with reddit automatically choosing the image from the linked page that has the highest color contrast (or so I've read many times in comments)   Make sure you are using the latest TWRP (2.6.3.3) and SuperSU (1.65)   It depends on the device, but probably not. External harddrives need to be powered and I doubt a phone would be able to supply the power needed over OTG.   1. That's just how it is with Android OEMs unfortunately. Even with a flagship device like the S4, you're realistically looking at a 2-3 month wait before you see KitKat. This is why the Nexus line and custom ROMs exist. 2. Check your APN settings (settings  more  mobile networks  access point names) and make sure they are properly set up (look up your carrier's APN settings online)      You're pretty much SOL. Best course of action would be to make a backup, flash a 4.3 rom, restore SMS and back them up using SMS backup and restore (which has 4.4 support), restore your 4.4 backup and then restore from SMS backup and restore.    Not sure about changing your status, but you can disable notifications for just Hangouts messages by going Hangouts  Settings  Your gmail account  and unticking Notifications.   That's correct. You can still run custom launchers though, so not all is lost.   SMS support on Hangouts desktop will never, ever happen. For this to become a reality, the phone would have to run some sort of server and push SMS to Google's servers as they come and go, which just isn't efficient.   No, it doesn't. The only phone with this feature is currently the Moto X.   1. Can't answer 2. There are a few but none even close to the same playing field as Garageband, unfortunately - I doubt it will get better until the audio latency improves on Android. 3. Can't answer 4. Kitkat comes with a [cloud backup service](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/nexus-5-leaks-time-hints-cloud-backup-android-4-4-kitkat/) that is similar to iCloud - I doubt it will be as wholesome or effective though   The "hot word" option only works on US English ATM.   [Scrotter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yttrium.scrotter.free) is updated fairly frequently (last update 4 days ago). It doesn't currently have the Nexus 5 but I'm sure it will support it in the future.   ART is a little bit faster but, since it is experimental, may break compatibility for apps. I currently have it enabled with no issues but I've heard that Whatsapp doesn't work with it.   Maybe they changed it to match 4.4's white statusbar icons? Not sure though.   Micro.   The PA builds overwrites the recovery, you simply have to reflash it over ADB.   Bar work (or hospitality in general) is always plentiful, and you can travel the world with it since it's such a translatable skill (I mean, everyone needs to eat).    I had a long-term relationship with a girl who was molested as a child (6 or 7 I think) by a close friend of her father's. I was quite shy so strangely enough all the sexual stuff usually initiated from her end. The first time she gave me a blowjob she went into a state of shock... I'm not talking just upset but like PTSD flashbacks sort of shit, she was shaking and it was like she was unable to see or hear me at all. I sorta just held her on the floor and kept saying "It's ok. It's ok." over and over again. One of the scariest things I've ever experienced and I would never have understood what was going on if she hadn't shared what had happened to her with me just a few weeks prior.   There were a few more episodes like this whenever we tried anything sexual but we just took things slow and I made sure she was 100% comfortable. After a while she was pretty fine with anything and in the later years of our relationship she was quite a minx in bed.  Unfortunately we're not together anymore but I'm glad I got to help her through that little speedbump so now she can have a healthy sex life.  edit: thanks to whoever gave me gold. To everyone saying what a good guy I am, it's really not as amazing as it seems. I had a girl on my hands who was willing to push through extreme childhood trauma to ensure that *I* was satisfied (both sexually and in our relationship). Staying with her and working through it was an easy decision.   Sorry but what on earth gives you the idea that Google would implement FB messages into hangouts? You know that will never, ever happen, right?   I never said that they weren't? I just said that the images usually end up on the developer page before anyone gets the OTA update. They push them both at the same time, but the OTA doesn't actually roll out to everyone at the same time due to carriers and connection issues. Developer images are more reliable this way.   Are you talking about an OTA update or for when the ROM scene reaches 4.4?  If the former, you have to do the following steps:  * Flash stock recovery * Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)  An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.  If the latter:  * Nothing - When you flash a 4.4 based ROM you will have to wipe data though, so you may want to ensure you have some sort of backup.   I believe he's talking about an OTA - which won't work without a stock recovery.   No. I doubt an OTA will be pushed before the images are up on the [Google developer page](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images).   4.4 ROMs are up and stable, why don't you take the plunge if you're eager?   If its stuck in a "pressed" state than unfortunately that is the case, and Xposed mods won't do anything. Every android phone I've ever used has a hardware switch that will kill power to the phone when holding the power button for a certain amount of time.   You can test it by removing your Google account. It is slightly duller.    The recovery gets overwritten when you flash the ROM, all you have to do is flash twrp again.    I just flashed supersu from recovery and it seemed to work fine.    Paranoid android has released a kit kat build for the nexus 4, it's one of the top posts on r/android right now.    Why are we fingers crossed? The device has been released... Just read a review.    Rule of thumb is to never dirty flash between Android builds. In fact, the only time it is ever not a bad idea to dirty flash is updates to the same ROM.   So:  Android version change - clean flash  ROM change (even if same Android version) - clean flash  Update to newer version of same ROM (but same Android version) - dirty flash   They ported it to the N4 using only blobs from 4.3, I don't see why they can't do the same for the gnex.   Ahh, right you are. That sucks. Looks like its back to Textra for the time being.   Yeah, server's down. I thought I managed to get it before it went but turns out I didn't, the zip is corrupted and failed to flash. :(   Backing up now, will report back.   Can I just flash SuperSU to this?   SMS popup on the play store. :) not a messaging app replacement, only does popups.    Many teenagers and girls (of all ages I've found). I know at least 4 people that chose an iPhone 5 over an S4 or HTC One when they had the chance to upgrade, because of this single feature. I am not joking.    Really? So it even works in the twitter app?   Really? So you have the full range of color emoji in every single app with no addons required? Instagram, Facebook, snap chat etc?    System-wide emoji!   This was confirmed in the nexus 5 ama :)   This is really surprising given that one of kitkats new features is running on low-specced devices. Surely they will push an update for the gnex?   Already been posted http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1pmpge/android_kitkat_platform_highlights/   It's been there since release. It sends an SMS to people that don't have Hangouts if you message them on Hangouts - so not full SMS support.   Because Google voice doesn't actually use SMS... It uses data. It sends your message to Google servers which then send the SMS for you. Gv is allowed on the app store the same reason Facebook and whatsapp are, because they are internet messengers. SMS replacement apps are a no go on iOS.    IOS app will never see SMS support, it goes against the app store rules.    Let me show you something http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Australia country2=United+States   I think one of the main issues that is being ignored right now is that ISPs are *decreasing* data caps, instead of increasing them.    Wow. As someone that was on the opposite side of this exact situation, can I just say that there is a very real chance that she was just as confused about what was happening as you and your friends were. Depression is a HELL of a disorder and when it gets really bad it can warp your reality to an insane degree. I hit a really low point in high school and as a result, I systematically destroyed every single meaningful relationship I had... No bridge was left unburned. You do this because you are so determined for the reality inside your head to match the one in the world around you, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Honestly I look back on that time and I couldn't explain half of my actions, your brain operates on an entirely different level. And I think your friend would feel the same way. Thanks for keeping in contact with her. I managed to reconnect with a lot of old friends when I started getting better and it meant the world to me that they stuck around.    Slide out the menu and tap the gear icon next to Newsfeed.    http://www.imgur.com/EeZ6qmw.jpeg   The only OmniRom builds that are currently available are unofficial builds, and they haven't implemented the Multiwindow feature yet (mostly because it is still unfinished). Slimbean uses a JWR/JSS hybrid kernel that rids you of the deadlock issue, FYI.   Does that not come with MIUI?   Have you tried an AOSP ROM? Much snappier than Touchwiz.    This has been around in custom roms for literally years though.    Screen out doesn't work on custom Roms for the sgs2   http://techstroke.com/use-your-android-as-a-wifi-dongle-wifi-adapter-to-access-your-home-wifi/   Not officially, but I'd put money on it that this gets an unofficial port.    Because AOSP apps are being deprecated in favor of proprietary Google applications.  Source on this? Google is still actively developing AOSP. Calendar and Keyboard have both been released on the Play Store and their respective AOSP versions are still updated to the latest with every release of AOSP. It's just a way of Google getting a close to stock experience on any phone with access to the Play Store.   I'm honestly confused, with the comment starting with the world "welp", how can it not be read sarcastically?   How?   Why is this a bad thing?  edit: TIL "[welp](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Welp defid=5929265)" is an expression of enthusiasm.   /r/supershibe   If you prefer the stock messaging app give 8sms a try (its on the play store). Basically the messaging app pulled from cm10.2, so it includes a dark theme and quick reply.        wow                          such brave            much edgy                               snapchat2teenage4me        #boycottsnapchat2013                                            wow   Ugh, dread is one that I really struggle with. Its that almost limbo between having a body full of adrenaline and not, and there's this weird stinging feelings in my bones and chest. Just awful.    What does being Australian have to do with anything? We have the exact same thing over here, they're just called "consultation hours" in the majority of universities.   "Confirmed"   The highlight color changes every year so non-schoolies don't come back and use their old band to get in.    I've never seen them anywhere other than schoolies is Australia. They're pretty unique. http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/image/4386546-3x2-460x307.jpg   Do you live in Australia?   Well, there is evidence that he's Australian. The yellow wristbands in the photo are schoolies wristbands, which can only be found in qld Australia during schoolies week...   Sudden clarity clarence is an Australian. Even if you don't believe the person I know is him (which I know it is, but whatever), the Australian part is undeniable because of the yellow wrist bands in the photo. Wristbands like that are only seen in Australia, on the gold coast, during schoolies week.    He most certainly is Australian. This photo was taken during schoolies week, as evidenced by the [schoolies wristbands](http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/4386546-3x2-940x627.jpg).   Actually, he has been identified, numerous times by myself. I usually point out who he is whenever there is a post or thread questioning his identity. He was in the grade above me in highschool, and the picture was taken during schoolies in 2011. http://imgur.com/a/LGc9O   Just an FYI: you can't post a link and a text post at the same time. Its one or the other.    I had the same problem with the lockscreen icon, hated the S one. There's a zip you can flash that changes it back to stock, its under the "addons" section on the slim website. :)   No worries, I'm glad I could share the experience with someone else!    Yeah I pretty much did a straight copy and paste there. I still have yet to come across any bugs, that includes random reboots and freezes (which I was getting daily on cm10.2). Can't help but love this ROM. :)   I posted in the flash Friday thread last week but it can't hurt to share again, in case anyone missed it.  **ROM Name:** Slim Bean  **ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)  **Android Version:** 4.3  **Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)  **Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)  **General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.  **Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.  **Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.  **Stability  amp; Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.  **Caveats  amp; Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover.   There are two types of people; those who have shit their pants, and those who have yet to. All in due time, OP.   The installer is only going to work on devices that come unlocked out of the box or have a Dev unlock tool supplied by the OEM. Devices like the LG Nitro would still have the same issues.   	110

 I actually returned back from Japan two months ago! I live in the US but was just there for a semester.  As for Kyoto, its a very beautiful city, which has LOTS of temples. They're all gorgeous, even the popular sights are worth seeing. Also, there are certain areas in town where geisha still "live" (they put on a show for the public) and its very rare to see one but if your timing is right then its honestly so intriguing to see them. Other than that, it was very safe and there was enough to do to keep me occupied, but I never saw nearly as much stuff that was in Osaka or Tokyo. But 11/10 I do recommend visiting :)    This happened waaay back, so I was very very new to cosplay and I was really uncomfortable so when I heard it was borderline hentai I was grossed out! Now that I'm a few years older, I dont find it as weird, because I know its a subculture and its peoples hobbies... But the 8th grade me was creeped out to the max    Its either creepy joker for males or sexy joker for females. Like really, just cosplay as harley quinn if you want to be sexy, dont ruin the joker for me!!   I would have loved to have someone sketch me/my character normally! But the staff members of this con said it was borderline hentai and my 8th grade mind was blown    Haha nah I'm in North Carolina!   I have had a previous experience in Kyoto at a temple with a man taking pictures of me, but my host dad came to my rescue!  And please be my Ryuuji 3   Here ya go! http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg  Sorry for the link, I'm on mobile   I only had a stuffed tiger with me :(     I always cosplay as Taiga Aisaka from Todadora! because I'm around her size. One day at a local convention, this really creepy guy dressed as the joker was following me and my friend (dressed as Korra) around to every single pannel we went to. We weren't too creeped out because it was a very small convention, but it got to be weird when he started sketching things on a sketchpad... He would sit directly behind us and keep sketching. Eventually things got so uncomfortable that we told the convention staff about the man who was following us... Needless to say, they didnt want to show us the drawings he did. And I REALLY dont want to find out either.   EDIT: since people are wondering what my cosplay looks like, [here] (http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg) ya go   [CAUSE ITS DIE MOTHAFUCKA DIE MOTHAFUCKA STILL!!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF8c3BjFWsw)   I already sharpened it off BUT when I did examine it closely it looked like a thin coat of whiteness, and it did not appear to be fuzzy   I have the Rimmer Lasting Finish lipliner in 1000 Kisses, and today when I removed the top I saw it was coated in white. I have seen posts regarding lipstick sweat, but I didnt know if it was possible with a lipliner. I just sharpened my lip liner and carried on, but I dont know what this mysterious white substance is. Any verdicts?    (srs) but its still around?! I thought it was just a 2010 thing... This post made me look up AT and I found out they're still making episodes and now I'm like :o   Whenever I see someone with a FOTD that includes cashmere I cant help but think how their lips look like an dry asshole   I've stopped self posting and am only giving advice to people who have no comments on their CCW posts. My first post on MUA was admittingly basic (winged liner and red lipstick) but I wanted tips to improve my eyebrows and add dimension to my face, and I got a comment that said "stop being ugly and stop wearing the look that everyone else is"   Honestly, i was so hurt. I deleted my post until i got enough courage to post again with a more "attractive" picture, but i STILL got no help...   The people on MUA are toxic, they only give compliments to the people who are attractive and popular. Its such a shame that people could really improve their skills, but are buried in submissions of redundant negative space cut-creases and bold brows.

There's about 10 poetica/monarch palettes and I'm positive they have ladybird and star struck. I hope you can find what youre looking for :)    Do you have a TJ Maxx in your area? Just got mine for $9 there!   Thanks for your opinion! Maybe of you would have read my previous comments you would have seen that it was one of my first attempts at a makeup. I appreciate your criticism but this is MY character, and I will represent them how I please. Plus, its creative. Sure, you may not like it, but its just a makeup for Valentines day. Seriously, I did it for fun, not for a movie. And by the way, you sound pretentious and off putting for commenting TWICE about how you dont like it. I get it. Now go away.   Reported for harassment.   How do I add dimension? I just started practicing a month ago so I'm trying to get all the tips I can get   Thanks! This was actually one of my first sfx makeups :) I was aiming for a morbidly ethereal cupid look, but I think I also may try out a more gory look too see how it contrasts.   Thanks for the advice!     	24
 A leaked report regarding Park View school has been [obtained by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27757987)    This highly-critical report found a classroom culture in which Park View School was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a "madrassa curriculum" in PHSE (personal, social, health and economic) lessons and "posters written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited"... and there were claims of an inappropriate external speaker being brought it to talk to pupils.  If you Google it there are plenty of pictures of the classrooms on the school's website too.   The vast majority of schools in the UK, regardless of if they are fee paying, have uniforms. The schools involved are all non fee paying, taxpayer funded. Blazers (in the summer) and headscarves are not a compulsory part of the uniform for obvious reasons but the few little girls who didn't totally cover themselves were openly referred to as the 'white prostitutes'.    Ages from 5, up to 16 years.  	3
 It's this weekend.   I hope Rollins becomes more and more like Edge (ie an awesome heel you love to hate). I've only started re-watching WWE in the last 1.5 years and there's not been any notable heels to me (Wyatt maybe, but he's more gimmicky), especially when I used to watch WWE as a kid back in the 2003-2007 era   I am the map but you don't know how to read me   *Parole granted*   Sorry, it does that sometimes *...whacks tv*   Ned spilled ink all over my poems, man!    I'm sorry you are feeling this way. What hobbies do you like to do solo? Are you an artist or create anything? When I want to try and connect with people I show them stuff ive made, such as 3D art or writing. There's a lot of really nice girls atmy college but they're so quiet and never talk about themselves. I feel almost nosy when I just walk over and start talking to them, like they give off this aroma kd "id rather be alone right now."   Well if we look at Reddit's average demographic, most of the posters are likely 20-something, white male Americans who grew up playing video games like Mario. "Perfect white knight hero fantasy" is all they know or have really experienced. I try not to get mad at people when they post this bullshit, just ignore them.   I am so glad I unsubbed from /r/Christianity.    Hey...his briefcase is full of nothing but shredded newspaper.   Wildstar, believe it or not, has the best housing system in a theme park MMO I think. The rest of the game is a a mess.   At least in Draenor it's: "You're a fucking commander, here's your own castle."   What the hell's so funny?   Ah, the old reddit anti-police jerk-o-rama.   When did American cops start rounding up Jews en masse to be gassed?

I really dislike overly flashy combat in massive PvP like this - you have no idea what the hell is going on.

I heard some WEIRD and kinda DEVASTATING news about a pastor I know. Im in utter shock right now and all I can think of is: "WTF!?!!"  Later...   The pastor, whom I mentioned above, 45 years ago, had a *sex change.*  Note the *italics.* Can you just *imagine* them talking like that in *real life*?   Im not saying he isnt a *true* Christian...

Im not saying its *wrong*, but its definitely *weird.*  [You can't make this up.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/2uifj9/im_reeling_in_utter_shock/)  In the comments we discover that:    Said pastor has been forced to resign, and separate with his wife, if he ever wants to return to the church.  If you read this thread, you discover he was with his wife for a long time. It's a shame that one's *dirty little secret like being a homogay* got spilled and now has destroyed one's family.  The top comment speaks on the issue   That said, I do believe that God wants us to represent the gender he gave us, no matter our feelings of identity. He knows better than us. (see Deuteronomy 22:5) If a pastor, or church member is caught up in this, he or she needs to be lovingly confronted according to the instructions for addressing sin with our brothers. And if they refuse to repent, then church discipline is in order.  Bruh. http://actlikemen.com/  I am glad some people start calling it out   What was the point of this post?

OP you have never experienced the bad sides of relationships, so you cannot understand where people are coming from when they fear commitment. People like being in control of their lives and when that is slowly chipped away by obligations (yes, a bf/gf can feel like an obligation sometimes) they tend to run away or fall into a rut.  I love staying up late and working on various projects. If I had a girl there who wanted me to cuddle every night I would eventually go mental. I had to break up with a girl in college because she WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. I couldnt get homework done. I couldnt go out for a beer with just my male friends. She was so needy and a bit immature.  That is the fear of commitment. Giving up control.   Who cares what people like on Facebook. If I saw someone post what you posted id shrug and move on. This entire thread reeks of attention seeking   1. She was not your girlfriend.  2. She is crazy.   I downvoted you because you didn't explain your position. You said one lazy ass thing then got mad about it   [There was also a Mass Effect 80s cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOqHUa2LfNY)   [A bit unrelated, but SNL did a Hobbit Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA8-KAsuv8w)   Then make a game, OP.   This thread must become #1 of all time   La la la la, I am not listening, la la la la.....   The only reason they gave everyone the pre-order "zombie mode" DLC is some users who pre-ordered a physical copy would not be getting their pre-order DLC discs until after release. So, rather than piss off those people, they gave it to everyone.     Right outside my apartment. Playing vidya games then hear loud pops and shouting.  http://imgur.com/a/KA4Xw   You essentially wanr those $60 games for $30. Lol   Does this apply to the Freelancer Physical package too?

Sister, I have slept with prostitutes, apostated from the faith, taken drugs and have been drunk off my ass, yet it still amazes me how forgiving people can be.  Then imagine Christ, who does that every single time, no matter how low you get. He's always going to be there at the bottom to pick you back up.  I cannot lie and say there are no judgemental people, but we should recognize it is Christ who helps, not those people, thank God.   My old watch doesnt even work, permanently set to 6:34, but it looks damn nice and was a really expensive gift from my father so I always wear it.   Really? I think Steam has really become quite shit in the past couple years. Any developer who knows how to make a crappy sidescroller in flash dumps their game on there. The customer service is atrocious too and they rarely, if ever, offer refunds.   It is absolutely required. The majority of communication between people is non-verbal. You learn to read body language; the twitch of the eyebrows, where the eyes are looking, shuffling of feet, the person's body odor, their smell....  If you tried this experiment on Skype, it still would not work.   The article mentions *personal* questions, not fun nonsense you ask your mates when you're bored and it's almost last call.   You should ask stuff like: who did you have your first kiss with? Where? When was the last time you cried?  I think the idea is you get to the *core* of a person's personality right away. Being with a complete stranger makes one start to sweat, you tense up. But then you're staring at each other, you can almost feel the body heat coming off the other person, so your hormones are starting to go wild. Now throw on very deep, personal questions that break into the core of someone's personality. The experiment breaks you down to your most vulnerable state, so you will naturally cling to the person you are with - or be entirely disgusted and retreat.   Uh....has anyone actually gotten back a rating?

You're going to have a blast    To anyone still buying into the F2P rumors; don't hold your breath.  Lol   Earl Warren wasn't a stripper!   MM....burger   Now I am considering a reinstall. Do you recommend any graphical mods to update the look of the games? I never played them much back in the day.   Man I really disliked Inquisition. Boring fetch quests that served as padding between main missions for a tired, predictable plot. Uninstalled as soon as I beat the main story.  And it was very disheartening for me since I played Origins and DA2 for the first time right before I bought DAI. Loved them both and I got very invested in my Hawke.   Most people on Reddit, well the game subreddits, are teenagers and early 20 yearolds with disposable income, ample free time and no other obligations than homework or maybe a part time job.  When these kids are literally being bombarded and absorbing content like trailers, opinions and games for hours a day, they get caught up in hype. Remember when you were 20 how "intelligent" you were? Then do you remember how fucking stupid most 20 year olds are with their money?  This and many other subreddits (e.g. pcmasterrace) have huge circlejerks around preorders, dlc and certain publishers...but time again these kids buy up all the shit anyways. [Remember that Modern Warfare 2 boycott?](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7hyuy3FN--/18j48weujcgewjpg.jpg)   But those games are puny, in terms of file size, to triple A titles. Bastion and Tran took me 20min to dl   How the hell would a mainstream gamer know that? They don't follow developers or read wikipedia. They just watch tv and maybe boot up steam for CSGO and see some ads for new games.   http://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-drops-subscription/  Fuck you   Yes   Pipe down in there, Hutz!

"Ey gurl, why don't I show you my bend modifier? ;) "   The work I do is for myself because I enjoy doing it. Women do not motivate me. Friends do not motivate me. I motivate myself to improve. When a woman comes along I fancy, look at all this work and effort and skill I can show her; it makes her think I am confident, that I am working for myself and not to get laid like some desperate weirdo. She will see a man, alone and working hard, not a "nice" boy running after her. She doesnt want a nice boy. She wants a man who can take care of himself and therefore, likely take care of her too. She wants a man.   The message being: get off your fat ass, stop fucking complaining and make a change.   And ive seen girls with guys who look so average. And they're not rich or anything.   Alyssa acts like a loser but let's not call everyone else one too   Are you a panda bear?   Drop little bits of yourself, or your skills, interests, etc. when talking with them.   I'm in school for 3D modeling and when I see a girl (or guy, since I want to make friends too), working on a 3D model, I just go up, "Woah that's really good. How long did it take?" The common interest helps break the ice. As the conversation flows, I drop little bits about what I may be working on (currently a Juggernaut skin for Dota 2), or what my dream game project is.  But here's the catch: I am shit at modeling. I only started this class two weeks ago.   After I have talked to them about the program for a bit, or what games they're playing, I usually ask for their Facebook or phone number (or both). I'm now in several of these small Facebook groups with upper year students comparing their work, and here I am, a complete noob, just listening and learning.    You wouldn't know what to do with her  Yes you would. It's one of the male body's most primal instincts; fucking. It comes naturally like breathing. My first lay was scary, confusing and I did not know what to do before it started but once it starts...well.   Gonna see the bear with the little car, huh?   Where in Canada are you from?   If that what you got you missed the point. At the beginning of the scene (bit hard to notice in that clip), the guys are all complaining about poor sales, shitty jobs, etc. They're being negative.  Then the Alec Baldwin salesman comes in and tells them to essentially man the fuck up and stop complaining - use that energy to close more sales. Stop being down on yourself "I was a salesman, its a touch racket..." and rather go out and do your job.  While the vid is specific to sales, the same mentality can be applied to anything in life. No one is going to hold your hand. "Nice guy? No one gives a shit." Stop complaining, get off your ass and fucking go change something about yourself.  As for dating? Every guy is a nice guy. Every guy can be reasonably attractive with some effort. The problem is the shitty attitudes that run amok on this subreddit. Attitude is everything.   The circlejerk is so strong in this fucking thread.  Me and Cat are both stating our opinions. We're not trolling. We're not being disruptive. We're not insulting anyone. We're stating opinions.  Fucking reddit.   Hrm, does anyone else prefer the fairly short story ME1 had? I just don't have time for these massive RPGs anymore. In Inquisition, I had to use cheats to bypass the "power level" requirements and just get to the next part of the main quest.  or downvote me for having an opinion   ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL   Why not? Not like you have the same companions and protagonist through all 3 games   Could you say it was "The best..." ending we got?   My career did not exist 20 years ago.   /r/circlejerk   edit: ayy lmao   Why would anyone ever need a stock photo of an old man holding his wife hostage?     most people are just complaining to get on the band wagon.  On Reddit? No....   It's $35 on nuuvem.   wow nice, how long did it take?   What a pedestrian thread.  No mention of Enter the Void or Man Bites Dog anywhere. We get generic "twist" bullshit like the Prestige as the top comments.    sided against the geth and whatnot.   Noooo. The Geth are innocent machines. A xenophobic Shepard would certainly go against the dirty space nomads.   Be a xenophobic Shepard. Paragon to humans, max renegade to aliens. Only recruit humans and only complete human loyalty missions. Ignore alien squadmates and let them die. Don't let Grunt out of his tank. Let Wrex die on Virmire, let the Council die, don't cure the Genophage.    Publishers ensure a few things like marketing, human resources, employee benefits, distribution for multiple platforms, international releases and not to mention the *funding for the next game.*  For every crowdfunded game like Minecraft or DayZ that does well, there are *hundreds* that don't even make it to Kickstarter. Go look at the Steam Early Access page and you will see just how much *crap* is on there.  A developer-publisher like CD Projekt have two divisions in their company. They have separate teams that work on marketing/distribution and then the actual game's development. An MBA doesn't know how to 3D model, nor does a concept artist know how to create an effective marketing campaign.  And you get 100% bet your ass that CD Projekt has outside investment (i.e. banks, investors) to help fund Witcher 3. Money doesn't just fall from the sky.   Since when is it unfeasible to demand better service for our dollars?  It's not and I agree with you that we shouldn't have to put up with crap like uPlay, Origin or even Steam, all of which are DRM platforms (despite the pro-Valve circlejerk on Reddit).   But you're giving all publishers the same brush stroke. You've become blinded by bad guys like Ubisoft and instead forget the hundreds of other [publishers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_publishers) out there that go completely under the radar. You know, the ones like Focus Interactive or Paradox Interactive, who just do their jobs.  And frankly I don't give a shit if Ubisoft releases a bad port every now and then. If they offered me a job to work in modelling or animation, you can sure bet I will work for them. They're a proven publisher with lots of money and job security, rather than doing the incredibly risky endeavour of starting one's own studio (especially when I have no formal experience yet).   You wouldn't have 90% of AAA games if those publishers did not exist. They're a necessary evil.   Snap out of it! *slap*  It's *slap* better to be *slap* safe *slap* than *slap* sorry.

 Haha that's perfect   My brother played Eminem's "Headlights" a few weeks ago. I'm not a fan of rap but my brother is a big Eminem fan so I'm familiar with the story of Eminem's relationship with his mother and that song honestly made me start crying.  But I think it would be 4 Non Blondes "What's Up" at 14. I heard it and that's when I knew music wasn't something you just consume but could mean so much more.   I have no choice but to take my time. I think I've chosen an expensive hobby so I'll have to save for my next purchase. :)   Yeah, I kind of figured that too. Any suggestions for the next step?   Thanks, there's a store nearby that carries Grados. I'll go take a look.   I just bought the Sennheiser HD558s. I like them enough but I can't help but feel they're just a taste of what I'm looking for. A start pretty much. I want headphones that make it sound like I'm right there, right in the room. The 558s still feel like I'm listening through headphones. Any cheap set ups for someone just starting out? I listen to mostly country.   Yes and it sucked. I was maybe 9 or 10 and this was at a daycare type center. I cried in the kid's house. One of the girls my age must've seen me cos she gave those were talking about me shit. Also, heard my aunt joking about me but I love my aunt and forgive her 'cos she just likes to joke around.   Bree Van De Kamp. Redhead. Stepford wife-ish. And I think I could handle her crazy.   Thanks, I'll check it out. I miss rdio simply because people I friended shared the same taste in music and I could see what they were listening to.    In a good way? It would be the steel guitar.   Watched fireworks with some friends from my backyard.   Ruining their fun I guess. When I didn't drink and would go bar hopping or clubbing I would just order a soda like pepsi or coke and just let everyone assume I was drinking rum and coke.   For those rare nights when I decide to just get drunk I drink lots of water and a bottle of gatorade before I sleep. Still got a hangover when you wake up in the morning? Bacon, more gatorade, and more water.   I made the switch from rdio to google play and so far it's underwhelming. No community, harder to discover music, and adding music isn't a simple click.   I feel like if something was popular, it was everywhere and you couldn't escape it. Pokemon, Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, Tamagotchi, Titanic, Friends, Windows 95, Sock'em Boppers, Tickle Me Elmo. Nowadays it's easier to ignore things but I kind of miss being caught in a wave of pop culture.   If anyone wants to add me, pm me. I don't want to give out my PSN name here. I have a PS4 and play GTA5, BF4, and just started FIFA.   I listen to mostly country music. I was thinking of the Sennheiser 558 because I can pick it up today while I would have to order the 598 online.   I'm thinking of getting Sennheiser HD558s. Would these be good headphones to start off with? And would I need an amp/dac or them? I'm seeing the E10k around a lot so should I get those? It'll be for my iPod classic and laptop.   I'm Native and yes it is. I have a lot of alcoholics in my family. My parents stopped drinking when I was a kid and I'm glad they did because our home life was great compared to others. Education sucks in native communities, poor healthcare, poor housing, little jobs, and residential school really messed up the older generations who then became poor parents to their kids who then became poor parents to their kids. But the new generation is getting slowly better. I see more young people who are breaking the cycle of family addiction who lead healthy lives. I didn't drink until I was in my 20s because of all alcoholism I saw in my hometown. People who get blackout drunk and become violent. But after years of living away from that I felt it was okay to try a beer and now I would consider myself a social drinker, 1-2 drinks tops and I'm done and switching to water. I'm very aware of the stereotype so I try not to get too drunk.   **Budget** - $25-250   **Source** - iPod classic, Macbook Pro   **Isolation** - Doesn't matter   **Preferred Type** - Over the ear. Or in the ear.   **Tonal Balance** - I'm not sure.. I don't like too much bass. I like to hear everything.   **Past headphones** - $20 Sony earbuds that get worse over time and sound muddy now. Sennheiser earbuds that were stolen so I don't remember what they sounded like. I also have Denon AH-D7000s and I find those underwhelming but they're meant for my record player not my iPod.   **Preferred Music** - Country, country rock, indie rock/pop. I could be listening to anything from acoustic country, country with rock guitars, or lo-fi like The Wavves and then to something like Lorde or Florence and the Machine.    The store I'm going to carries Sennheiser, AKGs, Audio-Technica, Monster, Bose, Sony and Panasonic. So preferably in those brands.   Riddick. Katee Sackhoff being badass, just ignore Riddick's stupid comments.  	21
 With the Departure of Nisovin and Rob, I will be following and supporting them like I did when I first joined PlayMindcrack. I hope the best for Guude, and I hope that maybe he can do something to keep his server alive too, but at it's core, Nisovin and Rob were PMC, they were the games, and they were AT LEAST half the community, and I will stick by their side, as I have from the start.   Well, KGM is under Rob's jurisdiction as well, so I see that going with him, as well as WAT, I presume. Camelot I'm not sure who that's under, as well as RoC and PJT.   Noosa - Walk on by (SR   RNG Remix)   good job :L    Mexican posted before you, you cannot host at this time without proof of permission.   Whitelist will be off at :45, for those that are waiting.   Not the time, nor the place, there's another thread you could just have easily said this, and if what rebexer said is true, then you should be less of a hypocrite.   Time to go, although, while being known for what you do is nice and all, I wasn't known at all on the gym until I became 10th on the leaderboard, that's when I go noticed. However, even if getting noticed is a good thing to come from the boards, they do so much more damage than good to me, and others, so it seems. The board should be removed, that's my opinion.   Honestly, although matt is in a case of ban evasion, he was only banned for bad fellowship, and so he himself is not cheating, and all his kills are legit, as one person, as much as he can play. FWP is not one person, can play any maximum of its time its members are on, and while there isn't modded clients in use as far as we know, and play time is not a bannable by any means, it seems very unsportsman-like to use one single account just for the purpose of bringing someone who got all his kills as one person, fairly, down, just on account of his past ban that doesn't have anything to do with his ability to kill.  tl;dr, Op got his kills as one person, fairly, it's unsportsmanlike to use a group on one account to do the same.   Sadly, I would not put it past some people that were once or still are in the community to do these things. Some groups are maliciously toxic, while others are very very nice. The thing is, those that are toxic are sometimes the popular ones, and they are part of the reason I am no longer playing on the server. My situation, as well as another friend of mine's are very similar to your's in terms of falling into a depression. I do not attribute these people alone as the cause of this, but I do site them as partial reason, as well as the boards, and other goings on in my life. It makes me very sad to see a community fall into something like this, but I am happy that someone brought it to light, something I couldn't do.   And our top Paladin being a bunch of people on one account is any better? it feels wrong to the community to do that.   While I have a personal bias due to people being rude to me in a similar manner, the *penguins* as it were, are known to share many alt accounts. While this on its own is not really against the rules, it is a relatively common occurrence.    THAT. IS. PERFECT.

He wasn't wrong, blocking off does kill dwarves. You would need more of an explanation to actually be able to convey your point.    Did you actually read the post? It says it right on Team size.    It was 1.5x gold, just a little edit.   I miss short games   nono, you are correct, they dont show up until those 5 are exausted   and patrons do not get double, they get 1.5x   FBI's game was posted first   I don't enjoy the indoors anymore, but I used to, now it's just about who has the most slabs and the most wrenches, it's not about tunnels anymore. Tunnels are pointless anymore   Honestly I have more fun with short and quick games, these new hour and a half long games are basically the reason I quit, they give me such a bad headache.  PS: Why is this downvoted? are you serious? It was a statement, my god.  PSS: This community is so broken now, all these downvotes on Mae's statements even though he is just trying to show his point, quite sad guys. People have opinions, they aren't necessarily wrong, and he has no reason to be downvoted.   Longer and more kills does not necessarily mean more fun.   It's unfortunate this is so downvoted, as you seem to have the same problems with the game now as I do, and it is the reason I have quit.  edit: lol, ironically being downvoted for a statement about downvoting.   Could I join?    May I ask what IrishBrawler (on the 2nd to last picture) is saying, what's that supposed to mean? of course, only if you know, by chance.   You all think this is a joke, it's not.   The special weapons do not give any bonus damage or any other buff, they merely have a different name and shine.    Hasn't gotten any better really.   The boards to me have done so much more damage then ingame, and I want them gone so badly.    Milky Way     Server Info: this server is a 4GB server hosted in PA, USA, North America, Earth, Milky Way.

I myself lost the whole team feeling when people started to form their own little groups and hold certain people up higher than others. It makes people not in these groups plain feel like crap as they're not included and sometimes discriminated against. Can't say you feel like you're on a team when someone on that team punches out your torches because they don't like you, or let their friends that are mobs just focus you all game.

You can actually make these yourself, simply going into your server textures file, changing the playmindcrack one into the same format as a resource pack, and then replacing the files from the resource pack of choice with the playmindcrack ones with the items you wish to change.   Magma Cream Represent!    Alpha Gym Represent!    You may think PlayMindcrack is unlikely to go down, but it's predecessor, Bruce's Gym, which used the same systems and had a lot of fans too, could not operate due to the low amount of donations, and was abandoned. Donators are more likely to donate if they have incentive, even if that incentive is only silly and fun. Getting nothing doesn't bode well for servers, and it won't.   What happens when you have servers like PlayMindcrack, that is coded and run by someone with a loyal fanbase, that wont work anywhere else, because they actually own the rights to a lot of the minigames? These servers are run for hundreds of dollars, you can't expect one man with all that money to all of a sudden run a server.   People already do.    not working as intended   not working as intended   	61

It was great, but the only downside was the extra floppy skin I had around my stomach. I looked like someone stuffed a pancake in a muffin tin.

What you want to do here is keep your fingers nice and loose.  Fold that thumb under your other fingers to protect it.  Also you always want to keep your wrist limp."   At least you didn't stick your dick in that crazy.   That's some dirty fighting, right there.   She must've learned her Muay Thai skills on the streets.  That and how to suck a dick for some coke.   Maybe you just found a new way for a girl to touch your junk.    "Hey girl.  Imma show you how to punch.  Just aim for the hands and if you miss and hit above my dick...next time just go a little lower and a lot softer."      I like your style.   You're like the male version of Rosa Parks.

 You know they've gotta consult their boss before they release anything about it. You can't really expect a lower level employee in charge of social networking to tell you everything will be fixed in a month, while eleaf is probably just learning about the issue and not sure what to do.    I'd say something exactly like that about the istick 50w, tbh. I haven't been on here in a couple weeks and just now am seeing this giant craze of everyone throwing out their eleaf products. If I hadn't known about that I'd still say that my iStick 50w is freaking awesome. I haven't had a single issue with it. Everyone raves about good products they have on here, and every day that I'm on here I see someone raving about how an order they placed got fulfilled and actually got to their doorstep. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say that just because they're raving happy about the istick that they're an eleaf rep.    Congrats, friend.    Don't have a serial number. Wanted to chime in and say that I got my 50w via the SmogGB directly from eleaf, and have had it for almost 2 months, and have had no problems at all. It is the only power source I've used since getting it, and I treat it like a baby. Hardly ever even sees my pocket, as my shitty dripper leaks everywhere. I carried over the habit from my mech mod of turning it off after each time I'm done using it. If you are worried about flames, buy lipo safety bag for under $20 online.

My dad just informed me of the same thing about the other boot XD. When I go back to work on that caliper I'll take the wheel off that side and push the boot back into place. Thank you!   (Illuminati)^n   Absolutely excellent link, man. Thank you so very much for the advice.   It came too far out? That seems accurate - as I first spinned it to the left (Thinking lefty loosey), and it began to leak fluid and got wobbly. However I just held and spun her back to the right and the leaking became minimal/nonexistant and it seemed back in place. How could I go about putting it back in place? Is it fixable, if this is the issue?   I'm having an issue changing out brake pads and rotors on a 2003 20th Anniversary Mk4 GTI. On the driver side, after removing the caliper from the rotor, opening the brake fluid reservoir, and using a special tool (the traditional 3/8"drive cube with two edges ground down) to turn the caliper's piston clockwise, the piston only goes in about 3/4 of the way. [Here's an image of first the right side piston, and the left side piston compressed completely.](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj)  Anyone know why the piston won't go in any farther? I can't fit it over my pads and rotors. I've even put the special tool on an electric drill and sat there for a couple minutes just free spinning the piston - however it doesn't go in any farther.   I'm really screwed and out of a ride - hoping for some advice.    It can move in and out, just can only go in about 3/4 of the way (the distance shown in the photo). It actually spins very much more freely than the one that retracted completely.   Yes I did, thank you for replying.

That's can't just be stupid - this is like, delusional.    2 Broke Girls   I can't urge you enough to call 911  All you have to give is an address and you can hang up.  There are people that can bring that happiness back into your life again, Chris.    Please dont. Is there anything else you can give me? I want to help you. A phone number so I can talk to you? The city you're in by any chance?    Are you saying that you think you'll live through tonight?  If so, i'd call that hardly a failure. It takes great strength to be able to be where you are now.    What do you think you failed?   You think you might be able to stay a little longer, my friend?   Ah, I see. A friend of mine does the same down in TN - he's 101st Airborne. Are you Army Naitonal Guard or Air National Guard?   I know you're fighting me, bud. But I really do want you to live. I see the numerous clues you've left throughout this thread as to your location, and it seems just looking at that, that deep down you want to live, too. At this moment you just don't quite know how.   It will come to you in time. Maybe therapy doesnt work at first. It all seems like a pile  of shit. When I went through therapy, I actually found that things got worse right before they started getting better than I've ever seen before,  and that was because I was forced to finally face all of the things in life that I buried so deep inside. Once you work through facing that, once you start to learn how to feel in control of yourself again, things will get better. It doesn't have to end like this, my friend.    Do you have buddies on base with you? Is there someone you can talk to first thing in the morning on base? The area is surrounded with people who could possibly help you, and people there care about you whether it's easy to see or not, as do I. I'd rather see you make it on base tomorrow than pass here tonight.    Check this out. [National Guard has a crisis hotline. You can not only call but simply chat online.] ( http://www.guardyourhealth.com/suicidal-crisis-support/)   Here is the night time call number I was given through my group therapy.  -snip-  When I'm considering suicide, and I don't want to listen to anything else, I read this. It's broken up into comfortable segments. It's meant for times like now.   http://areason.org/   The offices nighttime line should always have a therapist standing by. The behavioral medicine center of the hospital is always open for nighttime calls, and they know how to help you.   If you give me just a moment, I'm going to dig through my group therapy binder and find you some of my resources.    That's a recipe for an extremely uncomfortable feeling, my friend. I've been on all those medications. I beg you not to go through with it.   If you're going to go through with it, think of this. 24 more hours. What difference would it make? Say you give yourself just 24 more hours. You revisit this tomorrow, ask yourself if you still want to do it. If you do, it will be the same result as you taking your life tonight. But say maybe you don't - you might really find happiness again someday in the very near future.    You have a safety plan set up through this group therapy, or through one of your therapists? Are there some actions you can take according to that? It's there for a reason :).   If not, man, I just really want to remind you that this is the biggest decision you can make in your lifetime, and that like every other big decision, sometimes you really want to take the time to educate yourself on both sides of it.   Do you think you'd like to call your therapist? Maybe just tell her what's going on and how you're feeling, just to see what she might say?   How will the others in your group therapy feel, knowing that they might be in similar shoes as you, and not seeing you make it out of therapy alive?    well i mean, i wouldnt drive at the moment cause that would be just straight up dangerous to others, trying to kill myself, not others...  My friend, what if I pointed out that, by leaving, you will injure every person around you in a way that they will never be able to heal or recover from?   Stay for the people around you. There may be people in your life who can't survive without you. A friend of mine who passed away from suicide criticized this - he said it was selfish for other people to tell him to stay for them, however this reason to be alive will change over time. You won't, for the rest of your life, live just to spare the ones around you from pain. One day you'll look back on this night in tears happy that you made it out alive. I'm not Bullshitting, either :), I've had that moment. It's a very real thing. You've got so much ahead of you, my friend.   I tried to pass in the same way you're going about it right now. I don't recommend it. I'd like to ask, and hopefully you'll tell me, what medication it was that you picked up?      The thing about a psychiatrist, they are a specialist in behavioral medicine. Not so much therapy. A lot of people try to have a psychiatrist and a psychologist - or primarily a psychologist. They are specialists in therapy. They can really make a difference.    Damn.

 Yarp   From Steam Stats:  "Steam is down for routine maintenance every Tuesday."   I originally categorized it as "Hijacked Account/Stolen" but I resolved my issue and now I just want to purchase games again. What would you have suggested I changed it to?   Hmmm.... This might just be crazy enough to work.   I'm having the same issue, actually. I'm also using Gmail.   Long story short; I thought my account might have been at risk at a point so I decided to lock it (Huge mistake). I've been waiting four or five days now for Steam Support to reply but no answer. I've never had to use Steam Support before so I really didn't know what I was in for. Now the Summer Sale is almost here and my account is forbidden from purchasing games. Just came here to grieve. Perhaps someone could give me some hope with their Steam Support stories?   Good old role playing    Dammit, we need lamps   I thought I was the only one unfortunate enough to have to use this light method. Works like a charm though.   I've been smoking for around 7 or 8 years now. As of the past three years, I've been a heavy smoker. I used to be fine. Relaxed, giddy, aware, etc. Now I just get too tired too quickly and paranoid on top of that. Paranoid that people are watching me or judging me or something. It's pretty shitty cause I would always smoke to relax my mind but now it's doing the opposite. Any opinions on this?      I don't really see the cause for alarm here. It's a joke curator, he's had a YouTube channel for quite some time too. It's not that serious, guys. Not really doing any harm.

 Yeah, it would serve drinks. I thought about getting a job at a club, but I life in a rural area so there aren't any around, which is one reason why I had the idea.    Brand new to this sub, so I have super limited knowledge. I'm an 18 year-old who is considering starting a dance club in my local urban area which allows 18+ patrons.

Also why would harlequin declare a blood feud with Dunkz even if he had killed dupree by accident which i don't think Ghostwalker did, I highly doubt dunkz would've taken control over denver the way he did.

The PCs are hired to secure the area inside tir na nog's veil rumors and reports of a manastorm on the rise are circulating about for a while.  big events does the awakened community speculate on the matrix,  the manastorm did come about altough unexpectingly on it's way to the veil, despite the PCs best efforts the two anomalies crash and the PCs are shot up into a deep metaplane waking up in a completly destroyed tir na nog with remnants of the city and a gigantic ancient sky scraper with a strange architecture showing signs of "life".

 Yes and no. While HIV cannot kill you, when it turns to AIDS it can. However, we are no longer in the 1980s. People can go 20 or more years without HIV turning to AIDS. Even when it does change over, it is no longer the death sentence that it once was. It is fairly easily managed and medical researchers have managed to bring viral load levels down so low that it is nearly undetectable, effectively curing the virus, but with the stipulation that one must remain on antiretroviral medication for life. While AIDS was a deadly epidemic at one time, it is now closer to the flu; some people will die, but many more, with effective treatment, will be fine for a very long time. Since we don't arrest people for going out when sick and knowingly passing it along by touching things in public, it's a bit of a stretch to say that its attempted murder. More sensible would be a charge for fraud and a charge for assault, but that's just my opinion.   Yes and no. My "type" of lesbian is called boidyke. That means I'm a young, butch lesbian that isn't ultra masculine. Often, people like me wear the same clothes as men and boys a few years younger. Obviously, if stores took advantage of that, they'd lose a lot of sales to said boys. There are a handful of smaller name designers that focus on clothes for women who are masculine. I generally learn about them online. There are even maternity brands dedicated to masculine people. I belong to such a small demographic that for anything that is big name it isn't worth the money and potential loss to market to me.   SJW has two meanings. The real one; social workers. The stupid; anyone left of me. Neither is really an insult.   Also great to ensure safety of patients! Abortions can have unintended complications that require more than what is available outpatient.   Edit: I'm not saying outpatient is bad, I'm saying that hospital procedures can be better. Diner food isn't bad, but restaurant food can be better; it's all about what you want. What I would want is the best safety net possible.   My wife, who is a lesbian, uses PP for her birth control for PCOS. Without it she'd have gone through menopause at 19.   What are number 7?   I grew up poor and am minimally better off now. My one splurge is clothes. I'm a 20 year old lesbian, and I love the men's section at Aeropostale. The sales are great and the clothes last years longer than anything I've ever bought at Wal-Mart.    Equal parts redneck and historical society.      Old Spice sells it at Wal-Mart!   This is my mom! She told me and my then girlfriend, now wife, to "try the shoes on before you buy them."    /r/loomknitting   Knees are sooooo ugly. I hate knees more than any other body part.    More than disdain, people assume I'm incompetent simply because I appear female.   They why don't transmen get murdered at such high rates?   "Insecure bitches"   No one cares if a woman wear jeans because wanting to be a man isn't bad. Being a transwoman gets you murdered because wanting to be a woman is the worst thing someone can be.    A lot of feminists think feminism has to do with women being superior.   FTFY.  Feminism is about equality, some assholes just forget that.   It's a women's issue that being seen as feminine is a bad thing.   I'm AFAB and genderqueer! I totally get people looking weird at me for doing man things with these big ass breasts.   So what you're saying is she is an irresponsible mover.   Shhh! They'll realize that they're all actually feminists and have to go get washed up over at /mensrights and TRP.   It's just hair. Its not like he's going to be using his DSL.  Edit: DSL is dick sucking lips. Not sure why the comment saying this was deleted.   Psoriasis. I have it on the back of my head and on my arms and legs. Its best in the summer, when Its often exposed. Some derms will send patients to tan.   Maybe your point would come across better if it was phrased in a less misogynistic way.   That's an adult thing, not a man thing, sadly.   People should have skills, not just men.    This thread is marked serious and assaulting ones spouse is never acceptable. If you wish to abuse your partner, seek help.   I don't know how much this actually works. I'm a woman, but a butch one. I'd never flirt with a cop as I don't feel it's appropriate and I'd be judged for the tears, too. I have never gotten a ticket in all the Times I've been pulled over. I'm polite and honest. I think I get away with it by being white. I had a Spanish friend who is a lot like me and she would always get tickets. I live in a red neck area, though, with tons of racists.   I doubt he will. I'm his gay sister and it's not really an issue in our family. If he were gay he'd have said so by now.   Sadly no. My older brothers are both in long term, committed relationships.   That's not acceptable for anyone and this post is tagged serious.   I'd divorce a spouse for a "sucks for you" comment paired with lack of equal dedication to our children.   I have no idea how you got Margaret.   My wife and I both have unconventional spellings for our first and last names, and my middle name. I have never minded spelling it all out. It's unique and I love it, and so does she.   Eh I think it looks better with one.   If I had a spouse like you I'd get a divorce yesterday.   My brother and his girlfriend go for mani/pedi fates every other Saturday. He gets a clear coat. He's a 19 year old musclehead/car nut. There are guys out there!      My 6 year old nephew loves Legos. For Easter, I got him a set that was just pieces. He had no idea what the fuck to do. The only sets kids want and people buy are the pre planned one's. How about some imagination?   My mom told me that it meant you weren't a virgin and refused. I had been having sex with My girlfriend for months by then. I wasn't concerned.   I honestly love them. Pads feel like a diaper to me. Tampons keep me feeling cleaner and keep odor in. I don't even feel them, which you aren't supposed to if done right. But to each their own. Tons of people love menstrual cups and they are scary as fuck to me.   Surprisingly this often exactly what happens. I live in the Poconos. I am three exits on 80 in from Jersey and about 80 miles west of NYC. My family is local; I'm a sixth documented generation graduate of my high school. People who come here from New York and New Jersey bring gang violence, drugs, entitled attitudes, littering, and more with them. That isn't to say that all people from those places do that or even all that come here do, but plenty of them do bring all of that here, and it sucks for those of us who are local and don't want those things here.   I literally have to hold back my orgasms of excitement while I am passing clots the size of pennies through my cervix.   Well you put tampons in your vagina so it must feel great! Like a cottony dildo!   I'd bet a thousand to one that OPs desk was either moved or his position changed. It's unsanitary to PUMP in a bathroom and it's wrong to force a woman to expose herself.   Because people are not obligated to show any part of their body to anyone else.   If you have Netflix, try The Secret Life of the American Teenager and One Tree Hill.   Why should they have to expose their breasts to their coworkers?   So jerk it at home on your own time.   I'm from the northeast!   But dem titties is there for meeeeeee!  ^^^^^/s      Do you understand lactation and breasts being engorged? It's completely different from wanting to jerk it.   You're saying it's logical to allow employees to use their time to masturbate, which is technically illegal in public, but not smoke, which is legal?   Edit: I just realized you were explaining his thinking. I'm sorry.   Anecdote: I was raised in the north and I use holler/hollered     I understand where you could come to that conclusion, but I disagree. Even though we have walls in the women's room, it's awkward to intentionally take the stall next to someone if there are other choices. Its just awkward to use the bathroom so close to other people, especially strangers.   She could be, but that's not a valid reason to beat someone.   She already gave him the ultimatum "you hit me again and I leave". If she doesn't follow through on that he has no reason to think she will again. Also, is it really worth putting her life at risk to stop an abusive person from being an addict?   That's irrelevant. The situation at hand is a man beating a woman for the second time in a week and his mother blaming the woman. Your comment is irrelevant.   How do you prepare it?   Can confirm; my wife is the boss.   Clothes from Aeropostale. Their sales are great and it's generally good stuff on sale. I only shop sale racks in that store.   Most drag queens are not transvestites, either.   You come to a sub that thrives on equality and make a homophobic joke and expected it to go well. That's irrational.   I'm a genderqueer lesbian. Don't throw your anger at me over your inability to behave like a rational human.   There are plenty of gay drag queens, which actually vary from transvestites. Also, you implied that drag queens are gay by implying that they like pegging that you implied is gay.    How is it a bunch of songs stitched together? It has a story progression done in a series of different pieces. Plenty of songs are done this way; Paradise by the Dashboard Light, Jesus of Suburbia, Alice's Restaurant, and more.   Came here to say this.   On a scale of 10 to 10, 11/10 with 12/10 with rice.   I guess I have to see it a fourth time.   Nope. I don't like action movies.    Jessica!   Wait the what?   That was easily my favorite scene in the movie! The singing and dancing were really impressive.   We don't use "retarded" anymore. A person is "developmentally delayed".    Most siblings do not look that much alike. My sisters in law have another sister 15 months younger than them that looks nothing like them. Looking at pictures of siblings at the same age rarely offers the kind of similarity of many fraternal twins.   No, those are identical twins, not fraternal.   Like Mary Kate and Ashley or young Dylan and Cole Sprouse. I have fraternal twin sister in laws that I can't tell apart either. Why does this happen?   You should go see it. It took my wife months to get me to watch the first and I was actually excited for the second. It was really a good movie.   It's a great movie! My wife and I went on a date to see it, then the next night we saw it with my brother and his girlfriend. Yesterday we saw it with my sisters in law on my wife's side.      Try posting in /r/asktransgender. This is more of a general trans topic so they may be able to help more.   I hate /legaladvice. Real lawyers are not hanging out giving away free info on reddit. It's people who can use Google just like you. See if you can get a court appointed attorney. Maybe try to get your daughter into a mental health rehab center if she is suicidal and see if that helps. It may even help your case. I'm not well versed on the legal stuff, but I'm a mental health advocate. Please get your daughter help.   So if you need to eat a standard wooden door.   Hey no problem. If you don't live it sometimes it's hard to see a different side or there are perspectives you don't consider. Just like how sometimes fast food may be a part of your health budget though a splurge, that's what fresh food often is to me, just with a financial splurge.   I disagree. I'm poor and not healthy. I would love to be able to eat more fresh veggies and fruit. My favorite food is asparagus. Its too damn expensive. If it were cheaper, I'd have it more often.   I hate refrigerated leftovers! Room temp is where it's at and I haven't died yet.   one time we were in a diner and my uncle showed up. my dad had to leave to take my mom to work (night shift) and he offered me and my brother milkshakes. we said that we didn't think our parents would be okay with that. he said your parents aren't here, pick a flavor. his example is how I try to live my life as an aunt.   /r/firstworldchildmurdererproblems   Is it just biological middle children? I am a middle child but my older siblings are adopted.   pro tip: she's not going to ask about boys or drinks or birth control or thongs. she's just going to do all of that. your behavior makes you unapproachable and you are destroying your relationship with your daughter by being a controlling misogynist.   I'm anti-two piece for girls prior to high school. I have seen too many times men leering at little girls. I feel that two piece suits sexualize them and their bodies when they are too young to know what that means. I am also against Speedo style suits for little boys for the same reason. Children should not be sexualized. Tankini style suits are okay as long as the bottom is shorts style, not like a bikin, in my opinion for my children.   I assume you've heard of phantom limb syndrome, where amputees can still "feel" their body parts. For me, dysphoria is a lot like that. I can feel that my chest is supposed to be flat. I can feel myself get erections and I can feel that I should have testes. I have, on more than one occasion, gone out into my house where four other people live shirtless because I seriously forget that I have female breasts that can't just be waving around in front of my father.    except I'm attracted to women, not men, so no, not really.   If you shave no where, why care? For me personally, if you're femme enough to  want to wear a bikini bottom but not shave, I'm not approaching you. If I'm looking for a femme girl who fits femme stereotypes, I want shaved pits and legs and trimmed pubes. In the end, it's your body and your choice on what you do, I just wouldn't be attracted to you, but you're looking to be happy, not make me happy, so you do you.   The picture was of a cat with a deformed facial bone. I can't remember the exact name of it. It was simply referred to as having DS because it supposedly looked like a person with DS. He is just a moron and didn't think or search anything before posting.   This was really sweet.   That's what I thought this amounted to, but now he and his other friends are trying to throw opinions at me to prove me wrong. It's just stupid. It should have never been posted. What got me was that he had the balls to tag me in it.   I love hugs *hugs back probably too enthusiastically*!  I don't think it makes me special; I just have a passion and I firmly believe that people should follow their passion, especially if it helps others.      Also, not being a creepy weirdo makes people like you more.   In front of a room of 300 people minimum she should have embarrassed and made an ass out of OP? Yeah right. She's a 17/18 year old girl who was put on the spot.   It was probably more like "I'm going to get us a room for after the after party so we can keep hanging out, okay?" and less like "would you be comfortable with me getting us a room so we can continue hanging out after the after party if we want to?"   That's why I father them and let their mothers handle it.   I wear baggy shorts. My wife shoves her hand up my pant leg any chance she gets. While I'm driving. At the movies. Sitting side by side in a restaurant.   I'm a genderqueer, butch hair-shy-of-pillow-princess married to a very sexy, femme top. Its great.   I'm a bit younger than you, but I'm married and live with my parents.   It helps me to realize that a lot of people have no choice right now; wages are too low and prices are too high. My wife and I have a tiny cramped bedroom, but we are together and we help my mom out. I'm also unemployed. My mom is physically disabled and I do a lot that she can't. Maybe something to help you feel you have purpose is to take over household responsibility a little at a time.   I don't know if this helps at all but I hope so. Best wishes.   Boys do this stuff too you know.   I currently have what I call a dirtbag sim in Sims 3 that has 20 children, two more women pregnant, and will likely have some more in his 6 days before becoming an elder. Notable conquests include kids with a woman and then kids with her daughter and two sisters getting pregnant in the same day. He only raises the boys, and just takes them from their mothers. The oldest son is likely to follow suit. Anyone else have similar tales?   Except woman? Women don't want to be objectified with words like "chicks" or "honeys". Just call us women or our names. Not "females" or "chicas" or anything else creepy and dehumanizing.   This counselor ticks all my boxes, but I'm wondering if the other person is a conflict of some sort? I like her and I like my former boss, and my quitting had nothing to do with him and he and I are still friendly. I just want to know If it's an ethical issue.  Can I go in to make my appointment or should I call? I really hate phones.   Whip It! I love that movie so much. The book is great too.   Manipulating someone's emotions =/= being pretty.   That makes much more sense! I had conjured up a situation of an acquaintance you had had one date with getting his dick and legal name and tag all over Twitter. That's much more reasonable.   I upvoted you, but how would you feel if, as an attempted turn on, you sent him surprise boob pics for them to end up public attached to you for life like that?   I saw it two nights in a row. So worth it.   That's not always possible. Sometimes, like right now, I need more, so my wife has to give more. Right now I'm probably giving 40 to her 90, but in the past I've given a lot more. Marriage is leaning on one another when you need to.   You're one of those people who only interacts over the internet, right?   My uncle gave my mom away. Her dad was an abusive deadbeat and, while he was present, her older brother gave her away.    Well I'm glad you get that perk lol.    I have a lot of road blocks keeping me from transitioning. However, a ton of my dysphoria disappeared about a month ago when I saw a boy in the mirror. That boy looks 12 compared to my biological 20, but I'm happy with him. I don't know if I'm just carrying myself differently or what, but hormone free that boy is there smiling at me every morning and I'm thrilled.   Wait. Estrogen infused pubic hair is supposed to be soft and curly? I'm AFAB and mine is straight and wiry. So is my wife's. I'm not on hormones but she has PCOS and high T naturally so that would make sense for her. Why don't I get this perk?      What makes your opinion right and mine wrong? Because it's your opinion?   I agree that it's stupid, which is why the friendzone is stupid!   Now that you are so personally offended that you result to name calling...   Exactly! It's no where near perfect or what we need, but when you are starving, you'll take shitty food to hold you over until good food becomes available. You won't just hope until you die.   Nice meme.  Maybe you spent a lot of time on reddit and that's why you think that's the context it's usually used in.  The friendzone = "I deserve sex" trope is fucking stupid. It's not what it means; you're misrepresenting the usage of the phrase.   That reads passion.      You seem really passionate about this. Don't like someone blowing up your spot?   Not really. It's a neckbeardy thing to say. It means "I was nice! I deserve sex! Why the friendzone!?"   Yes, they do.    I'm gay. What pisses me off more than religious people who are against same sex marriage are ultra liberal hipsters who are against "all marriage" and therefore vote against it. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean I don't.    It's a transitional measure, like Don't Ask Don't Tell. No one really likes it, buts it's the only real step in normalizing to get it in it's feet. We will have single payer healthcare eventually, but if we had tried it immediately, it would have been shut down. We now have gay people serving openly, but if we hadn't had DADT, it would have been a longer wait.   The idea of the friendzone blames the woman for not wanting to be with you. It makes her out to be bad for not wanting it, and that's wrong.   No. When minimum wage is increased, every wage is. Just like minimum wage doesn't jump 4 dollars overnight, higher level wages will take time. Though, when you will be able to survive on flipping burgers, that makes good employees harder to keep. They have other real options. Employers need to be offering the best options to ensure that they keep the ones they want to. Higher minimum wage is good for all people, not just poor people.  	136
 Dystopia rising player here. Just wanted to give more details. The staff are somewhat disorganized, I will admit, since the local chapter isn't even a year old. However I haven't seen much dickishness. That's my personal experience though, I've only been to half the games and I don't know everyone.   As far as expense goes, it's $20 for your first game and $45 each subsequent game for an entire weekend of larp. Not sure how that compares to other games, but I think it's reasonable.  As a woman, I have never had a guy say anything threatening or rapey to me at a game. However we were warned that a particular player might come to our chapter who people have had issues with in the past; it ended up being moot since he was banned from all of DR before he got the chance. There are actually many, many women who are regular players at our chapter, and a strong lgbtq presence too, so it's way better than a lot of other geeky events I've been to.  In regards to safe time, the mods will tell you there is no down time. However, that isn't exactly true; in reality although zombie attacks continue well into the night the staff actually has 4am to 8am off so they can all sleep. There are no npc shifts during this time either. That means you can at least expect a few hours rest.   Who told your fiance she couldn't play a genjian because there aren't any Asians in Indiana? Fuck that noise. First off they're wrong because Toyota has a huge presence in the Midwest, secondly there are quite a few players with a character from that strain. Seriously I kind of want to know who said that racist nonsense so I can report them, I don't want that ridiculousness in my larp.   Cool, thanks!   Wow, that is really cheap for international shipping. I'm used to upwards of $20-30 for shipping from other countries.   Thanks, there are a lot of neat yarns on that site!   Ah yes, please tell me how the severe allergy I've had since childhood really works. I am perfectly aware that the lanolin is what actually causes the allergic reaction and not the hair itself. I know this because when I was in elementary school I wore a wool jacket and did not get a "rash" but rather a very bad case of hives - it was so bad my parents were worried that I might have shingles. My skin became red and blotchy from head to toe, and it was so itchy and miserable I could barely move. I had to go to the doctor and get prescription allergy medications to combat the reaction and the rash still didn't completely go away for almost an entire week.  Since then I have done a lot of research about what causes allergies like mine, what fibers are safe for me, and have tentatively experimented with various blends. I have had a reaction to as little as 13% wool, and to be quite frank, I am not willing to risk my health on a possible fix when it has such severe consequences for me. So I have stopped using wool altogether.  I realize there are some people who get scratchy wool and think they're allergic because it itches and allergies = itchy, however I do in fact have a genuine, diagnosed allergy and I really hate it when people just assume I'm some idiot who knows nothing about fibers whenever I tell them I can't handle wool. And as a side note, it's rather silly to point out the difference between the hair and the lanolin considering that we should all as English speakers know when someone colloquially states "I am allergic to wool" or "I am allergic to cats" that they aren't referring to every part of the animal but rather the specific oil or dander that induces an allergic response.   The pattern calls for 400 grams of one color and 250 grams of another, so I have no idea what the yardage should be off the top of my head. I could probably look up the Paloma yarn to get an idea though. I actually hadn't thought to look at Etsy, that's a good idea!   I did see that yarn in the store I went to, it was pretty much the only bulky yarn they had. I didn't quite like it though, so I wanted to shop around for some other options. Thank you for the suggestion, though - I appreciate it.   Alpaca should be okay for me. I'll check it out, thanks!   Hello, reddit. I'm looking for some help finding a good yarn, and I figured this would be the best place to start.  I found a really great pattern for a sweater I'd like to make before fall weather starts, and the pattern calls for Debbie Bliss Paloma yarn. The problem is, this particular brand of yarn uses 40% wool, and I am very allergic to wool, so I will have to swap this out for a different yarn that doesn't have any wool. I checked my local craft store and they don't have much bulky yarn; there was only 2 kinds, the first one didn't really feel that soft and the second was variegated but I would prefer a solid color.  If anyone knows of a bulky yarn that comes in solid colors, feels cozy, and most importantly DOES NOT have wool, please give me your recommendations! Thanks in advance :)   Okay, I have a question. I was abused as a child, and as a result now suffer from PTSD. I'm currently receiving treatment, but I would also appreciate support from other survivors. However, all of the resources for child abuse that I've found are for people who were abused by parents. I was abused by a sibling. Is there anything out there - legal help, support groups, whatever - for someone like me?   Today I realized that "get off my server" is my generation's equivalent of "get off my lawn," and that I am now old.   Definitely. As someone in a poly relationship, I am upfront about that shit if there is any chance of dating. If they want to talk to my SO, fine. Honesty is key. Cheating/hiding that sort of thing is so not cool.   Good advice! My SO and I haven't been spending much time together as a couple lately, but it's because he's been really busy with work and whenever he's not working I already have plans or it's pretty late in the day so we only have an hour or so before going to bed. We talked about this a bit last night, and we decided to schedule in some couple time Sunday. Don't know what we'll do yet, but it's the first time we've both been free for a significant period in two weeks or so, and I'll try to make it count.  Thanks for your input, I appreciate it :)   Well have you asked her about it? Because the easiest way to figure out why she's acting in a confusing manner is just to straight up ask. Honestly though it sounds like this girl isn't really worth the effort.   My favorite, ever since AFFC, has been Brienne. I really relate to her on a personal level since I'm also a woman who has gotten a lot of flack for not being traditionally pretty and daring to defy gender norms.   Oh, ok. That's not as bad then. From the way you told it, it made it sound like she started blowing you off so you then you started spamming the Instagram. Which would make very little sense.   I hope you all don't mind, but not many people know I'm poly so I just really need to gush for a bit about my new relationship! :)  I've been with my current SO for 5 and a half years now, and we've been non-monogamous off and on for the last two. He's dated a few other people, but up until recently I never have. Not that I haven't been willing, I just hadn't found anyone I was interested in.  Last week, a friend of mine from my RPG gaming group asked me out on a date Friday. We had dinner, saw a movie, played a few arcade games, and got drinks. I had so much fun! We really hit it off and decided that we both definitely want to continue seeing each other. Since then we got to hang out a bit on Sunday and again last night. And we have plans to go out again on Saturday.  I'm honestly really surprised about how well this is going. I didn't have the best of childhoods, and because of past trauma I have difficulty trusting others and dealing with any kind of intimacy or physical affection. But the new guy already knew about a lot of that stuff before we started dating, so he's been paying extra attention to make sure that he doesn't push my boundaries or make me uncomfortable. We're moving slow for right now, but I've been enjoying myself so much, and I'm really happy about how things have gone so far. And he seems pretty happy too!  The only downside to all this is that my SO is still uncomfortable with our relationship. I guess he was okay with the idea of me dating other people in theory, but for two whole years it was just theory. Now that it's actually happening he's suddenly having a lot of issues with anxiety and a little jealousy about my new guy. SO has always felt a little inadequate and has expressed concerns in the past about how I haven't dated anyone besides him (we were high school sweethearts). He's afraid that since I have nothing else to compare it to my evaluation of him is good, but once I experience relationships with other people I won't think of him as highly. Logically, he knows that I love him and he can trust me and I wouldn't ever leave him, but he just can't shake this irrational fear of his that I'll replace him with someone else (despite being poly means I can have both). He's gradually started to feel a little better as he gets more and more used to me seeing someone else. But I feel like we still have a little ways to go before he's truly okay with it.  That said, since I can't talk to my SO about it and new guy and I haven't really told anyone we're dating yet, I just wanted to tell SOMEONE. I hope you all didn't mind reading, and good luck with your own relationships!  TL;DR - I just started dating someone new for the first time since being poly and I'm really excited but haven't had anyone to share it with.   Just going on what little detail you've provided, I can tell you that spamming someone's instagram with comments after they're being mean to you is not going to suddenly make them change their mind. If you're getting mixed signals, you probably won't get very far with this girl. And in the future, you should instead just simply send one text or message saying something like "I thought we were getting along, what happened?" rather than flooding their social media with unsolicited compliments.   Usually I'll do Paragon on my first playthrough and then go back and be an asshole to everyone on my second.    The people I know all either play WoW, League of Legends, or Titanfall, none of which I'm interested in. And I suck at online fps's, lol.  You basically just described my life and friends. xD   I hope so. And I'm just the type of person to take things slowly in general, so he will most likely have a while to get used to the idea before things get super serious.   I'm feeling pretty good right now. Last night I went out with a friend on our first date, and in fact my first date ever with someone besides my SO. We've been poly for a while and SO has dated others, and while I had some interest in dating other people too I never found someone I particularly wanted to date.  On Wednesday my friend made a facebook post that seemed a bit gloomy. I texted him to cheer him up and he mentioned that we should hang out more. Before I knew it, we'd planned dinner, a movie, and drinks for Friday night. The dinner (and conversation) was great, the movie was really enjoyable, and I got a little tipsy for the first time (never had more than two drinks before then). Throughout the whole thing he was really great about respecting boundaries, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. We held hands, and I kissed him on the cheek good night. We both agreed that there would definitely be future dates, and we'll be hanging out after work tomorrow. I can't wait!  The only problem is my SO is feeling some anxiety and jealousy right now. I think part of the problem is that he's always had issues with feeling inadequate, and also while I could have dated anyone in theory the situation has never actually come up before. I've had two years to get used to him seeing other people, but me seeing other people is still new to him. We've talked about it a lot though, and I'm trying my best to be mindful of his feelings as I explore my new relationship.   Rumpelstiltskin is the best character in the show, in my opinion at least.  I've picked up and dropped a lot of games online over the years, but the one I'm always meaning to play more of is Torchlight 2. If you haven't heard of it, Torchlight was made by a lot of people who worked on the Diablo franchise. In a nutshell, it's Diablo with awesome useful pets.  I started playing it with friends but eventually they all moved on to other games and I was a little sad playing it by myself, so I stopped. But if I had someone to play with I'd most likely pick it up again.   Well, Wonder Woman is usually drawn pretty fit too. But yeah, for the most part it's all soft lines and curves.   I actually have seen Once Upon a Time, but I stopped watching it after season 2 because I had too many TV shows to watch at the time and just never picked it back up again.  When you get it, let me know what you think!   I really don't think that calling people out when they do something problematic is divisive. I think it's necessary in order for change to occur. If we just let things slide, society will never improve. If I keep doing something wrong, but no one ever tells me it's wrong, how will I learn?  How about instead of just writing off someone as homophobic (which is not at all what I wanted), we label actions instead of people? For instance, rather than saying "don't listen to them, they're homophobic," instead whenever someone says something problematic you can say "that was a homophobic statement." Because like I said, unless someone points out to you that you made a mistake, you're likely to just keep repeating that same mistake. And by labeling the action, generally people take it better because they don't feel like they're being personally attacked.   Yeah I don't know what they're doing with Jon's plotline either, nor with Gilly's. I guess we'll just see.  If it helps, The Wolf Among Us isn't just riding the vampire/werewolf hype train, it's based on the comic series called Fables which started back in 2002. The story revolves around the idea that all the fairy tales we knew as kids were describing actual people in other worlds, but their worlds were invaded and taken over by a mysterious figure called the Adversary. So now Snow White, the Big Bad Wolf, Prince Charming, Beauty and the Beast, etc. now all live in New York City.  So really the main character, Bigby, isn't a werewolf so much as an actual, large mythical wolf who uses magic to hide as a human and blend in with regular people. I guess that makes him more of a were-human? Lol.  As for what I thought of it, so far the game is pretty good. The animation is stellar, and they manage to reincorporate the "force you to choose between two people" mechanic from The Walking Dead pretty well. And I was a huge fan of Fables, so seeing the comics in game format was pretty fun for me.   Anything that runs off of the Ren'py engine should be compatible with mac.   Not wanting to see one or think about one because you're not interested is fine, but I know a lot of gay guys who talk about how they think vaginas are disgusting. Do you realize how fucked up it is for someone to just sit there and comment on someone else's perfectly natural body parts as if they were some freak of nature or diseased corpse?    I disagree somewhat. I don't think words like "homophobic" should be reserved only for people who do really terrible things, because honestly lots of somewhat problematic things over and over can really add up and cause just as much harm as the bigger stuff. And when people have this idea that people who are racist are Nazis or KKK members, or people who are sexist are the guys that beat their wives, or people who are homophobic are the ones who disown their kids and leave them out on the street, there's this tendency for us to think, "well I'm not a bad person, so I can't be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc." But in reality anyone can be prejudiced, even if they're an otherwise good person.   Just because someone is old and religious doesn't mean that saying gay people kissing is gross doesn't make it any less homophobic, though. Nobody should get a free pass on bigotry just because you can't convince them to stop being assholes.   Well the point of the article wasn't if you find PDA offensive or uncomfortable, just that it's homophobic if you ONLY find gay couples (especially gay men) kissing to be disgusting *purely because they are gay.* Not liking PDA in general is not homophobia. No one claimed it was.   I really love Pod and Brienne, too! They have great chemistry together, and I bet they'll be good friends later on. And there are definitely some good changes the show has made. For instance, I liked how they redid Tyrion's wedding to make Joffrey into more of a complete sadistic creep. Because no one can be mad at them for making Joff more evil, lol.  OMG I love The Walking Dead!! You HAVE to finish it. The ending is so worth it! Also, if you liked that one you should also give The Wolf Among Us a try - it's less jump-scare prone.   FYI profiling is not nearly as glamorous (nor as easy) as the show makes it look. Becoming a profiler doesn't make you magically able to know everything about someone just by looking around a room they've been in. And it's not an exact science. But if you're interested in the subject, you should look at the FBI's website and search for books authored by former or current profilers.   That's probably the best use of that gif that I've seen on Reddit yet.   I've heard good things about Origins, never been though.  I totally understand why those scenes would be off-putting. Honestly the Dany/Drogo scene was a really terrible one. The show changes a lot of the romance scenes purely for shock value and ratings, which I hate so much. I basically just watch the show for Tyrion, Arya, and Brienne. I like the books a lot more, too.  I've been playing through quite a few VNs lately. Some of my favorites are Katawa Shoujo, Higurashi, and Dangan Ronpa. If you haven't played them, Katawa Shoujo is free, and Dangan Ronpa came out for PSP (and the sequel is on the Vita). Higurashi is a little harder to find, and is a bit expensive pretty much anywhere you do find it, unfortunately.   Yeah, my best advice would be to just treat LGBT couples like any of your other couples.   I'm from the southern US, they still say it in over half the ceremonies I've been to (which is a lot, since I have a large family).   First off, you need to realize that asexual does not mean "low sex drive/never wants sex." There are plenty of asexual people that have higher libidos and enjoy sex. A person is asexual if they do not experience sexual attraction, but over half of asexual people surveyed masturbate and plenty have sex with their partners. So there's no reason to think that your SO isn't asexual simply because of libido.  That aside, it seems like she is having some issues with her faith. It's hard to say more without more details, but it's possible she's just confused and trying to figure herself out. In that case, you should probably talk things over, maybe give her some space until she's more sure of herself.   I have gone to Ohayocon once, but I can't make that one of my regular cons unfortunately since I moved a little further away and that would now be a minimum of 3 hours of driving, assuming there is no traffic. For a long time my regular con has been Sugoicon, but I skipped last year after hearing about the attendee limit and the date coinciding with 3 other cons, once of which was closer to me anyway.  What sold me on the show was Sean Bean playing Ned Stark. I couldn't get over the Boromir feels induced by them basically casting him in the exact same role. And dying. Again. The one good thing I got from watching the show first was that I already knew who all the major characters were, so it was easier to keep track of people since I didn't have to learn a whole bunch of new names all at once.  If you do, you should definitely subscribe to /r/crochet and post pics of your projects! I would love to see them :)  It has kept me rather busy. I have to spend an extra year in undergrad to finish both degrees.  As far as how I became interested in those subjects, I have pretty much always had an interest in psychology. This was partly driven by the fact that many of my family members (as well as myself) have mental disorders, and partly because I like to know how things work and psychology is essentially the study of what makes people tick. I did a lot of reading on the subject in high school, and decided to major in psychology whenever I got to college.  Anthropology, on the other hand, wasn't something I planned on doing. I loved archaeology as a kid. I was fascinated with dinosaurs when I was really little, and loved studying ancient Egypt; in fourth and fifth grade I read Greek and Roman mythology for fun while the rest of my classmates were enchanted by Harry Potter. But after middle school I started getting into other things and mostly lost interest. Once I got to college, I took the two intro anthropology classes for general education requirements (cultural anthropology counted toward cultural diversity and biological anthropology fulfilled a science requirement). Then while going over my school schedule with a friend, I mentioned how interesting all the anthropology classes looked and it was a shame they wouldn't count for anything since I wasn't an anthropology major. My friend responded by saying, "well why don't you become an anthropology major?" And then I did.   Just a thought, but perhaps his tan is also meant to emphasize how Oberyn has done a lot of traveling to places where people have darker skin? I mean, if you go on a trip to someplace closer to the equator you're going to come back with a tan, and he did say he spent 5 years in Lys. It seemed logical that someone who's traveled to a lot of sunny places would be more tan.   I don't take him seriously anyway, frankly.   Speaking of hair dye, why haven't they dyed Sansa's hair?   When discussing this with my roommate, he commented that it was probably because they were giving screen time to Renly and Loras purely for ratings, not for character development. I think I agree with his assessment; lack of follow-through suggests those scenes were only there in the first place because "LOOK GAYS PAY ATTENTION CONTROVERSY."  I think this also goes along with how they changed scenes with Dany/Drogo and Jaime/Cersei by removing Dany and Cersei actually being pleasured by their partners and instead decided to make the scenes non-consensual and rapey. They just want to stir up controversy.   I need to reread that book ... I haven't touched it since middle school, waaaay too long ago.   I have! They are so much fun! I usually go to the Ohio Renaissance Festival. My friends and I used to go every year until I moved away for college, although I went again for the first time in a couple of years last summer and it was pretty awesome.  Oh god, I can't even imagine having to stop halfway through because of the Red Wedding. I watched the third season of the show and then read all the books while waiting for the first season so I already knew it was coming, but it was still heartbreaking to read. I did hear about the Red Wedding before watching the show, but similar to you I only vaguely knew it was probably a bad thing that happened. But I was in no way prepared for the bloodbath.   I wish I had the patience to learn  This is one of the most common things people tell me whenever I mention I know how. I got good at it by doing it in my free time while waiting in between classes or while in waiting rooms at the doctors or in the car, etc. Also, YouTube is super helpful if you forget how to do a stitch. As far as finishing craft projects, you can look for a book called One Skein Wonders - it has a bunch of super short projects that take maybe an afternoon or two to finish and don't need much yarn, so you can make an entire thing in relatively little time. Otherwise I don't really know of a way to help finish more projects as I have the same problem about not finishing things sometimes ;P  I'm double majoring in Psychology and Anthropology, with a minor in Asian Studies.   Cas is basically the best part of that entire plot arc.   That is one of my favorite quotes from Supernatural.   That sounds like a lot of fun! And yeah, copying something is really difficult. But if you mess up making your own thing, you can always just write it off as "I meant to do that."  You just finished A Clash of Kings? Awesome. How did you enjoy all the weddings? Lol  I do a lot of needlework, so I knit and crochet things like plushies, bags, some jewelry, and other accessories.   I used to read a lot more, although since I started college I've been doing a lot less reading for pleasure and a lot more reading textbooks and research articles. As far as what I have been reading, I just finished A Dance With Dragons, and I started this YA series called The Frost Chronicles just for fun. I also read manga sometimes, but haven't been doing much of that at all.  I, too, have a problem with finishing games. Especially if I get stuck. I have quit playing so many games because I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do but I'm too stubborn to look up a guide.  If you want to get into cosplay, I would suggest starting simple. There are plenty of options for found-item costumes, where you basically purchase pieces here and there to put together an outfit. It costs a bit more, but it's easier than trying to make an entire outfit from scratch. Once you start making outfits, it helps to know a bit of sewing, although I've also used knitting, crochet, and papercraft for some of my costumes. Additionally, sculpting skills come in handy, and some people even do leather or metalworking. But that all comes later. Just start small and work your way up. Most people are really nice and will give you plenty of good pointers to help you improve :  I've been trying to go to more cons lately, although the last couple of cons I went to I was selling stuff in Artist Alley so I didn't get a chance to look around much.   Cool! What kind of hobbies are you into?   Considering your brother is still rather young, I don't think it's impossible to change his mind. Try explaining it to him another way. Ask him how he would feel if someone told him that he couldn't be friends with or like other boys. Would that be reasonable? No. Who you like and become friends with has nothing to do with sex or gender. It is the same way with love. Romantic partners shouldn't be limited; people can fall in love with anyone they like and they shouldn't be made fun of or persecuted because of it.   While I definitely understand while your partner and meta are offended and upset about her not being invited, I think you're probably right in this situation. Your family shouldn't have to invite meta. It would be one thing if you were the point in this V and they invited one of your partners but not the other.  However, in this scenario, there are three degrees of separation between the marrying couple and meta. Inviting your sister to your wedding is standard. Inviting your sister's partner is to be expected. Inviting your sister's partner's date? That's a bit of a stretch, even if you are poly-friendly. If I were in the position your brother is in, I would be like "it's great you're in this relationship and all but I barely know this person and have no connection to them, and my future wife doesn't know them either, so why should we invite them to our wedding?" She might be important to you and your partner, but that doesn't mean she has to be important to any of the other people you know. And if they invited everyone they had such a tenuous relationship with, the guest list would soon be ridiculously long.  Honestly, I think your partner and meta should probably just let this one go. This event isn't about them, it's about the couple getting married, and who they want to celebrate with at their wedding. There are family members who I haven't been invited when they got married, but we still see each other at other family functions. I would be more offended if the family didn't want to invite her to Thanksgiving or a reunion or something. So focus having your family get to know meta better, and I'm sure they'll start inviting her to more things in the future as they get to know her and start to warm up more to your relationship.   It does feel really good to be able to laugh with someone.   I really love when my SO gives me a backrub. Not only is massage really close physical contact, it's also a good way to show someone you care for them and want to ensure their health and well being.   If it makes you feel any better, this treatment was considered relatively humane compared to techniques from a few decades earlier. For instance, filling people's skulls with ethanol, yanking out their teeth, or removing large portions of their intestines.  For more info about how terrifying psychological practices were at the turn of the 20th century, I recommend *Madhouse* by Andrew Scull.    I'm just glad that this time around they didn't turn a character who was socially incompetent/crazy/robot/alien/otherwise misanthropic into an asexual character - e.g., Sherlock, Sheldon Cooper, Yuki Nagato, The Doctor, etc.   Who you are or aren't attracted to has nothing to do with your genitalia. See: any queer person ever. Also, I'm pretty sure any fan of GoT would know that Varys is a eunuch, but thanks for stating the fucking obvious.   Eunuchs can still experience attraction. Just because you don't have a penis anymore doesn't mean you can't wish you did.   It doesn't, necessarily. There are plenty of aces who want to have kids. In fact, it's a pretty common topic over at /r/asexuality. I've seen plenty of people bemoaning how they feel that their sexuality makes it difficult to pursue relationships, marriage, and children.  Being asexual doesn't mean that you don't like sex, never want to have kids, or aren't interested in relationships. It just means that you aren't physically attracted to any sex or gender.  As for me personally, I really don't want to have biological children - not because I'm asexual, but rather because pregnancy is terrifying and I'd just rather not. I might adopt, though.   I'm pretty sure that I remember that line from the books. I'd have to read through it again and see the show in context though to give a solid opinion on it.  Edit: I watched it. The scene was pretty great. Can't believe that just happened.   Well first off, that guy can go to hell. Fuck him, you're a cop, it's your fucking job, not playtime.  But yeah, I get stuff like this all the time since I'm gender non-conforming and I was a huge tomboy as a kid.   Nope, sorry.   Hello, redditors!  I'm a college student who is really into video games, comics, anime, sci-fi, fantasy, cosplay, and all sorts of other nerdy goodness, and I'm looking for other people who share my interests. I'd like to have some internet pals that I can occasionally chat with and perhaps play games or roleplay online together.  FYI, I'm queer and don't tolerate nonsense, so if you aren't okay with that we probably won't make good friends.  Edit: I should also add that I really like visual novels. If you're into VNs hit me up!   Thanks for the input, I couldn't personally say as I've never been to the Belton location (my local chapter is near Indianapolis).   Well if you're looking for larps near you, I figured there would be plenty in San Antonio. /shrug/  Anyway, I'm currently playing Dystopia Rising (a great post-apocalypse larp) and the Texas location is in Belton, which should be a little over two hours away for you. I know the people from there are all pretty awesome, so if it sounds like your sort of thing you should check it out. They meet up one weekend a month.   Possibly linked to a UTI.   He specifically said "my wife did not poop *on our daughter*," the implication being that she might have pooped, it just didn't get on the baby.   I agree with the blogger in the link. While no one should be ashamed of their sexuality, straight people do not need a pride movement. Straight people don't have to deal with the same bullshit. When was the last time a straight person:  * Was told they were going to hell for being straight * Was told they were an abomination because of their sexuality * Was told that they were probably abused as a child because of their sexuality * Was told that they should get their hormones checked after mentioning they're straight * Was told that being straight is "just a phase" * Was told by family members that they are no longer welcome in their home/at family functions because they are straight * Faced harassment by random strangers for being straight * Was afraid of getting stopped by the cops because of their sexuality * Was fired from their job because they were straight * Was evicted from their home for being straight * Was not allowed to marry their opposite-sex partner simply because they were an opposite-sex couple * Was told that if they were sexually assaulted they would then have the "correct" sexuality * Was brutally attacked/killed because someone found out they were straight * Etc., etc.  I'm not saying that straight people should be ashamed of being straight or cisgender, because they shouldn't. But no one is telling straight, cis people that they shouldn't exist or don't have rights because of their sexuality or gender identity. The whole point of the pride movement is that people who are GRSM are fighting back against the incorrect notions that they are wrong, disgusting, or lesser. We are fighting back against all the people who say we aren't human or don't deserve to live freely as everyone else. Straight, cis people don't need a pride movement because telling you to stop being shitty to gay people is not the same thing as oppression.   I started playing Dangan Ronpa a few days ago. Right now I'm in the investigation of chapter 2. So far I like it.   When I was born, or maybe for my first birthday or baptism or something (it was really early on okay) one of my relatives bought me The Giving Tree. My mom would read it to me every night. She told me that at one point when I was around two or so, she went in to read me the story before bed like usual, but I stopped her and said "No, mommy, I'm going to read it to you." And then I went through the whole book, page for page, line for line, and "read" her the entire book, which I had completely memorized. I didn't actually know how to read, I just knew where all the words were. Ever since then I've always loved that book, and I also liked Shel Silverstein in general as a child (I got his other poem books later on).  The author I really liked as a kid was Dr. Seuss. After The Giving Tree, the next book I remember having read to me every night was Fox In Sox. My stepdad read that one to me. Every night he would first read through the whole book at a normal pace, and then again really fast - it was a lot of fun because the whole book was full of tongue twisters and he would inevitably mess up the lines, and I would laugh.  I miss those days sometimes ...   Welp, that is certainly a pickle. I can certainly understand that you don't want to cause any untoward harm toward either your husband or your new guy, but honestly there is no pretty way out of a situation like this. You can only do the best you can and hope that it all doesn't implode.  First, let's address the husband. It's great that you love him, but honestly it seems to me like you really love him in a more platonic than romantic way. This means your relationship would be inherently imbalanced; you don't have the same feelings for each other. Also, you don't seem to have the same boundaries for what is acceptable in the relationship - since you can see other people you pretty much have an open marriage, but you were in favor of this so that your husband could be happy while he is only allowing to see your beau out of guilt. If he's only letting you see someone else because he's already seen other people and can't reasonably say no without being a total hypocrite, that's an issue.  You feel like you're stuck and that you owe husband something, but honestly you've already put a lot of effort into this relationship. If after five years of marriage (plus however long you were together before then) isn't enough to make you feel like this relationship is worthwhile, I don't think anything will at this point. You really need to sit down and assess your feelings on the matter. If you still love him at all in a romantic way, then it's not unreasonable to want to keep trying. But if you feel like you're only in the relationship because you feel like you owe him, then this is not going to pan out. Staying in a marriage out of pity is unfair to both of you.  Now, on to the beau. It sounds like you've found everything in this guy that you wish you had with your husband. You love him, you're attracted to him, and things are going well. Some of this is probably to do with new relationship buzz, but I wouldn't be so quick to pass this guy up. If you've only been together a short while it would be rather daunting to ask him to wait around while you attempt to patch up your marriage. But if this guy knows you're having problems then maybe you should talk this over with him and see how he feels about it. It seems like you don't want to quit seeing this guy, and I don't blame you. So unless giving up this relationship is the only way you can save your marriage (which I really don't think it is, you have too many other issues) I wouldn't do it.  Long story short, you need to do what's right for you. It's nice that you're thinking about other people in this situation, but trust me, trying to worry about everyone else's feelings to the detriment of your own will get you nowhere. Don't worry about what your husband or your new guy need right now, worry about what you need right now, and decide where to go from there.   Yeah, dragons are pretty awesome! :D Thanks.   We went to Destination (they're more figurine heavy than comic heavy), and we also went to a newer one in the strip across from the St. Matthew's mall. It only opened a few months back, so if you haven't checked it out yet you should - it's pretty small but they had a decent selection. I think it's called The Zone.  My favorite is still Roll of the Die, though.   Derby traffic was interfering with Free Comic Book Day. 'Nuff said.   If you're worried about leading her on, you should probably confirm with her at some point that this isn't a date, you just wanted to hang out as friends. Otherwise, if she seems interested later on in dating, just tell her that you had fun but you're not really feeling a connection. You don't have to come out to her to tell her you're not interested.    I get really frustrated being the walking encyclopedia  I know that feel. It's definitely frustrating and exhausting being the only out person your friends know and constantly being interrogated about it.  I have no problem with people who are genderfluid, but I can definitely see where you would run into problems. There are tons of people who have no idea what that is or how it works, and it really doesn't help that the same "just pick one already" mentality that bi and ace people get is shoved onto you, too. For some reason people can't comprehend that gender and sexuality don't have to be rigid, sometimes they change, and just because you used to be one thing doesn't mean you're faking it or you went through/are going through a phase. Temporary change doesn't make it any less valid. So I hope you can stick it out, too, and keep being you despite what everyone else thinks.  To be honest, for a while now I've been contemplating my own gender identity. Although I'm female bodied I also usually feel more comfortable with more masculine clothes and whatnot. I don't have body dysphoria, though - the only time I really feel dysphoria is when I have to perform as hyper-feminine, like when I have to dress up for family gatherings (weddings, etc.) where I'm required to wear makeup or dresses. I hate wearing that stuff, because it feels like I'm wearing a costume, putting on a feminine persona, and it's not really me. I don't really care about pronouns or anything, I just usually go by female stuff because I have female parts and that's what's most convenient. So if asked I tell people I'm "gender non-conforming" because nothing else really seems to fit.   Thanks for the kind words and support.    I wonder if your frustration is amplified because it is juxtaposed against your recent upswing.  I think that it certainly is. Having to deal with ignorance is always frustrating, but it especially sucks whenever I hadn't had to deal with ignorant comments from people I know in a while. There have always been ignorant people on the internet, but at least I could say "well that's the internet, my IRL friends are all cool so it's good."  I still feel kind of crummy, but I'll be hanging out with friends this weekend and that usually makes me feel better since I can complain to them and they'll understand and back me up. Plus hanging out with them is fun, and I could use some fun.  The upside of all this is that despite how exhausting it can be to constantly have to educate people about my identity, it's times like this when I realize that asexual advocacy is certainly a place where I am needed and can make some real, positive change. Dealing with ignorance sucks, but every time I take the time to call someone out or answer their questions (which I've been doing a lot of lately), I'm also investing in the future. Because the more I work to amend ignorance now, the less me or others like me will have to deal with it later on down the road.   Can't say that I have, although I know what I'll do the next time I'm sleeping over at a friend's house and we're really fucking bored at stupid o' clock.   Once I made a post asking for some relationship advice on how to make my SO feel better about being shot down when asking other people out (we're poly). Some random dude then proceeded to tell me that because I'm asexual it's probably causing unnecessary strain on the relationship (despite the problem having nothing to do with my orientation) and I should either leave the man I've been with for five and a half years or let him rape me because MEN NEED SEX.   The worst kind of prudes - sex-obsessed prudes. Literally our country's conceptualization of sex is so fucked up and contradictory, it's amazing that we haven't created some sort of black hole of un-logic.   Hello, lovely people. I hope you all have been doing well. I haven't been doing so well lately for many reasons, and I just need to share and hopefully get some understanding, I hope you all won't mind.  After many many years of not saying much about my sexuality, I have recently been coming out to more and more people about the fact that I'm asexual. It came up in conversation with my mother after she sort of cornered me about it in the car, and that went well(?) for the most part. Also, I was at a large family gathering recently for my grandfather's (mom's dad) funeral, at which some of my relatives brought up a facebook post I made discussing my identity. They wanted to know more, but didn't have time to talk because funeral. But I think I'm okay on that front as well.  In addition to telling more of my family I also decided to do my final presentation in my communications class about asexuality; it was well received by my professors and classmates. Now if only I could work up the courage to actually post the talk online ...  So anyway, things were starting to look up for me as far as coming out goes. I have plenty of great friends who accept me and even some fellow ace buddies. And family seems confused but mostly alright with it. After so many positives, I thought I'd be able to handle coming out to people who are relative strangers.  I started going to my very first LARP (live action role play) event a while back, and joined the newly-formed facebook pride group made up of various LARP members from across the country. And things went downhill quickly. I have realized after several conversations on various posts that I don't quite fit in with these people. At first I thought it was great that I was meeting so many new queer and nerdy friends, but then people starting making posts talking about how labels don't matter (which, for most asexual people, they do - a lot). Or about how the A stands for Ally - or was it amoeba? Because humans can't be asexual.  Ugh.  I know there were at least two or three other asexual people who were a part of that group, but it honestly felt like I was the only one in those conversations who was well educated on asexual issues because the rest of them barely talked at all about it. Basically I had to single-handedly explain to some very ignorant people what my identity is and why it's not okay to call me a bacterium etc.  I hate that "safe" spaces for queer folks often end up being places where I am yet again dehumanized and erased and talked over, just like everywhere else. It's shit like this that makes me wish I never came out in the first place, because it is so fucking exhausting to have to explain to people over and over and over that I EXIST AND I HAVE FEELINGS. Is it really so much to ask that I be treated with the same human dignity as everyone else??  So yeah, after dealing with a lot of other stuff - funeral, family drama, university finals, no money - this last bit of awful just really tanked my mood and even several days later it's still bothering me. Thanks to anyone who's read so far, I hope you all are having a better time lately that I have.   As someone who is both queer and suffers from mental illness (including depression), I really don't like the comparison they're making. Activists have been fighting for decades to make sure that being gay, trans, ace, etc. is not seen as a pathological illness, and then this person comes along and says "saying you have depression is just like coming out as gay." No, no it is not. Those are two fundamentally different things. Yes, mental illness is stigmatized. However, the parallels here are tenuous at best. GSRM people are discriminated against because of an innate part of who they are that they cannot willfully change, but nor should they have to, because there's nothing wrong with being queer. There is, however, a real need to treat mental illness.  The stigma is unfortunate, but we have diagnoses for a reason - if you are mentally ill, you can find treatment which will hopefully help you achieve a better quality of life. That has a lot to do with what's going on with a person internally, though - in contrast to the issues that the LGBTQ community faces which are due to external pressures.   Because historically, this is where some of the most outspoken shitlords have always lived. That's the best explanation I can come up with, anyway. Don't worry, though - there's little pockets of sanity here and there.   Agreed, if they pick one it will probably be Koujaku. As long as it's not the "true" route I'll be fine with it.   Cool, I'm not the only one who took issue with it then.  Also I mostly played it for the feels, and the stellar art. Because everything else besides the plot was actually really well made. Honestly, I don't normally go for the super-slick guys but Koujaku was super adorable, and he ended up being my second-favorite even though I never thought it would end up like that.  Also, have you seen that they're releasing an anime for DMMd this summer? I wonder if it will be any good, and also how they'll address the multiple routes.   Yes, because Batman's never dealt with super strength opponents before ...   http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md34or3lH31rrzlrq.gif   Welp, I can no longer go to bed now because all I can think about is cockroaches crawling all over my face the moment I fall asleep.  http://replygif.net/i/1314.gif   Presumably the Starks would know what he looks like, since they have his image carved in stone somewhere in the catacombs. Of course, they also mentioned at some point in the books that most of them don't wander into the older levels often. But Bran has if I recall correctly, so maybe he would recognize him.   I'd be inclined to believe they can turn anything, considering they also have undead mounts and whatnot, plus if you recall not all of the Night's Watch men are from the North, and it's reasonable to assume some of those who turned where from other areas.   But Batman fights best at a mid-distance. Spiderman would have a higher advantage closer up, where he could put his super-strength into play (although it would diminish the impact of his precognition).   There's a difference, though, between sensing danger coming and being able to appropriately respond to that danger. There were plenty of times when Spidey's senses were tingling, but he didn't have time to appropriately react to it. It's not like he's a freaking oracle, he just gets a vague sense of "Oh shit!" right before it hits the fan.   Yeah, I'd say that a Spidey vs. Bats fight would probably go the same way a lot of Batman fights go - he loses initially, then goes off to the cave to regroup. There, he makes a new gadget and/or comes up with a new strategy, and in the next fight he creams them.  This is why Batman is ultimately better, at least imo. What makes him a fearsome opponent isn't that he wins all his fights all or even most of the time. What's terrifying about him is that he has such dogged tenacity. In fact, I'd argue that obsessive determination is Bruce Wayne's superpower.   Don't get me wrong, I love me some Spiderman - in fact, he was probably my favorite superhero for a significant portion of my childhood.  But nobody is better than Bats.   Also, people who were made tranquil because they were afraid of their own magic powers suddenly getting their magic back might result in a lot of spontaneous abomination type scenarios.   I dunno, it's hard to read this as satire of gender assumptions since the usual point of satire is to exaggerate or mock something in order to point out how ridiculous it is, and therefore cause people to rethink their assumptions. This doesn't seem to aim to get people to rethink the assumptions that men are horndogs who only want to get in your pants or that women are emotionally needy and will use sex to manipulate people into getting what they want. It seemed like it was very pointedly saying "this is what happens and I'm above all that," like you were saying about the "asexuals are better" trope (which I agree is super gross).   I don't particularly like the gender-based assumptions in this pic.   I think this largely depends on what kind of larp you're doing and the particular community you're with. Right now I'm larping at the Dystopia Rising location near Indianapolis, there's actually a lot of women in that group (which I didn't expect but I'm pretty happy about since I'm not in a tiny minority for once), and a good mix of POC as well. Not many black people specifically, but quite a few people of all sorts. Out of about 100 people, maybe 15-20% or so. There have been a few issues with casual racism that I've witnessed but not anything really horrible and not very frequently.  Can't say much about Maryland, I haven't spent a lot of time down that way but you'll never know until you try I suppose.   Sounds good to me!   You look fantastic! Also your makeup is way better than anything I could do lol      That's awesome! Black Panther does not get enough love.   I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that asexual/aromantic people are often totally fulfilled and happy having close platonic relationships. Often times people will assume that asexuals are unhappy because they can't have relationships (which isn't true - we can). That, or we're described as robotic or somehow less than human because sexuality is a "natural" part of the human experience (which of course implies that asexuality is somehow "unnatural").  As long as you can show your character being happy with herself and her friendships, you're well on your way to writing a good asexual character. Really, just write a good character first and foremost, and think about asexuality as a secondary concern. Because ultimately we're all people.  However, if you wanted to have some sort of plotline about experiences that are specific to asexual people, you should read through some posts here and asexual blogs talking about microagressions and oppression and whatnot, it will give you a good idea of what we sometimes have to deal with.  Edit: Oh, by the way, I'd also like to read your story when you're done! And if you need anyone to proofread for you I'd be happy to help - I have a lot of experience with that sort of thing.  	106
 I understand the fact that it's limited edition. That's not my problem with it. My problem's the fact that the pre-orders sold out in 2 hours in a time when the majority of people are working/in school. And when the majority of them aren't even doing it for the figure, that's what bugs me.  As an older brother, it's freaking difficult with my brother and I trying to collect. Marth was sold out Day 1 for me, and I can't find a Captain Falcon anywhere. Luckily, I got my brother his two most wanted, Villager and Little Mac, before they became rare.    "Instead of re-releasing them with the sculpts we already own, let's make new sculpts that defeat the exact purpose of why people wanted the originals, and gives an even wider range of products people now need to buy them!   Because the only reason you're buying these is for the chip inside, right?"   In the end, for me, it doesn't matter to me, but apparently it does to others. I don't care what box art they have, I just want the figure.    Can we please organize an angry mob with pitchforks and torches?   I'm not saying this is THE cause of the shortage, but he's certainly a small chunk of it. He's doing it solely to screw over people. No other reason. Not because he's a "collector", no collector needs that many of one kind. 100 Rosalinas? Seriously?   People like this really need to get over childish hissy fits. He's complaining that Mario isn't from Brooklyn anymore... from Mario Bros. in 1983.   Half troll, half scalper... what has this world come to.    Hooray for not being able to go.    54952, Pit  Falcon.   ***sliver of hope intensifies***   Have you ever played Super Contra, and also, does your mom have a dick?   No, seriously, my question is if we'll ever see any more Malkovich material in the future. It's among one of my favorite segments from the older episodes, and I hope it appears at least one more time.   -test_subject6948, all the way from sunny Wisconsin   PM me please. I'd like to see what you have to offer.    First off, let me just say I'm a sophomore in high school, and not exactly the most persuasive person on the planet.   I've been on the hunt for amiibos for quite a while, namely a few of the more rare ones (Marth, WFT, Falcon, Pit). I was lucky enough to get Villager and Mac a while back, but otherwise I'm out of luck. I've been calling store after store, and I've noticed that some people are a bit... shady. For instance, one of the Wal-Marts told me that they had nothing but Mario and Pikachu. When I asked if there was by any chance a few amiibos in back, he gave a long pause and then said that what they had out was all they had in-store, and that I'd have better luck looking elsewhere, then hung up.   While a majority of employees are cool (One Target employee directed me to a store where he'd seen a few Falcons, but they had sold out by then), it's a bit more difficult to approach the shadier ones and call them out. Considering I'm also unable to drive and have very limited access to ordering online (can't import or go over base price, heck I was only able to pre-order 2 amiibos for the next wave), how should I handle trying to search for the ones I'm missing?    Honestly, I'm thinking of just making a bunch of amiibo concepts and putting them in an album, and then post it here afterwards.    I would've done that, but it would've meant editing the model again, and frankly, I was too tired for that.    I suppose I could try making one for you.    He said "retard" in it, and some people were bringing it up because of that whole Twitter controversy, so Jon must've unlisted it in order to shut 'em up.   A shame, it's one of my favorite JonTron videos. "6 Golden Bananas plus out of Shigeru Miyamoto."   Hey, by any chance do you have the template you used for the plastic packaging? I want to make my own, and I can handle the figure and the back card, but the packaging itself is difficult to draw.       	15
 I work in HR (maybe it's because of my job nature but I am really enjoying reading everyone's responses here, so felt like I had to jump in to say something)  The good: when my staff are happy, are committed to the job and perform well, especially those that I've personally recruited. It's immensely satisfying! I brought in one staff who had a splotchy resume filled with career gaps, earning quite low for his age   qualifications...but we gave him a chance and now he's excelling in his job, has a bright future with the company and progression in his career to look forward to.   The bad: when my staff aren't happy in their jobs, for whatever reason. Cliched, but true. Mostly, the reasons people are unhappy are beyond the HR function's capacity, but some staff seem to think that HR should be able to magically solve all their issues for them....quite often it's due to horrible bosses and I secretly think many of the management level staff in my company are incompetent.  	1

 brb, brushing my teeth   Personally, I dislike cowls and two tone paint and chrome wheels, but it's a 66 and isn't the worst thing I see.  We all have our different tastes and in the end, we all like cars, so. As long as you enjoy it and like it, thats all that matters.   Damn, we just went through Cali too. Went to CC and the saleen show.   Your friend is me. lol   Arizona? Are you part of DSAZ?   no gtx 980, 0/10  but seriously, nice. :)   Always get breakfast because they have to make it right then and it's always hot. The other stuff can sit in a heated tray for 30-45 minutes depending on what it is, you never want 40 minute old popcorn chicken. It's just hard and blah.   Yeah, we just put on tight gloves so they don't fall off. It's close!   Yeah we should have blue band aids, since that's what I was thought, but I don't get them, I just wear the ones we've got and put a glove on. Better then nothing.   We're not that awesome with our bandaids, we just get any bandaid that will stand out, so sometimes we have hello kitty, other times we have super heros.  I go for the kitty though.   I work at Sonic and we're not allowed to use those bandaids since they blend in. That's fucking gross though, and the lady who refunded you should be fired. Shit wouldn't last where I am.   Don't play online then. Or play a closed game. Easy.   Miles are high, but it looks good. Headlights are iffy, looks like he home did it.

Super sad.   Damn man, that's rough. I hope you're doing/feeling better. One day, you'll get her again.   489   faceit needs to not pair me up with Global Elites..   Nice man, cleaner than mine!

 History says this poster is a male.    Let's see some red marks on one of those cheeks.    Lovely, really like the outfit.  Now just needs spanked for being so naughty.    Awesome as always.    Depends how long she was a friend, or if you liked her as a friend before things went downhill.  Not to say she was right, but depressed people can emotionally manipulate even if they aren't intending it.  I know I used to focus on one person or two and think they were the solution to my sadness, if only they would.........insert whatever  Im the same with conversations, even with my depression improved some...  And honestly people get kind of scared to say anything to you that might be offensive, so they don't want to talk to you fearing you'll go out and off yourself or spiral.   It's not your fault, but being a person who tends to get depressed myself.  I don't think I could take too much of another depressed person with the circular logic stuff....I do it myself ALLLLLLLLLLLL the time and it annoys me.  So I can only imagine what other people think when I try to explain it and why Im stuck.  And I've had people who I thought were avoiding me......or had cut me out.  Decide if they are worth the effort, if not, then count them as an acquaintance instead of a friend.  Be nice, but don't invest in them until they invest in you again.  That means inviting them to things, trying to make plans with them, etc.  You can contact her and tell her you've worked on it and are sorry for what you said, but let her make the first move in meeting or talking since she withdrew.  I figure that's mature enough...I struggle with letting go and blaming myself for issues.  So just realize shit happens and might happen again.  And realize that me saying that doesn't make it easy to deal with as easy as it is to say.    Sparklers, individual wrapped cheese, some kind of child's toy which will depend on where you are probably.  And if you use those things already, I'd like to hear the story.   When I graduated, they had a review of their program.  I spoke with the Dean if I remember correctly.  He changed my review while we were sitting there to increase the score after speaking with me and determining he thought the score should be higher.  Same school that I reported a group of people cheating during a test and nothing happened (they were foreign grad students), but they were bringing the hammer down on the local under-grad students for getting help on projects.  I dont even think they realize how worthless that makes their school when those stories start getting out.    Well whatever it ends up being, the supergirl one is probably my favorite.  Thanks for posting!   Went through some of your photos.  Maybe it's just me, but I think all of your blonde hair cosplay ones look "right" on you versus any other hair color.  I dont know if it's the color or the wig/whatever...or your coloring.  The exception being one where you had black hair and face paint, that one looked fine.  So Im inclined to say coloring.  Can't put my finger on it though.    You look to be at a healthy weight to me.  I am really not seeing the bloat/heaviness you mention.  And your previous post, that was quite an amazing change.  Yay for boobs.    Some of the anti-depressants supposedly will increase the damage alchohol does to your liver...like so much so that they put a warning on the label about it.  Cymbalta is one.  Plus alcohol makes you depressed.  And yes I can understand the pressure to drink, but you also have to consider that if drinking is the only thing that makes you worthwhile to them then there's an underlying issue there.    At this point in time, with how much they check to see that you've registered despite the chance of a draft being called being slim.  They might as well make it universal or do away with it, because it's just a cost and a burden.  Not to mention you're not eligible for employment and other things as a man if you're not signed up.....which I think is fucked.  Think about all those forms where you have to check that you did register for the draft and if you havent you can do it by........  If it's not being used but to also register you for voting (and jury duty selection to boot), then I don't see the point of just doing away with it or making everyone do it (along with registering to vote and jury duty selection chance).     Really like this picture.   F4M = female looking for male, post indicates it should be M4F or M4M.    *jaw drop*   I've had it for years IMO.  But it just got progressively worse until it was literally crippling.    I believe have some sort of major physical trauma would be easier to deal with than depression.  Because people can understand physical. Mental, people think you're just weak or should snap out of it.....or "don't be like that".  And some of the people saying that shit to you are depressed themselves, but not bad enough quite yet.    Thanks for posting, you seem like a very happy person and I have enjoyed seeing your smile.  Hate to see you go.   Thanks for posting,    Yes, nice display there.  And saw your collar/leash post in your history.  Rawr.   If only cloning existed....    I would suggest going with no intention of bidding on anything just to see the people and how it's done.  A lot of these places will waste your time by cherry picking out the stuff they want and selling the junk or having "plants" in the crowd to drive up the price some.    When they cherry pick, they take out the items they know are worth more to certain crowds and then sell them through their auction company at another venue.    Locks will be removed, things will obviously have been disturbed with a lack of dust and what not before you ever see what's in there.  Haven't found one around here where what is happening seems like an honest auction.    It'll catch up to them eventually when their storage places get tired of hiring them for low turnouts.    Yeah, Im attempting to work on stuff some, but......shit just keeps on rolling in.  Pretty words and hopeful attitudes don't fix some things.    Sounds easy.  But it's not really something Im comfortable even attempting anymore TBH.  Might be the way the game is designed, but holy shit does all that false bravado and pretending and trying to carry conversations just get tiring.  Being the "I don't have anything better to do right now than talk to this person" guy.  Or the teehee, I need help with this and you're super interesting until I get what I need from you gambit some women play.  I personally don't see how some guys don't become bitter.  I don't rage-aholic asshole guy because of it like I see a lot of posts on reddit with the name-calling and shaming, but I can kind of understand the mentality behind it.  Since I'm way less tolerant of bullshit than I used to be, and it's definitely had a negative impact on my general outlook on life and the future.  And very few people want to be around a depressed/whatever person, so it only compounds IMO.  Shrug.  Guess I should just go ahead and say it.  After awhile suicide starts to seem like a pretty valid solution to the eternally-looking single life if you never get anywhere.    	23
 A) I'm pretty sure it's a continuation, and B) why was it removed? It was a good story.   I just went to my GP   .......The fuck?   I don't have the books in front of me right now, so I could be remembering wrong, but isn't it stated somewhere that McGonagall told all the teachers about Hermione's time turner? If so, Lupin could've seen both, and just realised what was really happening.    I just want to know, why did the turtle have to die?   He sounds like a good man. Music is one of the most important things to hold onto. I wish you the best.    I'm sorry for your loss. What was your father like?    I would see myself living with my girlfriend, having become my wife, pregnant with our child. We live somewhere far away from here, whether it's Portland (we've both expressed great interest in living there) or abroad. Only seeing our somewhat messed up families on the big holidays. Surrounded by friends close enough to consider them family.   Money and status mean incredibly close to nothing to me. Those things buy comfort, not happiness. So the house we live in would be big enough to support the family, but it wouldn't be overly extravagant.    So i actually figured it out.... but i know someone on here would've greed, for which i am grateful.....   So i have no idea how to create a post on my reddit to go app.... i made this post on chrome, btw... can someone please tell me how to create a post on my app?  	10
 P.s. This is amazing!    That last stitch had to feel soooo good.       I was making pizza at home and realized I put the pepperonis below the cheese, but typically when you order takeout, they are on top. Is there a difference? I feel like this could be a top feed/bottom feed toilet paper sort of argument.    White female, communication studies. What I consider "average" when it comes to unique identifying factors for scholarships.    Communication studies. I want to be a professor. What kinds of companies offer scholarships? Do they typically come with a contract to work for them during/after your degree?    I am a TA for my assistantship and I am teaching my own section of a basic communication studies course for the upcoming year. It is fun I have learned more than I ever thought possible, but it just doesn't quite pay the bills.   	7
 That's why I was asking if they are a good alternative to things like amphetamines, which do help, but have a strong chance for addiction. I was asking for help, not a shitty analoge. But thanks.   First off, you only got 1 down vote and being whiny it will not help. Second,you are in a VERY biased subreddit, all idelaogical subreddits are, what did you expect?   This law was added in 1998...  	3
 Lol, I love you too.   But it doesn't have to be. I respect if you feel like you're fine with the way things are, I just think there's a way to bring your 5 in tune with everyone else's. But that's all I'll say about it. Just know, if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm available.    Yeah, it's very different with the different cultures and how they look on mental illness.   Ok, I've dealt with a lot of these comments and remained civil about it, but seriously Fuck You. You think I haven't tried other means? I've exercised, done various forms of meditation, tried to force myself out of it. You've faced loss? So have I. You think I can't think of anything good? Mother fucker I've had plays performed across the country, I have more creativity in my left ring finger than you have in your whole body. If you were able to work through your shit together good for you, but how dare you come down on someone who needs more help than that. Shame on you.    Thanks, I appreciate that.   Not a problem. Keep me updated and let me know if you ever need somebody to talk to.   Absolutely, the pharmaceutical industry is out to get to you. Now go back to watching loose change and let the grown ups talk   Sleep paralysis. None of the other stuff.   Psychiatrist, insurance covers it, he's been practicing for almost twenty years.   Try reading the thread first next time, and nothing about the original post was misleading, that was the diagnosis as presented to me from my psychiatrist.   It's funny aint it? And I don't feel like i've been woe is me take pitty at all today, I just wanted to talk to some people and maybe my experiences can help them even just a little, which i think/hope I've done.   Dude, we had this conversation almost 24 hours ago, check the post. My diagnosis is  Dysthymia with a secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder. This developed from my original diagnosis of Atypically presenting Depression. I consider it one diagnosis, people argued with me, I am agreeing to disagree on this. So no I've lived with this for around 15 years so I understand it quite well thanks.   I was on lexapro, now on prozac.   It's a persistant state, emotional peaks tend to come with bi polar disorder. I'm in therapy and taking meds to combat at the moment.   Really sorry to hear that man, but just remember suicide is not the way to go ever. Keep an open dialogue with people, we want to listen and help you out.   They may but as we've established double depression is new but very real.   HEY EVERYBODY, NOT EVERYTHING THIS GUY SAYS FITS THE EXACT DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF WHAT I WAS TAUGHT SO HE'S A PHONY. Really dude? I'm trying to share my experiences and I think maybe I've helped some people. Fuck off.   Very well putt   It's like six degrees of kevin bacon but less sad   That's their opinion. It's pointless to argue with people who won't update their understanding to the modern world. I look at people who take that view on mental illness as the Westboro Church of the medical community. They're just silly and can't be argued with so it's best to ignore them.    Sometimes all it takes is the one person   Thanks, love you too.   Yeah, wasnt crazy about it. Thanks for your thoughts!   I certainly had never heard of it before my last session.   If I understand correctly yes   No, because I'm not suicidal and my doctor as well aware of my previous condition. I wasn't diagnosed with a major disorder, I was diagnosed with an atypically presenting disorder.   Thanks, and it does. I'm looking into meditation exercises that might work for me.   Mildly?   Thanks!   Oh no no, didn't mean it like that, there a shit ton of comments, was just giving a heads up that i was doing copy pasta for that answer. No worries, sorry if i offended.   Repost from earlier. i was originally diagnosed with Atypically presenting depression   That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.   Excellent point, but I will be researching multiple methods to see if anything fits with me.   It's a very tauist way of looking at things, I can definitely see how that could help some people. I personally feel that if the problem is chemical than focus alone won't help, but again, the brain is crazy strange and powerful so I can see how it may work for some people. That's one of the reasons I'm exploring meditation.   I hope not, I'm hoping to be able to ween off them after a few years, but everyone is different so i dont know.   If that's how you choose to view it, then that's you're choice, I just know what my results have been.   I spent a third of the thread saying Meds arent for everyone and find what works for you. I'm done with your bullshit troll   And we're pulling for you. Glad I could help and let me know if I can do anything else.    The thing is I'm slowly learning there's a lot more to live for and it's not just the fear that stops me anymore. You have a lot to live for and people love you, if you ever feel like taking action, talk to someone.   The first treatment actually made me a lot better, but I eventually leveled out and stopped getting better before I was fully 'normal'. I had to stop seeing that counselor for money reasons and didnt want to keep taking pills if i wasnt seeing the person who perscribed them regularly so i weened myself off of them.   You too, I hope the government sponsored aliens don't invade your headspace to take you back on the zany ride.   Any time. Bookmark this convo if you can and let me know how it goes. And if you ever need someone to talk, I'm always happy to listen   It's apparently fairly new terminology.   The joke you're looking for is surplus, and no, but it goes into remission.  	43
 Kaichou wa Maid-sama is another one of my favourites!  Haven't seen Golden Time though, might watch it then! :)   [Shinsekai Yori](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/from-the-new-world)   nbsp;   [Kyoukai no Kanata](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/beyond-the-boundary)   nbsp;   [Barakamon](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/barakamon)    nbsp;   [Zankyou no Terror](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/zankyou-no-terror)   nbsp;   These are all great and in my top ten, so I highly recommend them!   I absolutely loved Chihayafuru (and the second season)! Japanese culture really interests me and I love anime they showcase different aspects of the culture, like Chihayafuru does with karuta. More than anything though I just love the characters and how much they love karuta and dedicate themselves to it! Makes me wish I played too :3   I was the same, although in saying that I don't usually cry when watching anime or movies or whatever. YLIA definitely hit me right in the feels though!   	4
 Thank you so much for your reply. I really recommend that you do write her something. And even if you never get the courage to send it, keep it and look at it every now and then until you do :)  And yeah about the whole therapist thing, I told mine before I left for winter break that I wish I could have those really good daughter-mother relationships that a lot of my friends have, and she told me that I didn't have to have one person with all the qualities a good mother would have, it might be enough if I have several people with one or two of those good qualities. That's something that has really helped me be less sad about not having a good relationship with her.   Thank you! And yes, she does have a really twisted sense of Christianity like that. I know she's going around twisting the story and what I wrote her, but I know she's also probably panicking on the inside about what I might be telling people.    I love this!!    I hated this so much about my Nmom. She would do the same thing, except she would interrupt me while i was *answering a question she asked me.* And then could not see how incredibly rude she was being.   These things will never cease to amaze me.   [The original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qd73m/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/)    It's pretty short, for those who don't like to read a lot of text all at once.  Anyway, I just sent this message to my mother last night, for some stupid reason. I know it won't make a difference, but it made me feel better that I got some of that out directly to her. It reads:  "Hey, thanks for unfriending me on Facebook. Now i don't have do it myself. Just wanted to say a couple things in case i don't talk to you or see you ever again. I thought you should know your daughter is part of the LGBT community (pansexual to be exact), a multiple-event rape survivor, and a severely depressed and suicidal member of society. So excuse me for having a problem with religion and the way you decide to be a "Christian". And excuse me for wanting to get away from your psychotic, violent episodes.I'm not sure what your problem has always been with me but you sure as hell made it so i couldn't trust you enough to talk to you about what was really going on in my life and why i am so angry. There are so many things i can say about how your actions over the years have really really messed me up. But it'll be lost on you. I hope you feel really guilty about abusing someone emotionally and physically who did nothing to stop you. And I hope you feel really guilty about acting as crazy as grandma and papa. I know you know what you did was wrong, and i know you'll never admit it. I hope you realize that you've ruined any sort of relationship we could have had. Good luck living with that. You burned your side of the bridge and now I'm burning mine. Im incredibly sad about the loss of my siblings, and that they had to witness what they did, on Christmas of all days. I have to protect myself, however, if i even want to live to see them grow up. I hope you feel terrible that your last words to me included "get this evil witch out of my house." I don't know what kind of mother says that to her child about a stupid argument, but it's no mother of mine. Have a good life, [mother's first name]."  I wanted to write this to her so that she could realize HER actions have consequences, and that she's doing the opposite of making things hard for me. She's made my life a whole hell of a lot easier by cutting off contact and kicking me out of the house. I also used her first name because to her, that's one of the most disrespectful things you can do to a parent. Also, she would always complain about how she had a terrible childhood at the hands of my grandma and grandpa, and that what she did to me didn't compare (which, we all know is not a valid excuse to treat me the way she did my whole life), even though it really does compare.  It just felt really good to do. My heart was pounding the whole time. I kept imagining all of the terrible things she would say back, but I realized she doesn't have any power over me if I don't let her.  It was seen at 9:09 this morning, by the way. She hasn't responded. Maybe that means she's thinking. Maybe that means she's concocting a particularly nasty retort. I don't really care, all I know is that I've gotten what I needed to off my chest and the irrational guilt I have carried my whole life  has been transferred from me to her. Whether she realizes it or not.   My boyfriend's family is giving me a place to stay. They're wonderful and absolutely amazing. I feel bad for all the kids in my situation who aren't as lucky as I am :/   She told me I was ruining her holiday. She called me an evil witch. She told me that she rebukes me and rejects my worldly, evil ways. She hit me and punched me and is standing outside my door screaming at me to get out over and over as I pack. She told me I was dead to her. And you know what, Reddit?  This is possibly the best Christmas present I have ever received. She's finally out of my life forever. Going to be needing a lot of internet-hugs today, all. Love you guys.  EDIT: Thank you guys! I ended up moving in with my boyfriend's family until I go back to school at the end of January. We had a very lovely time at his family christmas. They always make me feel so welcome. I'm really thankful for all the helpful and supportive comments, it means a lot! Merry Christmas!   Why do you ask?  Edit: I'm an idiot. Yeah, it is. But he's my step-dad. He's sired the two youngest. Gross. I never want to think about that again   Yeah and they could go tell lies about each other to the animals living on it lol   Thank you for taking the time to respond like this. I don't want to be sad and angry every year but it's hard not to think of it and mourn for the mother and the life I wish I had. I'm also severely depressed, so the sad and angry parts go back to my "rut" thinking.   I am extremely appreciative for my bf. I don't think he will ever realize what that small gesture meant to me. If he hadn't everything would have been shit. It's extremely symbolic of the role he plays in the rest of my life, as well.    She is. I have LC with her. She seems to be coming around, the tiniest bit. This incident was summer of 2013. Like I said, she's not as bad as some Nmoms. She still digs into me but the LC is helping a little bit. I am extremely anxious to go home for winter break, because I don't want things to go to shit like they had last winter and this past summer. My bf's mom has already offered to let me stay at their house as soon as things get bad.   She has a bad background as well and while I understand that, I don't accept it as an excuse for her behavior. She's treated me badly and I've not treated people like she has. All I can do is hope that she can behave herself for a month or so.    I have lots of stories about my mom that I could tell you guys, but this was one that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Now, my mother doesn't exhibit all N behaviors, but many of them. The most prevalent of them is conditional "unconditional" love, as well as treating me as property.  To give a little bit of background, I grew up in a poor family. My mother is the only income for five kids. When I went off to college, I knew I would be paying for it all on my own, so I did, obviously not expecting any help.  In our family, my mother, my two sisters, my little brother, my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's mom ALL have birthdays within three weeks of Christmas. To any normal person, it would be understandable that, come Christmas time, I wouldn't have a lot of money for presents, right? I made cards for everyone, wished everyone happy birthdays and hugged them and told them I loved them.   For my parents' anniversary in May, I couldn't afford to give them anything but a card and tell them Happy Anniversary and offer to babysit so they could go on a date.  For both of these events, my mother huffed and puffed and made a big deal about how I didnt appreciate her on her most special days and starting screaming at me about how she would ALWAYS make sure that us kids had presents on Christmas and our birthdays and on any other special days. I just took the abuse, but how can you expect an extremely poor, extremely depressed college kid with no time for a job and no car to afford 300 dollars worth of gifts?  So, come my birthday in August, I wake up in the morning, excited about my special day. Usually my dad and siblings will decorate the dining room and there will be presents on the table. I woke up, and there was nothing. That was fine with me, I could deal with it if my mom was angry with me. I didn't know it would actually be worse than that.   She sat me down and told me there would be no presents for me that day. She told everyone to avoid looking at me, no one was allowed to wish me happy birthday, i wasnt allowed to see my friends (the few I had), I had to stay home and clean and babysit while my mom went out to do whatever it is she wanted to do. She told me it was because I didn't care enough about everyone else and that I didn't do enough to appreciate them, even though I had always wrote or made cards since i was little, and though all through high school I helped my mom out with money and childcare and sacrificed my social life (which I didn't have because she never let me go anywhere or see anyone) for whatever it was that she "needed" me to do.  I was crushed, obviously. I didn't care so much about the fact that I wasn't getting any presents, but the fact that she actually wanted to hurt me so badly that she called all of my relatives telling them not to call me on my birthday, or send presents, and told my immediate family that they were allowed to treat me like shit on my birthday.  It was also hard to  realize that I actually was a scapegoat and I wasn't just imagining it. I have a brother who is only two years my junior and she expected none of these things from him. It was humiliating and degrading.  I cried all day that day. I did exactly as she told me to. My Edad was cold and cruel to me, and wouldn't let me sit down to cry even for a minute, and threatened to call my mother if I didn't get up. I watched the kids while he napped and watched tv. My boyfriend, a knight in shining armor if I've ever seen one, came over anyway and gave me a dozen roses. I didn't let him come in the house, and let him stay for only ten minutes for fear that he would become the next target of my mother's craziness later on.  I will think about this and be sad and angry EVERY YEAR on my birthday because of this. I will think of the time I felt worthless and ignored and helpless. And every present or praise I receive from her will never feel like love and will always tell me that I only got those things from her because I have sated her selfish appetite.  It completely ruined any trust I was trying to have with her. I now see that "love" is a transaction for her and I am very hesitant to accept any help or gifts from her, because I know it comes with leverage for bargain and manipulation. It's spilled into all of my other relationships with people too. I cannot accept help, even when I need it, and am very suspicious of those who make offers with no strings attached. I will always resent her for that.        Its actually not the best quality of metal. I ordered it pretty cheap on Amazon because I just wanted a little variety. The metal is pretty bad to tell the truth but it looks so nice. As long as I only wear it for a day or two it doesnt irritate me or turn my nose green but I wouldn't risk wearing it for longer than that at a time. Bad, I know. But I was desperate haha.    Thank you!   Haha do it! It would look great on you!            Exactly :)   I only drink like once a week, but the people I hang out like to make fun of the fact that I'm a lightweight and that one drink too many can put me way over. I don't puke or run off or turn into an asshole, it's just really apparent that I'm drunk when I am.      What color did you use? Look gorg!   Where did you order these? They look cute on you!   Wow! What color is this?   You look like Ariana Grande!   Where did you get that jewelry from?   Its hard to get a good picture and the turquoise is actually much darker than this. I can't get one myself because the tattoo ends up looking distorted   Yeah, I wasn't referring to the style. The style is geometric. It reminds me of a tribal drawing so that's what I called it  	29
    Yeah I realised that after. I always try to give someone a chance cause I realise that it's hard at first! I'm the same, though I will never write just Hi, it is hard.   Yep I know I saw it after I posted to imgur but couldn't be bothered to change it.     	4

    I want an AR Pokemon Snap for the 3DS. It could be so cool!   *cries*   I didn't think about making backups! Awesome.   I am not a good enough person to loan out my Pokemon games lol. But I do like the idea of a game card for it.   Ooh the PokeBank looks cool! I'm definitely going to have to check that out! Thank you for such an indepth answer :)   I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/  I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.  Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]  Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?  Thanks y'all!   I spent less than half that on two degrees. I suggest you find a less expensive college or get some scholarships.   Girls like that go to football games too. No really, I LOVE having your shrieks permanently damage my hearing. I'm sorry you feel threatened by the fact that my big muscly boyfriend is wearing the other team's shirt.   Those are tiny! :O   Why thank you. :)  Yes the garland is NC, it is from the first festival of neggs iirc.  Soo cute! I love how they are hiding in the flowers. :D   Aww thanks! :3   Aww congrats! :)   Yeah that does sound complimentary. The difference for me was that my minor was required to graduate and therefore took no additional time since I worked on it at the same time as my major classes.   Thank you :3   Well, my minor was very complimentary to my major and has resulted in making me stand out in the job market because of that additional skillset.   Thanks! She is wearing the Dark Faerie Eye Shadow. It was a random prize during the Faerie Quest event recently.   I feel like your Draik would make an awesome meal from the fruits of her garden. :)   Aww he looks so dapper! :)      I had one that I bought in the US and it had Japanese characters too so IDK if that means much.   My period always makes me ravenous.    Yes! That describes my booty exactly lol. Do iiiiiiit!   I think it has been breaking my flash in Google Chrome (I'm on a PC).   Jadzia is my favorite Dax. 3   [It's this doll](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3331/5733577662_229f3a6ddd.jpg)  John Smith from Pocahontas   OK now I feel old. *cries*  Love those games...   I broke my tailbone when I was younger, and it healed at a bit of a different angle. That combined with the fact that there is not much junk in my trunk means that when I sit on my boyfriend's lap wrong, he is jabbed by my coccyx.   He calls it my ass dagger.   I would play this. It would probably be the straw that finally made me break down and buy a 3DS.   That's pretty low. :/ It's not up to him what you look like, only up to you!  I'd suggest getting single serving stuff or focusing more on veggies and things he can't sneak sugar into. Also, the best diet tip is drink nothing but water so it would be pretty hard for him to sabotage that. :)   Had to google fupa... kinda wish I didn't. ;_;   I would just ASPLODE if I got to meet Anna and Elsa at Akershus! 3 We have dinner reservations in May so PLEASEEEEE Disney!   Sure go ahead.   Do y'all do anything with Star Trek Online as an RP vehicle? My fleet RPs with the in game chat, but it's kinda flaky so my boyfriend and I have been exploring other options.   No, not at all. Good luck OP. :) (and yes he is amazing!)   I've been attacked by someone I trusted. The only person I have told (until now I suppose!) is my future husband, because I wanted to make sure he didn't feel hurt if I had to pull away during intimate moments that became overwhelming. I told him I had something important to tell him. I cried. He held me. I felt better.   My ideas are checking your paystubs with your employer or looking at all the deposits into your bank account. I do not know if this will work for your particular situation, but it is where I would start if it was me. Good luck OP that sounds really scary. ;_;   So does that spoon come in a cereal box or what? How do acquire? :D   You need to decline Delina's quest by clicking the X.   I did not read the article because the authors failed to differentiate between biological sex (the word female) and gender (the word man) in the first paragraph and it made me a sad science panda.     Fair enough.   ^That's ^what ^analgesic ^means.   He could chew on the cane and acquire nutrients. Also it provided a natural analgesic.   Yoda's cane (gimer stick) was also nutritional.  EDIT- Denis Lawson is Ewan McGregor's Uncle.   healthy, -to-2 pack-per-day smokers  I LOL'd.   Thanks! :)   It sounds like your family could use some happy news. It sounds tough, but happy things like weddings usually lift everyone up. *hugs OP*      I am super impressed! :D I thought it was an actual service Lego offered.   Anybody hear anything about Space Mountain refurb in April/May? Folks on a different page have reported fast pass cancellation.   Aww thanks. :)   Probably. I was trying to say that without directly accusing the OP of being abusive.   Her name is Treek and she is in the Cartel Market and is a tank/healer. You can use her for any class either Imperial or Republic. Kind of pricey if you don't catch a sale though. But it's totally awesome she swoops into battle on one of those little hang gliders, summons bees as a taunt, and stabs herself in the leg with a healing dart when her health is low.    It sucks dude but it is absolutely her decision to make. Chalk it up to a life experience and apply these lessons to your next relationship.   Thank you. Leia was a badass.  	55
 Is your almond milk one you buy off the shelf and is shelf stable until opened?  I think the date on those are when it can't be sold anymore.  But once you open it, it's only good for a couple weeks?    I made one with strong iced coffee. I cold brew and then if I drink it by its self dilute to taste. For the smoothie I used it undiluted,  with frozen bananas, Greek yogurt and chocolate protein powder. Bit higher calorie, but filling. I had borrowed the protein powder from a friend, next time I'll probably just put a little bit of cocoa powder in it or maybe some peanut butter.  I look up recipes online all the time,  and then I play around with ingredients on my own too. If I have a bunch of random leftover ingredients that might go well together,  I try it.    http://simplegreensmoothies.com/ I've gotten some good ideas for recipes here.     Edit: I've seen people on this sub use PB2 a lot, haven't tried it yet. But from what I understand it's lower calorie than peanut butter and could be used in smoothies as well.   Smoothies can get high in calories pretty quickly,  but I don't eat breakfast. I figure I can have one up to 400 calories without messing up my meals and snacks for the rest of the day. And if I know I won't be able to eat I'll make a more filling higher calorie one. If it's supposed to be a slower day,  I'll make a lower cal one so I can eat a lunch as well.   The sugar amount can also get high very fast. More greens and just a little fruit can help keep it down.    I work in the service industry as well.  It can definitely be hard to find time to eat,  let alone eat something healthy.  I've begun making green smoothies with Chia seeds the night before so I can grab it as I walk out the door. In my experience most places allow you to keep a beverage near. And it can be a lot easier to grab a quick sip than to eat a snack.   I make mine with spinach, coconut water (one that doesn't have added sugar), banana,  pineapple,  and Chia seeds. Mine tend to be between 200-300 calories depending on what fruits I switch up. They are typically spinach heavy with just enough fruit to sweeten it a bit.  And the Chia seeds help make it more filling.   I also have been packing sliced vegetables and homemade granola bars or half a sandwich.  If I have a few minutes for a snack,  I eat the veggies. If I'm lucky enough to get a little lunch break, I eat the sandwich.     I count both. I typically plan my dinner first and then work my way backwards. I pick my snacks for the day and my lunch based on what's missing in my dinner. My dinner is typically my biggest meal of the day and tends to be either high in carbs or protein.    A lot of cereals are fortified with iron. I believe rice Krispy has 50% of daily recommendation.  Fortified iron doesn't always get absorbed the best, but if you eat Vitamin C with it, it increases absorbtion. So for breakfast you could eat cereal and OJ.   My boyfriend's daughter is 7 and picky and doesn't eat meat, and doesn't eat enough non meat sources with iron. She recently went to the doctor and was told her iron was very low.  I looked up recipes to make granola bars high in iron. That's an option, but also a bit high in calories.    I eat plenty of fish/seafood in general. Love that stuff :)      Hadn't even thought about sodium in deli meats. I'll definitely be checking that now. Thanks!    I tend to switch up what I eat each day.  :) I eat tuna maybe once a week, or even once every two weeks. I appreciate your concern though.  Tuna was a last second addition to the sandwich,  my boyfriend had eaten about half a small can of it for his lunch and I've been trying to eat some more protein,  so I threw it on my sandwich.  :)    Started tracking calories about a month ago and try to eat between 1200 and 1300  day.   Made this with: Whole wheat sandwich thin 100 cal. 1 oz deli turkey 25 cal. 2 oz canned tuna 60 cal. Coleslaw 33 cal. Spinach 2 cal.   221 calories  25g carbs 3.5g fat 24.5g protein      A couple years ago I would have said no more than 5 years older or younger. Now, I've been dating a man 12 years older than me for almost 2 years. Things are going pretty great and I'd love to spend the rest of my life with him.    We are in slightly different parts of our lives, but I'm not far behind.  He has his career,  I'm just getting into mine. We both have bachelor degrees.    Biggest difference I'd say is he is divorced and has a daughter,  but I know several people my age that have kids and are single/divorced.   For us, the age gap isn't a deal breaker.    Thank you! I will look into some videos. I do have a full length mirror that I could probably use to check form.    I'm just starting to think about lifting weights. But I don't really have access to a gym. What are some good exercises you could do with these dumbbells?  Can you get good results even without all the fancy equipment a gym would have? Thanks!     I'm really glad you posted this. I'm just starting and my starting weight/height/age is almost identical to your starting  numbers. Very motivating and inspirational.  You look great!     http://thenourishinghome.com/2013/08/fruit-nut-grain-free-bars/ I've been using this recipe for kind bars. It's nice because it's very customizable.     Not sure what this is in reference to. Maybe you are being sarcastic.  But dietician is the correct term. Anyone can  call themselves a nutritionist. You have to have schooling, internship,  and pass an exam to call yourself a dietician.    I haven't personally, but a friend of mine has and said it was good. You could always cut back the sugar a bit if you think it'll be too sweet. I've also seen variations for mint chocolate chip and also peanut butter chocolate.    http://www.browneyedbaker.com/girls-love-their-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough/   Completely missed that connection.  My apologies.  :)   Went to school in MI. We celebrated 100th day. Also MI is Midwest.    Thank you!  I had a lot of fun with it.  Definitely something I want to do again :)      I should have dropped the flour to 400, but I didn't.  I had to add about a tsp of milk to help it come together.  But it was great. Rolled out nicely.  Baked perfectly.  And tasted good. Tonight I'll attempt to decorate with Royal Icing for the first time.    Thank you! Trying the recipe tonight :)   Do you chill the dough before baking? And on average how many cookies do you get from this recipe?    Had to get drug tested at one of my restaurant jobs. It was a 5 star place though.    I've had the half med rare half well done burger request before,  as a cook I just put a weight on half of it so it cooks faster.  	28
 I used to believe that my mom would actually cut my pinkie off if I broke my pinkie promise.   	1
 Kids, this is the story of how I met your mother.    Well, unfortunately, that's the way life is. I know several people who lost considerable amounts of weight, became 'attractive,' and noticed how much nicer people of both genders were to them. It's sad but true.    I always included hygiene, clothing, and most importantly *personality* in my definition of attractive - don't you?   Why? Honest question, as it applies to both genders.    I think most men have much lower standards for at least a one night stand than most women.    You do? When does that kick in?   I saw a paper a while back that said thirty minutes of fairly active (not missionary) sex a day was enough exercise for an adult to maintain weight on a reasonably healthy diet.   I think part of the issue should be that, in many countries, any 17yo having sex with a 15yo is statutory rape, regardless of consent given by both parties.    It's not so much underdressing as ridiculous overdressing that irritates me.   I think that firstly, there should be a difference between promiscuity and genuinely being a *slut*, and that some criticism of proper sluts has some justification - but most importantly, should applied to MEN AS WELL.  It's fine with me for a person (regardless of gender) to go out and have a one night stand. I'm fine with two or maybe three different partners a week. Sex is great and should be encouraged. But someone who has sex with a different partner *every single day* (casually, not as a job etc) or even multiple partners in one twenty-four hour period (and I know girls who do this) are going a bit far.   There are obvious reasons like the ridiculous risk of STDs with that many partners - protection isn't foolproof and you're vastly increasing your statistical chances - but, and this is probably where people will disagree, I think that having sex with *that many* different partners reduces the value of the emotional connection inherent in the act, and sex goes from positive to degrading.   And I think some 'slut shaming' of men is fairly obvious - if women don't like being sexually objectified (and who would) and the way that affects them in society, then stop treating every one of them like an achievement, and your life like you have a pokedex of vaginas you need to complete. In short: men shouldn't be congratulated for having sex just because they were 'able' to get in a woman's pants.   Details: I'm a white, 19yo atheist male from outside of the US, who was not brought up in a strongly religious home.    I think it would be their combined incomes that would drop the panties.   There's be billions just from the movie stars alone.    Well, let's think about it. You're displaying attraction to her, being confident, showing your sexual intention, and implying that you know in great detail *exactly* what women are attracted to.   Who said Samurai give good advice?  Last time I checked Feudal Japanese marriages were arranged, so there's no reason to expect him to be a seduction expert.    TL;DR of this article: Kino builds comfort   until you've built enough comfort  So you need to build comfort in order to use a technique that builds comfort? Totally sounds like a non-redundant strategy.    I said 'about five.' I'd meant it to be a rough indication.    *slow clap*   It was 145 over 139.   It does happen, though. (Without bragging, for the purposes of the discussion, as it doesn't necessarily mean that we're actually intelligent) both myself and my ex have very high IQs, but hers was about five points higher than mine, and because she was doing a science degree and I a music degree it led to competition, comparison, jealousy and bitterness on my behalf, and some considerable condescension on hers. It was a major factor in our breakup.    Answers to the first two would be great. And how to counter any potential resistance.    Playing badly   Explain?   I'm reading The Game at the moment, is it good/worth following in terms of self improvement? I'm not sure if I agree with things like peacocking.    It's like he's never been tickled before   Wow. You must be pretty hot for someone to genuinely compliment you after paying yourself out. That doesn't usually happen.    Also prepared to reach ultimate friendzone level: the shoulder she cries on about how much of a dick guys are to her while ignoring you as an option.  (I say this with the intent of being critical of guys who complain about the friendzone, not as a 'nice guy')     Am I the only one who thinks it's a dick move to break up any relationship, no matter the 'level of seriousness?'  Sure, I could probably steal stuff from a lot of shops. It shows I'm 'better' than the shop owner because he's not protecting his 'merchandise' effectively enough. So if I'm good enough to get hold of it then maybe I deserve it more than him. Doesn't change the fact that stealing is wrong.    At least you get compliments. 90% of men don't.    Colby. Never forget   Just FYI, the greater majority of /r/seduction frowns upon 'negging' (basically backhanded compliments) and most things that involve destroying someone's self esteem to complement your own.    Conspiracy Keanu   That's actually a really interesting thought. I'm doing my very best to show love and affection for you - why do you think you can reject that just because it's not in the specific manner that you want? It's quite ungrateful.    Only a Sith deals in absolutes.    Spray it with lemon water if it disobeys.    now kiss his balls   Blowjob for every mark above 70%.    I will loose wight  What have you done?! The White Walkers are coming!   Much less awkward than asking someone the time in this age of phones.    How is that AFC? An opener is an opener. And he clearly did something right, because she was his girlfriend.    Other countries - such as the Netherlands - have all of these things, as well as universal healthcare.    What has the US actually accomplished, besides fighting a lot of wars and making a small group of people very rich?   Makes me suspicious tbh. This story is a little too perfect.    This is also my bookmark.    Better: crocs   Your name is proof enough for me   It's well-established that what women *think* they want and what they *actually* want are seldom the same thing.  Example: wanting men to open up emotionally in relationships. They think they want to hear about all your insecurities etc. But now you've lost all of the self-confidence that made you attractive to her in the first place, and before you know it, she's cheating on you or dumping you for someone else.    Almost tempted to fly down from Brisbane. If the weather is lower than 36, I'm sold.    /r/askwomen is unfortunately a brilliant example of a larger male population upcoming what they want to hear.    I think you're onto something there. There is definitely a correlation between the common opinion of a subreddit and its general demographic - for example, /r/sex features a LOT of very sex-positive women. This is great, but it provides a slightly biased view of women the world over (IMO), because someone who is ashamed of religiously disposed against their sexuality won't exactly be posting about it on the Internet.    I understand this. There's no need to be aggressive. However I, as a male, in /r/askmen, in a thread about what males find attractive, think I can question what my fellow gender thinks to further that discussion.    Is this because you're so used to men in /r/askwomen asking about attractive features, what signs indicate they like someone etc?   how can I love someone who doesn't love themselves  Ok, what is seriously wrong with loving someone who has low self esteem? I see this constantly.    snipers and shotguns  These are not actual firearms, right...   Can I tentatively suggest that, due to the fact that men are (let's face it) generally emotionally repressed in our society, the Internet and these subreddits might be the only place where they feel comfortable talking about their emotions?   You have a great point. If you ask women what they find attractive, and it isn't you, is that really their fault? It ties into the idea that the most upvoted response in either subreddit is usually the one that pleases the males the most.   I say this as an unattractive and unconfident male who feels worse when reading these types of threads - but I wouldn't expect anyone to change them just to suit my fantasies.    Or "I already know what I want to do, please tell me that I'm right"   You're welcome. Now go get some.    Can you link me to a description/how-to of the 5 questions game?   You need to tell her everything you just said about not being old enough and not being ready, and above all, about *not wanting to be romantically involved with her in any way again.*  Do not, under any circumstances, have sex with her or be physical with her in any way. If she says it's casual, trust me, it's not. You will only hurt her more.    I can't do this  - Confidence in your own abilities and *knowing your limits and inabilities* - the difference between ego and self confidence.    /r/confidence, /r/faimprovement and even /r/seduction may help you out.    tongue was implied  Well maybe it's not. That's what you've learned from this night, and your routine will be better for it. You've improved. That's a successful outcome.    If you were actually an alpha you wouldn't be so dependent on sex to make you happy.    This is pretty well known. I'd say he means girls who can.    Can we have a 'dear ladies' and 'dear men' insecurities thread, sidebar it, and make it essential reading before posting? I feel this is an even better format of FAQ.     This article has no information and a lot of links to 'my website.'   Straight man who loves show tunes. Screw you.   	67
 my boyfriend tells me to keep not talking to my dad. i have told my boyfriend more stuff about my sister and agrees that she is a nasty piece of work. I've always felt like the outsider but that could be because i also have bpd.    thank you for calling me a sweet sweet woman    when i did see my dad the most recent i would just be silent and not talk and be like that for hours and it would be easier because i would try to talk and he would call me stupid for asking a question. or my sister would tell me to shut up because i said the wrong thing in front of our dad. so i just got sick of it and removed myself from it by not going and not talking to him.    im worried that if i talk to my dad even once it will go back to the way it was and ill have no life. he doesn't even know I'm bisexual and he doesn't even know I'm going to get tattoos done soon. so it seems easier to ignore him.    i did a bachelors in photography but i got an ordinary degree    i am currently on esa which is a disability benefit.    i didn't get a job out of uni because i was suffering with severe depression and still am. i am also ill and in and out of hospital and doctors. i don't have a job. when i am not too ill i get job interviews but never a job. i moved in with my current boyfriend but he couldn't look after me all the time and it was a strain on him.    my sister and my mum attack each and i don't know what to do. my new bf has met my sister brother and mum but i don't want him to meet my dad. i have tried to block his number using an app but I'm not sure if it blocks texts.    I'm going to have a talk with my mum because she has a rocky relationship with her dad as well. my granddad hit my mum with a walking frame but they still manage to talk still.    i also get a lot of hate from my sister about it   	10
 Anne Hathaway and Mark Wahlberg were originally the leads of Sliver Linings Playbook    This would backfire because I don't think people would always see the opening night because spending for example $100 for a movie is a lot of money. As a movie lover, I would just wait till the price lowers down or just watch it online. Indie movies, it would be great for because I think people would start watching Indie movies more.    ''I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.''- Taken    So my friend is in another country coming home, everyone is so surprised because no one expected this to happen. In honest opinion, I'm very overwhelmed because I know someone else who's father just passed away and also my dad is sick with cancer for a few years and I'm scared he'll be next.   Question: Has anyone been in this situation and what advice would you give me to help her out?    See! This is why I love movies! I'm always tempted with sucidial thoughts but I always have a movie that I want to see. So it keeps me want to wait to watch the movie   "Can people with hearing loss drive?" A person asked this in this class we had to take to get our license quicker and she knew I had a hearing loss.     It seems like you have changed a few things to be with her. She needs to do the same or it won't work. If you are watching the movie not her, she can't control everything. She seems too controlling    Ew, she's dating someone who's in high school. Shows that she is immature. you deserve better   Sliver Linings Playbook 50/50 pitch perfect   If he really cared about you, he wouldn't of left. He wouldn't want to leave because he would want to be there for you.    Life sucks. I know exactly what you are going through. Every single day I think about death and how much easier it will be if I died. But then I realized I'm only 20 years old. My life is shitty, but I can do something about it. I laugh about my life it helps me and I like making others laugh. You are 16 years old, I know you think ending your life will be better but it won't. Your parents may not understand your depression but they will be heart broken to hear that you ended your life. Why don't you go to a support group and meet new friend that you can relate to? Don't give up my friend.    I'm sorry for the PM that you have been receiving. You are not a bad person. Feelings change thats understandable that you want to leave him because also he is being very controlling. Being with someone who has been charged for domestic violence charge is very dangerous. If I were you, I would protect yourself because you are very vulerable in this situation. He is very dangerous and he wants you to feel guilty by saying he is going to commit suicide. Maybe he has a mental illness that you are not aware of that triggered the violence etc.   Have a performance that shows many scenes where the character has a emotional breakdown, character development and etc. Worked for Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine and Jennifer Lawrence in Sliver Linings Playbook.    sliver linings playbook   Captain America- Black Widow needs her own movie INMO   So I wanted to know if there is anything like strategies that they used that has helped decrease the suicidal thought or when they have them what do they do to help get rid of them in a way thats positive? These thoughts I have go in and out of my head, I just want to know if anyone has any strategies that helps them that they would like to share that would be greatly appreciated.    I don't know what to say, I'm struggling the same thing to be honest. How am I supposed to help where I can't help myself. I learned that life does suck but its how you deal with the situation it can make life better. Losing a puppy is like loosing your best friend. I can't tell you what that experience is like because I haven't experienced it yet. Being heart broken sucks, but it will get you closer to finding someone who will feel the same way about you. Sometimes we all think we don't have people who care about themselves, but we are wrong. There is people out there who care about you could be your parents, friends, teacher, neighbours, here on reddit. There is someone there for you. I know the feeling of the thought of dying would just make everything eaiser, and trust me I would but knowing that I'm so young and my family would be heart broken kills me inside. Show the girl that she is missing out by doing things you never thought you would do. We all have our moments when we will weak, but it is up to us to steer back into the right directon. Don't give up kid! You can do it.    I'm on cipralex for about probably two months now. The beginning you'll notice that you may not be as alert as you used to be that was a side effect for me. I felt very tired at the beginning but then your body will adjust. The medication will not work right away it will take 3 weeks. I was very scared during the 3 week time because my sucidial thoughts increased to the point where I was picturing wires wrapped around my neck. But my doctor increase my dosage and I'm fine so far. Stress can increase your behaviours so try to find coping mechanisms to help you out.    I guess they aren't a fan of Easy A then LOL   I am Sam, Hotel Rwanda, The Boy In Stripped Pyjamas    Easy A   Somebody clearly spent a lot of time on this. But this is very interesting   I'm hearing impaired, I'm so grateful that I'm able to use my hearing aids. I'm so happy that you re able to experience this. :)   There is nothing wrong with talking to someone who is a professional. The feeling will get worse if you keep it inside and you are not getting the help you need. We all need help in different ways. I just got help I don't regret it for a second.    Go to the park, and listen to the birds. Go downtown and hear all the buses and cars youll be amazed to hear all these noises   If you want to have a relationship with someone you need to be honest with them    Just be honest with her and be like the comment you said really bothered me. No one wants to be called disgusting. One day someone told me I look like a bag of shit. Still to this day it bugs me. Comments like that hurt.    Like it or not you need to tell him how you feel. Either way he is going to get hurt. No one likes to get dumped especially if he thinks the relationship is going so well that he wants to propose. What would you rather dump him before between you and him or in front of his family while you reject his proposal. If you say yes because you feel gulity thats even worse giving him false hope. Just be honest with him and make time to do it. There is always time you just have to make it    Come on, seriously calling someone a cunt its low.    pitch perfect    Pitch Perfect, Sliver Linings Playbook   Pocketful of Sunshine, I heard that song in the movie Easy A. That movie was shown right when my dad first diagnosed to cancer and the song cheered me up    Okay I would love to be Veronica Mars. I don't know if it counts, but it went from a TV series to a movie. She's intelligent plus she got like four boyfriends where I can't get shit.    Agreed!    You can get fired and you are an intern, he's a full time staff member. He can get you fired in a heart beat, all he needs to do is just tell one person and boom basically you put your job in someone elses hand. I'm not trying to scare you but you put yourself in a very bad situation.    I have a question because you are an intern and he's a worker isn't that against the code of ethics or something that you are not supposed to be in intimate relationships with staff members. Just be careful because you might of put your intern in jeopardy because you deleted the texts but it doesn't mean he did.  Also from the look of this it seem like he pressured you and made you do things that you said many times no. That is not right, he took your rights away.  Saying sorry during the sexual act or after doesn't make it better. If I were you I would stay away from him.    He sounds like an asshole.    Loved her in Frozen! Agreed!    I saw Pitch Perfect with my friends and two other people in the theatre. It made the experience ten times better because I already saw it a few other times before. I was able to sing and dance because I knew what was happening. It's the best its empty makes the experience better  	39
 Sexual incompatibility can totally be a relationship killer.   BUT, you don't have that problem.   Sexual incompatibility is when you guys aren't having sex as much as you (or he) thinks you should or wants to and that doesn't seem to be the case.   As long as you guys are both satisfied with your sex life and the relationship it doesn't matter what other people think. You could have sex one per year or 6 times a day and it still wouldn't matter.   If you think your boyfriend is unhappy or your need reassurance that he is then talk to him. But, from everything that you've written it sounds like you're both on the same page.    Obviously you need to talk to him about it.   Sometimes though, fantasies are just fantasies. Doggy style might just be something he likes thinking about but (evidently) doesn't like doing.   Less likely (in my mind at least) is the possibility someone else raised that he's doing research to try something new for you. While that would be awesome I feel like it's probably not the case.   You need to have an in depth conversation with him about why he doesn't like the position. Does it not feel pleasurable? Does he feel like it is degrading to you? Does he feel uncomfortable not being able to see your face?  There is a real reason and you need to suss it out and only then can you possibly work on moving past it.   Good luck. And remember to be a gentle as possible during the conversation. Use 'I' statements where ever possible (I would like it if we... I like doggy because...) and avoid 'you' statements (You only like it when we... You never want to try new things) because they can sound accusatory and make him defensive.    Have your boyfriend sleep on the couch.   You are a guest in his home, you can be considerate of his wishes when you visit. It's not a complete imposition.   Is it silly? Yes. Would you and your BF staying in the same room destroy your nephew's faith? No.   But, it's for a short period of time, I'm sure your relationship with your BF can handle a couple nights not in the same bed and it would make your brother more comfortable.   Try not to focus on it while you're there and just have a good visit. It's a small thing, you can handle it.    You aren't being a bitch, your husband is acting like a child.  If his single mid-late 20's co-workers want to go out every night and get drunk and party at strip clubs that is their choice.  His choice was to get married and have a family and there are responsibilities that go along with that choice.  He needs to start living up to those responsibilities.  First he needs to start communicating with you on when he expects to be home.  That's just basic courtesy.    Then you guys need to set and agree on some boundaries.  How many nights per week will he go out with his co-workers?  Is it acceptable to visit strip clubs on non-special occasions?  What activities need to be cleared/discussed prior to their occurrence?  If he balks at either request (communication or boundaries) then he needs to consider whether he wants your marriage to work.  For a marriage to work both people have to be committed and present and right now, he is not present (and maybe not committed either).  Either way, something needs to change.    * What do people look for in a romantic partner? That varies from person to person I think but mainly in the details. In general people want someone they are attracted to, someone who finds them attractive, someone they share interests and values, and someone who they enjoy being with.   * Me sending funny pictures/articles that remind me of them, etc., is that weird? What are normal clear-interest showing examples of things to do when seeing someone? I'd say that's not weird. Be aware thought that different people are comfortable with different levels of affection/interest at different times. I would say continue to be yourself and you will find someone who appreciates what you have to offer.   * What is the fundamental or "core" of a relationship? For me, attraction and trust.   * How much interest is too much/too little?  There's no hard rule. Some guys (and gals) are going to accept/expect higher levels sooner than others. Find the level you are comfortable with and express that and if you aren't getting what you expect back then say so.   * How to not be vapid without having to be a ball of energy at the time? You don't have to be constantly excited about everything but I find it very attractive when women are passionate about something. Have something in your life that you care deeply about and be open to new experiences. That's all anyone can ask of you.   Edit:Hit submit by accident     Your boyfriend is not perfect.   It's great that he's been there for you through your illness/diagnosis but I guarantee he is/has been feeling stressed by the whole thing.   If you believe his apology to be sincere then accept it.   It's hard to the other person watching someone you love suffer like that and have nothing you can do to fix it. Especially for guys because we like to fix things.   What he said was not supportive and you definitely have a right to be upset about it. I just wouldn't take it as a sign that he thinks you fake things or are a hypochondriac since he's never given that impression before.   Let him know you were hurt by his comments, accept his apology and move on. It's ok to be upset (for both of you), just don't let it poison what otherwise sounds like a good relationship.    You guys weren't trying to get pregnant and from what you wrote it doesn't sound like you even knew you were pregnant until after the miscarriage.   That must have been a shock and I'm really sorry you had to go through that at all and especially without support from your boyfriend.   My wife and I have been through 5 miscarriages in many stages from 1 week to 12 weeks. It's a little different for you because you didn't know you were pregnant at the time but let me say that men and women process pregnancy very differently.   It's hard for men to conceptualize babies in the womb. For a lot of men it's even hard to get attached emotionally to babies until they are able to have actual interaction of some kind (what level of interaction that triggers an emotional response varies from man to man I have found).   All of that is to say that your boyfriend might be experiencing a lot of different emotions that he doesn't know how to process and that those emotions are probably very different from what you experienced/are experiencing.   Don't assume you can read his mind/know how he's feeling without hearing it from him.   I suggest you sit down and have a serious conversation with him about how the miscarriage made you feel and how you felt unsupported by his actions. Let him know the kind of support you would have liked at the time and what you would like going forward. Ask him how he is feeling and encourage him to actually discuss his feeling and not just brush them off.   If you come to find that it's not a wave of unprocessed emotions that are making him act like an unsupportive jerk and he just is a jerk then by all means end things.   Just don't assume you know what he's thinking or feeling ahead of time.   Just because he's a guy doesn't mean he's automatically an unfeeling caveman. He still might be that but it's not a default setting we all share.    1 Find a divorce lawyer, in case you want to go that route, knowing steps to take ahead of time is never a bad idea.   2 Find a therapist. While the internet is always here for venting, talking to a professional is more beneficial   3 Talk to your husband. Tell him you know about the affair. Be prepared for him not to admit to everything at once. This is not acceptable but it is bound to happen anyway. Find out if he wants to save the marriage. Be prepared (as much as you can be) that his answer may be no.   If he says yes, he needs to cut contact with her NOW. Not tomorrow, not ASAP, NOW. If he wants to save the marriage he doesn't owe her a face to face, he doesn't owe her an explanation. Have him call her, text her, email her in front of you and then no further contact. He also needs to keep you aware of any contact they have going forward. If he runs into her at a restaurant, if she texts him, whatever.  Make it clear that any contact that happens that he doesn't immediately report is a deal breaker for you. There can be no half measures on rebuilding trust. He has to recognize that he broke it so he has to fix it.  You guys also need to see a therapist together to work through the trust rebuild and any other issues that exist or may arise.   It's not going to be easy. The whole thing sucks and will continue to suck for a long time.   All of this, of course, is assuming that you want to save the marriage. That is something only you can decide and no one would blame you if you wanted to just be done with him.   I'm sorry you're going through this. Good luck.    Tell your friend that, as he is aware, you are going through a rough time in your marriage and you need to focus on your relationship with your husband. Furthermore, since you crossed a line with him you need to have no more contact with him going forward     If he is a decent person he will understand and comply. If he isn't, don't take no for an answer.   Tell your husband when you have the end of contact conversation with your friend and then let him know ANY time you have further contact, no matter who initiates and no matter how small the contact.   Any hidden conversation  that comes out can totally destroy trust between you and your husband.   Good luck working through this!  I believe you can do it as long as you both stay focused on each other.    If he isn't already he should get hooked up with the local VA center.  As someone else mentioned, there is no time limit on PTSD and honestly (if that is the problem) going longer without treatment will only make things worse.   And if that isn't the problem there are specialists that can help him diagnose the issue.   I'm a Marine as well and I know it's tough for people like us to seek out help.   Just do everything you can to let him know that you love and support him and that you don't think anything less of him, although probably don't mention that last bit unless he asks.   Be ready with examples of how you don't consider him a failure to say in case he expresses that sentiment.  Tell him you are happy to talk things through and then give him space to decide when/if he wants that conversation to happen.   I'm sure he's aware already but he's really lucky to have someone so supportive in his life. I wish you both lots of luck and I know you guys can make it through this.    I'm sorry you've had such bad experiences.   I am a 33M just back on the dating scene and if I had started seeing someone and they reacted as you did I would be all for it.   I think the problem is the guys you've been finding, not you. I know that doesn't make it suck any less but I think the only solution is for you to keep meeting people.   Be honest with what you're looking for in a relationship (or out of one, depending on your preference) and I'm sure you will find a good fit for you.   Good luck!   You need to bring up counseling again and this time don't take no for an answer.   Make it clear that even if he doesn't see the problems the same way (ie, not as big a deal) they are a big deal to you and they need to be addressed.   Don't accept 'I'll do this better' or 'I'll do more of that' because things will go back to the norm.   I don't think you guys are totally hopeless but you both need to work at it.   Additionally, I know you don't want to, but you need to cut contact with this other guy.   As someone else said, it isn't fair for your husband to have to compete with someone you're not having issues with. If you want the marriage to work your focus should be there, not anywhere else.    Ok. Thanks for the heads up.   Guess I'll be unlocking Shores first.    I'm on the Xbox.   I just finished 'Assist the Zhentarim' step of the campaign and have Shores of Tuern and Lair of Lostmauth available (just missing requirements).   My question: are the unlock costs a one time thing or do I have to pay that every time I want to run them?   I play a Cleric, usually on everyday.   GT: Jaird   	15
 You guys don't actually believe this do you...?   r/cringepics   Get out of here you bloody brown bastard! (read with Indian accent)   #just#me#in#my#room#2deep4u#swag#yolo   Will you be my swag 5ever?   Just like when the police went to my buddy's house because they didn't know his address.   TIL   I have kind if a similar story. The whole family went with me to the shelter to pick out a cat and one of them came up to us and just jumped into the baby stroller. I'd like to think she adopted us :)    Small town in Switzerland here... everything closes at 5 and nothing is open on Sundays. Consider yourself lucky.   Wow awesome. Thanks for this OP   They're reminders   Great post, thank you http://i.imgur.com/AQXhkNw.jpg   Wonderful cat, thank you http://i.imgur.com/AQXhkNw.jpg   Source : http://www.landoverbaptist.net/showthread.php?t=29924 (beware, so much cringe inside)   Ahoy!   Proud of myself for still not having seen this.   I feel like shit knowing I missed this :(   I really don't understand this. How the fuck is your sexual preference interfering the way you play?    this gave me cancer   OP you're a fag   Could not agree more. I'm turly sorry for your loss man. Self medicating is not the answer. I think you just need someone you can talk to. Stay strong bro.    To clarify, that isn't me.   My hands just got sweaty.   You know it's gonna be a bad day when you've seen something on Twitter before Reddit.   	24
 If I need help I much prefer Mitre 10. The one near me actually hired an ex-plumber in the plumbing section. Also once I needed a gift for my dad for fathers day and got a suggestion - it was the only gift I've ever given dad that I think he's actually wanted, despite all my best efforts.   eBay if you can. It's cheaper and they're often better than store costumes. But you need time for the delivery... that's the only problem.    One option might be to find a Butcher that can order it for you.   I have usually found a good variety of meats at Peters Meats in Broadway. You could try giving them a call and asking them if they can order it in for you.  You could also try asking this Scottish place (in Maroubra btw,  not in the Hills) if they sell it or know where to get it: http://hillsbutchery.com.au   In Australia eggs are often located on non refrigerated shelves at supermarkets but when I get home I always put them in the fridge.  Australia sits somewhere between US and European standards. We wash our eggs but they sometimes are and sometimes aren't sold from the fridge in the supermarket. Most people I know do put them in the fridge once home though like I do.   [See here](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/should-you-refrigerate-eggs-in-australia-2014-7)   The processing process in Australia is shown on page 6 [here](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t source=web rct=j q=Australia%20egg%20washed ei=dLQeVdHEFMHe8AXGtYCIDA url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/primaryproduction/egg/documents/Eggs_healthandsafety.pdf ved=0CB8QFjAB usg=AFQjCNFfMLYdgk38K3YFJ71kHs7D8kRqNA )    If you're a good looking lady you almost always get to choose.   That's obviously going to vary as countries raise and lower interest rates.    I'm a resident overseas and have accounts overseas already. I'm not too worried. I'll spread my eggs around in different baskets to hedge my bets.   Sounds good to me. Thanks! :)    I wonder if you can get your wages deposited into an overseas account. Anyone know?   I just Googled it and found this photo of baby Emus on the beach!: https://malpassadventures.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/dsc_0058.jpg  Will sign! I want to see beach Emus one day.    I catch buses and don't use the opal card. If you do use the opal card just make sure you tap off when you get off.    A lot of native flowers are usually pretty expensive. I'd go to the market and make my own bouquet. You have to wake up early though but they are also really fresh.   If you want a good floral arrangement from a good florist you usually have to order them in advance.   I know a few good places but none in or near those particular areas unfortunately. There used to be a florist at the international airport arrivals terminal but I think it is gone now.   Pearsons florist at Broadway used to be good but they are renovating their store at the moment. I think they have quite a few stores around Sydney. Just be warned,  they're pretty expensive but they do very nice bouquets.   I've had my kmart one for a couple of years. It still works fine including the pedal, though doesn't look as good as it used to. Still does the job though. I don't value the bin enough to spend a lot of money on it.   I fed these guys once and ended up with my balcony covered in bird poo. That was the last time.   Tafe at Ultimo is pretty good and cheaper than the unis. Good if you want to go after work.    I think there are quite a few kids at jenolan caves though. I went in school holidays and they sell the tours out for hours in advance so I'd recommend if you go get the tickets first and walk around the pretty lake while you wait for your cave tour.   I haven't seen any in Sydney... wild. Even if they were it'd be hard to spot them. They're not exactly noisy! I was on Magnetic Island and it was hot so stopped to put sun cream on for like ten minutes. Just as I was going to leave I heard a small rustling noise. Directly above me was a small koala. Must have been a juvenile. It woke up for about 30 seconds and moved to a different fork in the tree then went back to sleep.   I'd say your best bet near Sydney is a wildlife park or zoo.    :( I am worried for my teeth too. I wish I was a shark and could regrow them.   But... where *are* the pedals?    If you ask a friend or acquaintance I'm sure they'd help you out. I'd let my deprived friends use my Internet!   If you have no friends you can try cafes but they'll be noisy. I personally wouldn't want to do an interview in one.  But if you must... Well Connected Cafe in Glebe has free wifi. It's not 24 hrs but it's got longish hours.   There are also Internet/gaming cafes like city hunter. You could give them a call and ask if you can use Skype but they would have headsets for gaming. Sorry been ages since I've been there. Not sure if it's noisy there but you could check it out anyway.  I reckon buying 4G would be the way to go as well.   If you're lucky you can see them in the city.   For the longest time I thought someone was using a clothes dryer at night... and it always puzzled me why at that hour they would do their laundry. It turns out it was a tawny frogmouth. They make a weird continuous hoot. After hearing this sound for over 5 years I finally saw them a couple of months ago. I saw 3 in the space of about two weeks. So cool. They hang by the creek.   Although tawny frogmouths aren't technically owls, they're nightjars so I suppose I haven't really seen an owl.  But yeah if you want to see them, you'll have to listen carefully. When you're close they are very quiet and difficult to spot unless they fly in front of you. But it happens! At least you will know from listening if they are in your area.   Maybe having the ticket is your chance to make friends with someone who will go with you.   Or you could go by yourself. I do lots of stuff by myself. It's not as bad as it seems. The animals don't mind :)   That's the weirdest part of the whole thing. Especially late at night. Who cares?   Anyway if it makes the OP feel any better, I live in the city. Road abuse is a normal thing for me and has no effect on me anymore. Just lock your doors, wind up the windows and turn up the music.    Redfern. But only if you get off and on the right carriages.    I've been looking for 2 years. Whatever the price guide is we usually add $200-300k and it ends up closer to what it will actually go for. It helps reduce our disappointment a bit at auction. But it's still crap. Every time we figure out what the price should be it defies our expectations the next month. It's horribly disheartening and makes me lose faith.   I'd leave Sydney if there were decent jobs elsewhere. How do we get businesses to move to other cities? Surely people would be interested in living somewhere with affordable housing closer to work.    Thanks! :)    OP has obviously already done it. Why would I do it again?   How do you make it show the locations?   Where is this map from? I need some suburbs further south!   Can you do Australian Fauna now and Carnivores later? That would be cool to do both.  Food poisoning sucks. Has the vomiting stopped? I paid a lot for a fancy hotel overseas once and spent the night on towels on the bathroom floor vomiting all night. I had to get a foreign doctor to give me a needle to stop it. But only after almost 24 hours. :/ He said any longer and I'd be in hospital.    I just realized how old I am. I used to use one of these at work.    I had a pet dwarf rabbit when I was a kid and the cat got it and killed it. I smacked the cat to try to make it drop it but I couldn't make it drop it without hurting the cat, and I didn't want to break it's jaw. The dog was barking, it was chaos, but the cat just hung tight until it was dead. Worst pet combo ever. Now, I wouldn't ever keep a cat with an animal that could be it's prey. We got mice for pets once, that drove the cat insane. The cat would refuse to eat anything else until it got the mice. One day I came home and the cat had knocked the cage over and broken it. Weird thing is that cat was so gentle with humans - no scratching or biting or anything, just cute and cuddly.   I got an air purifier the other day and I farted near it. Poor thing went into hyper drive. :(    Oh yeah whoops. I didn't notice the time :)   Aren't people who are cruel to animals often sociopaths? If so then they may be more likely to have a record.    During the gun buyback after guns were outlawed there were quite a few individuals who exploited the fact that people willingly handed over their guns. They often had someone file down the numbers and then redistribute them to criminals for a price. If you Google it you will find quite a few news stories about those who were caught. Many of the illegal guns in Australia are still in circulation due to criminals like this who profited greatly at the cost of others.   For example: http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/record-jail-term-for-gun-plot/2007/02/21/1171733835420.html?page=fullpage   Damn you! I was on a diet!   Some of these things are totally do-able! What is stopping you all?   But soup is humid. I went the other day when it was hot and I was sweating like a pig.    When I was in the US I learned they have BB guns and paintball for sale at some of the sports stores. Guess that's how they can host events like the one you mentioned. It's much more regulated here.   I thought this must be what happens when you get foxtel.    ... and MrAwkwardCrotch's knowledge of lubes.   Where do his man parts go? Are they usually that... compactable?   It must have been terrifying. I'm glad you made it out of there.    Have you fought fires there? Do the trees fall down when there's fires too?   Wow, that's pretty nice! How have I lived in Sydney my whole life and not been there?    That's a great photo!    I see what you mean. I agree with you. It doesn't make sense as an objective question. I think most people get that and answer it subjectively - at least that's what I did. Also I like hearing other people's opinions so I can expand my horizons and knowledge of other nice places.    Actually I would prefer if Australia was a Republic and that particular point has nothing to do with my choices.    Can other people not from the US/Canada who haven't lived in these two countries for any period of time tell the difference between these accents? Sometimes I feel like I can when I am there, but then I get all confused, especially when there are so many different American accents.   "America has contributed nothing positive to society or the world."  I don't believe this at all, but I do think it would piss most Americans off.   What sort of person would you describe if you were to try to explain what "most" Americans are like? I've always found this hard because America has quite a lot of diversity.     There are plenty of other things that need the world's attention, those are the things we are often trying to escape by considering living in countries that have less things that need the world's attention.   So on a global level we should care about other things, but on a personal level we want the best we can get, so this is entirely relevant to us as individuals.    I haven't been there so I can't really put it on my top list as I don't know a lot about it. I like natural features, so it has to have that to be on the best country list. Do you know if they have anything like that?  I loved the Republic of Ireland but feel that it's too economically unstable to live for a full lifetime. Also I have never been to a country that has so little racial diversity as Ireland, and I would miss it.    I would say Canada, Australia, New Zealand. I can't choose one.  Edit: Clearly this is subjective.    I had this same thing happen to me! I was running late for an appointment with a specialist and I told the guy and he yelled insults at me about being a selfish bitch. Honestly though, it's water off a duck's back. I do my bit.    I didn't know that but I always have donated directly. I tell them up front that I only donate online so they don't hassle me. I'm not giving some stranger on the street my credit card details...   I'm pretty sure my cat would have pulled this off in less than 30 seconds.   I drink Gatorade when I'm doing sport, but if you just want to rehydrate without the sugars, you can have electrolyte rehydration tables. Not sure what they're called in the US but in Australia they're called Hydralyte and Gastrolyte. They are good if you are dehydrated and need to encourage your body to absorb the water without all the extra sugars that are in some of the sports drinks like Gatorade and Powerade.  Energy drinks are not used for the purposes of rehydration, and they taste terrible. I don't know how anyone can stand the sweetness.    I'm really glad I read this thread for this comment. I didn't know they were bad. We were using them in the bathroom to rid it of the poo smells (our bathroom doesn't have windows or a fan), but now I will be careful what I burn!   I think we do know this is unhealthy, we just have difficulty doing much about it. :(   Commercial solarium use was banned in every state except Western Australia and Northern Territory on Jan 1st, 2015: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-02/calls-to-ban-solariums-in-wa-mount/5638152  VIC, QLD, NSW, SA: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-14/ban-on-commercial-solariums-to-begin-in-vic-qld-nsw-sa/5961736  TAS: http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1621203/tasmania-to-outlaw-use-of-solariums/  WA didn't join in - some reasons provided: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-02/calls-to-ban-solariums-in-wa-mount/5638152  Couldn't find an article on NT.

([more detail in my other comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zqim0/what_are_the_cigarettes_of_today_what_does/cplztv0))   I love how you saved something that might otherwise have ended up in the trash. It looks lovely too. I can see this is a proud part of your kitchen.   Yeah, sometimes I kind of cringe when he's handling the animals. Not because he's going to hurt them, more that I think he'll get hurt because he's shaking them around probably aggravating them. I'm surprised he's not bitten more often. Shows you that most Australian animals (goannas and crocs excluded) although potential deadly are usually pretty non-confrontational.    Don't worry he never hurts any of them.  He mostly picks up snakes. E.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at0efMXfCnc   Aw poor little things. But they are so cute so they have that going for them.    That's interesting - why is there an exception for axolotl's?      Yeah, it is. :( Stupid cars!    'cause they're super cool? :)  My favourite Australian lizard aside from the blue tongue is the frill-neck lizard. When I was in primary school I saw my first real one in the playground and it was the coolest thing ever! It was scared so it frilled up and had a stand off with about twenty 7 year olds all staring in awe.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frill-necked_lizard    Sort of - like, not really rare, but definitely uncommon. You need a reptile license to own any type of snake or reptile in New South Wales (and I think maybe that's the case for all of Australia but I'm not 100% sure). You can't really just walk into a normal pet store and buy them, but I suppose some people do keep them. http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/wildlifelicences/ReptileKeepersLicence.htm  I used to have a blue tongue lizard living in the backyard so never really thought about owning one. One day I came home and it was sitting in the gutter under our front door and I screamed thinking it was a snake, but it was just having a rest. :)   You might like this video then... First guy to get the iPhone 6 in Perth:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA135pd7oD0   I don't know if you've heard of him - David Ireland, Wildlife Man - but he always loves to pick animals up that don't want to be picked up and while he's talking he flails them about in the air.    He did this with a Shingleback and it was so angry at him. When he put it down it didn't really try to run away it just looked at him like it was evaluating it's options on how exactly it was going to take his life. I tried to find the video on youtube but I can't find it. :(   I think it's a [Shingleback Lizard](http://australianmuseum.net.au/shingleback-lizard) from Australia!   There is a little doco here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPZiAiUYS8o  The main feature is that the tail looks like a head - to confuse predators.   Ah I knew it was missing something! I have rectified this tragic mistake!   Maybe he saw the wallet and couldn't believe his luck. As he walked home he pondered what he could do with it. He could take a well-earned holiday. He could upgrade his worn out car that forced him onto public transport to a nice new car. He could pay off a bit of the mortgage. When he got home he realised that there were a mountain of bills piled up on the table and so he quickly went about using the money to pay them all off.   The moment he was finished he sighed a big sigh of relief. But as the night went on he couldn't stop thinking about the person who lost the money. Who were they? Why did they need that much cash? At first he dismissed the idea with thoughts that they were probably drug dealers and so by keeping the money he was actually helping to keep drugs off the street. For a day or two he tried to convince himself that that was the case. After the second day the thought popped into his head that maybe this was money that had been saved up by an elderly person and this was their retirement fund. What if children had visited him from two different countries and provided urgently needed help? Imagine, being 80 years old and the money to sustain you was in that envelope. For days he wrestled with the idea until he came to the conclusion that he would never know. This is what really chewed him up inside. What if his act of keeping the money was now causing someone else's deprivation? His conscience couldn't bear it.   He realised that there was only one solution and that was to give the money back. But he'd already spent almost $8000 of it. He felt so selfish. He didn't want to go to the police with the remaining money only to be found out if they did locate the original owner that he'd taken a cut for himself. He considered lying and saying that's all he found in the envelope, but he didn't want to risk it. So he decided he would save up the money and return it to the police. He calculated he could do this in about 2 months.  Two months went by and he was making good progress, but his dog got sick so he had to take him to the vet, which cost him another good chunk of the money.   Finally after several months he had earnt all the money back and put it in the envelope and turned it into the police. He was relieved. His conscience was clear, and he could resume his life before finding the wad of cash.   As he walked home he noticed a brand new looking lottery ticket blowing in the wind. If I win it's fate he thought! Karma for my good deeds! He got home and as all the numbers were being announced he slowly began to realise he had won! $23,000 exactly. :)  * Edit:   And then out of nowhere a heavy knock at the door... Without thinking he opened the door and there before him was Nessy the lochness monster. She explained that she was lost and was trying to get home to Scotland, and she needed treefiddy to make a phonecall. The man retrieved the money at which point Nessy started crying, explaining that it was such a lonely place in Scotland. The man's heart went out to the creature - he himself only had a pet dog whose health had recently taken a turn for the worse. He asked Nessy if she wanted to come to stay with him, as he had a large backyard pool, though he apologised that the water was no longer a clear blue, rather a murky brown, as you see he had no friends to share it with and let it go. Nessy squealed with delight! A brown murky pool was just perfect! They agreed, and the two mystical creatures lived out their days in the quiet suburbs of Sydney.   That's good. Those guys are like sharks. When I was younger there was a tow truck driver pouring oil on the road to cause accidents and of course he'd be the first on the scene. So since then I have never trusted them.  https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19920409034   I don't know :( I've never been cool enough to take up smoking. I was in Aspen, Colorado and the e-cigs are everywhere - mostly older people. Apparently it's the thing to do there.    This makes the most sense. I think they are more likely to pick up e-cigs. They look much cooler.   You're amazing :)   Thanks for the gold! :) I have never had gold before. I feel so special!    Maybe it is also just trying to enjoy a nice evening!   I just looked it up and apparently slugs are attracted to wine!: http://www.lifeinitaly.com/garden/slug-control.asp   Unlike Virgin, they go all the way... which way exactly though, they aren't too sure about.   They're building one of the biggest in Queensland! Hopefully the government can just keep their shit together for long enough to see the benefits.  http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/council-approves-2gw-mega-solar-project-plan-in-queensland-20827   I loved my cat too... she was the best. I miss her so much.   Some people suck, but there are a lot of good people too. But the terrible things people do overwhelms me sometimes. When that happens, I just think about building my own little island in the world and sometimes I travel to other places and interact with people, but then I try to come back to my own island where I try to create the world that I want to live in, and that includes making the world better for other people. I don't think island is the right word, but I really mean my section of the world, where I can mould it to be how I want it. I like that I can possibly make a difference in my little part of the world. Like a little oasis.     I think it's good seeing someone about it. Sometimes I get stuck in circles like being sucked down a whirlpool and it is like a hand reaching down and pulling me out of it. I hope you find it helpful too. I don't think I will ever be 'cured' but I hope to live a full life anyway.   I don't need to be happy all the time, sadness is a part of life, but I don't want to be miserable all the time.   How do I connect with Eeyore? I wouldn't mind. I should sleep too. :)   Btw, it means a lot that you took the time to reply. Thanks. It's my birthday today and now I don't feel alone. :)   Hey, this is precision driving! It's hard to get a car into a small parking space like that.   It looks like Hobart has been relocated to Flinders Island.   That particular Kirin one is pretty yummy! I had half of one today too at lunch with my sushi.    Mango Raspberry sounds good too. I am going to get that now next time I'm at the shop.   I also like the Kirin Cider - the one with "Ume" (Japanese Plum) delights my tastebuds!   I'm so glad there is a gym underneath my office. The punching bags there have saved me from imploding.    Working full-time is definitely an adjustment. You're going to have to realise you might have to reduce time with friends, e.g. to the weekends. Unless they are work friends or people that work close to your work, in which case you can try to catch up with them for lunch or after work. At my last job, I used to go jogging with friends at lunch, or play sport. We also used to go out drinking most fridays. At my current job I am too busy for that, so it just means a little less socialising. Luckily most of my friends also work full-time so they are in the same boat and get it.    Some jobs are better than others at having a better work-life balance. It's hard when you're starting out though because you sometimes do have to do longer hours and prove yourself. When you get a chance you can try to find somewhere with a better balance. Once you have experience you will have more bargaining power so that will help.    I also studied my last year of uni and worked full time. Things will get easier once you finish the year. Just try to stay on top of things and communicate with your boss if things are getting too much. I tried to power through it but I got really stressed and ended up on sick leave. Remember to try to eat healthy if you can and get enough sleep! It will help, trust me, I learnt the hard way.   A year or so ago I told my friend who is a psychologist about how I see someone, and I said that it's good cause I have someone to talk to. I explained I don't talk to my friends about it cause I don't want to burden them with it. She said plainly that she thinks that sometimes you should talk to your friends about things. It was the first time anyone had said that to me and it was one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me.   It's just so hard because I had it bad in highschool and always talked about suicide. My best friend from highschool also suffered from depression and last year she committed suicide, and I feel so responsible for talking about it all the time, and I feel like I didn't help and only made it worse for her.   I still can't talk to friends openly about it. Sometimes I feel so alone.   	95
 so for most cases, people are sure they are failing and therefore ask whether to withdraw or take the F (the catch all answer is to most likely withdraw)  I can't find a case for where you are borderline passing: like hit or miss pass.  Should you take the course to its entirety (with the risk of potentially failing)? or just withdraw anyways?  I guess this is one of those gray areas. Give me what you think, if there is no generalized catch-all answer. Consider/factor in financial aid.   I honestly believe my csing is really bad; positioning but that's team fighting phase, although I do have to deal with skillshots and stuff as well during laning; the only thing that bothers me in mid lane is getting ganked since I do try to be aggressive (force the opponent mid lane out and you also kinda need to do that vs 'weak early game').  also, what sort of champion is considered high difficult in mid?   I'm largely orianna, ziggs main: so basically mages  not a huge fan of assassins, the ones that comes close though are Diana and Akali  idk what ahri is, she's like a mix of in between   but queue times for mid tend to be long, thanks for the advice though haha   hmm, very good question. I really cannot handle said responsibility   the reason I am asking this is because it is the most popular lane (we're talking about normals here) and well, if you get it to practice and happen to not do well, you screw up everyone else's experience.  the only good thing is if I don't want it, usually someone else will take it (ranked)   I agree, otherwise most people would fit into genderfluid and thus invalidate the whole identity anyways  no person ever fully feels male or fully female, exclusively...   it simply doesn't  the only thing it has any effect is my personality which is what I want people to care about (except my partner)  my personality: very compassionate and friendly (sometimes it scares people), not afraid to say I love them but you know: people think I say I'm in love with them and just all around (try to be) funny person.   you are just simply sex repulsed.
