 Guess who just voted for the Yard Goats as my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place choices! Goat images/facts please   Skipped my first 2 classes because of this exact thing.  Thanks for bringing a smile to my face.   What did I just read.   That's what I'm thinking   https://twitter.com/realtonytiger/status/570266932626067456?s=09      I went from jmu today and it was fine so if you go tomorrow morning you should be okay. I went the Cass way. Hope this helps   Somebody please help all of us. Please.   Yeah let me know if you plan on going up though! I'm always down to shred snowshoe if I have the money   I go to jmu (obligatory "fuck vt") but I would definitely try to make it up for a weekend. I don't know if I'd be able to do this year (moneys) but in the future for sure!  	10
 Oh right, I forget that there is a drinking age sometimes.  Eh, once you pass 21 instead of being like "let's lower the drinking age so all these younger people can drink!"  you're like "oh screw it, I had to wait that long to for it to be legal"    Yup, thank you random internet stranger :)  If you're in the southwestern US ish area, I'll grab a beer with you!  Highly unlikely you're in my area though haha.  	2
 Surprised nobody in my FC has done this yet, tbh.   I politely disagree with Pennie not being the "best fit" for the band, because he was a lot better both technically and with understanding the band's dynamic range - better than most people off the street. As a live drummer for them for as many years as he had been, he was a good fit after Josh left and didn't really change the original rep too much. Yes Guns of Summer has a ton of technicality to it, but Pennie used to be in Dillinger Escape Plan, so it's not inherently surprising. For the most part, though, dude just kept time and did his job. Lol I personally think that they started experimenting more with electronic sounds more because of Pennie (dude has a degree from Berklee in Music Production, I believe), which has helped their Afterman sound be what it is, but I think YOTB as a whole was such a drastic "experimental" turn from previous records that most Coheed fans wrote it off. There is some good stuff there, though. Minus the songs that were singles except for Juggernaut. Wasn't feeling them too much.    Same! I got legit excited. That bassline is phenomenal!   Plumbers. I'll see myself out.    This I don't understand. I've stolen aggro from the MT who isn't Halone combining or mixing in flashes (for PLD, anyway). It's frustrating.    Tank, can confirm.    Pre-orders should've been in last week. Gf's moogle came in last Friday.    What a story, Mark! Haha  	8
 well, most people.   saw that coming from a mile away.    Why would you kill someone that 1) is willing to give you oral sex, and 2) is so concerned with your well being that will take you to the hospital when you smell bad?   I love working with my hands, putting things together, doing arts/crafts, etc. I need something new, something I can pick up fairly quickly with a little bit of research, and that will MAKE ME MONEY. Some crafts can be sold online but ETSY is oversaturated. I was thinking of making computers but I think that is something I wouldn't get the hang of, plus it cost a lot of money. I'm broke, my job isn't paying, and I do nothing all day, everyday.   If you know a better sub that could help, please direct me! thanks!!   Kava, magnesium supplements, GABA. try these.  buspar is pretty good though, try it.    I just wrote this long response but it got deleted. Basically, yes it does take a while to build up but for me, its different than cymbalta or something. I can tell which days I do or don't take it, and recognize its effects. Other than Xanax, there is a very popular pill (I think a benzo) that is nonaddictive and often prescribed because of this. I can t remember its name off the top of my head but you can search for it and do your own research. Allergy pills can affect your brain like Xanax, so it could be used as a quick fix.    Good to hear. I'm thinking of coming off mine for the same reasons as above!   That sounds like something to bring to a higher up. Good for you for leaving, I would have told them to go fuck themselves.   Arms because I'd take that idiosyncrasy and rock it.   What's the job?   Yeah I love that they care and ask me if i need I talk but the only people that understand are people that have gone through it or are currently struggling. Everyone knows my dirty laundry, but not it's extent.  Giving you advice would be hypocritical fit me because I'm stuck in this cycle as well. I don't care about anything including myself and gave up on getting better. You need someone, done meds, and to push yourself to make memories and do things.   Also, having a drink is fine, everyone gets through the day in their own way, but it's a depressant. Alcohol makes me want to kill myself and everyone I know that has depression (not many open people) feels worse when drinking. Just food for thought. Msg me if you'd like to talk.   Kratom. It's legal.   Witness protection?   To find our purpose in life.   Thanks :) it's the truth too.   Yeah I learned this about myself, i need/love physical work but who's going to hire me? I don't look strong or helpful. Idk where to look.   Sometimes the universe shits on you all at once. Repair yourself one by one. Check /r/assistance    Side note: The word "ugh" singlehandedly describes depression.   WTF are we going to do? Ugh   A critique.   Have you thought of digital design or communication design? My high school counselor suggested I make my own major and mix music and art. I forgot what it's called   Is this Canada? Just guessing because there aren't pennies anymore?   Used to call my own cell phone and let it vibrate. Repeatedly.   Did 3/4   And all sell dope   Can you send it to me 3   Well Friday in my case. It's still awesome. Who doesn't love money being put in your bank account?!?!   Message me when you find an answer because I'm right there with you.   Any antidepressant will have people that say good or bad things about it. It depends on the person and what they respond to, and other factors in their life. I'm on it now and gets me out of bed, no anxiety, but makes me feel nothing. But, in a way I'm back to my old self, as far as personality. It's the best out of the 3 I have tried, but do not feel happy at all. I was prescribed welbutrin in addition for energy and getting my emotions back but I feel it makes things worse and stopped.   Can I have a picture of said butt?   You're not going to know unless you ask.   Baby momma. It's not really known as one of the best comedies and gets pushed over but I love it. Amy and tina together are the best!   Cookies because every cookie is awesome.  Otc meds. If you read the label, it's usually the same chemical and dose, just store brand vs name brand.   There is an online community that hosts online overeaters anonymous meetings, like 3x per day. I think they have other ED online meetings for various types. I wish I wasn't on my phone and could find it.. But it's out there! Please seek help!   "Dad."   Mingle with your coworkers. Even if you don't love them, it's still is something to do, they can introduce you to people, force you to get out, and improves morale. Be friendly with your neighbors in your apt and see if they're your age. Go to a bar, even if you don't drink, and talk with the bartenders. It will help with the loneliness. Join a gym and see if they have classes and you may meet someone. If you tell them your new they may assist you and will give you something to do. All these things will ease loneliness and make you feel at home. Maybe volunteer a day or two a week somewhere like a music venue or something you're into.   I know someone that does. She said she doesn't love it but has been there forever and gets paid a hefty amount. Monday through Friday she is traveling, weekends she goes home. Obviously this isn't every job in the industry but something to think about.   Damn. All I knew was about drugs. This sickens my mood.   Nice. I'm going to be moving from the east to west coast next year. Idk. I believe you should take chances and do whatever makes you happy. I think a lot of people say that but don't act on it...   Yeah. Scariest thing is when a dealer sees you and tells you to stop buying. Stop while you're ahead. Seriously. Make a change.   Yes!! I saw part of it and it was so relatable but uplifting at the same time. I didn't finish it all but it's another way to look at things when life goes in different directions.   I barely felt anything. It was my first time and wanted to be safe. I felt the weed/alcohol high people say it feels like but wasn't too strong. But yeah, I checked the dosing and for my weight that's right in the phase 1 dose.   Oooh. Sorry. Misread. You can try welbutrin alone but I take it with an ssri, I don't like it but MOST people swear on this drug and call it legal crack. Give it a try   Never did it   Did it.   Did it   Ask about welbutrin. Eliminates side effects from SSRIs. Or try a lower dose. Or just get off them all together and control your anxiety naturally. You may not need.   Because in these movies the actresses are skinny little things and can't produce breasts, but it's also modest because they look like a guys chest.    I've always used WhatsApp and Facebook messenger to communicate. And then just googled "bar near me" or something and it will give you a name and directions for getting around. Are you using public transport? They may have an app for their system or site you may want to save to look at after.    Used to be a coffee addicted. Now I drink it once or twice a month. Doesn't pep me up, but does taste like shit now. Tastes like rotten seeds and dirt were brewed. Which is somewhat accurate. Can barely get it down, where u thought it was the best flavor EVER a year ago   Message me your pay stub/proof of employment and license and I'll help ya   Um yes. You do. I live right by the peace bridge. You say these things.   Not me   My grandpa   I think they were roxis. I called to get like 5 pills. He was in a rough spot and kinda fucked up that day and I ended up paying 2x what I wanted to spend, but getting 25 pills. He as like "do you just want my last ones?" Okayyyy   Right now he doesn't come again.   You should look into a parks job in your town. Or YMCA. You may be young but next year you could do something.    I don't train myself. I am who I am and let myself be attracted to whoever! No restraints, just intelligence.   Same with my niece. We limited the juice and changed to water or milk so she would start eating more because it filled her up. Didn't work too well. I'm worried, she hasn't grown and doesn't eat. :(  I can understand people that like feet and think they're attractive or like them being rubbed but some shit is cray.   How'd you get the job? I think bartending would be awesome and I'd be great at it but I don't drink so don't know combos and not the best conversationalist/looker. I love concoctions though and remember stuff quick!   Ooh some have raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some raise 0. Try it though, its easy to set up. I could even do it for you and the money would be sent to your account.    I hope he comes soon   Darien lake campgrounds.   Savings. Good job. I would never buy a 300k house at my age. I could buy a house but that sounds ridiculous. Around here, the nicest houses are 250k, anything above we consider luxurious and unnecessary. At this point, I dont plan on buying a house unless I plan to live there for 10+years starting a family and career. Sounds stupid to me but I'm a minimalist. Id be more than happy with a 1000ft house for 120k IF I knew I'd live their for a while.   Hey there's more than just being a vet! What do you like to do? Like, let's get to the bottom here, do you like planning? Meeting people from over the world? Entertaining? Conservation? Nature?  	65
 exactly why i want to kill myself now   i just want someone to hang out with, someone to watch films with, something real ! all i want is something real with a girl i care about, not a girlfriend not marriage just something real with a girl    thanks for giving me the same cliched answers everyone else has. i appreciate your trying to help but telling me 'it will get better' doesn't fucking help. it doesn't get better for everyone, so unless you have a crystal ball i don't want empty meaningless reassurances, sorry but I'm so fucking sick of the bullshit lines you've just fed me.    I'm just doing what the doctors have told me to do, I'm doing everything right and its really upsetting me, thats the problem all I'm plagued with now are the good memories from our relationship thats the only feeling of being content i have had so I'm constantly plagued and poisoned with thoughts of her, they tell me there called ruminating thoughts from the anxiety. its a fucking poison and all my ambitions and hope for my life, writing something that changes the world, hearing a girl say she loves me, being happy and okay with myself, not needing approval from everyone else. it all just seems like vein pipe dreams people keep telling me i'll be happy one day. well for some people it doesn't get better what if its like this for 10 years, fuck that.i don't want a life of mediocrity i'd rather die   Have depression and anxiety i've had it since i was 16-17 (I'm 21 now), i only started doing something about it in december because this is all i know so i didnt think anything was wrong, i thought everyone felt like this because i had no feeling of contentness to compare it too. got into a relationship and i still felt the same although i had some superficial happiness, i thought something must be wrong, got broken up with two days after christmas out of the blue after spending christmas with her family, my family was on holiday so i was left alone broken up with for the rest of the holidays. she lives next door and had the same circle of friends so i still had to see her everyday (i felt like this way before her so this isn't a my girlfriend broke up with me I'm so sad story) i started with counselling and medication to combat this depression started exersiing more and tried everything in the book, eventually to suicidal and tried hanging myself a bunch of time, got sent into a mental hospital for a week, got kicked out of my university house and banned from talking to all my "friends" and ex because of my 'behaviour' by which they mean my depression. now I'm left alone in a flat still suicidal, toy with the idea of killing myself every day, last night i spent 5 hours standing on a train platform trying to be brave enough to do it.   this is the edited version maybe one day i'll write a directors cut.    would be nice if someone cared i guess, i dunno, I'm not sure why i came here   i've tried 5 times now and i haven't relized i want to live. i don't want to live i quite fancy dying    why ? i'll be brave enough to do it then    I'm hoping to get drunk enough so i have the guts to follow through this time  i appreciate everyones help, i won't forget it anyway i've got a thing to do      im sick of explaining myself to people like a million times a day with no progress being made. I'm sure there ver professional but i struggle to think what words could bring me back   sure !     really fighting the urge to go outside and hang myself right now. I'm fucking begging    yeah I'm sick of being treated like a number, i understand that doctors see tons and tons of patients a day but you cant just shove any pill down my throat and tell me to be on my way   i just came here for a goodbye kind of thing, spent months talking to a billon different doctors    I've been trying everything, medication,therapy,hobbies,exercise, it doesn't change, I'm fucking so over this its beyond belief, I'm over this illness turning me into a week pathetic loser who crys uncontrollably, and cuts himself. this isn't me and its got a firm grasp on me that i cant shake off. i guess I'm posting here because i have none else to tell, all my friends have dropped me or been told toy drop me because I'm a burden, so sorry if I'm burdening you guys but fuck it. yeah i dunno bye i guess,   see you guys on the other side    Will do ! i've already contacted a club and I'm going to start in the summer, cant wait to be part of a team again, had a rough year so far    Thanks for the reassurance i appreciate it    Yep just contacted a club, man I'm excited ! thanks for the reassurance    Hey guys I'm a huge rugby fan and played through the minis up until under 15s and i'd love to get back into the game ads i've always been a fan, I'm 22 is it too late ? can i just join a club how does it work ?   Thanks    you're not bothering i just don't want to be any trouble, i really appreciate the concern, i don't want to come of as ungrateful    i've done everything they've told me too, doctors,medication,therapy,reached out to friends (lost them for it because i was 'burdening them) I'm losing the will to fight with every passing second.  I didnt come here to attention seek i apologise if it comes off like that     yep   Would anyone like to make my wordpress site look cool, I'm a writer and I'm crap at this whole website stuff anyone fancy it ?   You didnt bother me i appreciate the concern.    man I'm seeing counsellors and taking meds for years its tough    i've felt like this since i was 16 so i don't know anything else, i have no feeling of contentness to compare it to, which is the scary thing    Yep i have multiple times    i hate seeing happy couples and i hate seeing happy people because I'm lonely depressed and suicidal as fuck   calm down tommy lee    i got moved out of my university accommodation and banned from talking to my friends because the higher-ups said i was 'Burdering them' the thing about mental illness, people just don't get it    ' Then others must use violence to protect themselves'    you certainly seemed to be trying to justify this guys crime   so you think murder is okay ?    im 21 severely depressed and suicidal, and i've done everything possible medication counsellors doctors therapy.and i really don't know how much longer i can take.   please don't give me crap because I'm young    oh god don't wake an adorable baby at my expense ! and excuse my ignorance but what is an RSS feed ?       Hey everyone although i've made some enemies here and i've generally said stupid things at times, i really wanted to say thanks before i did it. anyway love this subbreddit and love everyone on here, you're all really friendly and easy to get along with and talk too, couldn't praise the subreddit any higher, anyway i don't have anyone else to thank or to say nice things too, due to this black hole I'm in and due to the nature of the illness its getting tougher and tougher, but thats neither here nor there, don't worry about my shit, i just wanted to say thanks so much for making this subbreddit awesome and thanks for putting up with me, cya   xx   Sorry i no its no excuse but i have dyslexia which makes it hard sometimes, but thanks so much for the feedback !   haha im glad :)   it made perfect sense !   benosullivanwritesstuff.wordpress.com    I feel like an asshole now, i've always been the less empathetic type when it comes to homelessness, I'm gonna try and change, man i feel like a dick   i agree with you a limit would be great. i guess it just feels cheap to me, kind of feels like this sub is being used for cheap youtube likes    what an innovate new idea !   i just don't think thats what makes this subreddit really good, i don't think youtubers posting there content hoping for cheap likes is what makes the subreddit what it is   well i like this subreddit so i wanted to share my opinion   because i think the subreddit would be a lot better off without 'work the space' videos being posted every 6 fucking seconds   i have no problem with pics or anything like that i love most of the content on here ! I'm just saying I'm not okay with the self-promotion 'heres my series give it a like and subscribe' and all that jazz, thats not good content its cheap is what it is. all i see here half the time is fucking 'work the space' videos, i mean jesus christ   I'm just giving my opinion on the matter if thats allowed. i think  a subreddit full of youtubers promoting their own videos is a good thing,  like i said just giving my opinion if thats allowed    I'm just saying i don't want a subbreddit full of people promoting their own shit    *cunt    because i don't want this subreddit to be full of people promoting their own shit, 'Hey guys i've just started a series' is that what everyone wants ?      dance yourself clean-LCD Soundsystem    I worked in the walkie talkie for a summer !   when you stop getting excited about snow and start getting annoyed by it    focus on showing it not saying it   thank you so much for caring   i mean i guess i don't know but i want to be hopeful i honestly do but I'm just not   i want to be a strong fighter but I'm weak and pathetic   why ?   i do and although they've been really sweet my friends and family are struggling to get there head round the gravity of my situation    thanks i think getting some fresh air always helps    i've felt like this for like 2 years though. I'm tired of it. i don't want to wait till I'm 30 to be happy    i've been really depressed for a few years now, and I'm sick of feeling like this everyday, its no life to lead, i don't want to fight against the currant anymore, if that makes sense. i feel like it would be better if i just let myself drown rather than fight the currant    i love telling jokes, listening to music and writing but lately i haven't found pleasure in anything    but what life is that, doing this everyday, thats no life   its gonna sound silly, but I'm 21   i cant take feeling like this for another 10 years, i cant fight the tide anymore I'm sick of it      being depressed like this for the rest of my life, 21   I'm sorry to just come here like this, makes me feel pretty selfish. i enjoy reading listening to music, watching films and telling jokes   I dunno why i'm here i guess i cant really talk to my friends or family about stuff like this, i've been selfish enough lately with the depression and stuff anyway,  this isn't an attention thing i guess i just don't want to be this unhappy anymore, i want to be happy and full of joy not feeling like this all day everyday it really sucks and i just don't want to be alive anymore, this isn't life this is no life at all. i just want to die   to be honest i never really feel like I'm beating it. it really sucks    when i let me depression get the better of me  	75
 I'm very petite, and weigh next to nothing. I don't need to lose weight, and he doesn't have a condition. We've checked...So please don't be rude.    My boyfriend has claimed he has a low sex drive recently, which is so strange for me because this has never been the case. He's always constantly wanting sex, and now he doesn't. I have tried laying around naked, wearing nice lingerie and he just doesn't stop to look. I find myself drooling over him when he walks around naked, yet he never stops to tell me I look good, or anything. I'm not very confident about my body as it is, so I am trying and I just feel ignored. Him having a low sex drive just makes me feel disgusting and extremely insecure. So how do I make.myself feel more.sexy when he isn't interested?   UPDATE: I am not overweight or underweight, he claims he is still attracted to me, and I'm not going to get rid of my long term.boyfriend over something that could be fixed...thanks..   Thanks all :)    Thanks!:)   Hi!  I'm a very anxious, and paranoid female and have been diagnosed with depression. I am taking anti depressants but I still find it hard to be wind down and relax.  Please let me know of any good methods and ideas you use/have.   Thanks :)    I've had a very low time, and I'm becoming fearful about how much longer I can live like this. Nobody around me cares about me, aside from my boyfriend but there is only so much he can do. We can't even be together during the week, and its the Times I need him. I'm not dealing so well at work, and my family do not give a shit about me. I really am struggling, and nobody seems to want to help me.   I don't know what to do anymore.    If he's a sex god, then yes. 100%.  	7

Please.   [Maddie](http://i.imgur.com/vbeOeOH.jpg) [Kitty](http://i.imgur.com/pgLh0jt.jpg) [Dexter and Max](http://i.imgur.com/VbFd51w.jpg)   Nah, you're close though   http://imgur.com/GfmTlzD  They usually look more green but   Going into my third year of Spanish. I love it, I'm planning on minoring in it in college.   I disagree with it. I'll sometimes make jokes about freshmen, but they're not serious. Honestly I try to help them out as much as I can, and be friends with them as much as I can, and make them feel accepted. It's hard being a freshman and I try to put myself in their shoes again. The most annoying thing is new sophomores making fun of freshmen.   About 1600 people, 9th to 12th grade. It's mostly either people who think they're redneck and southern or people who think they're ghetto, even though we live in the suburbs in Michigan. We just spent $2 million  that we don't have on a new football stadium for a team that won two games in three years. Our tests scores are in the 40th percentile in the state. Pretty below average.   Annamarie225/16/f  Golden retrievers and babies are the purest forms of good in the world. Also I like reading and knitting and music and robots.   Plz.   Yes! Oh my gosh I'm dumb, you're psychic. Thank you!   This might be a stretch, but there's this classic rock song that I know the rhythm of the chorus to, but I can't remember the lyrics or the name. It's really heavy rock and the chorus sounds really loud. It's one of those songs that everyone knows and has heard, like when I heard it at a dance the other day everyone was singing along. I had thought the lyrics were "You.. give me aaaaall I need" but it doesn't look like those are it. Sorry this is so vague, but it's been bothering me to no end. Thanks if anyone has any ideas.   Summer - Calvin Harris Shamelessly addicted.   Rounding to the hundredths place instead of the tenths place. Failed a test that I should have gotten 100 percent on.   I have a fear of bridges, and pretty much my advice is to just do it. Don't even think about it beforehand because you'll just psych yourself out.   Annamarie225/16/F/USA  I posted here yesterday but I only got like one person so ugh I need to procrastinate please message me ily   I'm not sure. I consider myself atheist but I read a lot about Buddhism and Buddhist teachings because I like the philosophy aspect of it.   Yeah that sounds like a bad time. Just find a public or not crazy private college that you're interested in. Do some research.   annamarie225/F/16/US  I'll talk about anything and I need to procrastinate on my book report halp   Annamarie225 16/F I'm willing to talk about whatever and I do marching band and frc and I probably like you a lot.   I've had that song on my phone for years and I still think it's incomprehensible gibberish.   PARAMORE AND FALL OUT BOY VIP TICKETS TUESDAY NIGHT   A dumb boy.   Samson - Regina Spektor (it reminds me of someone) In My Life by The Beatles and Drops of Jupiter by Train both remind me of my dad. Sigh.   Mr. Widemouth and (don't yell at me) Candle Cove are my favorites   That sounds terrifying either way though! I'm so beyond lucky that's never happened to me, lol   Hey my birthday is tomorrow! Happy birthday! Let's celebrate having almost the same birthday together!   Sleep paralysis. It can cause some awful hallucinations. My friend gets it where aliens and other weird things pull up chairs next to her bed and stars at her.    Thank you. It helped writing it out. Have a nice day!

We were perfectly fine, and we both went to bed because it was late, then the next morning he wouldn't talk to me.   Last night. I had a friend who I was talking to and cared about and shared a lot of really personal things with and now he's completely ignoring me and I don't know why. And I trusted him with all these things too.   Kik   My school has one except instead of being mean you  send in compliments about people and it anonymously posts them it's sweet actually    Vans and Converse    Boom Clap - Charli XCX. Oh my god it's so catchy.   THAT USED TO BE MY SONG IN LIKE 2009 THANK YOU SO MUCH I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT   One thing I notice is that a lot of places and people on the internet really glorify mental illness and depression and self harm. Tumblr especially doesn't shut up about how your scars are beautiful and that mental illness is just this thing for misunderstood moody teenagers. Obviously we shouldn't be criticizing people who have mental illness or have self harmed, but we make it seem like this thing that makes you unique or different or misunderstood when in reality it's awful and doesn't make you feel special. I think that might contribute to it in teenagers especially. It's glorified.   I don't. I don't think most girls do.   3,654    Cheez-its  Ew   Colours - Grouplove   Come On Eileen, Mr. Blue Sky, and Here Comes The Sun are my happy songs.

I do marching band and frc and I like books and sleeping and animals. So. Please.   That's really cute actually aw   Taller than me (not that it's difficult since I'm 5'3"), funny, preferably dark hair and dark eyes but I'm not picky, smart, puts up with being forced to listen to my music, geeky, and maybe kinda chubby. I'm not picky though tbh I take what I can get   Hey, one B won't ruin your GPA. That sucks that the stuff on the test wasn't covered in class, that's infuriating. Good luck with all your other finals though.   Northern Michigan or nothern California or Seattle. I'd love to move to a South American country but I don't like the heat, so.    I think I'm the really shy girl with the weird glasses and 8 different hand sanitizers on her purse .__.   Our team is green and black, but we don't refer to it as green, I've only heard my team refer to it as "robot green" for some reason. The whole team is really obsessed with that shade of green for some reason, the lights on our robot were that same bright green and it got us the imagery award at Waterford this year. And we adopted the team name and logo from our school, since we wanted to be integrated within the school. So the captain head is the main logo on our shirts and we incorporated it into our rebound rumble robot, also getting us the imagery award.    Here is 3098's wrap-up video from worlds. The very beginning and very end make me kinda sad and nostalgic tbh   http://youtu.be/lQ1IGKVyI30   ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING   YES. UGH. Life ruining.   We had a German exchange student at my school who was REALLY sweet and well-liked and she was pretty much great tbh   I've been listening to Straight Up by Paula Abdul for a half an hour and you can't stop me.   Oh my god. I don't even know. It's a long story and he's really difficult to read but idk. He's frustrating and I have no clue where I am with him.   IT PISSED ME OFF SO BAD THAT THE STUPID BOARD GAME SHIT WAS NEVER UPDATED.   My friend wrote a really in-depth and long thing in my yearbook. It was super sweet, and at the end it was "If I were a guy, I'd date you" with a bunch of wink faces and idk that made me laugh. The whole thing just made me stupidly happy tbh   I once failed a geometry test because I rounded to the hundredths decimal place instead of tenths.   annamarie225. 15/f. I like robots and music and marching band and cats and I'm a huge weenie  Plz   That's super cute, made my night a little happier! Congrats!!   I agree. That makes sense, and it's the first legitimately respectful comment I've gotten. Honestly, if I had realized that then I wouldn't have made the original comment. I didn't even think about that before.   Whoops, sorry I forgot that thinking that displaying racial slurs in a public place makes me "way too sensitive." My bad.  	71
 I think you're referring to the opioid AH-7921.   Super Smash Bros. Melee   Wow I'm a bit surprised nobody's recognized it yet since this is reddit and there are usually tons of CS/programmer types lurking around. But yeah I'm a software engineer.   lol I like your use of ASM in your flair.   Miralax or another laxative.   Yeah oxymorphone (Opana) is more potent than oxycodone on a mg to mg basis.   Yes, but I've only taken methylphenidate orally. I would say EPH is more euphoric then MPH but it doesn't last as long. EPH is also caustic and burns when you snort it, which is a good enough reason for me to moderate my use and keep my sinuses from getting too damaged.   I'd say ethylphenidate is the closest you're going to get to coke in the RC market. It's an NDRI that gives a decent rush when snorted.   I've vaped it off aluminum foil with a lighter and a straw. Bit of a waste but it works so I can't complain.   I noticed your username, have you tried vaping 3-fluorophenmetrazine? It's a nice rush but very short lived. I really like it.   Yeah I think it popped up in November on the RC market. In my experience 20mg snorted provides brief euphoria that gives way to 2-3 hours of functional stimulation. Less euphoria than EPH but I noticed less vasoconstriction as well. Similar burn to EPH when you snort it. May be caustic. Also, people have reported being pleased with how it vapes off foil and gives a pleasant rush. Personally I wouldn't vape more than 5-10mg though.      For reference I have a moderate to low stimulant tolerance. Remember that RCs can affect everyone differently, so start small with dosing if you get your hands on some. Check out the 3F-phenmetrazine thread on Bluelight for more info :)   Jesus OP please don't follow this advice. Please don't give out dosage advice for substances that you aren't familiar with, especially a substance as unpredictable as heroin. Nobody should be doing more than 5-10mg at a time snorted without a tolerance, and that should only be after snorting ~1mg to test potency. Heroin has the potential to be cut with the opioid fentanyl, which is active in microgram doses and can significantly increase the risk of CNS depression. Even when taking dosing precautions such as these, you're still playing with fire and I don't recommend it. Stay safe, you can always take more but you can never take less.   I would say low dose ethylphenidate complements alcohol well, as well as 3-fluorophenmetrazine. I feel that their short durations allow you to fall asleep more easily at the end of the night than you would if you were on amphetamines.      I tend to start with a small dose (~20mg) early in the night and redose one or two times throughout depending on how much I drink.   edit: added dosage in case people are curious   I've only read about it but people seem to compare it to meth. I'm interested in your thoughts on that. Also what dosage did you take and which ROA?   I'm an atheist, but if there is a god then he's probably pretty angry with me for all of my hedonistic pursuits.   Very jealous, hope you enjoy it. What quantity did you get/how much was it?   Holy shit 600mg oxy at once? Can you elaborate more on your tolerance?   You sound angry, maybe you should do some dope.   My understanding is that if the final product of the diacetylmorphine hcl synthesis is washed well enough then it will smell less like vinegar. The vinegar smell is from a chemical leftover from the synthesis.      Good looks man that's an amazing trade. IR's too! Enjoy!   Hi there. I'm counting down the days til im able to cop a g of ECP for $80. Two weeks left til my guy comes back from vacation. I'm an occasional user since I've managed to convince myself that using more than twice a month will ruin my life :) All the dope porn on this sub keeps me happy while I wait to cop. Hope you're well OP!   Thanks for the replies everyone. I've decided to try 0.5mg with the subs next time. I'll have people around in case something goes wrong.   Hi /r/opiates, I've been lurking for a while and now I have a question.       I have a few 24mg suboxones that I've been chopping into 16ths and snorting. This gets me pretty relaxed. I find subs pretty recreational during my breaks from H but I use infrequently. I'm looking to try clonazepam at the same time but I'm not sure what dosage I should start with. I'm aware that mixing benzos and opiates can be fatal. Cheers!   oooh shit hydromorph contins   You could cut up some lines and scrape them into little baggies, then when you want to snort it take a small straw and snort it straight from inside the baggie. Very fast and discrete way to do a line.   I agree with your once a month sentiment, it's been working pretty well for me so far. I've found that the best part about using opiates once a month is how your tolerance essentially resets after waiting so long.   Oh I see. Tolerance is a bitch. I'm a very infrequent user, so "not feeling it" has never been an issue (except if I get really shitty H). Stay safe.   	28
 You've written in all caps so it *must* be true.    No problem, I'm getting jealous at all the options you have in the US. In the UK only a humanist celebrant, registrar or priest can marry you as far as I know.  I found [a link](http://humanist-society.org) to the Humanist Society in America, hopefully there's a celebrant in your area which gives you another option.   As a fellow bride with a strained relationship with my father - he won't even be coming to the wedding - I can see where your concern is coming from and massive Internet hugs to you.  Would a possible compromise be, as someone else suggested I'm sure, having your DJ play a song dedicated to your FH and FMIL but have the dance floor open to everyone? This would allow them to have their dance to a song of their choosing without the implications of a spotlight dance.   UK here, we're hoping to have a humanist celebrant marry us. We have to become a member of the humanist society for 2 years prior to the wedding  (they offer a package for engaged couples). Humanist ceremonies are much more personal than a traditional registrar and as FH and I are both atheists and marrying in an observatory it felt fitting.

 I've been seeing a girl for the last few months who is absolutely amazing, and who's caught me off guard. We've been dating casually knowing that I'll be moving away to go to university on the other side of the country. We've only been seeing each other for two months, but I've really started to develop feelings for her that I didn't expect, and she feels the same way. Also her friends are great people who I'd really like to get to know better and I fit into their group very well (something that I often don't find easily)  I took a year off of university because I was dealing with depression and needed time to live at home and recollect myself before moving back to where I was going to university. Moving back to where I was going to school feels like it's the adult decision for me. It's me taking control of my life again and taking responsibility for myself. There are also a lot of great opportunities at the university that I'm going to that I wouldn't have if I stayed in the city I'm living in now (scholarships, professors that are invested in me, academic publishing, social contacts, etc.)  I planned on moving away before we started dating, but she and I really connect and I have some very serious affection for her. She's always known since the very start that there was a good chance I'd be moving away and that we'd only date for a few months. Also with the idea that we'd work hard to remain friends after I go back to university.   There are some problems though if I stayed. First and foremost she's christian and I'm an agnostic, which is a problem for her. There would be problems in the long run because being in a long term relationship with someone who isn't religious could be a dealbreaker for her. Secondly, and related, she's a virgin and I am not, and because of her religious convictions I would feel bad about taking her virginity even she wanted to at the time. I've sexually escalated things with her (making out and being physical. both of which are new to her). Not being able to have sex with her would be a problem for me. That being said, knowing her, if we were to go forward with a long term committed relationship I think she'd be open to having sex. I wouldn't pressure her to go outside of what she's comfortable with, but sex is important for me in a relationship.  She's amazing, definitely very serious long-term girlfriend material. I'm really debating just dropping my plans and staying for her, because that's what I feel I want to do, but I know that in the long run going back to my university on my own gives me so much opportunity to succeed and grow. I really care about her and want to make sure she's okay when I go, and I'd be lying if I said part of me doesn't want to stay.   What's your opinion, is it worth it to drop my plans to stay with a girl who I'm starting to have very serious feelings for? Or is it better that we go our separate ways, stay friends, and both look at our dating as a learning experience?  TL;DR: Unexpectedly developed a relationship with an amazing girl while taking a year off university, now that I'm going back I'm having some serious reservations about leaving. Should I consider dropping my plans to pursue a relationship, or is it better that I just let it go?   EDIT: I should just say that if I stayed in the city I'm currently living in that I'd continue my education here, it just wouldn't offer me the same opportunities that I might have if I move.     The mind's eye one is still broken, I just did it and scored a 4, when I've done similar tests with similar pictures and scored much higher.    I'm a writer and a musician. I used to write short stories and was working on a novella, but because of anxiety and depression I have a hard time creating new characters and imagining what they look like. I still write, but for that last year I've written only poetry, because I can create an emotion or a thought and don't have to create a person.    When my anxiety was at its worst I got into the habit of humming to myself when I thought no one was listening.    Yeah poetry has always been a fascination with mine. Lately I've been reading Rainer Maria Rilke, and I'd recommend him to anyone interested in poetry, especially on this subreddit.    I'm sure you know this, but most NT people don't usually follow those if there's no immediate reason to do so either. Most people don't follow arbitrary rules if there is no reason to. Lots of NT people would jaywalk if there were no cars coming (depending on the street of course) for instance.   The angst and sorrow are much too familiar for me. It might be an INFJ thing that we don't actually grow out of those feelings, but grow into and around them.    I have the same problem and am finding that writing every day yes helping me come up with and articulate thoughts better.   He seems like a good example of an unhealthy infj   I think Gandalf is the more INFJ of the two, but I'll certainly throw in my lot and say those characters have a lot of INFJ qualities.   Here's a quote from Andrei Tarkovsky's film Stalker, that I've always felt described music (and my feelings toward music) in a beautiful way.    "Are you awake? You were talking recently about the meaning... of our... life... unselfishness of art... Let's take music... It's really least of all connected; to say the truth, if it is connected at all, then in an idealess way, mechanically, with an empty sound... Without... without associations... Nonetheless the music miraculously penetrates into the very soul! What is resonating in us in answer to the harmonized noise? And turns it for us into the source of great delight... And unites us, and shakes us? What is its purpose? And, above all, for whom? You will say: for nothing, and... and for nobody, just so. Unselfish. Though it's not so... perhaps... For everything, in the end, has its own meaning... Both the meaning and the cause..."   Yeah for MBTI I usually test an an INFJ but I've shown up as an INFP a few times.   More or less. I think the social functions of both are very different.    I've been getting a lot of comments in this thread assuming that I can't make general small talk. That's why I tried to preface what I was saying by mentioning that I'm fine with everyday conversation. I don't drag people into deeper conversations, and very rarely begin them because I know that I'm very analytical in them. Maybe I didn't write that clearly enough. I would never hijack someone else's conversation, and I know when it is and isn't appropriate to talk about certain things. I think you assume that I'm someone who forces intellectual conversation on others whenever I open my mouth, but that's not the case.   As far as I can see, intellectual conversations are a level removed from everyday emotion based conversations. It's hard for me to see how an intellectual conversation could be separated from any hint of debate, even people with similar beliefs will disagree on some issues. I don't understand people who think they can lightly engage a topic like politics or philosophy.    That's where my problem is I can't see most intellectual conversation as regular conversation. Everyday chit chat is how you get to know people better, deep conversation is the trading of ideas. Chit chat is about participation, intellectually engaging conversation is about ideas.    Lately I feel like I'm starved of intellectual conversation. All day I participate in small talk, I talk about all kinds of things, I don't have too much of a problem, but I find deeper conversation much much more engaging. This is not to blow my own horn but to give context. I've always performed far above average academically, and have scored well into the gifted category on professionally administered IQ tests.   The difference between my small talk and my intellectual conversation is night and day for me. I enjoy small talk. Talking about light interests, each other, places to go, things to eat, cracking jokes, I like it a lot; it's how you get to know someone better. On the other hand, deeper conversations on politics, morals, ethics, philosophy, literature, history, and science when I'm talking about the concepts and not just what's in the news is often another a whole other situation. I get very intense in these sort of conversations and I don't really know how to turn it off. It's not that I want to be right, but that when talking about these things I always want to dig deeper, and more often than not the other person or people don't want to. I feel like I do this because I almost never get to engage about these things in a meaningful way and when I do I try to keep the conversation alive for far too long. I don't have these conversations often outside of my family and very close friends, so it's not as though I'm badgering acquaintances with these conversations. I get over invested in intellectual conversation and it often makes me feel foolish when I try to keep a conversation about an intellectual topic going.   What can I do to stop being too engaged in these sorts of conversations?   It's quite the odd thing to feel like an extrovert sometimes, even when you're not.  I know I prefer small conversation oriented groups,  and to be able to contrast that with how I can be at large gatherings is something a lot of people wouldn't guess about me.   It's definitely something that is a balancing act that I haven't totally figured out yet. I find that I especially try to adapt the sense of humor of a group, which can be difficult and awkward.   I'd recommend some Albert Camus, and Nietzsche. I know they are two very different philosophers, but Nietzsche gives a good explanation of why things are the way they are, and Camus' philosophy gives ideas on how to live with it.   I feel the exact same way. It's a confusing paradigm, and I'm still not too sure what to think of it. When I go to parties I often become the center of it, because it almost feels like I pick up on the "group feel" and adapt to it, but as soon as I'm away from the circumstance I go back to my own self. Sometimes I feel very out of touch with who I am.   Yea I have an intuitive (and sometimes annoying) ability to slip into the mannerisms of other people. I've been finding it very frustrating and a little distressing lately, because sometimes I feel that my own personality is "overwritten" by anyone else I interact with. It's something that I try to stay mindful of.   When I'm participating in a group I intuitively change my behaviour to fit in better with a group. The problem with this is I begin to lose my own identity inside of a group dynamic. I'll be honest that I have self-esteem issues, and that that is a certainly a big part of the problem. Every time I'm in a new group I subconsciously conform(sometimes unsuccessfully) to their behaviour instead of adding my own to the dynamic.   How do I maintain my own identity and add it to groups instead of conforming to theirs?   Tonight I was out with my friend and their friends, we were laughing having a good time, and really we having great conversation. One of them pointed out that I fit into their group like I'd always been there. Anyway we had really long conversations about a lot of different things and I participated in all them very well and with no trouble, but I couldn't think of things to talk about myself.   I seem to draw a complete blank when it comes to generating new conversation topics, or being able to change a conversation to a new topic. This is something I really need to get better at because I like talking to people, and am pretty good at it, but I just can't come up with new things to say, in fact I get a lot of anxiety trying to figure out something new to talk about. I can jump from someone else's last topic, but I can't start a conversation to save my life.  What can I do to get better at generating conversation topics and engaging people with them? I seem to do just fine in conversation outside of that, but I just can't seem to start my own topics.    Yeah definitely. I think the thing that I've been trying to do with "noun-ing" is going for things that dig a little deeper into their personality. It's a great way of finding conversation topics, and it's helped a lot with keeping conversations going.   I'm glad that my conversations are getting some flow to them. It was something that was really lacking, but it's getting better. I'm trying to work on getting a little more out of my comfort zone and "leading" conversations, but I've got lots of things I need to work on. Thanks   Today I went out for lunch with a friend, and the conversation went pretty well except that it went into some strange topics that left both of us wondering how we'd brought up that topic. We were at a restaurant and having a conversation about rats (not the most appropriate conversation to have where people are eating). We were talking about what kind of animals we'd seen or had lived around, she brought up mice, and then I told a story about the cat sized rats that lived near the harbor of a city I used to live in. It was a little weird and left us both asking how the conversation had gone in that direction. I  What're some good skills to work on when trying to change topics, or segue into something more interesting?   I just want to say that, for the most part, we're in the same boat. I've tested as being "gifted", I've had friends who are in art school tell me I should model, and I have many talents and interests (play three instruments, write, competitive sports, reading, cooking) and yet I have little faith in myself. It's been hard trying to gain confidence. I have a lot of reason to be confident, but it's almost as though I can't convince myself.   I hope that you find out the trick to unlocking that confidence. Changing your own perceptions is one of the hardest things you can do but it's well worth it. Best of luck.    I quit games and started my self-improvement project. Whenever I don't know what I should be doing I either start reading (I've written a long reading list), go to the gym, or ask people if they want to do something. Setting goals for myself and identifying what I want really helped me to fill my time.   Thanks for the response, those are some good responses and I'll try to play up that sort of response in the future.    I think keeping a straight facial expression and not acknowledging the teasing would make you look like you can't take a joke. How could you seem dominant without looking like you have no sense of humor?  	30

It was a coping mechanism originally from my childhood that just never left.  It is sad at times, I do get attached to characters and end up feeling even more lonely when reality hits me.  I'd like to be able to learn to live in reality but it seems so impossible  ):   *Dysfunctional high five!*  Lol hi there.  It somehow makes me feel better that there is somebody else experiencing this.  Sometimes I get way too centric in my own world haha   I do have regrets of having given up on so many things, I just don't even know how to stick with something at this point.  Art is pretty much the only thing I ever keep in my life, but I frequently give up on those projects and such because of apathy.  I'd rather have learned to play the piano, something more exciting like that could probably keep my attention?  I dunno haha.

 Hate to break it to you but my english is at the most par. My writing is shit. I am not creative enough. I think read something similar to my post sometime ago and stole the layout.

 But... It does. When you say "overlap" it just sounds like a duplication of features when it is simply not the case, if they have different implementations then they will break and neither gravity box's nor the ROMs implementation of that particular feature will work (see: quick settings on omnirom)   An alternative is to use light flow, it can do this for you and then you can use any messaging app you want.    ...well, yeah. You were the one that said that it won't "interfere" with the ROM, I was just pointing out that it will (and thereby do more than just "overlap")   Well... Yeah it does. It broke omniroms quick settings before the gravity box dev added an option to disable tweaks individually. And if you install it on cm and enable pie controls in both it breaks that. Its really only meant for stock.    That's because they strip a lot of stuff though. Factory images for nexus devices are typically 400mb+   No, it really is that bad. As a non-american I notice at least 2 carrier posts on the front page at any given time. I simply down vote and hide them but it is somewhat annoying - it makes as much sense as posting about ISPs in /r/windows or /r/Linux since that's how they access the internet.    I think the problem with that is that there are some girls that will offer to pay for things but expect you to not let them do so, and if you don't you're not being a gentleman. (or perhaps I've just been going on dates with shitty girls)   How does using a different ROM affect the screen?   The point is, the exploit they "burned" was one that many jailbreak developers used to find other, more difficult to discover vulnerabilities, since the exploit was apparently a very easy one that has worked on every iOS version since comex discovered it. Now that they've used it, it will be patched, causing any and all jailbreak efforts from here on in to take a significantly longer amount of time. You're probably right about them sitting on an exploit until iOS 8 or 8.1, but the problem is that now, they may not even find an exploit in 7.1 to sit on until 8, meaning the community will have to wait much longer. This also affects all future iterations of iOS, not just 7.1 and 8.   Question: how did the photographer get such a paper-thin dof?

He probably had a legitimate reason to fall over, I really doubt there was a sni-   I had this problem for ages on my old Samsung device. I wiped my phone, flashed new firmware on my router, did everything I could but it consistently happened. A data wipe would fix it for a bit but it would simply happen again. The only way I was able to fix it was using an app called Mac Changer, which changes your device's MAC ID so your router thinks it's a different device. Every time the obtaining IP address thing happened I'd generate a new Mac address and it would work for another day or so. Only thing is, the app requires root.    Omnirom nightlies with Gravitybox is an awesome experience. Been rocking them for a while with no issues.    Didn't they say that when 4.4 dropped though? They probably just hid it again.    Not sure but it probably would have been a smarter idea to cover all your bases before just giving up.   Did you make sure that /system was mounted in recovery? Do you have the latest version of your recovery and supersu? These are all things to check.    "away"   I've been using a combination of Omnirom and Xposed modules for things like Quicksettings customisation and lockring targets and its working quite well, you should give it a go.   All of them. Omnirom are focusing on their original features (namely active display and their new incoming call screen) before they start porting over the more common ones. This means that features you have come to expect from custom roms (since they are in almost all of them) are not present, such as lockring targets and quicksettings customisation. In the mean time, I'm using Xposed with Gravitybox to bring those features to my device. Active Display alone is worth flashing for.   No.   Yeah xhalofloatingwindow can do this.    Search parameters work on YouTube:  "Song name -cover -acoustic"   Just FYI: you can hide people from appearing in your news feed. Just go to their profile, clicks the "friends" button and untick "show in news feed" from the drop down options.    Official nightlies haven't dropped but they are actively working on the KitKat branch (CM11) so anyone can build for their own device. There are heaps of unofficial builds on xda, just have a look around, but I'd suggest euroskank's KitKang - it has a bunch of cherry picks and customizations that aren't found in other builds.    Uhh, are you aware that that's a downgrade? 4.4 - 4.3 will probably mean that the radio and possibly bootloader won't work, so you'll have to downgrade those first. You can do this by flashing the 4.3 factory image.   Its a separate activity in the same app. Its the same way that g+ used to have an icon for messenger even though it was just apart of g+.    Tasker?   you have to have stock recovery to install OTAs. TWRP is what is causing the issue.   Gravity box.    I remember having many nights like this with my ex girlfriend, its a connection that runs so deep and something that I will never forget. That feeling of someone truly getting you and you getting them, it's indescribable. I'm in tears now because I am so afraid of never having that ever again. I miss it so much.    Best bet is to flash the [factory image](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#occamkrt16s). This will get you a working device on the latest possible stock.   I think Cataclysm   Omnirom have this.   People are more likely to come to reddit with issues than "everything is fine" posts. Its a vocal minority - the update is fine.   Because Android runs on all sorts of hardware, its difficult to write native code that will play nicely on all the devices its available to. So, to combat this, Android ships with a VM - the Dalvik VM. This means that developers can write their apps in Java which are then translated into native code on the fly for the device. This extra compatibility comes at a cost: performance. ART is Google's effort to help lower that cost and increase performance. Instead of compiling the apps at runtime, ART completely pre-compiles all the apps on your phone (theoretically) making them faster to launch.  ^ this is a very basic understanding and something that could have been Googled.   It has new more original features than other Roms but not any of the ones you've gotten used to (quick settings   lock screen customization for one). Will definitely be keeping an eye on nightly progress though.    Yeah I think its more likely that people are going feature phone - android phone than iPhone - android.    **THE LIBRARY**   This is already implemented in a bunch of 4.4 ROMs, and has been for a while.   Apex and Nova both offer this feature.   This was on the front page of reddit yesterday.    You have to be rooted.   There is a noticeable performance increase. It's marginal, but still there.   I've got it working with Advanced Reboot Menu (CM doesn't come with reboot to recovery or bootloader options, which I use a lot), but a lot of the modules don't work properly since a lot has changed in AOSP.   It's a framework that hooks into the Android system files that allow the changing of those files on the fly (versus flashing or overwriting the files for individual mods). This has many benefits such as ease of use, and increased mod compatibility - such as two different mods that make changes to systemui - instead of having to choose between the two mods (since installing one on top of the other will only make the last-installed one active) they can now be implemented side-by-side.   4.4 brings systemwide emoji    The issues TWRP had with flashing 4.4 ROMs have been fixed in the latest version (2.6.3.3).   Just FYI that's a 4.3 build.   Currently on [gearheadcustoms' CM11 build](http://fitsnugly.euroskank.com/?rom=cm11 device=mako). Has pretty much all the features I was missing from 4.3 ROMS (customisable quick settings, lock ring   nav ring targets, hold back to kill app - to name a few) and very quick with ART enabled. Haven't run into any issues thus far.   Try clearing data for Snapchat maybe? I was having frequent crashes on 4.3 but since updating to 4.4 I haven't had a single one (and I use snapchat every day).   http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2527806   We'd rather have Abbott fight climate change.    To receive the ota update you have to be 100% stock (stock ROM, stock recovery, unrooted). I don't see PA pushing a build anytime inside a month tbh.       There is no such thing as group SMS. Group SMS is always an MMS.    Has anyone tried cataclysm? My friend is running it on his n5 but I'm not sure if its worth trying out on the n4 since the dev doesn't actually have the device.    Everything is pretty bare bones at this stage in the game, however, I found slimkat to be a little bit laggy in comparison to the others.    Running 4.4 and I am unable to reproduce this bug.    You can't post a text post and a link at the same time, if that's what you're trying to do.    There are quite a few kitkat ROMs already (well, for the N4 anyway) and you have to realize that the majority of Kitkat talk is coming from Nexus 5 users, of which there are quite a lot in this sub.   Purity now has a 4.4 release. :)   Ok.    You can't unless you are rooted or running a custom ROM. Transparent notification bar and nav bar are 4.4 features that the GEL takes advantage of, not the other way around.    Downgrading from 4.4 to 4.3 requires you downgrade the radio, otherwise WiFi stops working.    It's an experimental feature that hasn't been fully fleshed out. **You are going to have issues.** Disable it.    I think there is a HTC device called G2.    Not the factory image. When someone uploads the OTA .zip you'll be able to sideload it. Lurk around XDA, it will surely be posted there soon.   You cannot send and receive MMS on Google Voice unless the MMS is sent from a T-mobile number.   Its an intentional design decision. The circle isn't meant to be in the center because of other icons that go around it http://www.imgur.com/cpZuWGL.png   Crashes on N4 when I hold both. If I just hold the app drawer and tap an app it simply opens the app.    No. You will still have to use Google voice. Do not remove the app.    You can't.    Try changing it to another language and then back to us English.    A factory reset won't touch anything on the sdcard or internal (user) storage. It only wipes /data, so the only thing you lose is apps.    Can't change a link after its posted, just post the fixed link in the comments.    Make sure the version corresponds with your android version.    I use Common Sense 2013. Its free and doesn't come with any toolbars or nonsense.    Nothing that happens to you before 30 matters, in the grand scheme of things; it just doesn't. The sooner teens and 20 somethings accept that, the better off they will be, and the less suicides and depression will occur.  While I agree with you somewhat, let me also tell you why I disagree with you invalidating the way people feel as well. Life is proportional... as you get older, things that may have previously seemed huge to you are not quite as big. This is simply because you have experienced more. Take this [crudely made pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/U59ok5I.png). Say you've been in a relationship for 3 years. For an 18 year old, it is *proportionally* larger than what it would be for a 30 year old. That relationship ending, if we were to scale it, would feel the same way it would for a 30 year old to lose a relationship of ~5 years. It's a bit poorly explained, but hopefully you do get where I'm going with that.  The point is, just because things are insignificant to you does not mean that the validity and strength of the feelings that a person experiences is not real. I say this because at 18 years old, I have been through a bit of shit. And maybe it's trivial. Looking back now, I can see that what was going on was stupid and dumb, but hindsight is always like that. If I could go back to my past self and try to explain it, I wouldn't listen. The vastness of my feelings wouldn't go away because I told myself that it was insignificant (I even did so at the time).  So; I do agree with you. But you should never, ever invalidate someone's feelings. Because that will cause more suicides than people "taking what they go through far, far too seriously".   Ahh posted this before I saw your comment. Such a moving song.   "I held on as tightly as you held on to me." ;-;   [The Cinematic Orchestra - To Build A Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB0ordd2nOI feature=player_detailpage)  tears, every time.   The Play Store version won't be 2.0. Reinstall the .apk you have. Google rolls out big updates like this slowly based on your device's IMEI and country, so not everyone gets 2.0 at the same time (even though the app's description says so).  Edit: to understand, go to hangouts in the play store, expand the description and look at the current version. Mine is still 1.2 ( http://www.imgur.com/6kLfCTf.png )   Have you tried reflashing the 4.3 factory images? Might be a bit of a pain but if you could get everything back to 100% stock it might fix your problem.   You did something wrong then. Whenever you flash a ROM, it always comes with a kernel, because otherwise it wouldn't boot (well, it might, but ROMs always come with a kernel that the developers KNOW is compatible to ensure that it actually boots). Franco kernel doesn't even support 4.4 yet, so if you actually did have it on 4.4, you would either not be able to boot or see a shit tonne of graphical glitches.   No, as in, you don't have to do anything special. When you flash the ROM (in fact, any ROM - even the same one) the files that xposed modifies get overwritten.   No.    I don't really understand how I'm biased... I made the decision to get a Nexus 4, and part of the consideration was the softkeys. I previously used a Galaxy S II for a year, and when I compare the two, I much prefer the softkeys. I could have chosen any number of other smartphones available.   My university has a similar implementation and my device (Nexus 4) has no issues with jumping from AP to AP.    I don't really understand the question.    And how exactly would you know what other phones I have had? I had a galaxy s2 before my n4 and it had hardware keys, and I much prefer onscreen ones. Especially since my home button needed a push so hard I was blistering my thumb from extended use.    Well... Yeah. Because you already have hardware keys. Hardware + software keys at the same time don't make sense.   While I agree with many of the points you made, I think that a lot of people in this thread are jumping to conclusions. I think its a safe assumption to make that Google were rushed with the nexus 5 release, and have only had the resources to get KitKat optimized for the nexus 5. I'm not going to promise to eat my dick but I'd bet good money that the factory images that drop for the nexus 4 will start with 4.4.1.    What code are you talking about?   It didn't do nothing, he just didn't reach it in time.    Because the official app was released, it met my needs and I felt more comfortable giving them my account info since it was 1st party.    As far as I'm concerned, content-aware fill is black magic.    My only opinion of women as a whole is that I will never understand them. Everything else is on a girl-by-girl basis.    Not gonna lie, that looks absolutely delicious.    With the sizes of screens these days, does it really matter that such a tiny % of the screen is taken up with software buttons? I've had my Nexus 4 for about 4 months now and never have I thought "Gee, I wish I didn't have onscreen buttons so I could have about 40 more vertical pixels"... There's plenty of room on the screen.  	110
 Thats a great idea but do you think a rug could be made with 200 yds?   A little while ago i purchased 2 skeins of Loops  Threads T-shirt yarn in some natural colors and I have no idea what I want to make with it! It is bulky yarn, I was thinking a simple hat but wanted to know if anyone had any ideas if they've used this yarn before or have seen some great ideas. All i can find is loosely knit cowls and hats and dont like the very loose look. Ravelry only has a few projects, and most of them are crochet. Any and all ideas are welcome! Thanks :)   I never even thought about this - it would make life so much easier. Thanks! That will give me a clearer idea of how the gusset is progressing as well   Thank you! You're right, the thumb looked a bit iffy to me but i didn't take that into consideration. Ill knit it out, and if turns out wrong, try formatting my pattern better.   Thank you for the reply! I apologize for the wall of text, i see its way too long and not going to attract anyone, but you did give me some very useful information about gussets. Thank you. Just one question - it wont look disproportional if theres say 70 stitches on the body of the glove and 60 (at least) after the gusset? It seems strange to me but i guess I'll go with the flow and how im interpreting this pattern. Thanks, and I'll remember to try to keep to a more simplistic style of explanation next time. :)   I need some fellow knitters' awesome advice and help please - I started knitting the Sweet Life mittens I found on Ravelry a little while ago. Having never done a gusset in my life before (I've only been knitting scarves and hats), I'm having trouble trying to decode this pattern. Here is the original pattern for the left hand gusset that the author wrote (keep in mind the patterned part is only on the top, there is ribbing underneath, and I'm knitting in the round):  Left Mitt Gusset Knit in pattern to last 2 K sts, move marker to this spot. Increase two sts between the final 2 sts by picking up the stitch below and knitting into the front and back of that stitch. Knit in pattern for two rounds. At the third round continue pattern, Slip marker. Kfb the next stitch, knit across gusset and kfb the last stitch in the round. You will continue in this manner, increasing 2 sts every third round, until you have 12sts in your gusset. Knit one round in pattern. At the end of the round remove the gusset sts to waste yarn. In the space left by the gusset sts, CO 6 sts. Knit 2 rounds in pattern. On the third round K2tog after Marker and again for the last two sts in round. Continue in this manner decreasing 2 stitches every third row until you are back to the original (36, 48) stitch count. Knit in pattern until 7.5 inches long.  So I have attempted to write this in an easier form for myself, row by row. Here is the majority of my attempt:  left gusset pattern written out: 1: repeat #2, last two knit stitches in pattern, move marker HERE. increase between next two stitches 2 stitches by m1 and kfb that stitch 2: repeat #3 3: repeat #4, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 4: repeat #5 5: repeat #6 6: repeat #7, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 7: repeat #8 8: repeat #9 9: repeat #10, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 10: repeat #11 11: repeat #12 12: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 13: repeat #2  14: repeat #3 15: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 16: repeat #5 17: repeat #6 18: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 19: repeat #8  20: repeat #9 21: repeat #10 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 22: repeat #11 24: repeat #12 25: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 26: repeat #2 27: repeat #3 28: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 29: repeat #5 30: repeat #6 31: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 32: repeat #8, slip gusset sts on waste yarn and cast on 6 sts in empty space 33: repeat #9 34: repeat #10 35: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 36: repeat #12 37: repeat #1 38: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 39: repeat #3 40: repeat #4 41: repeat #5, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 42: repeat #6 43: repeat #7 44: repeat #8, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 45: repeat #9 46: repeat #10 47: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 48: repeat #12 49: repeat #1 50: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round  I have no idea if I'm doing this right. If any of you more experienced knitters could help me out on this, I would greatly appreciate your expertise! Also if you spot anything else in my "redone" pattern that looks a little wrong, feel free to let me know. It just seems like the whole gusset and actual body of the mitten would be so unproportional (lol is that a word even?)  Here is a link to the Sweet Life pattern: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sweet-life A link to my project page (has my improvised pattern in the notes): http://www.ravelry.com/projects/test_subject380597/sweet-life  Thank you thank you thank you!!!    	6
 I'm 5 years older than my younger sister, and when she was born I could never really grasp the concept that she had severe mental retardation. My parents always said she was "special", but I was too young to understand. I grew up loving and caring for her and I doted on her. She was too mentally retarded to walk or talk, and only communicated by pulling hair.   Fast forward and at this point I'm now a middle schooler who is ashamed and embarrassed of her own sister. I refuse to let my friends come over and rarely ever talk about my sister even though she was the light of my life, I cared more about fitting in. I constantly used the word "retarded" even though it made me uncomfortable knowing thats what people would call my sister.   One day, the first time I brought a friend to my house to hang out, they saw my sister and called her a "disgusting retarded freak" and she started to cry. I was distraught ag seeing her cry and being FULLY AWARE of peoples opinions and what they said about her. I kicked my friend out and hugged my sister for a full hour.   After that, I realized that my sister isn't something to be ashamed of. She's my best friend, and to this day she will always be the love and light of my life.    As a high school senior who was accepted into UNC and is a NC native...this is why I declined my acceptance.    I've heard her acoustic version of Yellow Flicker Beat and it was beautiful! She is seriously gifted because her pipes are amazing   Many people say Royals is a pos song and that her voice is too "dark" to be a pop singer and that she has no clue how to dance. Let the girl do what she wants! She's awesome.   In my area (the southern states) everyone's like "LORDE? more like GAY! Jason Aldean is more pop than her!"   As you can see, my highschool is full of 6th graders hahah   Lorde. Everyone always shits on her but I find her music to be very catchy   Kinder surprise eggs!   wow, thats so sad to hear. how are you holding up?   i wish that you have all the icecream and sad movies in the world to cheer you up!   Added! Snapchat is princess-kawaii   Went to the doctor on Monday and she said it didnt seem like an infection, just severely irritated. She took preventative measures and prescribed me 3 day antibiotics and a saline solution. So far the swelling has gone down to almost normal but it still looks a bit pink/red. So far so good, though :)   i never thought of the post being too short. i havent changed it since i got my nose pierced, thanks for the advice!    OK, I will look into making an appointment. Will icing it and applying tea tree oil and taking an anti-inflammatory help until I can get an appointment? I really dont want to have to remove my piercing    Nope. I've kept it a stud for work related reasons, and the jewelry has remained the same (and its good quality).    I had my nose pierced about 4 months ago, and up until yesterday my nose had been healing fine. Yesterday I woke up from a nap and saw that my nose was HUGE and tender to the touch. I applied ice for about 15 minutes every hour or so. I applied Tea tree oil at night and when I woke up my nose was only a little better... Now the stud is sinking into my skin and I don't know what caused this. I don't think its an infection because I don't have any secretions or crustiness. Its just really red, swollen and hot to the touch. Should I still apply ice and tea tree oil to help soothe my piercing?   Advice is VERY welcome!!      I met Ian Watkins at a lostprophets M G. He was super creepy, and kept trying to lure me away from my mom (I was 14 at the time, so she wouldn't let me go alone)  It was really making me uncomfortable so I left to talk to the other members, and he called me a "slut" to my face :(   Needless to say, I still love their music but I'm glad that asshat is in jail.    Nightmare and the Cat- Alvarado   Go for it! It would be awesome regardless :)    Downvoted because youre ugly and that lipstick is too red   I would like to think 5 feet is short   I think I love you.   My sides are burning hahahaha   No its not a hairclip. The photographer added it in PhotoShop, but your idea is actually really good!   Haha nope!

 'Matthew 5:17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.' The new testament by no means conveniently invalidates the old testament, Jesus fully supports the old testament and often refers to it.    How about Ericsson, HM, Skype, Spotify, Soundcloud, TicTail, Electrolux (the worlds second largest home appliances manufacturer), AstraZeneca..? on top of your IKEA and Volvo. When you take population size into account Stockholm is one of the most entrepreneurial cities on the planet. The rich are taxed highly, but still have luxury lifestyles and the highest standard of living in the world, and the money is spent responsibly to help the poor and unconnected become successful too instead of leaving them out in the cold.    Nope. Carlin is right. IQ tests use 100 as the *median* score. Half are above, half are below.  	3
 Since when did Jupiter have a blue atmosphere?   These threads are a welcome break from the "DAE Roman Reigns is bad for main event?"   hafr jlus bjrnsson (the mountain actor) would be a sight to see in the ring   To add to this anecdote, I used to work in telecomm, working on hydro (power in Canada) lines for the local power companies. While my own company is fairly small and was all guys, the power company was this monolithic public corporation, yet some of the supers were explaining to me they were having a hard time hiring anyone because (a) half of the population (women) never apply for anything but office jobs and (b) graduating college kids with engineering degrees don't want to work in some middle-of-nowhere city.   These jobs pay a metric fuck ton with amazing benefits AND union support. You practically have an amazing job for life, yet no one wants to work on substations in Farmville Canada.

FFXIV has a better end-game for its PvE raids, but that's about it   GW2   A temp   Actually, most polls and studies I have seen show most gamers being in their late-20s to mid-30s, not teenagers.   If you just want to level fast, get on an eye of the mist "karma train." I leveled two characters to 80 from 20 with birthday boosts. /age on each is 22 hours.

We did some work together; got him on my LinkedIn as well   I had a massive spreadsheet I used for planetary interaction...but that is hardcore industrial stuff most players never touch on the scale I was doing it at. :p   But why would you ever pay for an alpha, especially for a game ALREADY COMPLETED. It's not like Trion is some indie company either; did they charge for the fucking Rift beta? Defiance? No.   Never pay for a beta. I thought all you people learned from fucking archeage....   Everything clashes with everything. The hair, the armor dyes are all mixed, the ridiculous final fantasy legendary sword, the sunglasses and even the back piece. :p   I'd rather spend the money on whopper wednesday   GW1 just gave an error message. All of what you said can be solved with basic "if" statements; if inventoryfull=true then show error message and do not change the build.  It's a basic UI feature that should have been in game since launch   "Interested" is PR bull for "not anytime soon." How fucking complicated can it be to implement a basic build save/swap system? Instead we get hang gliding and black angel wings....    Not gonna lie... it totally works.  By getting you killed?      at least the wings in Aion served a purpose...   Gretchen  Elliott had far more impact on Walt than any other character in the show, except for maybe Jesse. Gretchen was Walt's ex-girlfriend and Elliott was his best friend in grad school, the man with whom he founded Grey Matter.  As we see in the show, Walt wants to earn everything himself - when Gretchen's rich family helps startup Grey Matter (presumably, but never explicitly mentioned), Walt becomes infuriated and leaves her. In his chaotic and moody state after leaving the love of his life, Walt gets hitched to some random diner waitress named Skyler, gets her pregnant almost immediately and then goes and buys some boring suburban house like everyone else. Walter then watches for 16 years while his ex-girlfriend marries his best friend, takes Walter's research and uses it with Gretchen's money to forge a billion-dollar pharma company that should have belonged to Walter.   Smells like a quick rewrite over some contract dispute or accident off-set   Breaking Bad was also a cable show - they were limited by how much they could swear (I believe it is 1-2 per season). Not giving House of Cards an excuse, but rather it makes the Breaking Bad writers work harder as they need to make their few swears have that much more impact.   Well the writers are clearly inspired by Macbeth and Richard III, two of Shakespeare's plays. In Richard III, Richard monologues quite a bit with the audience in the first act, but as the play goes on, he does this less and less to make him less sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the play, he does not monologue and the audience can see how monstrous he has become.   YO PRESDENT.  BITCH   I'd rather they end on a high note then drag the show along for more money.   Need to stretch out the show so Netflix and Kevin Spacey get more money.  I felt Doug should have ended Rachel in episode 3-4 and the whole Dunbar Iowa crap ends around episode 7-8.   gtfo this thread idiot   But they're not free. You're paying $40 a year. That $40 could have bought me the games on sale on Steam for my PC.   That's a really stupid analogy. I don't pay a monthly fee to use Steam and therefore don't get any "free" games that normally cost money.   Not really "free" though, is it? Still have to buy Gold   That's not a very good thing at all.   *You're all going to die.*   They can't laugh. They're in too much fear of the guards jabbing them with bayonets.

Mm...no. people are just buying cool looking ships at this point.   *polite clapping*   Being a trade mogul and running a large corp, same as EVE   Better Call Lionel   looks like something is wrong with the specular maps   "OMG guys look, The Repopulation."  "OMG guys look, Star Citizen."  "OMG guys look, Blade and Soul."  "OMG guys look, Everquest Next."  "OMG guys look, ArcheAge."  "OMG guys look, Albion Online."  "OMG guys look, Black Desert."  "OMG guys look, Crowfall."   WoW stomps on all of them, the closest I can think of are GW2 and FFXIV. A different kind of game, but DC Universe is also fairly polished.   Have you played Machinarium? It's a puzzle/adventure game set in a similar setting; steampunk with robots and fairly post-apocalyptic.    No more fantasy, no more elves. I want to see more contemporary or realistic sci-fi MMORPGs. Someone mentioned TRON, which would make for an awesome MMO setting. You mentioned Cowboy Bebop, which would be very cool.    "fuck this drama"  That was really stupid...now you sound even more passive-aggressive.  As for third dates - somewhere romantic where it's not just sitting in a dark theater   Boy, that would be sweet.   Before you learn to kiss a girl, you need to learn to KISS. Keep it simple, stupid. This post is way too long.  Go outside and talk to people. There's no magic trick to it; the more opportunities you give yourself to be around women, the law of averages dictates that one of them must eventually like you enough to kiss you.   My eventual goal is marriage and a family with a future best friend.  The red pill is about misogyny and hatred. The dudes there are the extreme version of neckbeard rejects who have never gotten laid - they take their frustrations out on women, instead of realizing they are all a bunch of miserable losers with no confidence nor effort to improve themselves.   Wildstar still has the best IMO, but the rest of the game is under-populated and buggy.   Oh, Ice Creamville!   I thought they lived in New Horror Field?   "Hey, I really like speaking with you but I have to go; give me your number so we can keep this going."  Or you can do the more bold thing and straight ask her out: "Sorry, I have to go but I want to continue our talk over a drink sometime, maybe next week. Write your number down."  Never ask them for their numbers. Always tell them you want their number, then hand them your phone. I get rejected far less when my phone is already out and it's staring the girl in the face.  Never be scared of rejection. It happens to everyone. Shrug it off and move on.   To become more intimate with the person in a conversation, just ask them intimate, personal questions. Say you start talking about a vacation they were just on; next, ask them "That sounds awesome! What would be your dream vacation?"   You didn't ask for a date or anything - you're just making lame jokes for what end purpose? You need to be direct with women and stop beating around the bush. They will respect you for that and it will help outside of dating as well (e.g. in the work place).  As for your picture in the OP, I could say maybe get a haircut or something, but looks are nowhere as important to women as personality and self-confidence. But definitely lose the shag - I can see you with short sides and a bit of styling up top.   no, move on   I don't think physical demons exist like we see them in comic books or Diablo 3, but are manifestations of bad ideas, thoughts, habits and activities. Like when someone did something bad they feel like they're "living with demons," when in fact it's just a sense of regret and foreboding.  When someone passes blame to a sort of intelligent evil mastermind behind everything bad, it does a discredit toward's humanity's own craftiness and tendency towards violence. Furthermore, why would God just let these little red-eyed devils run amok among his people if they have no redemption available to them?   May have better luck asking on /r/OrthodoxChristianity  Use the search bar there, lots of times this question has been answered   Do you seriously believe that? lol not sure if troll.   OP, everybody    wouldn't really mind having my boys hear their mom moaning for me from another room.   Ask her what food she likes. Cooking can be fun and easy - she can help you make it, or just let her sit while you do all the work, but keep the mood light and flirty.   He just said he was going to cook for her. They're not going winter hiking -.-   Did you buy the tickets already?   Get rid of the movie dude. Johanna is right - you want to have as much physical and social (conversation) interaction as possible on a first date to get to know the person and establish some physical contact face-to-face.    No, its shit. The shepard looks all deformed and you can clearly see they ripped the Charon from EVE in the bottom right.   The movie was not as good as the book - no movie I've seen has ever been as good as their book - but it still was a good movie.   The baby scene   amazing   Here's a trick: text them back while they're standing with you, using the excuse, "Here, let me send you my # too."   So do I attempt to call her again?  No.   Something lighthearted and in public, considering it is a first date. Go take her to get coffee or hot cocoa, then walk around a park, go skating or something.   NEVER go to the cinema on a first date. It's dark. You can't talk to them. It's really awkward and shit. Cinema dates are better later on - great for making out in the back.    "Be selfish"  I really don't like this, but that's the Anglican in me speaking.. You can be confident, charming and intelligent without having to resort to being a selfish prick.  The first paragraph was good advice though. OP needs to stop complaining and actually put in the time if he wants some results.   Plenty more numbers out there man - grats on getting one girl's number (well, almost). Chin up, take it as a victory.   ^^no   how i accounting?   Why not?   I don't think we're the right people to answer your questions - all we can give is amateur conjecture. I would strongly suggest seeing a sex and/or relationship therapist.   It's this weekend.   Um, it's free.   "move it chowdahead."  	104
 No, I don't really feel a romantic connection with men.    I've met a few guys I've been physically attracted to but their personalities totally turned me off so it was a no go. I can't really explain it. I'm attracted to the fantasy of a man but not irl men. I find that guys fall short of the fantasy.   I was raised Roman Catholic and couldn't imagine leaving the Church behind or renouncing my faith. I'm more Catholic in tradition than practice (but still attend Church occasionally, etc.). My family are just Catholic, that's just the way it is. I've reconciled my faith with my sexuality over time. When I was a teenager I believed it to be a sin. Now, I just believe Mark 12:30-31; I believe in loving God with all my heart, and loving my neighbours as I love myself. And oddly enough, I think of the Miranda Lambert song "Heart Like Mine"  where she sings: Jesus, "He would understand a heart like mine". I think if I try to be a good person, go to Church, be charitable, and kind to others, than that's all that really matters. In the end, Jesus will be my judge, not man.   I identify as bisexual, but only consider dating women. I'm sexually attracted to men but that's about it. I have yet to find a guy in real life that I'm attracted to, the more I get to know a guy the more I lose interest, meanwhile women are just so attractive in every way.   What bothers me is that they have to explain it at all. From the viewers POV, everything was working in the favour of the allies. If they hinted that it was going to be a hell of a fight with tons of casualties, it would work but they spent the last episode having Cage in a sort of rage because they, the MM, aren't left with any viable defences.   Yep, same here, with one added 'tell' which is my voice for some reason goes deeper.   Emmylou Harris - Boulder to Birmingham   Yes! It would be nice to be asked. I asked a friend to take down drunken pics of me from his facebook. He did but then months later put them back up. I approve things added to my timeline now.   Yes, Kate Winslet. Titanic.   My golden does this sometimes. Usually when we're out for walks and she wants to play with stray dogs and I won't let her.   For slowed down music, I've always liked Don Williams. Emmylou Harris is also good.   Jenny is my favourite L Word character.   Now I'm confused, I thought TDEE took into account activities like exercise?   I'll see how it goes for this week. I played my first soccer game yesterday and it was pretty intense so I'm really tired and sore. If 1540 calories isn't enough I'll add 100 calories incrementally until I feel the difference.   I'll try it for a week then and see how it goes. Thanks.   I'm 26, 5'5", 132lbs. I started lifting and running three weeks ago. I lift and run 3x a week and play soccer once a week for an hour. I'm wondering if 1520 calories is enough? My TDEE is 1902 and I took 20% off of that. Should I be eating more calories? I want to lose weight but gain muscle.  I try to eat 105g of protein, 60g of fat, and 140g of carbs. I always fall a little short on protein and fat and overdoing carbs but everyday I'm getting better the more I experiment with food.   Dixie Chicks Top of the World CD and 20 best of 60s Rock and Roll CD. I was 14 and decided I would find music that I really liked and stopped listening and buying whatever MTV or pop radio told me to listen and buy. The 60s CD was my parents but I loved it, "Da Doo Ron Ron" "Ain't No Mountain High" "Wild Thing".   I love running. I used to run track and field in Grade 5 and I remember looking at a poster of Donovan Bailey wishing I could be as fast as him. I played soccer as well in elementary and later ran track in high school. But I think it does grow on you but you shouldn't be afraid to try other things. My mom started cycling after being a runner for years and absolutely loves it because it's much faster, and less harsher on her knees.   I bought a digital textbook. Was slightly less expensive and it expired at the end of the semester. I could bookmark pages so I could flip back and forth very easily. The only thing was that it was available through a website I had to login and the website sucked and was a little slow and I could only download one chapter at a time.   I actually like Blake Shelton's music because I feel it's genuine to who he is. As for Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean, I believe they're sell outs because I really don't think their music is genuine to who they are.   Ashley Monroe, Elizabeth Cook, Kelsey Waldon, Sunny Sweeney, Angaleena Presley, Nikki Lane, Lydia Loveless, Holly Williams, Lee Ann Womack. Thought I'd add more women to your list.   Xena. Buffy. Spice Girls. Hermione Granger. Captain Janeway. Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality. Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. Stupid Ash from Pokemon couldn't appreciate Misty. Also, my brother and I used to have lightsaber fights in the backyard. And how could I forget Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels, leather and whip.  	21
 Video games, thats about it :/   What's on my mind is that I don't find myself with much of a future, as most people, even my father, find me purely despicable.   Thing is, she wants me to kill myself, and I still love her, I care about her more than myself, and I just want to do as she asks, added onto the lack of hope I have left for any real reason to live.

But I can't be lost forever, sadly, our world for whatever reason doesn't allow us to do that. We end up as failures, I just want to go before I end up that way in the end :/    I would do things I liked to do, if it wasn't for the fact all I likedcto do was things with her. I can't help anyone, anyone I try to help just ends up hating me in the end, I just don't want  to do that to people anymore, to hurt anymore, I just want to be gone :/   I'm a rather depressed person. For about 5 years of my life, I felt lost, without anything to aim for in my life but maybe a chance I could find a reason. And then, one day, after a bit of time, I found that reason.  I found her.  And I know what you're thinking, he's going to kill himself over a girl, it's not worth it, I know that.  She was more than a girl, she was my reason to live.  We met eachother through a game, we lived across an ocean from eachother. We loved eachother, but we had issues with what we did by ourselves. Me much more than her. I cause breaks like this with everyone. I don't have friends, I don't know where to get help, I was sent to a mental hospital, it fixed nothing, my following therapist, nothing.  I am talking here, because I had no friends. Everyone I have ever talked to has one way or another turned out to hate me. I just wanted someone to talk to, that's all. I have little hope, but I need to know if someone, anyone out there cares about who I am for more than just a human, for me, JT.  And if there is not, then may there be salvation beyond.     http://i.imgur.com/08jRwgO.png feel free to just draw these two doing anything, although them in a campsite with a tent, a fire, and a log to sit on would be nice   test_subject5099 and YetiiWho92 together please?   http://i.imgur.com/08jRwgO.png feel free to just draw these two doing anything, although them in a campsite with a tent, a fire, and a log to sit on would be nice   http://i.imgur.com/08jRwgO.png These two?   http://i.imgur.com/08jRwgO.png These two sitting in a very basic campsite, like, just a tent, and a log, and a firepit :P    Yetii*   http://i.imgur.com/08jRwgO.png these two firing down on at hill at a group of zombies? if you can't do that, these two as cats would be very, very nice :P   This one came out of the crevese in dogekac and made its way into the shrine, capturing one of the dwarves inside it.   No Problem :L   http://imgur.com/MY4ce05,RoZLuyr,CjsoRd4,uAxuLIn   http://imgur.com/MY4ce05,RoZLuyr,CjsoRd4,uAxuLIn   I personally got to see the Kraken about a year ago, and I can dig up screenshots at your request, no video though.   I walked into the room, instantly feeling a sense of, *emptiness* in the room. It was clearly lit by the full panel windows along the walls, but the light didnt reach the back recesses, to the staircase. It was nearing night, and patrol would need to start again to keep the monsters out. It had been a few days since the last attack, and the pink sky out the window seemed to fully encompass that bliss that many of them had been feeling. They were still warned however, to not go beyond the shrines reach, because if they do and die out there, they would not have the shrines timewarp ability, and they would be eternally doomed to a death of nothingness.   I sat down in the chair outwards from the table, and had a look around. The room was mostly bare, but bookcases lined the walls that the windows did not. Books filled with history and knowledge of the Dwarves past and even before that, before the calamity. These books and this house held the utmost importance to this outpost, as this was home to the second oldest living dwarf, and not only was he the ancient in his status, but he is also ancient in name. He is the last surviving titled warrior of the dwarves, a practice that was ceased a long time ago, after one certain title was killed beyond the shrine. After that title died, The Old Man never titled another dwarf again, realizing that giving these warriors titles and then losing them was causing more morale loss among the dwarves than needed, and was unnecessary.   Slowly, more and more of the remaining titles were lost to the place beyond shrine jurisdiction, and eventually that left one. At 23 dwarven lifetimes, he is only four lifetimes younger than The Old Man himself, and because of this, he experienced much of the important events that had befallen the dwarves. So, this dwarf, was forever to have the occupation of The Rememberer, which has now become his name, as no other name seems to fall upon him. His job was to answer the dwarves any questions they might have that could pertain to the past and all events in it to his knowledge.   Thats what I was here for, I had vaguely heard rumors and seen inscriptions of one certain topic in particular and I had come to ask The Rememberer if he knew its origin or meaning. The question befell on me each night when I saw a vision of the inscription each time I shut my eyes, of the bright blade that shone brighter than all others, but was not that legendary sword of the Old Mans , but was another, beside his, with another name below it.  While in thought, a small, quiet voice asked me, Yes, Jimmy, what are you here for? What is it that you seek to learn?  He slowly walked to me, with a cane in hand, and sat in the chair infront of mine. He sat there, giving me a questioning gaze with that bright blue eye of his. He only had one, the other was lost lifetimes ago, in another battle; no one had asked. He had one rule about questions of the past, no dwarf was to ever ask about *him* and his involvement in dwarven lore, and so the mystery of his eye and his title are known to very few surviving dwarves, and they do not utter a single word.   I quickly composed myself and as fast as I could asked the question that was burning inside my mind, Who was; The Deathseeker?  Excuse me son, what was that? He asked, as if completely dumbfounded that such an audacious question could befall upon him.  Well, sir, I had been seeing some visions of an inscription I saw a little bit ago  I dont need backstory, he interrupts, just ask the question again.  Well, who was the Deathseeker?  He sat there for a few moments, and put his face in his hands, for several minutes he sat in silence, and then very quickly outbursted, I dont know what youre talking about, Im sorry, I dont have that information, goodbye.  Dont you think they have a right to know, JT? a soft, low voice said. Across the room near the door stood none other than the General himself, OldManWillakers.  No, Bruce, they dont, it need not concern them and theres no reason to lose more lives because of a dumb prophecy. The longer they dont know, the better. The Rememberer said, very quickly and coldy to the General. It had surprised me to hear him say The Old Mans first name, something no other dwarf had ever said and lived to say again.  Just because you refuse to use its power because of your loss does not mean another Deathseeker cant after you. There is no reason to be withholding this information from them, it doesnt hurt them to know, if they want to know, tell them. She was important to me too, you know The Old Man said.  It doesnt hurt them not to know either Bruce, so what does it really matter? And please, dont talk about her. The Rememberer said, almost moving to tears over his last statement.  I began to tune out their bickering as it seemed not to be going anywhere important, just endless arguing, so I began to look about the room some more. Something I had appeared to miss now shone from the falling sun, up against the wall by the staircase was two very unique items. One of them I very clearly recognized, was the bow known as Brenna, used by the Ranger JT, who had supposedly fallen many lifetimes ago, one of the first to fall. However, he did note that Bruce had called The Rememberer JT, and no one had ever asked about JT specifically in the past, it was possible that the dwarf standing before him was JT himself, but it didnt change much if he was, beyond the name.   The other weapon however, was more curious. A shiny Silver Blade sat in a glass case, and I couldnt look directly at it, as the shine off of it made it nearly impossible to do so. Its shape was not unlike that of the Dwarven Runeblade, yet, slightly bulkier. It did not have the same bend of a holy blade, this sword was much different from them.  The Old Man and JT seemingly stopped arguing, with The Old Man walking up to me, saying The Rememberer here has agreed to give you your answer, but I am going to give it to you.  The Deathseeker is a legendary hero of the dwarves, able to unlock the power of a sword nearly as powerful as Excaliju; Orion, the Silver Blade.  I glanced back over at the case, this sword seemingly to fit the description.  This blade could blind the monsters with its shine, and cripple them from escape, allowing for an easy powerful swing to end their undead lives. Only one Deathseeker can live at one time, and when one passes, another can then realize his potential with the Blade. The Old Man explained.  However, the last Deathseeker to be known did not use the Blade, and instead kept its knowledge from the dwarves for thousands of years, as well as hiding its prophecy and inscriptions.  The current Deathseeker is the man that stands before you, and that is his blade, in the case, never to be used until he passes  Never to be used again, I hope. JT interrupts.  You wasted your ability to use that blade, you could have helped purify so many places and you wasted it. Bruce sternly said.  Because that sword gives nothing but trouble, and I wanted nothing to do with spreading its curse to others. JT retaliated.  The curse is a small price to pay for power. Bruce said.  It wasnt a small price JT trailed off, seemingly on the break of tears, Get out Jimmy, thats the story, now leave.   I got up and left the room, heading out back to my barracks to start my shift on patrol, and think over what I just learned.     	61

Everyone can stop by, say a prayer, and then dip a chip.   And a "No Groping" sign right beside you.   Do hot girls eat chili?   Cool. I guess you wouldn't mind if I tape my dick to your forehead, so you can cd's nuts?   Cool.  I can only hope to be like that when I'm older.

 Also, do you know of any way to test whether or not it is the brake lines, besides of course having taken the caliper off and have it successfully compress?    This would probably make the most sense out of anything anyone has told me all day. Thank you much. I've gotta look into where to buy brake lines. I've had real issues getting any sort of part for my car, because I don't know what's limited edition, and what's stock Mk4 GTI parts. This specific part of brake line costs $45 on ECS tuning, and while that's better than $232 for a caliper from them, I'm sure someone has it cheaper.    I'm not disagreeing with you, it would make sense and you're probably right, but Wikipedia is not a source. Thank you for your insight.    Interesting. Do you by chance have a source for that?   I had twisted the boot while turning the piston inward towards the caliper. I put the boot back into place, but if anything I'll buy a new boot, not a whole caliper.  Happy Cake Day   Ahhh! Sweet deal, man! Never heard of this website before, and although the website looks sketch, I guess it's covered by BBB.  When you ordered yours, were they brand new calipers? No chipped paint or wear/tear? Essentially, were they like the photo?   A little under a month ago, I bought new rear rotors and pads for my Mk4 20AE GTI, as the drivers side pads had been worn down to the metal. **While trying to compress the drivers side caliper, I could not get it in all the way**, and I tried literally everything - [it only went this far (2nd image is passenger side for comparison](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj).  **I removed the caliper** from the brake lines and the e-brake cable - completely off of the car. **I spun the piston, and it went straight in** and shot fluid out of the hole where the brake line connects.  I put it back on the car over the new rotors and pads, and me and a buddy **bled the caliper** (I was operating the pedal, I don't know if he for sure did it right, but he does work with cars at a dealership).  My **brake warning light came on** - flashing and beeping, but no ABS light or check engine light - no code to read. It was a similar warning as to if I were to take off driving with the e-brake pulled, however the brake light was not solid on as it is when the e-brake level is pulled.   Brakes were squishy on and off, but me and my buddy ended up pretty much bleeding out all of the squishyness and adding a bit of fluid (with where my reservoir is positioned, it's impossible to see the gauge   tell how much fluid to add, but it's not empty). Still had the same warning.  Decided to take it for a drive to see if it would get me to work tomorrow. I drove about 4 miles (brake warning light on intermittently), and as soon as I opened my door, I could smell it - the heat coming from the pads and the rotor on that side. I put my hand in front of the rim, and all of the surrounding air was hot as hell. **Its as if the pads are sticking to the rotor - like the brake caliper is pushing out onto the pads, but not retracting back into the caliper**. I have no idea what could possibly cause this.   We decided to try getting a new caliper, [but none of the calipers in any store around me fit my 20th AE GTI](http://imgur.com/nTAXogC). ECS Tuning has the caliper for $232, and the VW Dealership has the caliper (only 3 of them in the US) for $200. I'm hoping to be able to just rebuild this caliper or find one that I can afford, because that price tag is just stupid high.  I'm completely lost and I miss my GTI. Been driving a Ford for the last 3 weeks :(. I have no clue what could cause this, so any advice is much appreciated.  If I can supply any more information or images to make the situation more clear, just let me know. I do have the caliper off of the vehicle and the piston removed - however I have no clue what I'm looking at.  **TL;DR in bold**  [Here's some images of the two sets of threads I could see inside of the caliper.](http://imgur.com/a/LoOli)   Also, I took the caliper apart to see if I could quickly see any obvious fuckery, however it looks pretty clean. The only dirt I could find was on the very outside of the actual piston itself.  http://imgur.com/a/LoOli  Pay no attention to the last few images, another user was trying to help me find a part number on the caliper somewhere.   Thanks for the quick reply, man.  I know for sure that the handbrake lever in the car was down all the way, but I don't know for certain that something wasn't pulling the handbrake mechanism on the caliper, as I've made some adjustments in the way the cables connect to the lever (cables kept falling out of the bracket, couldn't get it tight, just duct tape wrapped them). I checked a couple times and it appeared to be in the correct spot, however I'm tempted to put the caliper back on and disconnect the e-brake line to see what that does, if anything.  I took the caliper apart and took some pictures of the two sets of threads I could see. They look pretty clean, not real screwed up from what I can see. I also went and tried to find any part numbers that were on the caliper - I didn't see anything apparent, however at the end of this album are all the engravings I could find.  http://imgur.com/a/LoOli  That's good to know that the Audi TT has the same calipers. I will for sure look into that.   Thanks for the reply.  I'll check car-part.com, I hadn't heard of that before. So far Advance Auto, NAPA, and most other store websites haven't given me any luck.  It's weird that it still considered the fluid to be low in the reservoir, I definitely thought I had it filled enough. It'd be useful if anyone had an image of what "full" looks like in the reservoir, as I can't see  the side of my reservoir to look at the gauges.   I did use the proper tool. I went and bought one of those cube tools and ground down two of the edges on the 4 prong side. I even attached that bitch to a powerdrill and sat at it for days, and while attached to the car it wouldn't go in that far.  I'm hoping to find out exactly what might be wrong with the caliper so that I could try to repair it.      A little under a month ago, I bought new rear rotors and pads for my Mk4 20AE GTI, as the drivers side pads had been worn down to the metal. **While trying to compress the drivers side caliper, I could not get it in all the way**, and I tried literally everything - [it only went this far (2nd image is passenger side for comparison](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj).  **I removed the caliper** from the brake lines and the e-brake cable - completely off of the car. **I spun the piston, and it went straight in** and shot fluid out of the hole where the brake line connects.

Citation 135 points to the New York Times, which does talk briefly about the dementia they found by examining his brain tissue. However, they also talked quite a bit about depression, anxiety, paranoia, and self harm. This article does not say that the dementia was the reason he committed suicide, which is what you seem to be trying to find out.   Citation 136 points to TMZ, which is the source that says that the dementia was a "critical factor, " however their source of that information is "someone connected to the Williams family." Not a doctor, not the person performing the autopsy, not a therapist, but this mystery person.    Sources connected with the Williams family tell TMZ ... Lewy Body Dementia was the "key factor" they believe drove him to kill himself.   That's good.

This was a thread in a group buy subreddit. They come straight from the vendor to us in the US.   I was a member of this group buy, so maybe you can know what the fuck you're talking about next time before you claim I'm spreading false information.    Had to read this title 5 times before it made any bit of sense.    I may not know my physics correctly here, so take this with a grain of salt.   I'd imagine that more loose/open/wide airflow would lead to less negative pressure. When my airflow is open, I do not get as great of flavor, nearly. For instance, I have an infinite clt v2 (don't ever buy one), and the flavor is not nearly as good as my fogger v4, however if I want better flavor from it, I close off the airflow, which in turn raises the heat of the air in the atomizer.   With my fogger v4, it's hard to draw from - the airflow is tight, the atomizer chamber is small, and I get the greatest flavor I've tasted from it. I'd assume that being harder to draw, that there'd be more negative pressure in the atomizer?   Maybe I'm completely wrong. Just wanted to see if I could assist.    Here is a thread in a subreddit full of people who all got their 50w isticks mid-march. Determines eleafs statement to be pretty false.   https://www.reddit.com/r/SmogGB/comments/348myl/have_any_of_you_had_any_problems_with_your_isticks/   I had similar feelings while waiting for the iStick 50w. If you want to see both Smog's and the communities response to the issue,[ check out my thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SmogGB/comments/2vp9f2/question_about_the_release_date_for_the_istick_50w/). It's reasonable to wait quite a bit of time.    I posted this because I believe their danger is getting way overhyped. Everyone on reddit was going absolutely crazy over the istick 50w before it came out. It was like THE best thing to hit the market and everyone **had** to get one. For a very long time, the istick series has been the top most recommended setup for beginners or for people to have as their next purchase/upgrade from an ego style battery.   Now that everyone has one, people are having problems and it seems incredibly more widespread because... Everyone has one. My current hypothesis is that while it may "auto-fire" - that this won't happen if people simply turn the device off while they're not using it by clicking the fire button five times. This is the same thing everyone has had to do since someone had the grand idea of putting a flashlight battery in a metal tube - you have to lock the mech mod or it will fire in your insert area here. While mech mods have the ability to start fires and kill people if they are left unlocked, we still very widely accept them as a great product. However, the istick also has the capability of firing when left turned on (no one knows yet if this is just a specific batch eleaf put out), yet everyone is losing their fucking minds over the safety concerns of this product. Everyone is jumping on a bandwagon and telling everyone they know to throw the whole series of isticks in the garbage because they saw someone on reddit tell someone else to do the same.   A theory that was talked about a month or so ago, is that because the button is directly under your tank, if your tank leaks Eliquid into the crevice of this button, the mechanism may stick. This is true with so many other devices out there. I take great care of my iStick, and I have yet to see a single problem, and I'm positive that as long as I keep it turned off (like my mech mod) when I'm not using it, and I keep the button clean, I'm still going to be able to love this awesome product.   Stop all the downloadin!    Discovered this item today. It looks very pretty, and I'm interested.    Thank you for advising. I'm trying to figure out if these auto fire while turned off.    I didn't mean to say locked, I meant moreso turned off. I press the power button 5 times to turn the vape off every time after I'm using it, as the habit just carried over from having a daily mech mod. The locking function only locks the arrow keys that adjust voltage/wattage.   Did you mean locked, or powered off?    Try changing the wick.    Do you recall, was the 30w turned off? As in the button clicked 5 times?    No issues with mine. I think the whole issue is getting really exaggerated. All of ECR was fine with using a battery in a metal tube as long as you kept it locked. Now people are putting their 50ws in their backpacks without locking it and freaking out because they're firing without them pressing the button. I really hate /r/electronic_cigarette right now.    Every bot on reddit is an account except you.    Bot no run   Good luck. If it doesn't work, you can purchase a single evod battery from discountvapers.com for just a few bucks.    I've got a 50w, my buddy has had a 20w, passed it onto my roommate to pick up a 30w, and my bud across the country also has a 30w. We all love our devices and have had no problems.     Edit: Lmao at the downvotes   Try screwing it into the charger and then turning it on.  If that doesn't work, leave it on the charger for a while and try again.  If that's not working, leave it screwed in but plug and unplug the charger, try to defibrillate the fucker.   Make sure you click the button five times to turn the device on/off.    I started out rebuilding with kanger coils. It's excellent to start with. If you want to rebuild the whole coil, pull off the positive terminal pin on the bottom, as well as the insulator between it and the pin, and then just pull the coil and wick out. Then give all pieces a bath in some boiling distilled water, as this will clean the coil and rid of any wick left in the coil unit.    No. It's a hysteria circlejerk.    http://imgur.com/WfSYa5Q   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1BDM1oBRJ8   Oh my fucking god you're already dead run don't look back   Oh god everyone burn the hell out of this company whose dick we were sucking and praising just two months ago every body is dead your house is on fire and you don't know it yet mass fear hysteria       This, dude.

I have no problem with my grades or anything, I m not being bullied I just cant get myself to do anything. Im just shutting myself in my room and spending most of my time sleeping and I cant find any reason to do anything. Sometimes I dont even get up to watch Tv and i just lay in bed the whole day. The worst part is when my dad found out and he told me that Im just fuckin my life, that i could have done it if i wasnt lazy. And i know he is right but I just cant...

 I recently purchased a few syringes from Earth's Tongue. Cambodian, Argentina's, and Mexican Penis "A". I couldn't find any info on this strain though and was hoping someone here could help?

I was surprised by how many different types I was finding in my area.   So that's the typical name for the commons? I'm fairly new to mushrooms so I'd like to know for future reference, thank you         As anyone would tell you, it's just sort of unbearable and hard to deal with. I don't like taking about it so people don't think I'm looking for attention or anything. People really give me a hard time about my issues like motivation, laziness, and my blunt opinions and I don't want to say "I'm only doing it because I'm sad" because that sounds like an excuse so I'm just stuck dealing with it from both ends and it's been like this for years. My mother had me at an early age, to a drug addict. So I have that in my blood. My grandmother though, had my mother with someone who had severe mental health issues like depression, paranoia, and anger she has those traits and so do I now. The only difference is that she is less passive and more aggressive. She can be cruel, selfish, lazy, etc. Me and my sister mostly had to find our own food or rely on our grandmother to raise us. If we were thirsty she'd say "Drink your spit" or "Sip my beer" (she's an alcoholic too). She would lock me in the bathroom with the light off as punishment which was terrifying to me. I remember banging on the door and yelling and I feel like that's where my fear of the dark came from. Now that I'm older she's even worse. She promised us all our lives that we'd have college money and she spent it all. The house is a mess and the pets aren't taken care of because she has allowed her younger friends to control the house. They've beaten up my friends and threatened me with her in the room. It's like I don't have anywhere to go and I'm stuck. I can't make myself happier because very thing that used to make me happy doesn't work anymore. I can't get away because my job doesn't give me enough to live on my own. My own family is giving me a hard time with it and I'm just so fed up with trying to do it on my own and explain myself to everyone. It's not fair and I can't do it anymore. I never asked for any of this.   Well it just feels like I know my mistakes and I know what I do wrong. I half ass my work, I'm critical of others (Not insensitively, I just want them to do the right thing. But I don't sugar coat it. They get very defensive). I'm possessive in relationships, I also don't sugar coat things when it comes to that either. Then there's things I'm just ashamed of like my sex life. My sex life isn't exactly inactive, I just am not happy with my performance or nervousness usually. Then things like how I talk with people in public. People will say something to me and my mind just goes blank and I come up with the worst responses, it's terrible. I can't form relationships of any kind and people don't know what to think of it. I read a post on here a while back about this condition where depression is what a large percentage of your brain power is focusing on so it spaces you out and makes it harder to think about anything else including conversation.   Grim Dawn is on sale until the 22nd for 40% ($16) off.  It's currently on a flash sale for 50% ($12)  Is it worth the few extra dollars or no? I only have $40 I save for the rest of the sale.   Sorry I didn't even think about it, I can't see the rules on my mobile app anyway. I apologize though.  I'm not sure if it's exactly self-learned, more like self-aware in my opinion...      Found it! It was just posted on r/Shrooms  Here's an article: http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html  Here's a gallery: https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB   You should follow r/GTAV_MODS   You should pick up Darkest Dungeon, it's $15 right now. Great RPG Rougelike   I just prefer watching things like this. I like "strange and slightly disturbing" for some reason, odd as that may be. I completely understand why it's out of other people's comfort zones though.   Me too, it's almost unthinkable that PC's are becoming a more popular platform than consoles at this point. I have a huge wishlist of games on Steam though. Some of the ones I'm looking for deals on would be D4, Project Cars, Mortal Kombat X, and Killing Floor 2. What about you?   I read a post on here not too long ago about someone saying that Fallout 4 was keeping them going and I related to that one a bit but currently this is what's keeping me going. PC gaming is my hobby and I enjoy it very much. It's the one thing that makes me happy so I'm glad something good is happening revolving my hobby very soon.  Happy spending, to anyone who is a PC gamer!  	18
 The shoes I'm referring to are the ones he wears during the talk when he announces that they will be streaming the UFC fight.   A dance club like with a bar, dance floor and obnoxious, loud music   Any particular reason you feel this way?  	3
 i've heard of special astral gates that let meat go into astral and corps hid their existence and protected them heavily outside and inside.  i've seen some stuff from 4th age about magic it isn't that far from sixth with few obvious examples otherwise pretty much of it sounds like things peopel just haven't thought about it or have the materials and critters available  blood magic is especially brutal most things leave you disfigured and such.   If it's knowledge dragons supposedly might also be able to do it, right? Assuming it isn't a "secret technique" of the 4th age   I'm talking like Great dragon magic, mass blood rituals, VERY powerful spirits and ETC at what point could a spirit start showing signs of higher magicks (probability manipulation or true resurrection ) things that most certainly would not be possible for a pc in normal play.  please no "handwave it" type of responses, it's just for speculations and debates sake.  here's a good one too what would your "Perfect" scenario for a ritual and i mean bringing everything you know ,ley lines,feng shui etc.   Yeah it's just that feeling you get when see someone's elses thought on how he looked.   I don't wanna explain too much bcause it might go against lore and have it all go down the drain.  On the other hand it's a metaplane  yeah i'l just introduce some more people maybe some animals that were also caught in the blast and they'le meet while climbing the tower  "I haven't seen the tower light up in a long time" could the spirit say.  how do we get out?  "if you want to technobabble talk to the one who's in charge of it"   Woah is that really how he's depicted?   Nobilis you are lord and embodiment of an aspect of reality.   well the point of the of a manastorm hitting the veil is to cause a big magic event, it's supposed to be magic but you can always drop hints for it to be something more  Only one way to know,climb the tower.  i had the free spirit idea but then i thought "they're nowhere why would they? but i'l let some metaplane "citizens" there to drop some hints and chat.  it's a deep metaplane , who knows if deep enough they are or sometimes are the same thing?  In the end i hope th gm left enough hints for the players to make up their own explanation usually that is way more interesting then what you had planned.  but anyway thanks for the suggestions!   Okay i summon a spirit how do i know what the spirit can do?  basicly walk me through spirits in Mage: The Ascension   Please read the whole conversation.  	10
 I'd say you're wrong.   ~~Not when followed by "lite". Ultra thin pads are also thinner than regular pads.~~  Edit: I don't know how to read correctly.   Yeaaaah... need to ~~shorten my showers though...~~ start showering at other people's showers; water bill is too high...  FTFY    Male - sex woman - gender    Thank you! Back at you!   Your second analogy is actually great. Questioning can feel a lot like not knowing who you are and being wrong about it. That's why, when a person finally comes to a real conclusion, it's better safe than sorry. They won't be offended by you trying to hard to accept them, but may be hurt by you seemingly not trying have enough.   You're putting words in my mouth. That's not even close to what I said. She earned the medals while presenting as a man and being male. I don't know the rules for trans* Olympians, since I'm not the least bit interested in the Olympics. In my opinion, people should participate with the gender they present and/or identify as, regardless of sex, and if that changes in the future that has no bearing on the accomplishments, but I don't make the rules.   Since you are clearly looking for a fight, please go TERF elsewhere.   That's so cool! I'm sorry all you got was a gator. Maybe you can try again in the future!   Incidentally, one can be male and a woman.   I have anxiety and just throw it on whenever I'm having an attack. Its soothing    I think she would have gotten less outrage if it weren't for her crimes. She was literally only known for violating the Espionage Act and nothing else.   Yep! She has always been a woman, just not out about such. That's the rule of thumb, anyhow. Individuals may have personal preferences but it's a fair, safe rule to follow.   You're the one being abusive here, hon.   And that is a struggle for a spouse of a transperson. But guess what? Transitioning is about the individual, not their spouse or us strangers.   True, but I've learned that six is waaaaaaay too many.   I'm 20. My current favorite is Hairspray.   Manatee! When I was in kindergarten my class "adopted" one and fundraised for it.   On my wife's 21st I had two glasses of wine and five pina coladas. I was smashed. She was still mostly sober so at midnight we made a Wawa run and I ended up throwing it all up.   It's okay! Thank you!      Yes! I was on mobile with next to no speed and Google wouldn't load the real name for it!   Shawn is unisex? That sounds about as unisex as Britni to me.   I, too, am an ordained Dudist Priest!   I basically use my face routine on my arms twice daily. I start with Equate-equivalent of Cetaphil cleanser. Then, I use Equate Black Head Eraser. Then I use wipes with salicylic acid that I purchased at the Dollar Tree. Finally, I moisturize with Equate-equivalent of Cetaphil moisturizer. In four days the redness has reduced significantly as has the bumpyness. I hope someone else can use this to help them!   I'm confused; what part are you sorry to hear?   Then don't go so slow in the left lane.   Thank you! We are very happy with our choice!   If your parents made you aware enough that you attended pride events, you have to decide to become a bigot.   Thank you!   In typical babydyke fashion, we talked about marriage from about 2 weeks in. It was always an inevitable. There was never a huge proposal in a super immediate way. On our nerd anniversary dating I gave her a ring in Texas Road house and asked her to marry me at some point. However, setting a date was done by us sitting in a college sociology class and me realizing that her father's income took her out of financial aid. I wrote her a note explaining such and we talked to my parents (who we live with) and got their okay. We talked to her mom the next day.    I drive a 2003 Hyundai Elantra that I paid for with my own money from an accident suit in my 1997 Volvo 850 that I paid for with my own money. My brother drives a 1998 Ford Mustang that my uncle hooked him up with cheap and helped with all the repairs.  My brother is constantly calling my car a go kart and just a general dick about how much better he is than me. It really hurts me and I really hate it. He is completely irrational and talking to him about t would do nothing.  TL;DR my brother is a dick.   Hahaha I sniff her armpits, too! I also pick at her pimples and stuff. She hates it lol but I love it.  We work really hard to support each other, and so far it seems to be working okay.   We are both gross and don't have fantastic hygiene; mostly it's a side effect of our depression.  She eats ranch dressing on peanut butter sandwiches. I find it horrifying. She is grossed out by my insistence on licking her face whenever possible.   We have been together since we were 15 and 16. That helped for most of our family members, and, she would have had to drop out of school because of financial aid, so her mom got over it really fast.   ...come to think of it, you probably have.   Cheap vibrators use AA or AAA. Good vibrators use either D or C batteries.    /u/MeridatheBearida is my wife and we would love to a answer any and all of your questions! Happy pride month!   Then let's stay fat!   You are a balterina!   I don't know if you mean it that way, but this seemed really misandrist to me.   And they can still attend pride rallies and church. Like 75% of Reddit went to church before becoming atheist. You can go to a pride parade and then decide to become a bigot, too.   I identify as gq and don't have PCOS. My wife has PCOS and is solidly a woman. I don't know that I believe there is a link. It seems as though he is implying that heightened testosterone levels make someone's gender identity wacky. It would stand to reason that going on T would alter identity as well.   Walls is my go to when I'm feeling down. Such a good song.   "Tell me how you feel over and done with Like your life is a map with no compass to guide, At the bar drinkin way too much We sing along to "Forever Young"." - Somewhere in Neverland  "Little rats, running mazes, having babies It's a vicious little world" - The Reckless and the Brave  Those are my current top two but it fluctuates.   When you're in a position of underprivilege it's important to see more perspectives so you don't develop a victim complex.   So any actor making a racist joke must be a racist. Any actor who makes a joke about dead babies/abortion/stillbirth/miscarriage must be insensitive to women and loss of children. Any actor who makes a sexist joke is actually sexist.   That's completely preposterous. Acting is not real.    I'm proud of you for making it through last night. That's a major accomplishment. I hope that you can continue to make it through every night until it's no longer a struggle.    Eh, it's called acting for a reason. That's like saying that agreeing to play a murderer means the actor perpetuates murder.   Oh! I see what you mean now; circlejerk upvotes of the same thing so the hive mind can get going. That is definitely really shitty and not something we want. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.   [I posted this on offmychest yesterday about this very topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/37wwzn/its_my_body_hair_and_ill_do_what_i_want_with_it/)   That's still good content. Clearly people like it if it's being upvoted. Why does it even matter if the posts aren't true? It matters if the content is enjoyable to those consuming it.   Sadly, the issue seems to be time and energy for OP, not money, but perhaps I'm wrong.   No, no! See it's a *health issue*. /s   As a mobile user, please no.   Yo. If you think all females the same and all Js different, you gotta straighten out some priorities.   I make my wife shove everything in her wallet.   Check mate, femmes.  Seriously though she hates it and makes me carry said over stuffed wallet.   I'm here for laughs. Other people's karma doesn't affect me; if they have high karma clearly they post good content.   And that's fine for them. Some of my trans friends truly identify as trans and like the label.    Well that's a trans pride symbol. Clearly your friend doesn't have trans pride and prefers to be seen as equal to a cis woman. That isn't a bad thing, but based on that this has little to do with her then.   Well creating them is sort of gross and shouldn't be shown to children, but growing them is fine!   The placenta looks like a Mary Poppins umbrella situation.   You da real MVP, OP.   I am a 20 year old woman. I last shaved my legs the night before my wedding, which was December 10th. I last saved my armpits roughly one month ago. I last shaved my pubic hair sometime in January, I think.   I'm a small part Native American, and it presents in low body hair and reddish toned skin. My legs don't really appear hairy, as what there is is blonde and thin. My armpits have enough growth to feel the breeze from the fan if I'm shirtless.   I absolutely love it. I feel sexy with more body hair. I feel more myself, not working so hard to remove what is naturally growing. I bathe regularly and wear deodorant, so smell isn't an issue. Not shaving makes me feel at home in my body.   My wife loves that I'm more confident. She loves that I like my body more. She also knows that, if she asks, I will remove all of it for her.   I wear shorts and don't care, though I don't quite have the confidence for tanks right now.   My sisters in law are all 14 and 15. They are all super feminine and don't get why I'm comfortable this way. I don't need them to get it. I need me to be happy, and this helps me be happy.   36 of my deceased '89 Volvo 740.   You know what else was the best thing to happen to LGBT people? Stonewall! Sure, we we're murdered an assaulted but people knew!  Just like with AIDS! Formerly Gay Cancer, formerly GRID. We died and were treated unjustly and that bigotry prevails but people knew gays were real!   I disagree that the email and Skype are an issue. If you ever thought the companies didn't have records you're incredibly naive. I never really considered the medical stuff, but if it's attached through email, It's almost to be expected.   I was unaware of the picture and phone sex stuff being circulated, but that's an issue of abuse of the system, not the system itself.  Thank you for making me more aware. :)   Except when you use the internet it's a public thing, not your bedroom.    I'd skip the pap and just get a massage.      My wife's engagement ring was 60 bucks and her wedding ring was under 30. We are happy and in love and the money spent on a ring is irrelevant.   Four of my 2003 Hyundai Elantra.   You can't sit with us!   That's why I always dry myself on the floor. I don't want the floor to miss out on perianal sweat.   I think that would make getting raped a little worse, like you're laying there having just been raped which is really a shitty thing, and then you smell ice cream but there is none to be had, so you're just that much more upset that you can't even get some comfort food.   It seems like I went through webMD and picked symptoms.   I have irrational, uncontrollable anger that I can't handle well in many situations. I'm very emotionally unstable; I can go from ecstatic to livid like the flip of a switch, and I handle neither particularly well. I have really bad abandonment issues for no apparent reason and it manifests in my testing relationships and generally being an asshole to make sure people don't abandon me. I nearly always feel empty; the only time I don't is during extremely special happy events and when I drink. I make a conscious effort to control my drinking and drink less than once a month, and I'm a lightweight so literally two Smirnoff ice and I'm drunk. I drive and spend rather recklessly and I find myself dissociating and unable to really change my off the wall actions. I also have a history with self harm.  I've read that BPD is often hard to diagnose because people with it don't want to be criticized so they won't mention shitty things they do. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like if I really had it I couldn't be this self critical. I've had some of these symptoms for a long time, but stuff like the dissociating is very recent, like within the last year. The only stable relationships I have are with my wife and my mother. I go through "friends" like water and I admittedly am a terrible judge of character so I pick them poorly.   My mom is my best friend. She supports transpeople, just not me transitioning. She fostered over 50 children, partly because she was infertile. Almost all of those children were boys. She wanted a daughter so bad. When she got pregnant with me, she was 38. She says she knew immediately that God wouldn't make her wait 16 years for a sick boy and that I was a healthy girl. She had my brother two years later; my older brothers were adopted before me.   When I came out as gay, she struggled with it. That didn't last long, but at that time she made it clear that I could "transition ten years after (she) was dead." She reiterates that periodically as well. When I started keeping my hair short, she struggled, but I tease her and tell her that I brought home my high femme wife so I'm no longer obligated to be femme.   In 2012, she ended up in the ICU for 11 days and almost died because of a whole host of medical issues we didn't know existed. We worked on them for two and a half years before learning that she has non alcohol related cirrhosis. She remained sober her whole life (her father was a drunk) so that she could avoid that exact problem. If you didn't know, there is no treatment or cure for cirrhosis.   I don't get very many more years with my mom. I know that for sure. It's in the early stages, but it sometimes progresses very quickly. I don't want to waste what little time I have making her view me as a man when I know that is the last thing she wants to do.   I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share. I'm sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic, I don't mean for it to.

So do my pups! Mya is Mya-Doodle-Do, Doodle Dog, and Doodle Bug. Reese is Reesey Puff, Fluffer Nutter and Fluff Butt. On a side note, my brother has a dog named Pope that is a black boxer, so I call him George Foremen or Georgie.    That's a great name for a cat!   That's adorable! What's his name?   I added pictures to the top.   They are named Mya, who is 3, and Reese, who is 2. I hate to play favorites, but Mya is like a super dog. She is protective, helps me during anxiety attacks and wakes me with kisses. She is also wicked smart. Her only bad trait is that she barks at all strangers. Reese on the other hand isn't as smart or sweet. She's a good pup but Mya is just perfect.   They're mutts. They are Yorkie, Chihuahua, Dauchsund, Cocker Spaniel mixes. One looks like a small black lab, the other looks a lot like a Dauchsund.      http://m.imgur.com/gallery/ygjpJ   http://imgur.com/a/iOmAD  The solid black one is named Mya. She is 3, her birthday is February 29th. The one with brown is Reese, she's 2 and her birthday is April 5th.   This is freakishly close to my ravioli recipe.   Otherwise you'll serve barely warm ribs to your boyfriend's roommates.   Cam Tucker?   Goods and services can be e changed for money.   It is generally stated as distracting. Also, many districts opt to put students in in school suspension, not just home to change. Both truly are distracting to an education. I agree that situational appropriateness is important, I just don't see schools as really aiming to teach that.         How can you tell that I was shadowbanned? My wife went through and upvoted all of my posts for my first two pages, which She does periodically. I don't have any alts.    Those can he transmitted even with a clean mouth.   Do you recognize that disease can't be spread through a beard or a dirty mouth, but it can through blood and other menstrual fluids?    If that's true then I assume women are also made to remove peach fuzz. Otherwise, you are full of shit. Based on your irrational anger and name calling, I'm going to assume the latter. Have a nice day, and make friends with someone who can help you handle your mental health issues.   Except it's literally a health risk to everyone to have menstrual fluid everywhere. It isn't a health risk to have a beard.   I'm not saying he should quit his job to grow a beard. I'm saying razors aren't a necessity and that if *he* cares so much about it, then that's his solution. Not having to pay tax on a luxury item is not a solution.   You know women use razors too right? And he can always just get a different job. No one is forcing him to work there. Science forces me to bleed from my vagina and I can't have it all over everything.   I saw it in a video like 4 years ago and it came up on Google just now, so it might be.   For my monogamous marriage, that's the issue. Other people's relationships are not my relationships.   T can make you sterile but it also isn't considered an effective birth control.   No, *I* don't, but it's not my body or my child, so it's not my place to make that call.   Yes, they are.   Why does it matter? If no genitals or nipples are showing, it's not a girl's responsibility to keep a boy from looking.  Edit: do you guys realize that bottoms of buttcheeks are no more indecent than cleavage? If it's not indecent exposure, no one but the owner of the body or the owner of the body's parent gets to decide what shows.   I though Spider Man was from a bite from a specially bred super spider? Though, I've only seen the Toby McGuire movie.   Rub the negative side of a D battery on it.   Adding "Mc" to a name is appropriation of Irish naming roots and I will not stand for it. Somebody get me a chair.   Yeah....... Putting someone else at risk for STDs isn't the same as your partner jacking off because you aren't feeling it.   I think you're leaving something out. You come off a bit misogynistic, or at least completely oblivious, for other reasons.   I am very high libido married to someone very low libido. She was low libido before we got married, but it got worse after. It isn't that she doesn't want to fuck me. She truly just can't get there. She can't force herself to be in the right head space. She also leads me on quite a bit. She'll spend a day promising me and sending me dirty texts and at night she just can't get there. Its not that she intentionally lied, she just isn't there, and that isn't her fault.   You aren't wrong for wanting compatibility, but it seems like you never really tried to have a heart to heart with this girl about this. Her explanation sounds like she was raised to believe that sex is for marriage, and she feels shame for having it before. It's a really destructive mentality that causes a lot of issues. It sounds a lot like you got an answer you didn't like and didn't want to work on the issue.  For a lot of people, security and love are needed to feel comfortable to have sex. If she was asking you to listen more, she wasn't feeling enough of those things to be comfortable.   You were a bit of an asshole in telling her that was the reason. You took something out of her control that you knew was an issue early on and threw it at her. Her libido is something she can't change. The only reason to give a reason when breaking up is so the person can work on themselves for their next relationship. All you did was make what already seemed to be a big insecurity worse. I think She dodged the bullet.   I don't get how she can be nine months pregnant with a fetus in her arms.   I watched that in World History in high school!   This sounds like something a sim would say.   Oh god. I'm a 20 year old woman and I say chauvinist.   Only vaguely related.  I used to be friends with this guy. One night, I'm driving him home cause we had been hanging out. We are all just chatting when he says to my wife and I, "Do you think Canada wants to kill us since we share such a big border with them?" I flipped out explaining to him why he was a goddamn moron.   I worked for 18 months as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. It was mostly to help me build my resume as I'm a social work major looking into mental health, and it's related enough. The same guy as the Canada situation **tagged me** on Facebook in a picture of a cat with "Down syndrome". In fact, the cat was missing a facial bone and I explained why that was impossible and why saying it had DS was insensitive and actually extremely offensive. He said that people would do their own research and that he wasn't taking it down because he wasn't offending anybody.   I no longer associate with that individual.   What word should have been used?    My mom has four children. We are 44, 32, 20, and 19.   Thank you! Yours is pretty snazzy as well!   Yep. She loves it there! I hope it's as good for you as it is for her. :)   I wish I could do that. I feel hopelessly committed to everything and even when all I need to do is stay home and be with myself I have no choice, I just have to go.   My best friend from middle school goes there!   My wife and I have been together almost 5 years. Our room is a mess and we often can't remember when one another bathed. It works for us though.   I'll go against the grain. It was too soon. I was 15 and had been dating my 16 year old girlfriend for 2 months. We both agree that we should have waited longer. Neither of us was really ready and it lead to a lot of issues in our relationship for a while. We're 20 and 21 and married now though so it couldn't have been all bad.   You're kind of socially retarded if you have no dating experience by college, especially if it's because of mom and dad.  Edit: I literally meant socially delayed, not trying to insult people with developmental disabilities.   Discouraging exclusive relationships is encouraging promiscuity. There is nothing wrong with promiscuity, but be aware of that. People date younger now, too, and your forbidding it won't change that. You are setting your child up to be an outcast.   Sleepovers should not be allowed unless with people who are just friends. This won't stop sex, but will prevent it under your roof. Also, don't dismiss her relationship. I am married to a woman I started dating at 15. Her relationship may very well be real.   I know you are trying to do what's right, but you aren't really in the right decade.   Same to you. :-)   Plenty of kids don't take it seriously enough at all. I've heard about parties where young gay men try to get it as soon as possible so they don't have to worry about going bareback. That's terrifying. I didn't mean to minimize it, just explain that it isn't as awful as it was 30 years ago. Its still not something anyone should want to have; it is still deadly. I'm sorry that my explanation came off as blas like AIDS isn't a terrible thing. For anyone reading this, AIDS is awful and not something to be taken lightly, it's just less awful than it was a few decades ago.   Can you explain why it riled you so much? My intention wasn't to hurt feelings, but to explain the common confusion of AIDS then and now.      Thank you for that! That makes me feel really good!   Do you set your own price or is it decided by Amazon?   /r/hitsworthturkingfor     That's really shitty. I'm sorry you have had that in your life.   I'm basing that opinion on the men that I know, not any real evidence. You are beyond free to disagree.   I subscribe MFA because I love the community and a lot of the stuff they post is great. I can't actually afford anything they recommend but it gives me an idea of what looks good and what to pair it with. There is also /r/lesbianfashionadvice and /r/boifashionadvice, which I mod but it's like totally dead air.  	136
 I (thought I) had a really good friend when I was younger, a girl I went to school with. She and a bunch of other kids and I were all in advanced classes in middle school, and we were all pretty close up through high school. At first things were pretty great, but then there was a time in 8th grade when she just stopped talking to me for like a month. My other friends said she was mad at me, but I didn't know why. I'm usually pretty chill and easy to get along with. When I asked her about the reason she was mad, she just got all huffy and just said "you should know why."   Eventually she and another of my friends (whom she had apparently been talking to behind my back and had convinced to take her side) showed up to our group's lunch table with a list of grievances. She filled an entire page with bullshit she was mad at me about. Most of it was stuff so petty and minor I didn't even remember it happening. But some of it was incredibly hurtful - and a lot of the more hurtful things were outside my control. For instance, she looked down on me because I said I was interest certain things she liked, but unlike her I'd never actually pursued them. She saw that as me being some kind of poser who lied about stuff to get people to like me. What she hadn't considered was that my family was incredibly poor (not to mention incredibly dysfunctional), so although I was genuinely interested in a lot of her hobbies I would never be able to afford to try them. I merely wanted to share my friend's passion, regardless of whether or not I could do it to the same degree.   So after they spent over half the lunch period assaulting my character right in front of all my closest friends, and then told me that I was also bad at taking criticism - another load of bull, because if she'd told me about any of that shit earlier I would have definitely apologized and tried to do something about it - I had enough. I was in tears by that point, and simply left, choosing to sit at the other far end of the table. A few of my other friends saw how upset I was and tried to make me feel a little better, saying that my former bff had been very harsh and asking if I was okay or there was something they could do. But I spent most of the rest of the day feeling miserable anyway. I had never been made to feel so small and insignificant by a close friend before, and it hurt.   Not one to hold a grudge, I forgave her and we made amends. Although she was still very elitist, and would hoard grievances like food for the apocalypse, she didn't ever do a repeat performance of the lunch room list. So as far as I was concerned, all was well. But I should have taken that as a sign of things to come.   Fast forward about three years. Now we're all in 11th grade, and still all friends. Up until the previous summer I had never dated anyone or had a boyfriend. However, one of the guys in our friend group had a crush on me since 7th grade. In the past I had repeatedly turned him down and said I only wanted to be friends. This was partly because I hadn't wanted to date in general, but mostly because he was a prick. I was only friends with him because he was friends with my other friends.  This is relevant because I actually did start dating someone over the summer before 11th grade started. We met through mutual acquaintances and really hit it off, so after two months of dating we decided to tell all our friends. Most were surprised I had a boyfriend but still happy for us. The guy who had a crush on me ignored us, and started avoiding me at school.  I figured he was disappointed someone else was with me because he liked me, but he would eventually get over it. Nope. Instead he told everyone else how I apparently led him on and was terribly cruel to him (all bullshit, I told him from the beginning I didn't like him or want to date him). Pretty soon he suddenly seemed very close with my laundry list friend - which was odd, considering she HATED him before and even wrote a song about how creepy he was. At the lunch table, they started icing me out of conversations and generally made me feel unwelcome to the group. Once again, my friend was clearly mad at me but wouldn't tell me why. So I just said fuck it, I'm tired of all the lies and drama and being vilified for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I stopped being friends with both of them, and sat with another group of friends at lunch.   I was told later by my actual best friend that the guy had been making up a lot of stuff about me, including how I had apparently driven him to attempting suicide. She knew he was lying because he said he tried to hang himself and his voice was raspy, but only when he thought he thought she was listening - 15 min after telling her this she caught him talking to some other people perfectly normally, and not a bit depressed, but when he noticed her he suddenly got all raspy and sad again.   As for my former best friend, I'm fairly sure that she swallowed all the lies this guy was telling as it gave her another excuse to look down on me and be mad at me. I probably shouldn't have been surprised that they would team up in their distaste for me, but I was still upset that someone who claimed to be my friend would believe the bullshit from a guy she couldn't stand and would turn against me without even asking for my side. After that I said good riddance and only kept good friends in my life, so ultimately I'm better off for it.   I have this watch. For like the first 3 months after I bought it I would giggle a little bit every time I looked at it.   That chart is stupid and awful, seriously don't listen to these dudes who keep saying she's crazy just because she offered you casual sex. How is admitting you'd like to have sex with someone crazy?   What the fuck, dude. A woman wanting to have sex does not automatically make her crazy. NEWS FLASH, some women like having sex just as much as some men do because WHAT DO YOU KNOW having sex is a biological drive that all humans have to some degree or something???  You cannot possibly tell just by her offer of being FWB with OP that she is unstable or crazy. That is bullshit. Also bullshit - the idea that someone who has casual sex MUST have an STD. Nope. People who don't practice safe sex are more likely to have STDs, but you can get an infection from your first time just as easily as you can on your thousandth time. Stop filling this kid's head with stupidity.   ManLeader and That_Irate_Guy are right on this one. There is no special ~spiritual connection~ when you have sex with someone. Sex is just sex. The only things sex can give you besides the act itself is what YOU choose to attach to it. Wanting to have sex is natural and healthy - and having sex with someone is not giving away any part of yourself. That's just bullshit that religious conservatives spout in order to control their women-folk. The only reason that sexual relationships were ever attached to the idea of a "special connection" was so that people could try to control lineage and inheritance, and neither are nearly as relevant today as they were a few centuries ago.   Although virginity is overvalued in our society (especially for girls), I still think that you should be able to choose to lose your virginity on your own terms. If you would be more comfortable having sex for the first time with someone you trust and have developed a relationship with, then that's what you should do. You shouldn't have sex just to get it over with or just because you can - you should have sex because you want to. Good on you, OP, for sticking to what you want.  Also, like a lot of people have said, it's often a bad idea to sleep with coworkers because it can lead to a lot of drama. So it would probably be best if you didn't take her up on her offer anyway.   If she seriously thinks that having her wedding and house paid for will make a marriage magically work, not only is she dead wrong, but she still has a lot of growing up to do. There's no doubt, your daughter is straight up spoiled, and not only does she not appreciate your money (or your feelings) but it seems she is under the delusion that she shouldn't be responsible for her own relationships. I would second the idea that she should get some counseling, and you were right to stop enabling her. It might hurt when she says those awful things to you, and her feelings are probably hurt too, but in the long run you're doing your daughter a lot more good by standing firm in your decision.   You know, gay men might not get pregnant, but STDs are still a thing you can get regardless of pregnancy. Thus why I highly encourage girls/women to use condoms even if they're on the pill.   a turkey baster shaped like jodie fosters knuckles   That's very oddly specific. You have some strange kitchen implements.    I'd also heard variants that you shouldn't give a boyfriend/girlfriend a sweater, but it's okay to give to a fiance/spouse. The idea is that you shouldn't commit to such a huge project until you both commit to the relationship, otherwise you put all the time in for nothing if you end up breaking up with them.   You look like you had a lot of fun making this lol. Also I share your wish for identity denying assholes and their high horses to drown in a non-superpower-giving pool of acid.   Unless of course you have a gay son and a lesbian daughter, in which case with a boy you have to worry about all the penises and with the girl you don't have to worry about any.   I'm an asexual woman, but panromantic and I would totally be willing to have a relationship with a woman or someone who was non-binary. But I have been dating the same guy since I was 16, so I know how you feel. Definitely not the only one.   I actually had a communications seminar that was based on TED Talks and did a talk on asexuality for my final project. If you want to PM me, feel free and I can share some of my notes with you.   Oh! I'm so sorry, I don't mean you should expose yourself to sexual situations, only conversations about sex. I read back through my reply and realized I didn't clarify that at all. I didn't mean to imply you should have to have sex or watch porn or anything.  It might help if you just practice saying stuff out loud that normally makes you uncomfortable when you're by yourself, until you gradually get used to that. Then maybe you could get your friends on board and have practice conversations with them. That way you'd know how to handle it if it comes up in everyday situations.   This is true, but the show also does a really good job of making it absolutely clear that being a eunuch and being asexual are not the same thing. Eunuchs could still wish for something they couldn't have, which Varys says he never wanted in the first place. Being castrated did not affect his identity. So at least in my opinion, having the only openly asexual character be a eunuch is forgivable, especially since it's one of the few shows that will even openly admit we exist.   It is a bit fast, but honestly there isn't much to worry about. Sometimes you just find a really good fit, and I think this is one of those times. I appreciate the concern, though - I understand why it would seem rushed.   TL:DR; I told my mom I was poly and I had gotten engaged to my second partner, she took it well. Any advice for someone introducing a partner to their family for the first time?  I'm still freaking out a little right now, and kind of nervous, but overall the outcome was good! I just wanted to share, and maybe get some helpful advice or at least sympathy from people who've done this before.  Quick background: I have only ever been in two relationships, both of those with my current partners. The first one, Andy, I started dating when we were in highschool (over six years ago) and the second, Justin, I started seeing seven months ago, although we've been friends over a year. Andy and I have had an open relationship off and on for the last three years, but I never had a second partner or even dated anyone besides him until Justin.  I've been really worried for a long time about telling my mom I'm poly. Originally it was because the first time Andy and I decided to open our relationship failed miserably and my mom knew all about it. I didn't want to tell her about Justin until I knew it was serious, so that I could potentially quell any doubts she might have about whether or not dating two people was a good idea. More recently, I still hadn't told her about Justin because we haven't been on as good of terms - nearly every time we had a conversation we ended up fighting about money, which is definitely not the best time to tell someone "oh by the way I have two boyfriends."  Anyway, I posted on here recently about how Justin proposed, so it wasn't like I could keep him secret forever. So I planned on taking a weekend trip back to my hometown so he could meet my mom and sister. I called her tonight to tell her about it, and the conversation went something like this:  Mom: When are you and Andy coming back to town?  Me: Oh, I'm not coming up with Andy.  Mom: Who are you coming with then?  Me: Justin.  Mom: Who's Justin?  Me: My new fiancee?  Mom: Whoa, wait a minute, back up. What happened to Andy?  Me: We're still together.  Mom: [Confused] As in friends, or romantically?  Me: No, romantically. I'm engaged to them both.  Mom: Does Andy know about this?  Me: Yeah. He's fine with it. We're poly.  After that I explained to my reasonably confused mother what ethical nonmonogamy was, how our relationship worked, and that I really love both Justin and Andy and yes I was aware that this was complicated and there was a risk of getting hurt but we had all talked about that.  Overall, though, she said that she loved me no matter what and that she would support me, she just wanted to make sure I was happy. She also said she'd like to get together so Justin could get acquainted with her, her husband, and my younger sister. She even offered to let us stay with them in her new house (assuming it was okay with her husband), although we'll probably turn them down in favor of a hotel since Justin has said he isn't quite comfortable staying with complete strangers, even if they are my family, which I totally get.  I was so nervous about telling her about this for so long, it feels so weird now that it's finally out. But I'm really glad she's been supportive so far - I was really afraid that she wouldn't approve and it would put a strain on Justin. He tends to feel guilty if he feels like he's stressing me out (regardless of whether or not it's actually his fault, which it usually isn't) so it's good that things are going pretty smoothly.  Now I'm nervous for a different reason, although it's not as bad obviously. I've never had to go through the whole "introducing my partner to my family" scenario before. Andy and I started dating when we were 16, and he came over to hang out at my house before we started dating, so the introducing-your-date-to-your-family thing never happened there. If anyone has some advice I would really appreciate it! Otherwise, I hope you all have a lovely weekend :D   That sounds like a really tough situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through all that. I have gone through court cases involving family members before so I know it's incredibly nerve racking to be in the same court room as your abuser.  There are a lot of reasons why your father's family hasn't contacted you, but speaking as someone who also cut off contact with their father (well, technically stepfather in my case but he adopted me when I was very small) I can maybe give some insight to your situation.  I ended up completely cutting my stepdad out of my life a little over two and a half years ago, although I had slowly been phasing him out before then. I had two major reasons: my brother was physically and emotionally abusive, which my stepfather refused to acknowledge; also, he was emotionally abusive as well, and neglectful, and I could no longer continue to deal with his shit while also maintaining my mental health. For a long time afterward, I didn't hear from his family at all, and I asked a lot of the same questions you did during that time.  Later on I finally heard from his sister, who had been kindest to me over the years. One day she found me on facebook and invited me over for dinner, just her and her kids and me. I had a good time seeing them again, and when she took me back to a friend's house I was staying at for the summer I finally had a private moment to talk to her.  At that point, she asked me why I had abandoned my father and if it was because of the divorce he was going through with my mother at the time. I was astonished to find out that she knew barely anything about my brother's behavioral issues, and after telling her about the recent interactions I'd had with him (where, by the way, he threatened to kill me multiple times), she suddenly understood why I was having so many issues with my stepdad, who was complicit in the abuse from my brother.  Although I'm still on shaky ground with his family, I can tell you that there's a good chance they don't have any idea how bad things are for you right now. If you like your father's family and want to maintain a relationship with them, or even just want closure, you should try to contact them. Tell them your side of things, let them know what is going on, and they might surprise you.  All the best.   And what criteria are you using to determine whether a stranger one the internet, after a mere few paragraphs of describing one issue that they have, must be clinically depressed? Which, by the way, "clinical depression" is not a diagnosis.  This sort of comment is not at all helpful and only serves to reinforce the idea that non-heteronormative people are all crazy. And the whole "there must be something wrong with your hormones" line is so overused around asexual people. Kindly refrain from spouting such harmful and irrelevant nonsense to people looking for serious help about their sexual identity in the future.   Well, the short answer is, you don't. Sexual identity isn't something you "get over," you either live with it, accept it, or try to hide it. Sometimes it can change over time, but it's not something you can just will away.  That said, this knowledge won't necessarily help you. It seems like what you want is not to "get over" being "asexualish" as you put it, but being more comfortable talking about sex or sexual situations as it's starting to affect your interpersonal relationships. There's nothing wrong with being asexual, and it's not something you should feel like you have to get rid of. But not wanting to be made uncomfortable by even the idea of sex? Although you shouldn't feel bad about being uncomfortable about it (you can't help it, it's okay) I can definitely see why you don't like being in that situation and it's probably something that you could actually change.  I'm not entirely sure how you would go about doing it, other than practice. If you slowly expose yourself to that sort of thing over time, you would most likely be able to gradually feel more comfortable with it (or at least less squicked out).   I really liked Makina's route, mostly because I preferred how they handled the similar themes found in Yumiko's route. My favorite route is still Sachi's though. Possibly because [](#s "I have PTSD, so I can relate to her struggles with trauma. Also, she is the only one who had a decent family that we actually got to see, unlike Makina and Yumiko who had terrible shitty parents and Michiru and Amane who seemed to have relatively normal families but we didn't see a whole lot from them").   I just started [If My Heart Had Wings](https://vndb.org/v9093) and [World End Economica](https://vndb.org/v7184). I haven't gotten very far in either (haven't even made choices yet) because I just got them like a week ago. I usually make progress a lot faster than that, but I also got a lot of games for the holidays and I wanted to play those first since people were nice enough to give them to me.  Edit: forgot to link   No problem! I know that I would have had things a lot easier when I was younger if I knew there were other people out me like there and I had someone to guide me through it, and I'm sure a lot of people on here feel the same way, so if there's any thing I can do I want to help people out. If I had one wish for the next generation of aces, it would be that they wouldn't have to go through so many years of loneliness like we all did before the internet and research and whatnot. So I'm glad I could help you, even if it's only a little bit. :)   Yes, it's perfectly normal for you to feel confused. I went through a pretty similar experience growing up. I felt like something was weird or wrong with me growing up, then I discovered the asexual identity and community and I felt a lot better, but not all at once. I still have days, a few years after coming out now, where I have down periods and I still get that uneasy feeling. That's totally normal.  I'm glad you have some support with your sister. In my experience, most therapists have never heard about asexuality and I actually had to educate mine about nearly everything there is with being ace. The research on it is still very, very new - the first peer-reviewed study on it was only published about a decade ago, so this is understandable (if unfortunate).  I think you should come out to people as you feel more comfortable. Coming out doesn't happen all at once, it's a process, and a lot of people start with those who they feel safer telling - people they know will be supportive, like your sister. If you think your friends will also be supportive, telling them might help you gain more confidence to tell your family; plus, they will be there for you if other people don't take the news so well.  Welcome to our family, and I hope that everything goes well for you! Don't ever be afraid to ask questions here, or get advice, or even just vent to people. We're all here for you!   Yeah, there are lots of people who don't identify as male or female. I'm pretty similar to you, actually. I consider myself somewhere between genderqueer and agender. So you're not the only one ;)   Nope, it's not too early. Most people are pretty sure of their sexuality by puberty, and I've pretty much known I was ace since I was around 8.   Yes, I live in the U.S., but no, I most likely will not be legally married to them both. On paper I'll only be married to one of them, but I'll still have a ceremony for both.   I was so excited I didn't stop grinning the whole weekend. My face actually started to hurt.   Double woot!   Thanks!   I know, right?? Funny thing is, if you told me a year ago I'd be engaged to two guys I would have laughed in your face. Whenever my first partner and I decided to open up our relationship back then, I had no intentions of seeing anyone else. Then I pretty much fell ass-backwards into a date with the guy who is now my new fiance seven months ago, and things took off from there.   No, I don't. Actually my other partner and I are always broke because he just graduated college a few weeks ago and I'm still attending. Basically we agreed to get married a few months back but I don't have a ring from him. Whenever he does get a ring though, I will be sure to post it :)   You know, I didn't even think about that but now I can't stop hearing it either.   Thank you!    It isn't the haircut that makes me think this, it's fleeting but ongoing conversations/comments over the past 10 years.  I figured this was the case, I was mostly just trying to make a point about how sometimes we pick up cues that we think lead to one thing but actually lead to something else entirely. I'm glad you recognize this.  To be honest, I also went through a similar process as a kid. When I was super little I played with Barbies and my third birthday was all pink (except for the plates, which were Jurassic Park themed because I insisted). Then at the beginning of grade school, I shifted away from wearing skirts or dresses, started hanging out with mostly boys, and focused on more stereotypical male interests. I was always a tomboy, but during middle school I toned it down a bit. Mostly it was due to social pressure to conform. Sometimes it's easier to just compromise what you want for your outward appearance, rather than deal with other people constantly judging you for it.  I think one of the hardest parts about being out and obviously queer is that you have to constantly field questions and comments - some benign, others hurtful - from people who obviously recognize you as "different" and "other". I know one of the biggest reasons that I didn't come out for a long while is because I was very much aware of this difference and was tired of dealing with people about it all the time. Sometimes it felt like people were focusing so much on the way I dressed or who I was (or wasn't) with, they weren't actually seeing *me*.   Of course, there are also times where you just get fed up with playing along, say "fuck that noise", and decide to just be you, even if that you is very obviously different. Just like your daughter I went from very long hair to cutting it all of at 14 over spring break, and I never looked back. So yeah, it's probably safe to assume that she's trying to negotiate who she is and how she expresses that with society's expectations of who she should be. We all go through that growing up, it's just not always so visibly obvious.   FYI, "gypsy" is considered a racial slur used against people who are Romani. A lot of people don't know that it's a slur, so I figured I would let you know. A lot of people who are Romani or of Romani descent are really offended by its use, as it was a term applied to them and not one they historically used or typically use today.  Now that that's out of the way, the pics are really nice and it's some good craftsmanship. Thanks for sharing.   Thanks! I appreciate it :)   You sound like a loving and concerned father, who wants to do all he can to do right by his children. So don't worry about making mistakes too much - your heart is definitely in the right place, and your kids seem like they are very much in good hands.  As for your concerns, if this is a major concern for you, then there is no reason you shouldn't talk with your kids about it. Of course you don't want to assume anything about your child's identity based purely on how they dress or cut their hair. I'm female-bodied and a lot of people assume I'm a lesbian because I wear men's clothes and cut my hair short in a typically masculine style, but that isn't even close - I'm actually gender nonconforming and asexual. Sometimes reality is much more complicated than appearances.  If I were you, I would approach this from "let's talk about this topic." There are plenty of times when parents talk to their kids about plenty of topics, and you can start the conversation like that. Just tell them you'd like to discuss trans people, because it's something you'd like to make sure they know about. Ask your daughter(?) what she knows about trans issues, and explain to her as best you can anything she doesn't know. You could potentially look at educational videos or websites for this, too. Make sure to express to her explicitly that you have no problems with trans people and you want to be a supportive ally. Sometimes just knowing that your family is vaguely not negative about these things isn't enough to make someone feel comfortable coming out to them - after all, this can be a matter of life or death for a queer or trans person. And tell her that no matter what, regardless of her sexual or gender identity, you will be there for her and you love her unconditionally. That kind of support is so crucial and can mean everything for a young queer or trans person. Then, if she is trans, hopefully she will feel comfortable coming out to you. Don't push the issue - she will come to you on her own time. Especially if she herself isn't sure of her identity or is just exploring possibilities with gender expression, she might not be ready to talk about it yet, and that's okay.  Hopefully all goes well, and I wish you all the best with raising your kids! Keep being an awesome dad.  Edit - accidentally hit send too early   Thank you!   Thanks!   The term "asexual" applies to anyone who does not feel physical attraction to any sex or gender. If you don't find yourself physically attracted to anyone, then you would be asexual. Of course, you are the only one who can choose to identify as such, so whether or not you use the label is up to you.  On that note, you do say you are attracted to people, but you didn't specify a type of attraction. Lots of asexual people sill feel romantically attracted to people (and this can be heteroromantic, homoromantic, biromantic, panromantic, etc. just like sexual attraction). If you've never heard these terms or are confused, usually physical attraction is being interested in someone's body or appearance, and thinking that you would like to be physically intimate with them (hugging, kissing, sex, etc.) while romantic attraction usually refers to things like being attracted to someone's personality, wanting to spend time with them, wanting to get to know them, or imagining a relationship with them.  If you experience physical attraction, but are repulsed by the act of sex itself, that's different than being asexual. Asexuality doesn't mean that you don't like sex - that's a common misconception. Although some asexuals are sex-averse and don't like sex at all, there are others who are neutral to it (I fall into this category) or who like and enjoy it. Studies show that people who identify as asexual tend to have slightly lower libidos on average, but still have plenty of participation in sexual behaviors.  All that said, I don't want you to feel like your feelings are invalid if you aren't asexual. Only you can really know what your identity is, but regardless you shouldn't have to do something for the sake of a relationship if you are made that uncomfortable by it. You should talk to your husband about this. Let him know that you just don't want to have sex, and why. There's a good chance he'll take it personally or assume you're no longer attracted to him. That's only natural - after all, even you considered that possibility. But this has nothing to do with him. You need to make sure to express that to him - there is nothing he's done wrong or could possibly to do make this better, you just don't like sex.  Also, I'd like to reiterate the suggestion you consider therapy. If your repulsion toward sex or how that repulsion is affecting your relationships is a concern for you, speaking with a counselor or therapist might help you work through that and figure out what you should do about it.  I hope that helps, and wish you well in the future. :)   Hey, everyone! I don't have a lot of people to tell about this, because only a select friend group even knows I'm poly, let alone dating two people. So forgive me, I just wanted to gush a bit!  This weekend, one of my partners popped the big question - and I said yes! We're engaged!! I'm so excited (and a little bit nervous). But more than anything I can't wait to be married to him. I am now officially ~double engaged~  Join me in my happy dance!!  Oh, and here's a picture of the rings he got us: http://imgur.com/Lb4YvOC   Yeah, that sounds like you're probably aromantic. It means you don't experience emotional attraction to other people, or at least that it's so low or infrequent as to be negligable. You aren't the only one, and it's perfectly okay.   At least now you have an excuse to make a few cute baby clothes! Assuming you have time after taking care of the little one, of course.   I haven't ever had someone tell me they didn't really like a gift I hand-made for them that I can remember, but I do have anxiety about this pretty much every time I make something. The closer I get to finishing and giving it to someone, the more I sit there working on it thinking, "I've already spent like two weeks making this, what if they don't like it??" But I also only try to make things that I know people will really like and that are practical or at least related to something I know they love (for instance, I'm currently making a Doctor Who cross stitch for a couple who are friends of mine and pretty big fans of the show). I've also probably gotten pretty lucky.  Something I've had less luck with is people not showing appreciation for the time I put into these gifts, rather than not appreciating the final product. This year my mother texted me on Dec. 4th to tell me that she wanted three separate gifts made. One was some boot cuffs for my 13-year-old sister; I made three pairs finished those in a weekend. The next one was a little tougher - a Batman hat for my 5-year-old cousin. That's what I've been working on for the past week, but I'm doing the finishing touches now, so it will still be done by the time I give it to him Christmas Day.  But the kicker was the gift she requested for herself. She wanted [this  shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/25-13-shawl), which calls for super fine yarn, a 3.00 mm hook, and complex lace work. To top it all off, she wanted it to be either navy blue or dark purple. Most of my local yarn stores have hardly any options for lace weight yarns, and 99% of the ones they do have are either baby yarns (so pastel colors) or made from wool (which both of us are seriously allergic to). And she asks for all of these things exactly three weeks before Christmas. I was really pissed.  Thankfully my favorite LYS had ONE YARN that was 100% alpaca, a wonderful dark purple tone, and was only $10 per hank (I needed two). I'm pretty sure that's the closest to a Christmas miracle that I will ever get.  Needless to say, whenever I show up to visit her for the holidays with only like 15 rows done and she complains about not getting a gift I will definitely lay into her about it.   Okay so there are officially four people on Reddit who have both seen Princess Jellyfish and love crochet. MY PEOPLE   I don't think that her wanting OP to stand up for her is narcissistic at all. It's perfectly normal for people to expect that a significant other will have their back and will defend them to other people when they're being shitty.  In this situation, OP's gf cut her hair (which OP didn't say anything about, only that she couldn't dye it), and OP freaked out because he doesn't think his parents will like it. That might be the case, or they might not end up caring after all, but either way, I think the gf is reasonable to think that OP will still support her. It's not being rebellious to want to live by your own standards, not the standards of some other person's parents who have never met you and who quite frankly have rather bullshit standards anyway. You can't expect your parents to get along with every partner you ever have perfectly, and you shouldn't expect your partners to tailor themselves perfectly to all of your family members' tastes.  It would be one thing if it were over something major, like what sort of religious ceremony they'll have for their wedding or how they'll raise their kids. But this is a freaking haircut. If OP's parents want to get all up in arms over something that will grow back in a few months anyway on someone else's head that they likely won't see very often regardless, then that's their prerogative. But OP and his gf shouldn't have to put up with that, and it's a stupid thing to care about. Plus, if OP isn't willing to go to bat over something that is relatively minor and at most should only get one or two passive aggressive comments or negative looks, then it doesn't bode well for them when they DO finally get to tougher issues.   On the one hand, I get where you're coming from. Having parents or other family with different views from you can sometimes make things pretty difficult or awkward, especially when someone else you care about forces you to confront this difference. I've had to deal with several family members and their homophobic views whenever I talk about queer issues (many of my friends and I myself are queer).  On the other hand, I've also been in your girlfriend's shoes. It can be incredibly frustrating when someone you care about disapproves of your choices, especially when they personally don't care but are afraid of what other people might think.  I had a similar experience earlier in college. I went to the same college as my boyfriend, and I didn't get along with my bf's roommate very well. On more than one occasion I had arguments with this roommate, and my bf would often get upset at me. He told me that it stressed him out when the person he was in love with and the person he was living with didn't get along, because it put him in the middle. He often tried to tell me to avoid conflict with this person, because the way he argued it, I might have a fight with him for a few minutes, but he would be the one having to live with the guy for the rest of the year, so it wasn't worth it.  However, this was incredibly hurtful to me. Like your girlfriend, I was upset that my boyfriend didn't want to stand up for me, especially because we'd been dating for years but this guy was just some douche the university assigned him to live with. To me, having to live with a slightly awkward roommate situation for a semester or two paled in comparison to potentially ruining the romantic relationship you have had and potentially would continue to have for much longer.  Of course, your situation is different. This isn't a roommate you're talking about - someone you can never see again and probably not care that much. It's your parents. You probably love your parents a lot, and your gf a lot, so those feelings of being caught in the middle are most likely pretty intense.  What you should remember, though, is that you aren't the only one who is feeling this discomfort. Your gf probably doesn't feel that great either, because your parent's views seem to be that people like her are somehow wrong or unworthy or whatever. And if you admonish her for doing something your parents might not like, in a way you are also telling her that you don't think she's good enough either. I know you don't mean it like that, but that's how it can come across - she might be seeing this as "you think your parent's shitty opinions are more important than me being able to just be who I am and feeling good about that." OP, I can't tell you how to feel about all this, but there's a good chance that's how your gf is feeling, and hopefully that knowledge might help you out a little.  If I were you, I would make sure to tell your gf what YOU think of her hair. She was obviously excited about showing you her new 'do, so she probably wants your approval. If your first reaction was "what will my parents think??" then that would make her upset too. So if you haven't already, tell her how beautiful you think she is!  As far as your parents go, whenever you take her to meet them, stay casual. Don't make a fuss about her hair. If they bring it up, and say something negative about it, then just tell them something like "I love my girlfriend and I think she's an amazing person. If you honestly think that something as trivial as a haircut is that big a deal, then you're not looking at who she really is." They might be tempted to judge her on appearances, but hopefully they'll be reasonable enough to realize that ultimately what's important is that you are happy with this person - a person who is the same inside regardless of how short her hair is.   Yep. And I'm an X. Yay for breaking scales!   And of course, not all people who identify as bi like men or women equally either. It's almost like human sexuality is this really complex thing that doesn't fit neatly into label boxes, lol.   On the other hand, I have known a few people who identify as bi but are only attracted to, for example, women and androgynous people but not men. "Bi" implies only two, and not which two those are, so the use of pan more explicitly says "no I like everything." Still though, like you said, people have the right to choose their own label and I know a lot of folks who use "bi" because not many people know what pansexual means or have never heard the term before, but generally get the idea behind bisexuality.   I teared up a little reading that. I have had a lot of the same feelings when thinking about whether or not to come out to some of my family members. It's rough sometimes. But hey, you'll always have your internet family, yeah?   For some reason the first thing that popped into my head was that the creeper was possessed by a demon and that's why its head got turned around   That's what I was trying to get at. I'm pretty sure the other person was objecting because of the context of OP's post, but I agree that as long as both friends are okay with it then it's fine to have more intimate touching.   I'm really glad so many people on here are telling you to stick up for yourself. Because it's true - if these people were really your friends they wouldn't want to do anything to make you uncomfortable. And if they can't handle their liquor, they have no business getting drunk.   I've gotten smashed with my friends a few times, but I've never inappropriately touched one of my friends. Why? Because I respect other's boundaries when I'm sober, and even if I'm drunk, I still feel that way. Yeah sure we all do silly or embarrassing things sometimes while drinking, but harassment is never okay. If your "friends" think it's okay to touch you because they're drinking, odds are they never had much respect for your personal boundaries to begin with - and that's not someone I want to be friends with.   Intimacy in a friendship is fine, as long as both parties agree to that. But the issue here is that OP never consented, and you really shouldn't start randomly groping your friends without their permission. It's a whole separate issue than if you and your friend have a mutual understanding that touching is okay.   But if they wanted me to yarn over wouldn't they use yo for the notation? Thus my confusion.  Oh well. In any case I'll try it, because it ends up with the same number of stitches and that's all that really matters.  Thanks!   But if they wanted me to yarn over wouldn't they use yo for the notation? Thus my confusion.  Oh well. In any case I'll try it, because it ends up with the same number of stitches and that's all that really matters.  Thanks!   Hello, fellow knitters! I come to you seeking your infinite wisdom on all things knitting. Usually my google-fu and YouTube will help get me through any questions I have about new stitches, but this time around I'm not getting squat on my search results so I figured it was time to reach out for help.  I'm currently working on the [Buttercup Scarflet](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/buttercup-scarflet) pattern I found on Ravelry, and I'm on row 3 of the pattern repeat (so frustrating, I've got barely 2 inches and I already have to stop). The row reads like this:   Row 3: K1, P1, K1, sm, P4, sm, Bundle 3, P4, K6, P4, Bundle 3, sm, P4, sm, K1, P1, K1  The part I'm having problems with is the "Bundle 3" stitching. The pattern defines the special stitches and here's what it says:   Bundle 3 = wyib slip 1 st, (k1, yf, k1), psso the (k1, yf, k1)  I don't quite get what they're wanting here, maybe I'm just being dense, but I've never done this stitch before. So I start with the yarn in the back, I slip one stitch, I knit a stitch, then I bring the yarn forward, and ... what? How am I supposed to knit the next stitch?  Someone please explain it to me like I'm five because I have no idea.   Or maybe it should go exactly as planned, because things going exactly as stated pretty much never happens in this series. The dramatic tension would be all of us going, "wait, she actually pulled it off? No way, it can't be that easy. Something has to go wrong." Cue paranoid readers biting their nails waiting for a downside that never happens and GRRM laughing maniacally.   Same here - I got a slightly older one refurbished. But no new laptop I've seen has VGA anymore. It's like trying to make an argument that we shouldn't update to DVD players because VHS still exists   This reminds me of a conversation I had with a professor the other day. I was complaining about how we have to either use an adaptor or a school laptop (which are hella slow) when doing presentations, because the school's projectors only have VGA and most of the students have newer laptops which use HDMI.  Me: "The university should really upgrade to HDMI. Nothing uses VGA anymore."  Professor: "Well they won't do that because they can't justify spending money on something that isn't standard."  Uh huh ... According to her, HDMI is too new to be considered standard. Meanwhile, literally every person who owns a laptop has an HDMI port.   I live in the US, and in my state teachers can retire at 55 assuming they've been teaching for 30 years.   I never understood why at a doctor's office where you can only make appointments and they don't take walkins you can be delayed for an hour and a half yet they expect you to show up 15 min early. Oh well.   A little stressful. I woke up at 5:30 AM and couldn't fall back asleep (I usually wake up around 8:30 AM so this is significantly earlier for me). Then I had a doctor's appointment at 9:30, which I was late to because Google Maps took me to 400 WEST street name instead of 400 EAST street name. Then despite getting there ten minutes late I still had to wait around for over an hour before the doctor actually saw me. And I will have to have another appointment on Friday to get some testing done. Ugh.  Meanwhile my classes have been pretty boring and I nearly fell asleep during a discussion because I was so tired :(   I have a hard time with cold. Let's compromise and have one that's kind off cold but not too bad ;)   Fuck it, let's just found an island country or something   Okay but what is the most liberal of all the states? I need to plan ahead so I don't accidentally end up in one that later becomes conservative lol   That is not a word I'm familiar with, and for context I'm a native English speaker from the southern US. But it does sound similar.  In the case of mansplaining though it's specifically a man doing it to a woman, because it's meant to describe a form of sexism. So a besserwisser might be mansplaining in that context, but not always.   Your chocolate scenario is a good example, but the term also applies to more objective topics. For instance, say a man tried to explain to a woman how computers work on a basic level because he assumes women aren't good with technology, but he doesn't realize she's actually a computer programmer and knows more than he does as just a common layman. That would also be mansplaining.   Basically, woman is talking about subject. Man interrupts to give unsolicited "expertise" to supposedly enlighten woman. Woman already knows everything he said, or possibly he's just spouted a bunch of nonsense she knows is wrong. Woman declares man is mansplaining, as he assumed because of her gender that she's ignorant and because he is male his knowledge is more authoritative than hers. And a lot of men don't even realize they're doing it.   To illustrate why so many women find this irritating, here's another comparison. Imagine you were a botanist with a doctorate, and you went to a conference to discuss sciencey plant stuff (full disclosure, I am not a botanist so just go with me here). In the middle of giving a presentation, a five year old runs up on stage to interrupt and tell you that plants grow because sunshine makes them happy. If you were in a good mood you might be amused by the kid's antics. But most likely you'd be annoyed that this kid interrupted your important discussion with other people who actually know what they're talking about to spout this nonsense. Now imagine that half the population was made up of five year olds, and most professors, politicians, police officers, doctors, etc. were also five year olds, and the society and culture as a whole supported the idea that the opinions of five year olds were more important than those of adults. See the problem?  Not to say, of course, that men are immature or don't know about anything, I was merely using the kid as an example of someone who had no possible way of fully understanding what they're talking about. The main takeaway here is that we all know more about some subjects than others, and you shouldn't assume you know more than someone else, especially based on that person's gender.   I can't tell if you're being serious or not?   Ah yes, thank you. I couldn't remember the name of it.   I live in Louisville, which is like the only mostly liberal part of a very conservative Kentucky. I'm so glad I moved here from my small hometown, living in a conservative environment is not so good for a queer person's health.   It's as they say, you have to be at least somewhat competent at something to realize just how little you know about it. And I'm glad you think so - that means a lot coming from you :)   Oh yes. Funny story, actually - my roommate and close friend once told me that when we met he was somewhat wary of me because I told him I was a psych major and I potentially wanted to go into counseling. He was really afraid I would try to diagnose him with a bunch of bullshit, like most psych majors he'd met, but was later surprised by how nonjudgemental I was. We became really good friends though and still live together.   No, mansplaining is more specifically when a man talking to a woman or group of women tries to act as if he knows more than the women do about a particular subject, when in reality he has no idea what he's talking about or might have some knowledge but not nearly as much as the woman does. This is especially true of situations where men try to posit themselves as experts whenever woman are taking about women-specific issues or female experiences.   In this video the term is highly relevant, as whenever the female guest tried to explain why she doesn't like being cat-called, the male guest then proceeded to tell her that he's an expert in how men think and therefore he knows more about cat-calling than she does. He then states that all women want is to be told they are pretty, and that if the guy harassing her was hot she wouldn't care, despite her just stating only a few seconds ago that she doesn't like it when men give her unsolicited comments when all she's trying to do is get to work or run errands or whatever (and add the female guest points out, that has nothing to do with how men think, which he's supposedly an expert on, but how women think). He doesn't acknowledge what she says, just tells her why she is wrong about her own feelings, which he cannot possibly know more about than her. In a word, mansplaining.  Edit: typo, clarifying   It's not really an official diagnosis obviously, just a colloquial term for a common phenomenon lol. And yes, most likely your parents' biases have affected her. A lot of people will try to claim their beliefs are unbiased because SCIENCE. What they don't realize is that the researchers and everyone else interpreting the results are not nearly so objective as they like to believe. Even unintentional biases affect results. But the studies showing some sort of negative for lgbtq people (they're crazy, they're pedophiles, they are delinquents or criminals, etc.) have long since been debunked - that's why homosexuality was removed from the DSM in the 1970s and is no longer considered a mental illness.   Well like I said, that's part of the problem - there are different definitions out there for what romantic love is. But most people tend to agree that it's an "I know it when I see it" kind of thing.   And yes, I would say that my feelings toward a romantic partner and a platonic friend are different, but again it's hard to pin down exactly when that line is crossed. There are things like having children or getting married, for instance, that you don't typically do with friends. But how is hanging out with a friend at the movies different from going on a date with someone at the movies (especially if the latter does not include sexual contact)? The actual actions don't matter as much, but the intent and feelings differ. And I think that's what it comes down to - what do the people involved call it?   I think that everyone views love a little differently, and therefore it's really hard to answer your question definitively. It is true that our society places a heavy emphasis on a physical component of love - after all, most people who say that they're in a sexless relationship are complaining, because usually when your partner doesn't want to have sex with you that's an indicator something is wrong. This is often used against asexuals - we're sometimes told by people that we aren't *really* in love with someone unless we are physically attracted to them; otherwise, how is our "love" any different from friendship?  But I would say that there are certainly some similarities between the love I feel for someone and the love a straight person might feel for someone. I know that I love someone because I feel a desire to spend time with them, they bring out the best parts of me, and I want them to be happy. I imagine us getting married, maybe having kids. I can't help but smile when they're around and I know they feel the same way about me. So yeah, it's entirely possible that aces and straight people can feel the same or similar kind of love. After all, love is not determined solely by your orientation. Sure, there are people who might feel love in different ways or who experience different kinds of love, but that doesn't entirely rule out the possibility, you feel me?   Hey! Welcome to our sub. I hope you find some good friends here :D  I am also studying psychology, and unfortunately your sister has a condition common in our field of study - PDS, or pseudo-diagnosis syndrome. In other words, she (and many other psych majors) have a tendency to try to diagnose family, friends, or casual acquaintances with psychological illnesses that they totally had to write a paper on once. Long story short, she's full of it.   Not only is there absolutely no actual evidence that people who were abused later become gay or otherwise not-straight, she cannot possibly determine what your sexuality is or should be. You are the only one who can determine that. I know that it feels really awful and demeaning when someone dismisses your sexual identity (I've had family do it to me too when I tried to come out to them), but the good news is what she says doesn't have to affect how you view yourself or your ultimate happiness. She's wrong, and her continuing to not believe you can like girls and guys doesn't make you any less bi. The best thing you can do is just brush her off and keep being you. Science is not on her side, it's on yours - if you like, you can look up recent studies on human sexuality that talk about how common bisexuality is and show these to her. Who knows if she'll accept it, but in any case just know that there are people here at least who do believe you, and who are proud of who you are.  Good luck OP, and all the best!   OP, your bf is being ridiculous. There is nothing embarrassing about using a mobility device such as crutches, a wheelchair, or a scooter when you are clearly injured. And it is impossible to miss those boot things, so it's not like anyone would mistake you for one of these "lazy fat-ass slobs" he seems to be so concerned about. He has got some serious fat phobia and ablism issues if he's reacting this strongly to you using a scooter that you obviously need. You weren't embarrassing him or making a spectacle, you were being practical. The scooters are made specifically for people like you who are injured, or others like those who are elderly who have trouble walking for some other reason. Why should you be ashamed of using something for its intended purpose?  If I were you, I wouldn't take this lying down. He's so clearly wrong, it almost hurts. If anything he should be apologizing to you for being such an ass. And if he continues to make a fuss over this, I would highly consider dumping him. The kind of person who would try to belittle their injured girlfriend for using a motor scooter while shopping and then have the gall to act like it's somehow her fault he had issues with it is not someone who is worth your time.   That's fair. And like I said, I'm sure you meant well, it was just worded a bit weirdly. I totally understand wanting to make sure she has as much info as possible. Thanks for the clarification. Also, since we're sharing stories, I pretty much had the opposite experience as you - at first I thought I was most likely demi because I had a boyfriend and I didn't hate sex with him (I was under the incorrect impression that asexuals all hate sex). Then after a while I figured out that I am actually just ace, and having better sex didn't change that, but rather reaffirm my asexual identity. Funny how that stuff goes, huh?   I rather doubt that OP's sister is just having bad sex. The way she describes being physically repulsed seems very much asexual to me, especially when it goes beyond sex to not liking other things such as kissing. And having better sex does not make one suddenly become attracted to people. I'm sure you mean well, but your argument is rather is perilously close to the "but you haven't had sex with ME yet" or "maybe you just haven't had GOOD sex" arguments people often use to dismiss asexual identities.   Others have addressed the first two questions so I'd like to address number three specifically.  I identify as a panromantic asexual; in other words, I am emotionally attracted to all genders, but I am not physically attracted to people at all. I am rather neutral toward sex - although I don't mind having sex with a partner I am in a relationship with, I also have practically no sex drive and never initiate sex. Additionally, I am polyamorous and practice ethical non-monogamy. I believe that people are capable of loving more than one person simultaneously, and myself and my partners have a relationship format that is not restricted to only two people, with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. I am currently dating two men, one of whom is also poly and currently seeing two other women besides me. The other is monogamous and I am his only partner.  So long story short, yes - it is totally okay to be with guys and not want to have sex with them, and it is totally okay if they have sex with someone else in order to fulfill their physical needs. The best way to go about this is an open and honest communication with your partner(s) - let them know what you want out of the relationship, ask what they want, and try to figure out where to go from there. If you really like a guy but the idea of having sex with them is totally unappealing (this makes it sound like you are asexual and sex-aversive or sex-repulsed to me), then tell them. Just say, "hey, I like you, but I just don't particularly like sex. It has nothing to do with you, it just isn't something I enjoy doing." If your partner is at all a decent person then they will be understanding about this.  At that point, you can then discuss sex in your relationship. Would your partner prefer to just abstain from having sex, or would they like to have sex with other people? That's up to them. If you are fine with them having a sexual relationship with someone else, that's usually referred to as an open relationship. My first partner and I have been in an open relationship for quite some time now; my second partner doesn't wish to date or have sex with anyone else, though. What's important is working out what is best for everyone. Also, make sure that you are clear about boundaries and what sorts of behaviors are acceptable. For instance, with my first partner, I have an agreement that we always use condoms and he will always use condoms with his other partners unless both he and the other partner are tested for STDs and are clean, and they notify everyone else they come into sexual contact with that they will not be using condoms. Also, we both let each other know when we are interested in someone else and if we will be spending time with another person to avoid scheduling conflicts. Other than that, he and I are both allowed to date whoever we like and have sex with whoever we like, there are no other rules. Other people, however, have more strict guidelines: some like to meet their partner's new date before they have sex, some reserve the ability to "veto" their partner's choice of other partners, etc. There is no one right answer here, just make sure that you talk it over with your partner and decide what is best for you, and make sure to communicate that clearly with them.  If you would like more information about open relationships and how best to go about them, you should check out /r/polyamory or /r/nonmonogamy.   My advice? Try to at least finish this semester. If you drop out now you'll still owe the school money, but if you stick with it you could get at least a few credit hours toward a degree if you ever decide to go back to school.  Talk to your professors. Go see them during office hours. If you're struggling with the material or just the workload, most professors are willing to work with you on it so you can still get a decent grade. Don't be afraid or intimidated - they are supposed to help you, it's their job as an educator.  Also, talk to an advisor. Most schools these days have staff for advising you on how to navigate your degree and whatnot, and it doesn't cost extra to talk to them. They might be able to help you figure out what's best for you and if college is really a good fit. They will be able to help you lay out your options and hopefully make your decision easier.  If your school has it, go to their tutoring service. People who get tutoring statically get better grades. Even honors students benefit from it, there is no shame in going.   Lastly, if you feel lonely or that you don't fit in socially, try joining a club, volunteer organization, or intramural shorts team. There are plenty of interest groups on campuses; try to find one you like, or seems fun to try. It's a great way to meet new people who have something in common with you, and it helps break up the monotony of classes.   Hope that helps, and good luck with whatever you decide to do, op.   I often have a hard time taking to people I don't know well, especially strangers, but I've found that knitting and crochet make great ice breakers. Often people will ask me what I'm making, I'll tell them all about my project, and then they'll say something like "that's so neat, I wish I knew how to do that." It really makes meeting people a lot easier, because it's already gotten the conversation going, and I know that they  admire one aspect of who I am because they have me a compliment, which gives me a nice little confidence boost. After that, I feel a lot more sure of myself, and the conversation goes pretty well. It's even better if they're a crafter too, because then we can talk about techniques and patterns and already I feel like I've made a new friend.   Huh. So basically the idea is they just want to sell it to adults instead of kids? Okay. TIL   It seems like you are really unhappy with your relationship and you want out, but you feel responsible for this guy. Don't. He is not your responsibility. He is an adult, his situation is his own fault. If you break up with him and kick him out, you are not leaving him homeless - his own immaturity and poor behavior is what got him there. Don't blame yourself for his mishandling of things.   Any relationship where someone takes is that dependent on another is not healthy. It seems likely to me that he is very much aware of how poorly off he would be if you were no longer in the picture and he is taking advantage of your kindness. I know you love him and it your first instinct is to protect the ones you love, but you aren't doing him any favors and you're making things worse for yourself. I would suggest telling him that he needs to get a job if he doesn't already have one, and start paying his share of the bills - half of rent, gas, groceries, etc. Otherwise, he no longer gets to use your gas, eat your food, and live in your house. Because that's what he's currently doing - taking and using *your* stuff that *you* paid for. And if he won't help out financially, you can easily take legal action to kick him out. You need to make it clear to him that you are not his mother - it is not your job to do everything for him. He's an adult and he needs to act like it. He needs to quit treating you like a doormat and stop being rude and ungrateful. You deserve a partner that appreciates you and helps you out sometimes too, not someone who just takes and never gives. And if he can't be that partner, he doesn't deserve you, and the relationship is over.   Even if they aren't lying, though, there's still the risk that she might forget to take her pill the next day, or she loses her pills, or that she's taking other meds that interfere with it (like antibiotics for instance). Shit happens. It's better to take extra precautions.   What exactly is adult taste strawberry?   Good for you, op. Although it is certainly true that abusing other people is never okay and serial abusers almost never change, I'm really happy to see that you got help and got your shit together. I think what a lot of people don't realize is that you'll never change *unless you want to*, and sadly a lot of abusers just don't care or don't want to acknowledge their issues. I was abused physically and emotionally by family members, and the ones who did it to me will most likely never change because they refuse to admit there's a problem or blame everything on someone else (namely, me). But you we different; you had enough human decency to know what you were doing was wrong and you actually wanted to do something about it. And you worked your butt off trying to get better. So as a survivor of abuse, I just wanted to say you're damn right you should be proud. I know that therapy and working on your mental health is a long uphill battle (I also have PTSD), but you did it. You actually got better. You're managing your symptoms, and you repaired your relationship. That's a lot more than other people in your situation could ever hope to accomplish. I wish you and your fiance all the happiness, and I encourage you to continue your efforts. Good job, op!   That's so awful! Makes me glad I use primarily acrylic yarns. Hopefully though all the bug killing stuff and the new storage container keeps the remainder of your yarn safe!   I showed this to my SO, his response was "I feel like this describes our life pretty well." Guess it's time for me to make some lobsters   I have a similar issue with my partners; I'm a tiny person, but both of them are significantly taller than me and also tend to run hot. Their space-heater abilities are much appreciated in winter but not so much when it's 80-90 degrees outside. I usually sleep in the middle of a queen sized bed; we sometimes use a fan, and usually I'll only cuddle one of them at a time to avoid too much overheating.   I know. I'm just scared, I guess. Hopefully things will go at least okay, though.  We have been having many conversations like that, which I think is a step in the right direction. And yes, Andy has also been a part of the marriage/kids discussion. No details really hammered out, but we have plenty of time later on down the road. If I do have kids, it won't be for at least another five years or so.  Oh, family drama is something I seem to have no end of, lol. Having two partners to support me certainly does help though. I guess I should just focus on that - no matter how my family reacts to me being poly, I know I can count on Andy and Justin to be there for me. :)  Oh, and as for F24 ... well, to be quite frank, it probably wouldn't work out. She came out to me as bisexual a while back, so I know that it's not completely out of the question. But ever since then she's only dated guys. Not to mention that she lives in a different town an hour away. So a relationship isn't really convenient, even if she were interested.   Hello, all! I just wanted to vent about some things, and I don't have many people to talk to about this offline so bear with me.  Background: I (F22) am currently living with one partner (M22) who I've been with for 6 years now. In May I started dating another partner (M26). We'll call M22 Andy and M26 will be Justin.  I've posted once or twice about my relationships here before but it was a long time ago, so I'll just go ahead and recap. Andy and I are high school sweethearts. We started dating our junior year, and eventually decided to go to the same university. We lived in the same dorm buildings for the first two years, and then got an apartment together with my roommate from the dorms. The three of us get along pretty well. In the past, though, our relationship hasn't been perfect all the time. A few years back, we decided to try having an open relationship and Andy started seeing another woman. However, there were issues with honesty (especially from this other woman), and the whole thing moved way to fast for me. Our relationship suffered, but eventually we worked things out and Andy and I decided we were no longer going to have an open relationship.  A little over a year ago, I realized that I had developed feelings for another friend from high school (F24). After thinking about it for a while, I brought it up to Andy and we decided to open up our relationship again. This time, we focused on having clear communication and properly expressed boundaries, and things have gone much better. Since then, Andy has dated several other people, but I hadn't started seeing anyone until Justin.  Justin and I were getting along great, but my relationship with Andy started to suffer again. He suddenly became really anxious about me leaving him or that I didn't love him as much as Justin (even back when I'd only been dating him for a few weeks). After many long and tearful conversations, we started to come to several realizations. First, Andy and I have very different concepts of love and how to express it. Second, we wanted very different things from our open relationship - I was looking only for serious partners, while he wanted more casual dating. But slowly, we have started to come to more of an understanding about what the other person needs, and our relationship is improving again. Andy feels much less jealous of Justin and insecure about being with me, and I feel much happier and less stressed out now that I don't have to walk on eggshells around him anymore.  I'm really getting excited about the coming few weeks. This weekend, Andy and I will be going to visit friends from high school as well as his family (whom he recently told about us being poly). The following weekend, I'm going with Justin and another couple we're friends with to a Renaissance fair. Meeting us there will be my best friend, and she will get to meet Justin for the first time! It's going to be so much fun.  That aside, I am starting to get to the point where I'm introducing Justin to more and more people. His whole family and friend group knows I'm poly and I've met all of them already. I have also told most of my friends from university about Justin and poly; however, my hometown is over an hour away and most of the friends and family from back home don't know about it. Even though we've only been together a few months, Justin and I are getting very serious - we plan on all living together after I graduate this coming spring, and we have started discussing marriage and kids and whatnot. He is definitely around for the long-term, which means I will need to introduce him to my family at some point. But I'm concerned that they won't be accepting of him, especially since they all know about the previous time Andy and I tried to be in an open relationship and how poorly it went. I don't want to treat Justin like some sort of shameful secret, because he is a wonderful and important part of my life. But I also don't want to have to expose him to any potential family drama.  Thanks for reading, and any comments or advice you have are welcome.  **TL;DR:** after a rough start, my first partner and I have successfully navigated our poly relationship and I now have a second partner - things are going great in my relationships, but I'm worried that previous issues with my first relationship will cause my family to react negatively to my second partner.   Okay, I could MAYBE see parents acting like this if their child was 14 or 15 years old and pregnant. However, you are 20. You are working and in school - clearly you are doing something with your life. You're not just some lazy person who is leaning on their parents because they don't feel like putting forth effort. You have your shit together. Now that you happen to be pregnant, it seems like you just wanted a little bit of help or support from your parents so that you can provide the best possible home you can for your child. This leads me to believe that you're responsible, and would most likely make a good parent.  So why on earth do your parents think that this is suddenly their baby? Did you ever ask them why they keep making these assumptions? Why are they treating you like you're also a child? This makes no sense. It seems like they keep doing all this weird stuff, and then you try to correct them, and they just shout at you. That is not a healthy environment for you, or your baby.  It might be a good idea for you to sit down with your parents and ask them some of these questions. Why is it that they think they are going to adopt this baby? Why do they think you aren't capable of being a parent? Why are they overstepping these boundaries? If your parents are reasonable people, you should probably be more explicit about your expectations for them and exactly what kind of help you need.  However, if your parents continue to be unreasonable, I would definitely move out. You should start looking for other places to stay now, just in case. Do you have a close friend or other relative who would take you in until the baby is born? Are there any cheap apartments nearby? Could you possible find a roommate? You should look into this stuff sooner rather than later.  I don't know where you are from, but I know that where I live as long as you aren't found grossly negligent or incompetent (and it takes a lot of evidence for this to be proven in court), there would be no legal basis for your parents to assume they could adopt your child or name the child or anything else. You don't sound like the type of person who would be forced by the state to give up their parental rights, so if your parents start getting touchy about this, just remind them - you are in control here. You are the only one who has legal power over this child. They do not get a say - you only have to take their wishes into consideration. There is no law saying you have to name the baby what they want or have the baby live with them.   ......... Maybe   Huh. I had that exact tea set when I was a kid.    Exactly. That's the kind of attitude every larper should have, at least imho. It should be about making sure we all have the best experience possible.    Oh, that was the first official game month. Yeah, thanks for humoring me!   Was this back in like January or February of this year then? That's when the current chapter got started (although I think they might have tried to start an Indy chapter before, I'm not sure). I'm actually going to bring up a lot of the complaints people have in this thread to the staff when I get the chance, so any info you can give would be awesome. It might not change anything but at least I'll know who to watch out for.    Wow, op, that's rough. I'm really sorry your mom has been awful about your identity. However, I have to say I'm pretty impressed with you. Not only did you stand up to get when she tried to shame you for being who you are, you also took the initiative to contact your local LGBTQ organization and have tried to educate her. There are a lot of people who don't know how to respond to that sort of situation but you've got a good grasp of it.   As far as your suicide threat, I personally don't think it was too extreme. Of course that sort of thing should never be said lightly. However, she's been completely unreasonable, and she probably needed to hear you say something that extreme to give get pause and make her examine what she's doing. That said, if you ever actually do feel suicidal, please please please seek help from someone. And I hope you stay safe and your mom eventually sees some sense.    It's ok to be confused about your sexual identity, especially as you're growing up and you haven't been exposed to a lot of options living in an area with little lgbt presence. To me it seems like you're a girl who enjoys crossdressing (although I wouldn't rule out the possibility of being genderfluid or otherwise non-binary), and you are emotionally attracted to people regardless of their gender, making you panromantic. You could also be somewhere on the asexual spectrum. I would take a look around /r/asexuality.   Of course, it's up to you to decide what your identity is and what labels do or don't fit you. But don't stress it - sexuality is complex and fluid, and it's possible as you become more sexually experienced you'll change your mind. That's perfectly ok and normal. And it's also ok and normal to not know for sure sometimes. What's important is that you do what feels best for you.    I'd agree with that assessment. If you're a trans woman emotionally attracted to other women, whether they are trans or cis, that would make you homoromantic. Panromantic means you are attracted emotionally to all genders (like me!), but considering you haven't expressed any interest in men, people who are third gender, agender, etc., that doesn't seem to fit.    No, you don't identify as a man or woman. There are many people who identify as both, or neither, or something else entirely. Also people who exhibit physiological characteristics that are both "male" and "female" are referred to as intersex. And they aren't as rare as you think.  	106
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME  CURSE YOU 30-MINUTE CLASS   Ice Climbers, Lucas, Wolf and/or Snake.   I think Lucina negates any purpose for Roy to return (minus possible alt. costume for her or Marth if they really want to stretch it), Young Link's basically dead with Toon Link there (unless they revamp him with new weapons and/or the masks), and Pichu didn't work well as a character.  Wolf and Lucas, while they had a lot of similarities to Fox and Ness, still had major differences and lots of unique moves. Snake and Icies were just fun to play as.    I'm interested.   Thank you for doing this for the community, and congrats on your test scores!   Dipper choosing fun over the possible apocalypse of Bill?   Everything is different now.    Alright, in the case that this is legitimate (which it's looking to be):  What'd his moveset be? Besides the obvious Helicopter hair and wind-up punch ending up somewhere?   Honestly, what I want is to see Norman Osborn appear more in line with the Avengers' stories, and having the majority of Spider-Man's rogues gallery / supporting characters (Black Cat, Vulture, Shocker, Hydro-Man, Sandman, Tombstone and Hammerhead all seem like good options) appear on the Netflix shows. If they need to, I'd say Doc Ock, with maybe references to Spidey previously fighting Norman as the Goblin, and then sometime in the future, set up for Venom to appear, possibly with the Guardians.    I'LL MAKE IT THROUGH, PROVE IT TO YOU   Goddammit Ross...      I pre-ordered him and Sonic.   I see I chose right.    I'd pick up Toadette, Daisy and Waluigi.   Spike? Eh... not so much.   I'd be fine with either, honestly. As long as crew battles are part of Smash 4, I'm fine with it.   While SSB4 may not have as strong a 1v1 game as Melee did, 4v4 and 2v2 are NUTS.    Marth, Ike, Robin and Lucina are compatible in Codename: Steam.   AND MARTH'S GETTING RESTOCKED THIS YEAR WOO   Young Link and Tingle in Hyrule Warriors Toad, Ness, Wario and Pac-Man amiibos Splatoon Punch-Out and Metroid Prime Trilogy on Eshop for Wii U  All I need is Mewtwo and then I'll be happy.    Honestly, there's a lot they could do with these figures that they haven't done. Like you said, the fact that only certain amiibos are getting used kind of stinks. I've got quite a few ideas myself that could really help push amiibos.   Pokemon games: This is among one of the most obvious to me. You scan an amiibo in, and you get some sort of costume piece for your Trainer (Full-blown costumes even, I'd love to see a Trainer decked out like Link or ). However, if you scan a Pokemon amiibo in, you can use the amiibo as that Pokemon, with the amiibo basically working as an extra Poke Ball. It's your Pokemon that you deck out and battle with. Of course, the amount of Pokemon would be limited, they surely won't make over 600 types of Pokemon amiibos... right?   Animal Crossing: Basically, cartridges like in the original, or costumes/furniture your character can use.   	15

 Livin' that dry desert life here!   Throw same $$$ my way, and I'll wash it! :P   It truly is an amazing color, especially when clean!   Mustang English lessons, hell yeah.   It does pretty good, if there's a scratch, I don't see it. But there is a deep one on my rear fender from the previous owner, but no one really sees that one too.   Me and the 15 probably will always be together.   If you got 40k, your dick can grow!   The stripe really helps.   Anytime dude, never actually seen you, just your photography, keep it up!   Hey! You liked my post my man! Good shots dude!   That sounds better, thanks!   Hell yeah.   Same my man.   It's purdy, aint it?   But he didn't wash it, I did. I'm watching it while he's gone.   I always thought it always went "My friend and I" so I just put an 's and cars. :p   Yeah, never shows dust until you actually touch the car. Plus it shines magnificently.   Yeah... I don't know how else to put it.      Sick man, enjoy it when you can!!   Yeah, the dealership added the stripes, they also did the tinting of all the cars. I was saying that the Rocker stripes are really just dumb IMO, because while yes, it is 50 years from when Mustangs were made, its just the Base GT with the dealer stripes added.   I'm sure he figured, Young guy, Brand new fast car, and doesn't want to get chewed out in the Corps for speeding. Since, in the first place he shouldn't have been driving, he got talked to about that before he came back. Yup, it was literally one exit before PAVS. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve one, obviously 40+MPH over could seriously hurt someone, and with what we were doing, I'm slightly surprised we didn't actually hit anything. They gave his GF a ticket, which she's obviously upset about, but she was basically doing what we did, on a lesser extent. If a cop saw us going up to flagstaff on Friday night, woooo, that'd be a funny thing.   We went to San Tan, but a lot were Auto, which isn't what he wanted. And the stripes are sick, until you realize that its not a 50th, and the side stripes are just annoying when you notice that. [This is the one my friend had bought](http://www.bergeford.com/new/Ford/2015-Ford-Mustang-mesa-az-eb8b4eff0a0a0064487c13719b4589bf.htm)   Yessir.   Agreed. Performance is lovely.   Yeah my friend bought his at Berge, he got 2k off a GT, and that was the most wiggle room they could give him, so they said. So he paid 35k instead of 37, but after taxes and stuff it was low 40 according to his girlfriend. They were really nice and kind about everything. They let us have a test drive (which they're strict about, since who wants a "new" car with 100 miles on it already?). They cracked jokes with us and let him take all the time he wanted with buying.   Yeah, they now are kicking everyone out after the classic show is over. Which is silly because they're all old and go to bed at 9..   I think I see more DSAZ members here than on the forums, lmao.   I love the 15's, Headroom up front is awesome, being 6'0, sitting in the back is kind of a bitch to put it lightly. The new Mustangs definitely turn more heads than any other car in its class. Personally, I haven't driven it yet so I don't know how it handles, but my friend said it handles amazingly. And seeing him do a slide in a cul-de-sac, I believe him. Berge Ford in Mesa had a few GT's, if you actually wanted to drive one. They also have a 50 Years Limited Edition, but its a 50k car.   Oh yeah.   You're bustin' my balls man. It's lightly used! only 150 miles!   Yeah it was! Ton of Mustangs, but in total around 500+ people showed up. Way more than PAVS.   250   Tempting... Tempting...   He got it on the 29th, had it for 6 hours, we went to go to an Instagram meet-up held in Scottsdale. The cop said he saw us going fast but wasn't going to do anything, and then he started going faster, and faster, we hit 95, and then the cop got next to him, no lights on and waited until there was room to pull him over, then he talked him. From what I was told by my friend and his passenger, is that he told him he was following us for quite some time, and then asked my friend what he does for a living, to which my friend told him hes in the Marine Corps, and the cop said "You don't want to die do you?" and "Do you like your car?", he told him to slow down and to tell me to slow down. Probably passed at least 5 cars pulled over on the way back. And his girlfriend got pulled over by the same cop a little bit down the road for 84 in a 55, but wrote her for 74 in a 55.  He was a pretty cool cop, I'm glad he didn't pull me over, or I'd be out a car.  And thus concludes story time.   Yeah, plus with the stripe it has, it stands out.   No idea. Was from Berge Ford in Arizona.   My friend had planned to surprise everyone with him coming home Thanksgiving morning from his Marine MOS school. I went to pick him up at 3am and we surprised everyone. We had planned a trip to Flagstaff for that Friday and before we went up, he wanted to see a few Mustangs, as he told me he wanted to buy a new car. There was this one, or an 04 Cobra with 78k Miles. He drove the GT and we left saying "We will be back tomorrow." After we left, its all we could talk about that night and into the next morning. We came back from Flagstaff and even before he went to our homes, we went to the dealership. His mind was made, and he bought it that day. He already had gotten pulled over once in it for 95 in a 55 (construction zone). (Thankfully they went after him and not me!) I'm the only one he will let look after it and make sure its clean, so I get to buff and wax it tomorrow, since there already is a scratch. All in all, it's an incredible car, and I've changed my mind about it. I'd want one.      The mod is better, IMO. More to do, a lot more.   I don't understand why this is a thing. I'm not abusing the kicking power. I'm helping get rid of a troll of the team and we all vote to kick him, Happened 3 times.  I get killing team mates, but giving me a cooldown because I agreed to kick someone who obviously can't play the game is just dumb.      Hey, It's Inked! :D   You get a free car wash!   But... The Termi 4.6 :(   Fun fact: That color is called Legend Lime!  That wasn't fun, I'm sorry.   on point   Yes.   I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't have a key, lmao.

Congrats man!   rained really hard in Arizona, not used to it, Went around a turn in my neighborhood and put it in second, went completely sideways and almost hit the curb. (This was in my old '95 v6)   Right? Got an old sn95 beater and never hit anything.   First mod for me, coyote. Lol. Nice car man, love watching the videos you post of it.   Woooo! Lets go 40th anni's!   I could never fucking getta Cybunny.      Yeah! I saw it, instantly sold my car and went for this. I couldn't pass it up. It's really everything I've wanted. Besides it not being a Termi. Lol   Thanks! I appreciate it.   It's only ever nice in fall/winter, cause then you can actually stand going outside and it's not 110. Lol   Arizona!   Got it for 10k   I was lucky to find it, someone backed out on buying it, so I went for it. Thank you! I'll treat it nicely. ;)   Time to get ALL the stickers.   It's a 2004 DSG Mustang GT, 40th anniversary, Premium, has 24.5k miles, no real problems besides just some cosmetic things, like oxidation in the third brake light and on the driver side headlight, has a scratch behind the tire and a small dent, and has a scuff on the passenger side front bumper that I plan of buffing out this weekend.  Overall I'm in love with it, its my favorite body style, has all the little doodads I wanted, (keyless entry and power windows are a god send).  I can't wait to start making changes to it.

[Exhaust video, if anyone wants it](http://instagram.com/p/uMZOocmGr9/?modal=true)      Oh it is cheap, my dash shakes, and the door panel is coming off, whenever I drive, you can hear the plastic in the car shaking. It's really quite sad.   I feel you there, I got used to it since its the same as my 95's interior, its just a change in the body style.   Dude where?   I got approved for a 04 DSG GT, we should start a club or something.   I think the New edges had the best designs, for really anything. Roush, Saleen, SVT, Mach, and just the Basic V6/GT.   Dude, soon, Hopefully I'll get approved for a DSG 04 GT.   Mine just has all of our bread in it..   This and a TR 10th Cobra are my dream cars, someday.   No :(! I didn't know there was one! Pretty sure I saw it leave though, it was black right? 'Cause that thing sounded so good!   I looked and I just see imitations. :(   Damn, nice turn out :O   Basically take the folks with fancy cars, or unique cars, and have a giant meet!   True, I did see the wheels man.   Ah, so the black 5.0 is his.   Didn't bring, need gas for the cruise tonight. But I have the POS red 1995 v6. With the loud power steering. Lmao.   Yeah man, DSAZ!      I own a 95 v6, and damn do I fill up often.. But I like my car, but I do want to get rid of it and get something better.   Soon....   I know with my little 95 v6, when I rev, it's mostly engine noise, no exhaust. Maybe he's talking about that?   Thats what I'm thinking, but my friend is currently doing Marine training, so hes not here, we're just trying to fix it up for him when he gets back, but I do know its got BBK CAI, Cobra Intake Manifold, Short Throw Shifter, Pretty sure no Muffler that I could see.  Believe me, I'm trying to find the Modlist that he has, Earliest I can know is Tuesday when he leaves MCT to go for MOS school, I can keep you posted!   Oh we will, but this is the first time it's started in a while and it was 9pm, we went around the neighborhood and the neighbors came out and told us to stop since it was 9:30. The car hasn't had tags for 2 years so we're working on getting that all sorted out, but once thats done.. Gonna fucking rev the shit out of it.      Oh yeah.   Found a DSG 04 GT in my area, but I'm short 10 grand. Lmao. But you're welcome man, kinda wanna black one out now.   That is a really good looking GT.  One day...   Awesome to see other members!   DSAZ?   NRG, cause, energy   Pretty sure its his, check history.   Duuuude that'd be cool.   Gotcha.   We have different tastes, I LOVE the new edge style. But I can see where you're coming from, outside of the mustang group a Termi is just a mustang and not a special car, but a Shelby is a big deal because, well Shelby.   A low mile Mystic goes for 30-35k On SVTP. There's one on there with 1k miles and it's about 33ish I wanna say. And you can find a decent 10th anni for 20-25k. If they went for double that, it wouldn't be my achievable dream car. :P   I don't know man, SVT Cobras get a lot of attention and they're in the 22k range.   Mouth is feels better, I even scrubbed my tongue and used mouth wash. I feel like a new person!  	109
 Know of a guy who ran a car lot, he traded stock while he sat in his office waiting on customers and calls.  Said he made ALMOST as much money trading stock versus car sales, but at that time the car sales market was super shitty.   I like em.   Yes I have said this before.  I feel like a disease that can be visualized in some form is much easier to "fight" and explain.  A lot of people just flat out don't believe that depression exists, you're just a "downer".  Feel like the best contribution I could make to society is if I could take the diseases of a few people with me on my way out.  At least I'd help keep around "useful"/"good"/"worthwhile" people.    Very often, since everyone else is more important than I.    I haven't kept up with all the PC stuff, but I'd look further into your non-SSD hard drive choices to see if they have a high failure rate in the past.  Some of those HDs die off after 2-3 years in certain brands and that's a lot of data to lose.  PSU is probably overkill, BUT going to a lesser Watt unit probably won't save you THAT much money.  And if you ever get another video card you'll wish you had the bigger PSU.  And if it's high efficiency it won't be too much waste.  They have very detailed reviews on PSUs on some websites to give you better ideas on what you're buying.     Have to say you make some excellent points booze.  If you don't present a good life to women as a man.......you're definitely seen in a completely different light.  Another thing is just that social media and this weird distortion to always present everything in a positive light because future employers/whoever can see what you say.......it creates some unreasonable expectations.    I don't understand what is being asked for here.  I PMed to ask about it, but might as well post here.   The depression cloud says that the other shoe must drop and the job will taken away from you, or be the most miserable experience you've had in your life.  OR, something good happened, now where is all the bad?  That's how mine works, if you never get any good, then you never get any more of the really bad.  Just a steady level of bad.  You might not be happy, but you're not quite actively suicidal. (my thinking)    Others judging you, feeling less than, assuming they think you are negative whatever, your achievements and things seem less important than theirs.  For me it ties heavily into depression and feelings of self worth.  If you're feeling like an especially worthless human being that day, the anxiety is worse.  I want to get to the "Not giving a fuck what others think/say" status that many functional and happy people seem to have.  I care faaaarrrr too much what other people think,  even people I barely know.     Dont judge me for my alternative lifestyle!   A beautiful, intelligent, open, supportive SO/Spouse with some kink.   It's a fine line between love and hate as they say.....so perhaps hating them will make it easier.    Hair looks amazing, just need to see your wonderful smile to go with it.    If you run out of ideas of what to do with them, contact me.   Yeah this would be the one I'd first think of, but......you know what they say about assuming.    Where's mine, friend?!   Tri-state area is.......................where?   *motorboat*   Yeah this post is pretty much a lie.  Ask for live pics, not even half of them have a profile picture that appears to be an actual person.  Saw peewee, a kitten, some sayings, etc.  And you get booted before you can type while they slap each other on the back for "regulating".     Feel free.   Typed out a message earlier, never heard back.  Still interested in hearing your thoughts on it or a "No thanks" type reply.    Bring out the wax and clamps, need to tame those sweater puppies.    Might as well post my story, and it's one of a lonely guy.  I am 36 year old virgin.  Never kissed a woman.  I've been told I shouldn't bring up my virginity and just "fake it until I make it".    Had a few girls I liked in high school, most only spoke to me when they wanted help with something.  I was invited to a dance(one where the girl is supposed to ask) by a girl in a grade above me, she was very shy like myself.  And I felt like I didnt belong at the dance, I doubt I made a very good impression on her.  And the next day I was teased by friends and others about going with her, I really don't even remember what was said...    but I was generally picked on a lot in school and everything just kind of internalized because of it even to this day.  In my last year of high school I asked a girl in my grade, she said she was "waiting on someone else", he eventually asked her.  Then she told me she should have went with me instead.  This same girl wanted to make a pact to get married at 30, and wondered if I would take care of another man's kids........I think she may have even asked how much I'd pay her for sex....really don't recall how serious/joking that was.  High school and college I met a little older woman online, and we emailed and spoke on the phone for years.  Went to meet her......I think second year of college, she was a state over.  It was awkward, she didn't act the same at all.  Stayed for two awkward partial days, cut it short by a night, and left early.  She told me I intimidated her by walking into her door without being invited in...I didnt even know if it was true back then.  But it was below zero out so it's a pretty good possibility.   Walking into that, the expensive of a hotel room, being in an awkward position with no experience, etc........then she says "Well I would have...." after I left.  Basically fell apart after that because I was hurt by the whole situation and that the years of talking did nothing to alleviate it.  I met her in an online game, she met with other guys from it within months of me meeting her.  I never heard what that situation was, but I always wondered if she had a couple guys in her back pocket and just hadn't decided on which yet.  College, was in a major that had maybe 2 or 3 non-foreign women, 1 was dating a dude who was cheating on her, another got hit on by first one's boyfriend which is how everyone found out about him doing that, and third was in a different program and I believe she was dating.  I don't recall.  I think I saw a fourth woman but she must have been only taking evening classes and her boyfriend picked her up all the time.   Anything non-major related was full of guys talking to the girls and sitting around them during class etc.  I probably could have socialized more, but I don't drink and I was a commuter who worked part time.   I spent a lot of time driving back and forth and working stupidly late at the computer labs.    Got out of college, dotcom bust, the places I did work the people were generally 15-20 years older than me and if there was someone younger...she was ALWAYS dating someone or married.  So...... stuff happened.  I burned out on my job field.  Went to work at a family business and generally just felt like I had done what I was able.  I had decided no woman would be interested in me due to shitty job and obviously being "broken" as a man in some way.  Lived like that until the economy collapsed and life got worse, since it was a family business many of us in the family were straight up fucked financially for a good long while.  And I just stopped hoping for stuff and wanted to die, but was too afraid that I'd screw up killing myself and end up able to think but unable to move.  So I could just sit around and relive all the shit my life was.  Last year I started seeing a therapist, it's helped...but it's kind of a nebulous can't put my finger on it kind of thing.  Changed some meds for the depression recently.  Try as much as I can to not care what other people think, but it's just really ingrained.   Met a girl in an online game......talked for almost a year, got to be really close IMO.  She started dating a guy and that put a stop to what we had because I feel it's wrong to be that intimate with someone whose involved with someone else.  We're still in touch and friends, but that shit just eats my soul.  He's better looking than I, doesn't look like me in anyway.  I don't know his personality but she said he's generally nothing like me.  So......yeah.  I can't blame her for wanting something in the real world, but it doesn't make it suck any less for me.  POF and OkCupid, you might as well write your messages on toilet paper if you're going to bother writing anything IMO.  Even mutually "Liked" profiles won't get them to respond in my experience.    Even contact women on R4Rs and other things.  I've met some VERY nice women a little older than I, who are located outside of the US.  But it's just nice to talk to them.  In the US, this week alone I've had three stop messaging me after they received my picture....  that's assuming they write you back in the first place.  And you try not to tell yourself that people can't possibly be that rude, that maybe something came up....or they found someone else they liked more.   But common courtesy would be to write something back and say "Yeah I don't see this going anywhere....."  just something.    But you know they probably get raged on by other men if they do that, so I dunno what to suggest there.    Generally, I find that even when I try to put the work in, read their listings, reply with something meaningful...even if I do get a reply they are pretty horrible about responding after the initial few messages unless you message them every day to kick it off again.   And they claim to like talking to you, but if  they like it so much you think they might remember to message you after the 5th or 6th day.  Hard not to feel like you're bugging or nagging them.  And this doesn't even cover the issues with the women having kids, or "complicated" situations with exs who might not be out of the picture.  Not that Im opposed to being involved with a woman (who I really get along with) who has kids, it's more hurdles for her and for you....and if the kids dad is involved that's another issue.......and yeah.  So........advice to future generations.  Don't do what I did.  Blow smoke up their asses, inflate everything you do so you sound like a superhero, outright lie so they think you are interesting enough to get to know.  Then you can "be yourself" after you've got a ring on it and a bun in the oven.  At least you'll have someone to be miserable with at the very least.  And I say that last paragraph in a joking/not joking kind of way.  Because often it seems like people in general just want you tell them everything is perfect, everything will continue to be perfect and you are the person for the relationship.  Like a job interview, which I also suck at.  And I agree with other comments made in the thread, a large chunk of women gravitate to a handful of men.  This is why you end up with the one guy that has 20-30 kids by as many women.  I think women kind of see it happening, but thinks they are better than that....or are too busy getting laid to really care either way at the time.  You hear about all the guys who are "interesting" once they are dating someone.....    like corporations who want to steal other corporations employees instead of giving the new guy a chance.  It's just bizarre, loyalty is apparently not a desirable trait any longer.     	23
 Soooo.... Is anyone else as worried as I am that there hasn't been an update?   Your "boyfriend" seems like a total fuckwad.   You definitely deserve to feel special on your birthday, and your 21st no less. Honestly, everyone here is right. You should definitely get yourself done up, and just go treat yourself to some breakfast, or brunch. If you can, definitely do a movie as well. Always a good help, and there are great movies out right now.   We may be internet strangers, but you can always turn to us to be there for you.   And your kitty really does love you. They can sense emotional stresses, and will help you through this. You're awesome, OP!! And happy birthday :) stay strong.    .....isn't it the three eyed crow?   It's count of how many have found this place and died. It's keeping track of how many people have perished in the chamber with no air. Soon it will read 12,109.   Soooo..... It sounds like you should move. Like now. Maybe move in with Anna somewhere new? That seems to be the only thing that would help. Unless they follow you.... As for any new owners to the house, well they can deal with the Ghosts or Demons, or whatever they are. Just be sure you're careful when moving.    Soooo...... My name is Will...... Shit.... Please don't come after my family.....  On a side note, I love that all your stories seem to have some sort of way for you to resolve them. You clearly care about all of your friends and family, and I respect that a great deal.    Is anyone else worried that we haven't heard from either OP or /u/solotopvladimir in a while? Because I'm starting to get really worried about them.....   As far as FU's go, this one is pretty mild. I agree with some of the others here, just make this your NoSleep profile, and make a different one for your personal account. That's what I did, I have a NoSleep profile, and this one. It always works out great.   .....did you castrate him at the time?    I actually kinda expected them to be awake and say she owed them money for staying in their BnB.... Like maybe she didn't realise what they said as she was so drunk... But hey, good things are good!!   	10
    I just tried to make this using the pattern. It said it made 6 legs, but it really only seemed to have room for 4. How did you alter the pattern for the legs? You did such a great job!   My boyfriends mortgage is in his name, so he pays the mortgage. I pay utilities, cable, internet, trash. We go every other on groceries and split vacations down the middle.    This happened to me once. I was working with a piece that started with 150 ch, so it was pretty big. I didn't want to tear my work out, so I ended up single crocheting down the side that had the dropped stitch(es) and back. It looked like a repair, but I was glad to have a fix that didn't require undoing 8 hours of work.    I'm assuming so. It's just a fabric glue, so in sure any brand would work. It is in a tube so it is easy to control how much you use.    I usually use a little Liquid Stitch on the knot. Creates a slightly tough area, but at least I feel like the knot will hold!    This is amazing! Did you make it up or use a pattern?  	7
 No law is truly "unenforced."  Good evidence, glad you commented.   Happy?   It wasn't used as a gender slur, you sjw.  	3
 I'm a rabble rouser. I rouse rabbles.    Can you provide some examples? I'm not challenging you this is just the kind of thing I want to talk about, and need to know about.   I didn't know where precisely to put this, sorry if it doesn't necessarily belong here.    I have been following everything and I mostly agree with you, though I don't think our generation would ever allow a draft, and I only think 1/2 of our current wars are illegal.       The only thing you can do is be there for him when he asks, and maintain cautious distance when he doesn't.  The loss of someone that close that suddenly can awaken some dormant things inside of a person. I used to be suicidal so if you ever need advice, message me and I can let you know some signs to watch out for. Stay strong, for you and for him.    HEY EVERYONE! OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME IDEA SO IT'S NO LONGER FUNNY! JOKES ARE ONLY FUNNY WHEN DONE ONE TIME AND ONE TIME ONLY! I'M DOING YOU ALL A FAVOR HERE BY POINTING OUT THAT THIS GUY IS DOING A JOKE THAT ISN"T COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY ORIGINAL.  Yes I know it's not been done before just once, it's done a lot but who gives a fuck. I still laughed. If you didn't ok, move on with your life and stop being a dick about it.     Cops, Nickleback, and (to a certain extent) Religion.   See that's funny. I still just can't get into it. I think I'm missing the seinfeld gene.    Well I mean if you're gonna be in the greater Jacksonville area in the next few weeks....   Edit: Unintentional Creepiness aside, i definitely understand, and I'm not saying wait for that perfect moment with fireworks and white wine and all that Hollywood nonsense, just best not to rush into anything you'll later regret. I've had some close calls where I damn near broke rule #1, and it would have been bad.    I'm 23 and still a virgin, I feel you. It'll happen when it's supposed to though. I know more people who regret their first times because they rushed it instead of waiting.   Some moments of brilliance and then some moments of... not at all.   I mean I get it. I have friends who are crazy about it and that's cool, just not my thing personally.   Getting this second hand because Elder Scrolls isn't really my things, but it comes from a random NPC encounter that the hive mind exploded over.   Frankly your careers been disappointing since Hustle and Flow anyway.   Tv: Not really any stand out new shows that I've seen, which is somewhat ironic given the thread.   Games: Uncharted 3, Skyrim, Gears of War 3, Assasins Creed Revelations  Movies: Harry Potter 7.2, The Hangove 2, X-men First Class, Super 8, Captain America, Rise of the PLanet of the apes, Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, Warrior, Moneyball, Red State, 50/50, The Muppets.  That's what I got. God Bless for what you did over there.   Anybody else?   I honestly recommend going back through it as soon as you're done with you're first viewing. You catch so much more the second time through.    That Sucks man, sorry. Can't say Skyrim does a lot for me but I know how freaked I'd be if that happens in march and I miss Mass Effect 3   Nice, some good things to come. Also the last season.    On the second season, having trouble finding time for it but I do love the show.   I've spent the majority of the last three weeks blasting my way through How I met your mother, Parks and Recreation, and starting community. I saw an episode or two of these at the beginning but just never really got into them.  So reddit, what are some of the things that you missed out on when they first started?   Collapsing ever inward    #3232;\_ #3232;   Still a lot of life left....   Just because we stop putting out milk and cookies, doesn't mean we can't still hope.   I still can't make myself do that. I'm 23 btw...   Again I said ridiculous, you're very handsome.   Oh emotional scarring...   Think it was a holdover from their parent. Lack of socks? I don't know.   Holy crap I thought I was the only one who got told this.   She is, she's also ocd. Vengeance is had. Frequently.   Right until my roomates start playing the fucking jaws music when I'm having my morning still mostly asleep poorivate time.    Read a couple of my previous posts, no... not even a little.    I said ridiculous.    Got that beat with two words, toilet sharks.   Upvote for me not having anything to say...   Well the 2nd one is true in the literal sense...   This one's a big one for me... Still holding on right there with you.   Go on...   This is just a question out of curiosity/for fun. Please, please, please, I don't care what spiritual beliefs you do or do not subscribe to, please don't attack anyone else. Just a bit of fun.    Bitches love pregnant   When she stabbed me in my shoulder and then made me apologize. That was a pretty good indicator.     	43
 I know! It was so good!    I'll definitely go and check out the rewatch threads - I've been dying to see what other people have thought after rewatching SSY...it's definitely a different experience the second time around. On Yakomaru/Squealer, I've actually started a thread dedicated to discussing him as a character, as he's personally one of my favourites. You should definitely [check it out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/shinsekaiyori/comments/3atzyy/the_nature_of_squealeryakomaru/)   I mostly agree with what you're saying about the possibility of Squealer becoming a dictator himself had he managed to overthrow the humans. What's really scary about that though is coupled with the revelation that bakenezumi were genetically engineered from the non-PK humans, it really does seem plausible that Squealer would become just like the humans he was trying to overthrow. I definitely agree that Squealer wasn't good. I mean, even if someone argued that he was inciting war for the sake of liberating his species, the fact that it seemed he was planning to go further than that and straight to world domination stands. In the end, his opportunistic and calculating nature definitely make it seem like he was after more than just being free from humans.    That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for! I'll give it a go :)  	4
 Yeah, I'm not worried about the mail, I know she'll hand that over. I'm just worried she wont give me the tax information. I'm pretty scared at this point but hopefully it will all work itself out. :/   Haha oh man! Gosh darn Vikings.   Hi! Thanks so much :)   Thanks!   Thank you! I can't afford to take any prep courses, so I'm saving up for some LSAT books that are highly regarded online. Preparing on my own makes me a little nervous because sometimes I hardly have motivation to do everything else that's going on, but, I think it'll be fine!   That's so exciting! It seems so far off in my future but its really not. I have to take the LSAT this coming summer. It seems totally unreal   Well, I live in Green Bay WI. This is really stereotypical, but gamedays during football season are absolutely amazing, especially if you're actually going to the games or just tailgating anywhere near Lambeau. Everyone is so nice. It's like having a huge family who you can drink with and party with and love the Packers with. It is a totally unreal experience and it was amazing to grow up here, and I'm not even that into sports, really!  Football is our religion here. It's not an exaggeration what you hear about the cheeseheads haha. Everyone takes their prom pictures at the stadium, a fancy night out is taking a loved one to one of the stadium restaurants, or a restaurant named after someone associated with the Packers...yeah. Everyone should visit Green Bay on a game day sometime haha   This is such a great idea!   Actually, I'm still a junior in undergrad. I am pre-law track. Wonderful professor, very dry material. lol   As a citizen of Panem, I swear loyalty to President Akeleie.   AGREED.    Aww thank you so much!   Thanks! I'm pretty sure the last book I read was for one of my Con Law classes, pretty boring! haha   Thank you!    Thank you! I generally like to think that if someone needs help and I am able to offer some, I will. I think that's a pretty neat trait to have!   I'm Maya! Nice to meet you as well! I dont think I ever go without pepperoni on a pizza.   Oh my gosh macaroni and cheese. I have to go make some now. haha   Thank you!   My favorite food by far is lasagna! Unless you count pizza as food, then pizza is my favorite. How about yours?   I just discovered this sub recently and I think what you do is pretty great! It makes me happy to see all the gift posts when I'm scrolling through reddit. :) Keep up the good work, all!   Mind-boggling, lol. And i know. WHITE SOCKS FOR KIDS ONLY. I can't even keep track of my own when they are fancy-patterned.   Red-pillers.   Aw that is so cute! I'm so jealous, mine just went away back to school for a J-term class!   American here. I'm from Wisconsin. Our overweight, entitled drunk girls are pretty terrifying   A sock basket. I soon realized that normal families just match their socks and get on with their lives.     This sounds weird, but force yourself to smile and laugh with other people. Even if you feel dead inside, eventually it becomes genuine, and if you are looking for things to laugh at, eventually you realize there are a lot of things in the world that can make you smile. I use this a lot for my depression, and it helps with other situations too.   An "us" night, complete with food, movies, and lots and lots of sex and laughing. We have a fairly big group of friends who are constantly doing things and hanging out, and it's especially bad when everyone hasn't seen each other in a while. He's a good guy and hates saying no to people, so I feel like I have to compete to get his undivided attention sometimes.   Congratulations! That has got to feel so good. Sending internet fuzzies your way. Sounds like you've got quite the set-up, at the beach! Nice!   Aw, thank you so much! :) That means a lot to me.  	29
 Oh I'm not sure! Finnish is meant to be quite hard. Maybe when I have some experience with new languages I could try to hop on the finnish bandwagon :P   yes very much so! Hi :)   Hello! I'm a native english speaker and I'm looking for penpals who are willing to to correspond with me (either through email or snail mail) in a different language.  If you already know English, or have no interest in bettering your english language skills, you can write to me in your language and I'll respond in the same. However If you are interested in bettering your language skills, you can write to me in English and I'll respond back in your language. We can both exchange comments on sentence structure and give constructive criticism too.  I am looking to learn a variety of languages (though less of the grammar and tenses and more just being able to effectively communicate), however learning chinese and arabic do not agree with me. I have tried and It just didn't happen :/  Edit: Just to clarify - I speak NO other languages beside english and poor conversational french (which I wouldn't mind improving too). So this is going to be hard...  So comment or PM if want to be penpals :)  edit: Family stuff has made me really busy so I can't write to anyone anymore. Thanks to those who agreed to help me with this project.    http://www.okcupid.com/profile/ilikeyourlaces I'm nervous... thanks :)  	4

 That's pretty cool! :D   Yes, thank you! I had a looooot of time between knowing I wanted to get the band and finally getting it so I did a lot of research.  I'm glad you like it! :D   He must have been so excited :D   I think it comes from the same part of my brain that wouldn't allow any connection with my college students on social media. Educators have to treat these things differently.   I work at a museum and I bring my 3DS to collect steps for playcoins on my lunch break basically (and that Pokemon Shuffle fix) and I noticed when I got home I had a streetpass from one of the kids I gave a guided tour to today. SO now I feel a bit creepy but hey at least I got an Eon ticket out of it. xD   Aw! Thank you so much! :D   Aww gosh thank you so much! I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish.  3   Thank you! I bet yours are in the mail then eh?      I'm bringing a rubber Darth Vader keychain :D  I heard they trade you pins sometimes.   Ouch that sucks :(   Definitely file a claim with etsy. They are pretty good about getting your money taken care of.    It's not broken. It has a superficial scratch that screen protectors would have prevented.   Try repairing your download from the eShop settings. It fixed the issue for me!   You see the icons on your desktop and think about how to slide them to make the best combo.  Add yours!   Sitting on my Diamond and Platinum carts hehe. I have JPN Movie Darkrai, US Movie Darkrai, and the Pokemon Ranger Darkrai.   Because I like Munchlax too. It's so hard to choose between favorites! D:   Yes Darkrai is awesome! I'd love to see pics of your collection. 3   Pokemon X/Y is glorious. You would probably enjoy Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire too.   I am not a huge fan of Black/White, but I do heartily recommend Heart Gold/Soul Silver and Diamond/Pearl/Platinum. But you don't need them for Pokemon X/Y to make you happy.   Yes! :D Darkrai is awesome! :D   Dem cicada hands doe....   Yes I did like it, thank you! :D   Darkrai FTW :3 I actually used to have two of those holders. Can't find the other one. :/   That's a really good manga though! :)   Pikachu actually :3   Thanks :D   Hehe yeah I was wondering who would notice.   Thanks. That would be a nice addition for when Darkrai wants a snack.   Eh, not so much.      Poke Mac n Cheese always tasted better. My bro and I were convinced the cheese sauce was different, but my adult logic knows that the shapes just held the sauce better than the elbows.   Hah you have those little cutouts from the Mac n Cheese boxes.   I have heard that having a big combo multiplier helps with catchability. I have not progressed far enough in the game to get to Groudon or Kyogre though.   I'm planning on bringing mine to Disney next month :) Good to know I will get lots of passes!   Totally!   You could use Pokemon for things like that in the Ranger games. It was great.   That would be beautiful. :O   Definitely. Black was such a let down for me after Diamond.   This is adorable.   ^^^My ^^^biological ^^^clock ^^^is ^^^going ^^^CRAZY   I've put the most hours into Pokemon Diamond and thought that was the pinnacle of Pokemons, but I just started X and basically it's the Pokemon game I have wanted since 1998 and is amazing.   I was tempted to make a throwaway, since the institution I work for is dealing with a potentially hairy NAGPRA claim right now but I have to say that yes I do. I don't know if NAGPRA is the law you are referring to (and I don't have much knowledge of legislation in other countries) but I do support reburial. I also support scientific study of remains. I know from personal experiences that compromises can be made that allow for study and documentation prior to repatriation.  Also, I can't think of a single example where remains in a historic context were not reinterred as soon as practical. Historic cemeteries are always moved if the archaeology is done right. I don't see why this same attitude does not get applied to prehistoric remains that lack a cultural association. They're still people!   That's awesome! :D Thanks!   Wait wait... I just started Gen VI and you can breed into specific balls now? O_O Too cool!   I've really been enjoying Wondertrade. I just got a Helioptile named H-Dawg lmao   The bug is usually the one thing I DO evolve haha.   Nido FTW   I like to keep my starters cute for as long as possible lol.   That's a nifty challenge! :3   Haha ouch yeah that would be difficult.   Yeah those games turned me off too. I'm grumpy that I need to finish my Black that I haven't touched in four years to get Pokes from my Diamond/Platinum/Heart Gold sent up to my new game.    Aww :3   Nice! Yeah I do the leveling thing too. It kinda threw me off in X when my happier Pokes started getting boosted XP.    And I miss out on Raichu because I refuse to evolve my Pikachu lol. That's pretty cute. :)    So waaaay back in my first Pokemon game (Yellow) one of the members of my team was Nidoking. I didn't have any water types on my final crew I guess so I taught my Nidoking Surf because he could learn it for some reason. Ever since, in FR and HG and just today in X my Nidoking on my team has known Surf. 3  I think my first team was Pikachu, Nidoking, Scyther, Charizard, Articuno ... and someone else. I can't remember the sixth pokemon. ;-; EDIT- Haunter. I think it was Haunter.  What sorts of things do you carry over game to game?   They are Banpresto prize plush from 1998 and SUPER RARE! They are called bell plush because they have a tiny jingle bell on them. Laptop for scale. I loves them so much. 3  	55
 My mom recently told me she'll mix tuna and cottage cheese and eat it on romaine and it's supposed to be really good. Put a little seasoning on it too.    That sounds delicious!  Do the low carb tortillas taste good?       Dinner is always my biggest meal. SO and I like to eat dinner every night together and his calorie allowance is a lot higher than mine. We usually compromise with a 500-600 calorie dinner.  Breakfast is around 200 - 300 calories.  Lunch is about 400 calories  If I have any left over I'll eat a little dessert or have a snack between meals.   I aim to eat 1200 to 1300 calories a day.    5'5" SW: 165 pounds CW: 152 pounds GW: 130 pounds   My first goal is to get to a healthy weight. Once I get below 150 I'll no longer be overweight.  So close!    Then I want to continue to around 130, but that's not a set number.  If I feel and look good at a different number,  then that'll be my final goal weight.    Try eating the BRAT diet. It's bananas, rice, applesauce,  and toast. Even if it's just half a banana, see if you can keep just a couple bites down.   And stay hydrated.     I'm PMSing and bought a bag full of chocolate truffles today.  But I haven't eaten a single one!     I've lost a large sack of potatoes.   You look great!  And I love your glasses :)   If you order a steak blue in the US. It's less cooked than rare.    Holiday Inn expresses usually have some sort of continental breakfast right? Last time I traveled I believed they had things like yogurt, hard boiled eggs, English muffins. You could easily track those things for breakfast. Then bring or purchase salad mixing and healthy sandwich items for lunch. Try to limit eating out to just dinner. Or eat out for dinner, but only eat half. Save the other half for the following day lunch.    Being told I look fine and don't need to lose weight.  I started 15 pounds above normal weight and now am only 5 pounds away from not being classified as overweight. I hope to lose an additional 20 pounds after I reach normal weight. That'll put me in the middle of the range for my height. Friends tell me I'm being silly because I look fine. But I'm overweight,  they just don't see it.    You've been together for 6 years and still haven't met his son and he hasn't met your parents? Leave. If he has any relationship with his son, and hasn't felt the need to introduce you after 6 years, he has no plans on long term commitment.    I'm (24) dating a man who is 36 and has a 7 yr old daughter and ex wife. I see his daughter almost every week, and I've met the ex wife. I'm currently living with my boyfriend, so an introduction to the ex seemed reasonable seeing as how her daughter lives with me when she visits her dad.   As soon as things started to get serious, I met his daughter.  In my opinion 6 years is a very long time without meeting his son or your parents.    I knew I was posting too much! Figured I'd get discovered....small towns....   I pretty much knew who you were,  but post history confirms it. :)   My boyfriend likes to eat doesn't care about counting calories. We like to eat together though. We will start planning a meal based on what meat we want. I may only eat 4 Oz serving while he eats 6 oz. Then we always have a decent size serving of veggie. He'll throw some cheese or butter on his. And then we add it some sort of grain. Once again he may add extra sauce or cheese or just a bigger portion than me.   Basically we eat the same thing just slight variations that are easy to do as you go along.    You're welcome! I really love the versatility of it. You can change it to your preferences quite a bit. :)    When I need a crunchy snack I slice sweet peppers into sticks and munch on them.  Very low cal and you can dip them in a little sauce and still keep the snack under 100 calories.     This specific one has almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips, old fashioned oats, Chia seeds, ground flaxseed, rice krispy, honey and almond butter.    I switch back and forth between http://thenourishinghome.com/2014/05/mock-kind-fruit-nut-grain-free-bars/ and http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/no-bake-granola-bars/ recipes. But I always vary a bit different than the recipe. I switch up the nuts, seeds, and fruits a lot. But stick to the total amounts of fillings and I stick to the liquid amounts, otherwise it won't bind properly. The no bake recipe is a tad sweeter, but good. If you like coconut, the kind bar is really good, also not quite as sweet which can be good. I make mine in a 6x8 pan because that's what I have. And cut them into 8 rectangles. Wrap them individually and keep them in the fridge. My boyfriends daughter who is 7 and picky loves them both.

I actually used a tomato basil goat cheese to give it a bit more flavor.    I like to get bagel thins too. 110 calories each and the everything bagel thin is amazing for sandwiches too.    I try to eat between 1200 and 1300 calories a day. I tend to snack throughout the day and eat a big dinner.   The pasta dish consisted of:  1.5 cups Spinach Fettuccine (190) .5 Oz Tequila (34) .12 cup milk (18) .25 cup Turkey broth (9) Sweet pepper (15) 1/9 cup feta cheese (20) 3.5 Oz chicken (96) .5 Tbs fake butter (45)   Total for the day: 1232 Calories 135g Carbs. 48g Fat. 83g Protein.       You're welcome!    I didn't realize they lasted so long! :)   I have a couple cookies and cream pudding pops in the freezer. 110 calories a piece, and helps fight off a period craving. Just stick a popsicle stick in them before freezing. So yummy. :)    http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/holiday-recipe-remix-spinach-goatichoke-dip/ I made this for superbowl Sunday and thought it was pretty good.    	28

 If I had one of those to wear I wouldn't need to lift.    The most important thing I got from this: be considerate of your SO when planning surprises and that they may not be ready for a night of wild sex as soon a they walk in the door. If possible, give them the option to choose.    "One bite could feed a man for a week." "Pippin, how many did you eat?" "Four." *belch*   Yeah, this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I'm getting tired of hearing about how introverts are all super special snowflakes that deserve vast amounts of love and care and attention. Especially in the description that extroverts 'take' energy while introverts 'give' it - funnily enough, we're actually people too, not vicious social predators. We also have specific needs and dislike being treated in certain ways. And we give far more energy than introverts - who makes a social event fun, the friendly, talkative person who wants to connect to people and bring them together, or the awkward person sitting silently in the corner trying not to "waste" his precious energy on people who are beneath him?   Classic Schmosby   This probably doesn't count, but my Skyrim character is a black female. The option to be one is fairly strongly presented.    my clothes will probably fit better than women's without tailoring  MFA would like a word   IIRC this exact one was in Strauss' book (The Game).   I generally pretend they don't exist  TIL I'm super attractive   I'm on my phone and can't see tags, so that whole comment was a rollercoaster of possible genders.    generally only considered from the male perspective   Really? I was expecting this thread to be full of men saying how badly they are treated by women because they're unattractive. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough down.    What is this, Sexual Achievement Sunday?   What's sad is that in the actual picture, the penguin is about to die.    Hodor   This isn't true. There do exist, unfortunately, truly unattractive women in the world (below the minimum standard of the vast majority of men). While this isn't necessarily their fault, they would have difficulty simply taking any man home.    Maybe not aggressive. I would personally be offended by that. But each to their own.    Musical theatre is a completely different art form to opera. It's much more accessible for someone who isn't a hardcore theatre fan, and the repertoire is considerably more well known by the public (e.g I Go To Rio from The Boy From Oz, *everyone* has heard that song)  OP, if you tell me what city you live in I can give you recommendations of productions.  EDIT: I might add that the timeframe in which something was composed is hardly an indication of its quality. I know hilarious and highly inappropriate operas with brilliant music, that can easily be compared in entertainment style to a modern comedy movie. Just because the accompaniment is a violin and not a guitar doesn't make it stuffy and awkward like most people seem to think.    Well, yes. You know what I mean.    I have a feeling that reddit has a higher concentration of these assholes than regular society, simply because they're the kind of dickheads who don't socially fit in anywhere else and retreat to anonymity.    One of them is from a guy whose username is I'mWaySmarterThanYou, which is interesting because you got it and he didn't.    What's wrong with tshirts? Assuming it's not the only thing they're wearing.    Men pretty much never get complimented on anything. So telling him all of these things is far from vanity - it's likely that he hasn't heard someone else say them in a while, if at all. He will be very pleasantly surprised.    AFAIK Asperger's isn't something you treat. It's a mental 'disability' (I don't know if that's the proper term and I don't believe it really disables you, so take it with a grain of salt) on the autistic spectrum, which just means that his brain is wired a little differently to that of most 'normal' people. He will have trouble innately understanding a lot of social stuff and human interaction, particularly sarcasm and body language, and may have trouble empathising. As far as being passive or having no goals goes, I think that's something he will have to consciously work to defeat. There's no reason why he can't (but I'm far from an expert so do your research) but he needs to understand first that these are not really healthy traits when taken to that extreme.    Yet more proof that everyone's different. So long as it didn't take up time that I needed for something else, I would adore a surprise date.    Wow, none of those are symptoms of depression. I would really, seriously look into Asberger's - I know nothing about it but I have a friend with it and he fits most of that criteria.    Before we met, he had absolutely no goals whatsoever, no interests or hobbies other than watching TV and playing computer games. He would just go to work at a grocery store (where he still works 8 years later), come home and play games/watch TV until it was time to go to work again.  As someone who has had it since the age of 12, this is *not* the result of depression. Sure it can (and not always) affect your motivation and your ability to focus, but nowhere near to this extent.   His mental illness is possibly contributing to some serious issues that he already has, not causing them. This guy (I'm sorry, but honestly) sounds like an apathetic loser, who is either using depression as a get-out-of-life-free card or is just completely unmotivated to do anything. There is no reason why he can't have goals and ambitions with depression.  EDIT: Or he has some other additional, possibly undiagnosed, mental illness. Is he medicated for depression at the moment, and if so, how heavily?   No one opens by grabbing a girl around the waist. That's not 'attempting kino,' that's suicide.   What women want, and what women *think* they want, are two very different things.    This kind of discussion comes up in this subreddit on a weekly basis, if not more. Every single time, a guy explains in detail about why we can't share our emotions. Then some chick comes sweeping in with "oh, but I personally just *love* it when guys open up to me! And I'm sure lots of other women do too!"  If they actually did, the problem wouldn't exist. For precisely the reasons you outlined above.    must hate Miranda  Am I the only person who doesn't like Miranda? Sure she's a cow sometimes, but so are most people.    from romantic partners  - girlfriend is, like most women, attracted to you because you appear confident and self-reliant - as you become comfortable in the relationship you tell her some of the horrible shit that has happened to you which gets you down, and you seek some emotional support - girlfriend completely loses all respect for you because you're not 100% made of steel, and leaves you for some brofag with 'more confidence' who actually just has the emotional capacity of a brick   Ultimate first world problem: I'm too rich and healthy to get laid   And don't feed him after midnight.    He did tell her. And he's invited her to come with him at every other occasion that she was going to be present.    Fellow Aussie here, keen to see how the US likes us.    Are you a dog?   It says in the post that all of these except no. 2 are to be done after having talked to them for some time.    The PUA is always different from the crowd.    IMO masturbating to the thought of someone real is infinitely better than some chick on the internet.    You'd think it would be, though. It's not a professional that gets paid vast amounts, so most of the people there are probably the ones who have always wanted to be, and it's creative and in constant communication with new people. Sounds like avert happy job to me.    If it was that easy, why do you think it happens so much?   Well, in some way or another, the girl in question will also be settling for him. OP is equally unlikely to be perfect, it's just not possible.    The Hobbit? Just because it's awesome?   Unless there is a better option immediately available.   Source: experience   IMO girls are different, in that they'd go for the body more than the face even more than guys. But that might just be me.    Vocal fry isn't lack of breath support, it's just a different register below your chest voice. By your logic you should hate people who slip into falsetto (which is a lot of people when they laugh).  Source: I'm a singing teacher studying voice at uni   Calipers also measure your body fat content, so I guess it could have been a clever pun.    I think his definition of gentleman is everyone else's alpha male.    How do you feasibly say that you can't have sex with her if she's expecting you to be a typical male horndog?   Yep, the adjective 'good' is describing a verb (dancing) so you would use the adverb form 'well.'   Find some friends who also have depression. I did, and it was the best thing I've ever done to help myself, because they always understand and are always there to help you. And then you can help them in turn.    Before he edited his comment, it said "this guy needs to grow some self esteem balls"   Reddit seems to be strongly biased against people with low self esteem, and loves to tell them to 'just respect yourself more.' Holy shit Sherlock, is that what I've been doing wrong all along? Especially when the esteem issue is medical and from a legitimate mental illness like depression, you can't just decide to like yourself overnight, and more importantly - *it's not their fault that they are depressed in the first place.*  It'a like telling someone with cancer to just harden up and get better already, and that if they die then they didn't try hard enough.    Seeing as it's supposed to be written in Arabic anyway, does it really matter?   Dear lord above yes. There is no reason to ever have pigtails, simply because no matter how good they look, a ponytail will always be better.    Too young. Like grade four young.    I think the most interesting thing is that most of her 'bitch friends' would have probably said the same thing to you.    A girl left a guy because he wouldn't put out? That's honestly the first time I've ever heard of that situation.   Not that I think it's wrong or anything, people have needs, but considering how our society and gender roles (let's be honest, they still exist, they're just more subtle) work.    I think about 10% of people - the really popular and attractive ones - had an amazing time in school. They were the ones telling other people that they weren't so desperate and so on. The other 90% thought it sucked.    I'm not sure if I acquired a ponytail fetish because of all the years of school and girls with their hair up, but they make me melt. Every time.    Yes, I'm never going to get old!   My name is Lorenzo von Matterhorn...   "Viruses" - toolbars and freeware   I've had several (platonic) female friends say that the best dates they've ever been on have been fun or exciting in addition to the talking.    She hates musicals? I can see why she's your ex.    For me, in the episode after Bastogne (I think) when the choir is singing and they fade out all the men who died. Heartbreaking.    What's worse is when she's attracted to you because you're confident, you begin to trust her and share some of your troubles, and then she no longer finds you attractive and dumps you for not being confident enough. This has happened to me on several occasions.   Ever since I've believed that women don't actually want men to share their feelings - they *think* they want to because they think that's what a good person should do. They want men to be strong and silent, because that is attractive.  	67
 i have been to a therapist before and they have referred me to a Psychiatrist to be assessed.    sorry to hear that    i have 0 money. i have no job. i am on a disability benefit of 73 pound a week. i am really ill and been to the hospital and doctors so many times this year. i have really bad depression. i have unknown illness that is still being looked into. i don't have any friends.   i want to have a job. i want to have a car. i want to have my own house.   i know now that i can't listen to anyone else and to do what makes myself happy.    i never did   i was thinking of showing my dad this post but then i was thinking about writing my dad a long letter. is that a good idea?    i really liked the last sentence you said.    theres a lot to say so i will try to say all the information. i don't even know if this is the right sub reddit to write this in. this will put me in bad light but i need all points of view. i am currently 27. i am a woman. i am british. i was brought up in a sunni gujarati muslim household. my childood was pretty perfect and nothing bad happened. my parents were married but divorced when i was about 17. my dad was a sikh but converted to islam to be with my mum when they were both at school. my mum started to distance away from islam and is one of the reasons why they split up. my dad got more strict. my mum no longer believes in islam. i started to have doubts about islam at a different time to do with my mums doubts. i moved away to go to university and felt conflicted because i wanted to date but felt like islam didn't let me. i started to move away from islam a lot. i became very westernised over a couple of years. i lost my virginity at 21. when it was time to move back to my parents city after finished university i confided in my dad that i had met someone and wanted to see them and maybe move in with them. he was a white non muslim and my dad freaked out. what then happened is i ran away to be with this guy. things settled then my family and parents visited me. my dad straight away told my boyfriend to convert to islam and have a islamic wedding. he didn't want to do that i didn't want him to do that either. we had only been living together for 5 months and known each other for about 8 months. the relationship ended for different reasons. 2 years pass and i get a new boyfriend. he is also white non muslim. i don't move in with him and take it slow. i think he is an awesome guy. i find out through his Facebook that he has extreme anti muslim views and is a member of the uk group edl or english defence league. i like an idiot tell my family and my dad finds out. everyone freaks out. my dad over speaker phone shouts that he is going to hurt my boyfriend and that i need to break up with him and stop seeing him. i shout some hurtful things at him on the phone. he says he is going to get his brother and him and beat up my boyfriend. i say that i am not going to break up with him. things settle down. the boyfriend then dumps me 2 months after all that happens. i move on. i used to be very close to my dad and we had a lot in common. we both like the same tv shows and movies as we are both very geeky. we like the same type of stand up comedy as well. my dad used to really support me and i looked up to him. the thing is since me moving away from religion and having boyfriends my dad tries to control me. when i was young he ripped off a good charlotte poster off my wall for having eyes. i used to be a goth and he would tell me not to wear certain clothes because it was promoting satan. i had a skeleton necklace and he tore it off my neck once. once when i was 13 he hit me really bad with a flip flop because i was making loads of noise in the morning and he was sleeping because he had done a night shift on the taxis. ever since the age of 17 me my brother and my sister would see him on saturdays and get picked up in the car. we would go to the cinema or go to a restaurant and it would be our dad time. i had facial piercings when i was about 18 and my dad hated them. said i looked ugly. i became vegetarian when i went to university and when he was shouting at me on the phone and threatening me and my then boyfriend he said something like 'this is just like the time you had the goth phase or the vegetarian phase' in the past my mum said to him to not mention islam in front of me because i don't believe it anymore and he still did. he went and bought me a book on islam. ever since the phone call shouting I've been avoiding him. i don't reply to his texts. i haven't talked to him in 2 years now. he keeps wanting to sort things out and fix it but i don't feel safe around him and i don't feel like i can be myself around him. i am now in a new relationship with a white non muslim athiest. i consider myself agnostic now. i live with my mum and brother and sister. my dad lives on his own. i managed to block his texts on my phone but i ended up getting a new phone. my brother ended up telling my dad my new number and has started texting me again. i want him to say sorry but i feel like i don't want to bother with him anymore. my sister and brother want me to talk to my dad again. they still see him weekly. when my dad comes in the house i stay upstairs in the bedroom and avoid him. he doesn't come up stairs. one time i was going out and my dad saw me, he said hey. i said hey. then i just got out of there. i was panicking. I'm scared he might attack me because I'm so far gone from the little girl he used to know. i feel like he doesn't know me anymore. my dad and my mum no longer talk to each other unless its an urgent matter with there children. my mum re married a white non muslim and hides it from all her relatives. should i try and talk to my dad and sort things out? twice before we have had bad arguments over the same thing. should i keep avoiding my dad? what else should i do? any questions you have or advice will be helpful. i know I'm going to get lots of hate.   i know that both of my parents are not perfect but i understand what you are saying.    i didn't think of that at all, i will have a think about it    also months ago i replied to one of my dads texts and say that i want an apology. no reply. i block him. on my new phone the most recent text says something like 'i want to know what it is i need to apologise for'   	10

Anna Kendrick character said a quote that helps me through the hard times and makes me more positive "you can't change the situation but you can change how you deal with it''    My mom loved Lee's Daniel's The Butler. She couldn't understand why I didn't like the movie. Oprah's death ruined the movie for me. I thought it could of been shown better.   Olive in Easy A   Agreed!   Thank you so much and thank you. Good luck and you are in the right field because your field will always be needed! It sucks that people do not have patience when I ask them to repeat something but hey I do hope one day people become more aware because its sad when people think deaf and hearing impaired are the same thing!    LOL it was an old man. I doubt he found me attractive, if he did I would be sketched out. Thank you!! I like to add some humour as well. My favourite part of pitch perfect when there was a scene where this club Deaf Jews appeared. Since then, I joke i'm in the back. I learned sense of humour gets you through it.    I think it's great to be in that field. I'm sending you a e-hug as well!  Techonlogy is amazing. I can listen to music wirelessly its amazing. I can never do that 10 years ago.    I've been hearing impaired for all my life and I wear two hearing aids. Yes, I'm very lucky to be able to get the care I need, but there are several struggles that I face everyday that many do not. Having a sense of humour helps me through this. I joke when my friends didn't hear me (shocking right) I say that my hearing loss is spreading onto them lol. I also joke that I'm the extra in pitch perfect in the deaf jew scene. I no longer have to worry about what to dress up as for halloween. I just need to be myself!  1- I had a professor refuse to repeat what he said in the lecture (no power points) even though the week before I told him I was hearing impaired. He said if I didnt keep on raising my hand I would of heard it.   2- People tell me that I talk to loud and a recent incident happened when I was sitting outside with friends at Starbucks and someone told me to lower my voice. I can't hear how loud I am and people do not understand that it's not my fault.  3- People think I'm deaf and it's sad that people do not know the difference between hearing impaired and deaf.  4- In loud places, I have a hard time hearing conversations   5- People ask the same questions- can you sleep with them, can you shower/swim with them, if you take them off can you hear, can you read lips/can you read mine, can you get electrocuted? (yes someone asked that)   6- A few years ago, I worked at a day camp. A kid wanted my attention and I talked to her then I went back to listening to the others when I heard people laughing. My co-workers were laughing at me because the kid wanted my attention again and I didn't hear. I hated working there.  I made this post because I believe people need to be more aware of hearing impairement and deaf. So the next time you hear someone talk loud think before you speak. They may wear hearing aids.    But they are still in a relationship regardless. I just hope this was worth it because you could loose a freindship    He will care    What I'm trying to say is that I didn't have a choice.- everyone has a choice or should. It's our right too. I just hope the choice you made is worth it because your friendship with your best friend won't be the same ever. Don't guys say bros before hoes?   I would end it because she does not the feel the same way about you if she was unfaithful to you.    I'm sorry to hear that. That happened with my friend too.    You only dated him for 2 months and he is already has a list of things for you to change. If I were you, I would run before the lists gets longer. If he really liked you for you who are, you wouldn't have to change.    Watch Movies!   Gay and Vegan are two completely different things. Vegan is a choice of a lifestyle the person has made and it has to do with food. Where gay is a sexuality and has to do with being attracted to same sex. Being gay is more accepted now than in the past but its still not a 100%. Where as Vegan is being healthy since now its the new thing to be skinny and be healthy. Some people on the internet are stupid. I would be all over that shit.    I have depression, and I went through a very difficult time from Nov-March. My dad cancer spread and after hearing so many good things it crushed me knowing that the treatment didn't work. When my sister told me she was engaged a week after I didn't feel anything. That's when I started to notice things were not so good. Suicidal thoughts began and I would always think about my funeral. Once I finally opened up to my therapist and my friends/family about it. I feel a lot better knowing that I'm not fighting it by myself. Yes it was hard to open up, but now I don't feel ashamed and I do not feel alone. I love movies, I watch movies all the time and it allows me to look forward to things ahead. I still have depression but I feel a lot better than I did before. I accepted what I had and I'm not letting it stop me. I always have a laugh about life because it makes things better when things are funny!    Easy A.   I'm glad I wasn't the only one who felt that way when watching Magic Mike. There was no chemistry at all between Channing and Cody. I felt like I was watching a really bad date.    I don't think it will be a sci-fi classic in 20 years because it was released at a bad week with Fault of Our Stars and it killed EOT at the box office.    It's too early to look at rotten tomatoes because yesterday was the first showing with the finished cut of the movie.    So I was really lucky and I got to attend the first advance screening in Toronto for Zach Braff second movie Wish I Was Here that he directed, produced, written and acted in. I also got to meet him in this fancy room with fancy drinks and food for all FREE! This girl on twitter couldn't go so she gave them to me! The movie was good, 3/5 stars! The soundtrack was good as well!   Fun fact: Steve Spielberg is in the credits for helping making the movie happening.    Glad to hear!! :) keep skating!    Happy Christmas Magic in the moonlight Malicifent  The Giver    50/50 sliver linings    You don't really need to watch the others. It's just better so you will know what happened because it continues from First Class. I liked first class   Gigi    filmfan   Lol   Thank you very much for the suggestions! It's nice to hear from others on how they dealt with this sort of situation.   Meryl Streep for sure.    The love interest of Channing Tatum in Magic Mike Teresa Palmer in Warm Bodies    I liked Drinking Buddies and I'm also a fan of Anna Kendrick. This movie looks hilarious and its nice to see Anna in a new role that we haven't seen her in yet.   	39
 I had them anyway so I just went for it.    I didn't really farm, just opened what I got for the first few days. Some favors (sold them, didn't want the horse), potions, profession stuff, and enchantments (made 2 rank 6).   Then Sunday rolls around and I'm still without a Lucky Coin so I found one for a decent price on the AH and got it.   And what do you know, like an hour later I had one drop, so my friend got a Lucky Coin too.    I guess I'm an optimist somewhere deep down because I think pretty much any two people can make it work if they're both willing to put in the effort.   That's why it's important that your BF understands why this is important to you and how big of a deal it is. He has to put forth the effort, even if the progress is slow, for you to feel validated.   Good luck.    Treat them like your landlords (they are). Sit down and discuss what responsibilities they expect from you and your husband. Are you paying rent? If not, are you contributing in another fashion? Groceries? Utilities? Cooking meals periodically?   What are appropriate quiet times, bathroom schedules, access to common areas? Are there any areas off limits to each other (ie stay out of each other's rooms)? What kind of cleaning do they expect from you (just personal areas or common areas as well or whole house, is there a rotation expected)?  Your husband probably isn't anxious because they are his parents and he's sure of his relationship with them. Just approach them tactfully and say you are really appreciative of them opening their home to you and you want to make the situation as smooth as possible. More communication means less misunderstandings.   Edit: You don't mention if you have children. If you do you need to make it clear what rules your in laws expect to be followed and also make it clear what type of discipline is acceptable. When I lived with my in laws I had a rule that my wife and I would discipline our children and my in laws needed to let one of us know if there was a problem. If the children are left alone with the in laws, only then would they receive discipline from them.    I suppose, looking back, I could have been clearer.   She crossed a line with Sam and she is dating Toby.   I'm not asking if these things happened or if she's had sex with them.   My issue is that she feels like she had no obligation towards me once she said 'I want a divorce' and therefore feels justified in all that she has done.   She had already checked out I suppose but I hadn't. I feel like the very least she could have done was told me she had met someone but she lied to me and I feel like, even though our marriage is ending that that is not ok.  Do I have unreasonable expectations of adult behavior or is her declaration of a desire for divorce enough to sever any responsibility we have to each other in the relationship?  Edit: a word   I don't think I'm in denial but I'm willing to admit that my judgement may not be the clearest at the moment. There are A LOT of emotions I'm dealing with.   Again, I have a lawyer, we are proceeding with a divorce. I have take steps (with advice from my lawyer) to separate our finances and property as much is as appropriate right now.   I am doing my best to be strong and be there for my kids.   I'm just having a really hard time dealing with how betrayed I feel and it doesn't help that she is totally unapologetic. To ask her she has every right to do what she has done.   We are getting divorced.   Maybe I wasn't clear in my post, but my desire for counseling was before I was in the hospital.   After she basically abandoned me and told me she 'couldn't support me' I was done with any thought of reconciliation.   I'm not trying nor do I have any desire to save the marriage. We are negotiating through our respective lawyers over details but are nearing a settlement.   My questions have to do with whether her actions would be considered cheating by anyone else. I feel like she did, she insists she didn't and her actions are justified. Am I crazy for feeling betrayed and cheated on?   This may be a little long, so, sorry.   At the beginning of January I stumbled across a text conversation between my wife and a coworker. I wasn't trying to snoop, she works late nights are restaurant a few nights a week and she had been out late one night after a shift and fell asleep on the couch once she was home. I tried to wake her so she could move to the bed but she wasn't budging. So I thought I would at least plug her phone in for her. When I did I noticed a text alert from the guy. I had heard her mention his name, we'll call him Sam, before but was curious why he was texting my wife at 3:00 in the morning.   At this point we still had access to each other's phones/emails etc. We had always shared passwords as I though we had nothing to hide. So I opened the conversation.   It wasn't explicit but it made me uncomfortable. I should mention that I had been feeling more and more distance from her for the few months prior to this and was starting to feel pretty depressed because of it.   The were texting back and forth about something I can't remember but I do remember it was a longer text conversation than I had had with my wife for some time. Our recent ones were all business and always short. They were flirty and at one point she said that if she had known him 10 years ago they would have had a lot of fun together.   We've been married 9 years, our anniversary was in December.   I went to work and I wrote her a long email about how I had been feeling distant from her and I didn't like it and how that conversation made me feel really uncomfortable and jealous. I felt like I could get my emotions across better in writing.   When I got home later that day, before I could speak to her, before she had even read the email, she told me we needed to talk and that she wanted a divorce.   This was pretty shocking to me because even though I wasn't happy with the recent distance and I knew we had issues, divorce had never crossed my mind.   I wanted to work things out. She said she didn't want to waste any more time in a relationship that was never going to work out.   We argued and talked for a few weeks and eventually she suggested that we separate and allow each other some space (and therapy) and after some time had passed we could start going to couples therapy.   She said there was nothing going on with Sam and she wasn't asking for a divorce/separation because she was interested in seeing other people either specifically (ie Sam) or in general.   Well, during this time I found another conversation between her and Sam, this time they were explicit.  She was saying how as soon as things were 'settled' how she wanted to 'have solo much fun' with him and how he better live up to the hype.  She was also sharing her sexual preferences and she said at one point 'Why didn't I go home with you? I wish I knew where you lived.'  I felt floored after that and my depressed state that had been building even before the first texts reached a point where I wanted to kill myself.   I ended up checking myself into a hospital and staying for most of the month of Feb.   Before I did that, I had also noticed her texting a lot with another coworker, we'll call him Toby. She said Toby was just a friend and I never saw anything inappropriate between them, just a lot of texts in general.   While I was hospitalized she basically abandoned me. She made no effort to bring our children to visit (they couldn't come directly to the ward but there was an area I could have supervised visits with them outside the ward). She only called me once, she did answer the phone most of the time if I called but shortly after my arrival told me 'I can't support you'.  She also never asked how I was doing when we did talk and was only concerned with when I would be home. She never visited me on her own either and only came to the hospital once to attend a meeting with my treatment team where she declared that she didn't want me to come home when I left and if I tried that she would make it a 'legal issue'  When I did return home she refused to sleep in the same room as me (we had been still sharing a bed previously) and had changed all her passcodes/passwords so I no longer had access to anything. She was also spending as much time away from the home as she could. Before I was hospitalized it was common for her to go out for a drink after a restaurant shift and be home late (1 or 2 am). That time had been getting later and later though as things went on and shortly before I checked myself in she didn't come home at all one night.   Once I was back she wouldn't come home until 3:00 or 4:00 on shift nights and other nights would stay out until sometime after 11 usually (her day job is done at 5:30).   I was suspicious and jealous and now I was snooping. This time I found a notebook she had written to Toby saying how she had been trying to think of a gift to give him for awhile since his birthday was the next day.  So she came up with this notebook where she was going to write down lyrics to all the songs that made her think of him and want to be close to him. She said hoped he had a great year coming up and how she was so excited to be starting out the year with him. She finished the intro, 'I love you Toby'  When I confronted her about the book she told me that as far as she was concerned we were separated as of the day I checked into the hospital and she didn't owe me any kind of explanation or consideration.   We are moving forward on the divorce. I am in therapy.   My lingering questions are this:   1. I feel like she crossed a line with Sam but I don't know that it's technically an emotional affair (I believe nothing physical happened between them). Did she cheat with him?  2.  Is she right that she didn't/isn't cheating with Toby since she has already told me she wanted a divorce and we were 'separated'?  My feeling is since we never discussed seeing other people and in fact, she had stated that she wasn't interested in doing so that she went behind my back with this relationship. Am I being too literal with my definitions?  3. How do I move passed this?  I feel like I need answers to 1  2 so I know if I can tell people that she cheated on me and not be thought of a paranoid or crazy. Not that I'm planning on screaming it from the rooftops or anything but, like, if it comes up.   But regardless of what I tell people how do I get passed the feeling that I've been cheated on?  I don't think I'm at the point where I'm going to assume all women are lying, cheating harlots but I'm afraid some insecurities are going to pop up in the future about this issue.   Thanks to anyone who actually read all of that.   TLDR: My wife and I are getting divorced. She's started a relationship with another man behind my back. Is she cheating or is she justified?     Sounds good.    I'm up.   I've run it once before but had major issues with the boss. Having a good team would be a big help.   GT: Jaird  DC, 13.9 Gear Score   'Hey baby. We need to talk. I love you and I think you're really hot (insert appropriate specifics about his features that you enjoy). I love the sex we have but I think it could be better. I really get turned on when I know that you're having a good time and that you're really into what we're doing. I need to be able to get real feedback about what you like so I can make things better for you and better for me. I hope you know that I would never judge you for what you say.'  Something like that for an opener, maybe. As for the non-answers you're going to have to be a little blunt. If you ask 'Do you like it when I do...' And he says 'I don't know' you're going to have to straight out tell him that that isn't helpful. Tell him you need an answer. Try to phrase your questions so he can answer Yes or No, giving longer, more detailed answers (though helpful) may be too much for him right now. I think it's going to be a slow process.   You also need to start telling him what you like and what you expect. If you want more oral, let him know.   'I really like going down on you because of how excited it makes you, it makes me feel good to please you. Don't you want do the same for me?'  If you want him to initiate, let him know. Come up with a sign or phrase he can use to get things going.   'I think it's really hot when you start things. The next time you want me I want you to (touch me here, kiss me there, say 'this')'  Share with him your fantasies. Start with things that you guys have already done 'I really loved it that one time when we...' He may not be ready to hear everything yet.   On the masturbation front it's going to take time for him to feel ok with talking with you about it. I have some of the same issues with it.  I've always felt on some level that it's something I need to be ashamed of. Additionally I've never had a partner who was totally ok with it, which I'm sure hasn't helped.   You might be able to get things going by introducing porn yourself. Have you got yourself off in from of him?  Tell him you want to watch a movie (not X rated) that has a scene that really turns you on (don't tell him that part ahead of time). When you get to that part tell him that you're feeling really turned on from watching that and ask if it's ok if you touch yourself. Letting him feel like he's in control may help him feel more comfortable with the idea. If he's game then do it and encourage him to do the same. If he doesn't want to get himself off then tell him to touch you and kiss you but don't transfer to PIV. Let him know that you love PIV (if he asks) but that sometimes it's fun to just touch yourself and be touched.   If that goes well you can bring up watching something more explicit together and see how that goes.   You're going to have to be his guide, open the doors. Hopefully he will reach a point where he can be a more equal participant in your sexual journey but for now you're going to have to lead and he's going to have to follow.   Last, but not least (hope you're still with me after this massive response) if things aren't progressing to your liking you may want to seek out counseling. And you also need to consider, if things don't improve, that you too just aren't sexually compatible. That can be a relationship killer. You feeling constantly frustrated by him (and sexually) will lead to resentment and loss of respect.   I don't think it's hopeless but I can't say it will be easy and it definitely won't be quick.   Good luck.    Read over your custody agreement and see if there is a provision requiring in parent to inform the other of changes in living arrangements. My custody agreement has such a clause.   If yours does not then there is probably nothing you can do to force him to tell you. If it does then he is in violation of your agreement and you need to contact a lawyer to see what your next steps are.    I can't tell you to stay or leave, that's a choice only you can make but here are a couple things to think of that I got from your story:  You wife is sorry that she broke your trust, but not sorry enough to actually cut contact with the other guy.   She didn't come to you and admit anything, you found her out. And even given the chance to come clean, she lied. She would have continued to lie if never confronted with proof.   Leaving aside your history with her is this the type of person you want to be with?  Someone who is totally comfortable lying to you and at least from an outside perspective, not sorry for doing it?  If you stay a lot of things need to change, most of them have been mentioned already. You need to figure out what is best for you.   I promise you that you being happy and sane is way more important to your children than just staying married to stay married.   Good luck.    Make it clear to him how big a deal this is to you, that it's making you question your future together.   Tell him if something doesn't change that you cannot continue.   Be prepared, if you guys stay together, to assume responsibility for things that CANNOT be forgotten (money, birth certificates, medical appointments, etc)  You can work with him on setting schedules and routines, that should help with his forgetfulness a little bit. Chances are though, he's never going to be a super responsible person when it comes to physical items. Some people just can't do it.   It doesn't mean he's a bad person and it doesn't mean that he would (automatically) be a bad father.   I would speak with him, enforce the importance of the issue, and set a small goal.   If he makes acceptable progress towards meeting that goal (acceptable to you) then continue. If he doesn't try or doesn't take it seriously then I would consider breaking things off with him.   He cannot change this part of his personality overnight but if he is serious about yours and his relationship then he needs to make an effort.    It could just be low libido. Or it could be something else, or a combination of the two.   First, I think he needs to see a doctor. You don't mention his energy level but if his testosterone is low then low energy (and libido) would likely be symptoms. To make it easier for him (if it's true) maybe focus on he energy side rather than the sexual side. 'I think you should get this checked out, having correctly balanced hormones can give you more energy and generally make you feel better'. Something like that. Also, speak with him about your dad going. I love that your parents are so supportive but the idea of going with your dad may seem very intimidating. If he doesn't want to go alone maybe you could offer to accompany him.   I feel like, given his upbringing and current environment, that he is very uncomfortable talking about sex.  You need to work on that with him.   Let him know that you love him and you enjoy the sex that you have but you would like to be more open with each other. It will probably take awhile to draw him out but make it clear all along the way that you love him and you want/need for him to be open with you about his desires/kinks/fetishes, etc.  I think he is probably lying to you about masturbation. But, try not to take that personally, I feel like that's a product of his upbringing; the fact that he feels like it's wrong and something to be ashamed of. I wouldn't take it as a slight against you or a sign that he doesn't trust you.   And maybe he doesn't have any defined preferences or kinks but that doesn't mean you guys can't figure out together what he likes.  Tell him that you want to try new things and find out what he likes. He likes when you wear skirts, maybe he would like a whole school girl get up or some stockings. Try new positions. Go slowly with new things and have conversations afterwards about what he likes/didn't like. And it's ok if he didn't like everything but don't accept non-answers. He needs to communicate.   Tell him over and over that this is important to you and is an issue that needs to be taken seriously, not just brushed off.   Hopefully you can get him to be communicative and he can learn more about his sexual self.   Good luck.   	15

 That is exactly why [Cronulla is no longer as good as when I was growing up](http://www.beachandbay.com.au/realestateblog/greenhills-beach-new-land-released-september-17/).   Developers made a large donation to the state government, despite Sutherland Shire council strongly opposing it, in the end they had no say. $$$   Do you prepare you clothes and belongings the night before?   When I didn't live in the city it was up by 6-6:30am to drive to the station and get the train between 7-7:30 and arrive in the city around 9am. Now I live in the city I get up around 7:30 to get to work by 9am on the bus.  But at the moment I wake up whenever I damn well feel like it because I'm on leave :)   Oh that's sad. I've had some good times here, especially when they've had some pretty awesome and unexpected free live music.   lol. Sounds delicious. I thought it would be okay because it's mostly older people in there... or does that make it not okay.    I guess it depends what type of person you and your friends are. Are you into outdoor stuff? Do you want to go drinking? Do you have other shared interests?  Anyway here's some ideas:  * [Paintball](http://ultimatepaintball.com.au/)  * [White Water Rafting in Penrith](http://www.penrithwhitewater.com.au/pages/whitewater-rafting.asp)  * [Skyzone Trampoline Dodgeball](http://www.skyzone.com.au/) * Go to a bar with [board games](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/features/9737/top-five-bars-with-board-games). I know it might sound lame but board games can be fun! Just don't play ones where people get knocked out completely and have to sit around and wait for the game to be over.  * [Go Karting](http://www.kartatak.com.au/)  * [Surfing Lessons](http://manlysurfschool.com/)  * Book a room in a venue and hang out there for the night - beers + drinks sorted. I think there are a few places that will let you book rooms.  * [Murder Mystery Party](http://www.murdermysteryfun.com.au/) - You can also do this one yourself.  * [Luna Park Party](http://www.lunaparksydney.com/parties-groups)     Lol. The older I get the more fun this sounds. :)    Thanks! After reading about all the pubs I've been to I feel like I must be a bit of a drunk. :)   I'd recommend [Lord Nelson's](http://www.lordnelsonbrewery.com/) in the city for a bit of historic Sydney charm.  Just down the road from that is the [Argyle Hotel](http://www.theargylerocks.com/) which actually appears on the $20 note - as it used to be called the [Argyle Stores](http://urbaneventsvenues.com.au/articles/2014/7/24/from-convicts-and-liquor-stores-to-dance-floors-a-history-of-the-argyle) which was a warehouse for ships a while back. It can get [busy on Friday nights](http://www.barsandnightclubs.com.au/assets/images/content/club/sydney//The%20Argyle%20Hotel%20-%20The%20Rocks/The%20Argyle%20Hotel%20-%20The%20Rocks%20-%20Sydney%20-%20Photo02.jpg) so head over before 6pm if you can.  There is another pub on one of the steep hills in the Rocks but more towards Wynyard, [Harts Pub](http://hartspub.com/hartspub/Welcome). It's quite old inside so has a bit of an old Sydney feel, but don't try walking down that hill when you're drunk.  A little bit further towards the bridge, is the [Australian Heritage Hotel](http://www.australianheritagehotel.com/). They do good pizzas here. This is your stereotypical Australian pub. It's a bit of a tourist attraction, but who cares, I like it anyway.  Another nearby key kind of place in the Rocks is [Push Bar](http://www.pushbar.com.au/). It's been renamed a couple of times so I get confused, but I like sitting around in here with 3-4 friends and some beers and/or cocktails.  If you're looking for views, head to [Opera Bar](http://operabar.com.au/) in Circular Quay. The [views from this bar](http://www.boudist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Opera-Bar-and-Kitchen__credit-Daniel_Boud-048.jpg) include the Harbour, Harbour Bridge and Opera House. It's only good when it's raining if you get a seat inside.   There's a couple of little bars around but harder to find. Two of my favourites are [The Baxter Inn](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/venues/4904/baxter-inn) which is a whiskey bar, and [Palmer   Co](http://merivale.com.au/palmerandco) which is a 20's themed prohibition style bar. For both of these you need to get in early especially on Fridays, where they get busy any time from about 4pm onwards. There are a couple more small bars listed [here](http://www.urbanchicguides.com/top-10-sydney-small-bars/#.VThGhCGf4Q8) that I haven't tried yet, but I love the small bars. Keep in mind the drinks can be pricey at some of these places though, so if you specifically want to get drunk maybe head outside the city.    Also because you specifically mentioned brews, I've got a couple of suggestions: Lord Nelson is a brewery so go there. There is also [Sydney Brewery](http://sydneybrewery.com/). It used to be called ["the Mac"](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/the-macquarie-hotel-sydney) and I also heard somewhere it was called [the Scwartz](http://barzine.com.au/the-mac-surry-hills.html), but in any case, the rebranding has done them well. Their beers are not bad at all.   *Edit: The Mac hotel/brewery is now Harpoon Harry's   apparently not as good anymore (see comments below this).*  If you're out at Manly, hit up [4 pines](http://4pinesbeer.com.au/). It's just across the road from the ferry. Beer is nice and food isn't bad either! You can get the ferry out there from Circular Quay (I think it's wharves 3 and 6 - there is a fast one and slower one).   If you're more into Wine, check out [Wine Odyssey](http://www.wineodyssey.com.au/) in the Rocks. It's a bit touristy but the service is pretty nice.   If you want to see stuff from high up, I have two suggestions. First is [Blu Bar at Shangri-La Hotel](http://www.shangri-la.com/sydney/shangrila/dining/bars-lounges/blu-bar-on-36/). Second is [O Bar](http://www.obardining.com.au/) located in Australia Square, which is poorly named because it's actually a cylindrical building near Wynyard. Keep in mind both these places are more expensive. Cocktails at Blu bar are around $20. Generally we just have one or two and enjoy the view. Or buy a bottle of wine and share it.   If you're looking for something lower key, there are other places outside of the city. Within walking distance (via "the Domain" - a park) you can get to [Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel](http://www.woolloomooloobayhotel.com.au/). It has water views - good for a pub lunch and a beer.   In Newtown there are a few hotels. I don't mind something simple, so [Coopers](http://coopershotel.com.au/) suits me and has a nice upstairs area. The [Bank Hotel](http://bankhotel.com.au/) used to be pretty popular but I haven't been there in ages so have no idea now. There is the [Marly Bar](http://marlboroughhotel.com.au/) which is a long standing Newtown Hotel. It may not the fanciest place ever but it's consistent. If you go here you can grab a bite to eat upstairs at [Miss Peaches](http://www.misspeaches.com.au/) which does Southern US soul food... though if you're from Canada you probably get better versions of it over there.  Hope that helps! I've tried all the bars I've mentioned so if you have any questions let us know. :)     Rain itself isn't so bad. Rain + wind is not as fun.    I'd never even heard of a roast before this post.   Ah right, yeah I'm talking about city usage e.g. around uni. If I'm on rocks or snow then I've got a completely different set of criteria, and own a different set of clothes.   The jacket I have is great for regular rainy weather, easy bushwalks, going out on boats (wind   sun protection), sitting on the beach/coastal walks in bad weather, walking around the city, etc. Nothing really intensive like climbing or going in the snow. It has no warmth protection other than being windproof, and to me is suitable for Sydney weather.   I've found Kathmandu okay, but really overpriced. There is no way I would pay full price for any of their stuff. The quality is just dependent on what you get. Those pocket-it rain jackets are cheap things. My favourite by far is the FILA jacket with the lining, but I got mine on sale for $50 - and a similar sort of jacket to mine is about $90 according to [the FILA site](http://www.fila.com.au/index.wsp/fila?page=ViewProduct StyleCode=ASJ10080 Cate=MENS grp=TOPS) but mine has pockets - I prefer it with the pockets.   Let it be water off a ducks back. You're doing things many people could never dream of.   I think it shouldn't necessarily have been "question" in that sentence. The examples given were more like statements e.g. "you'll change your mind". Maybe they should have said "It's not your place to make presumptions about me." Or "It's not your place to second guess me".    I caught the light rail after midnight on nys. It was packed though. Barely standing room.    Oh yeah I never noticed the start of a freeway sign. I feel silly now.    I've stayed at the Swissotel before. Parking is in a nearby secure parking garage and is $45 a day with in/out priviledges. You get one exit after checking out.  http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/sydney/explore-hotel/guest-services/   I've checked out a couple of others but they're all around the same price, often more.  Would he consider parking his car at the long-term parking at airport if he doesn't need it for the duration of his trip? Sounds like no from what you've said?   Otherwise maybe a stayz place with a carspace would work. I stayed in one in Perth specifically for the car space.    If you stay somewhere near a station, e.g. http://www.stayz.com.au/accommodation/nsw/sydney/mascot/79611 then he can walk to the station   jump on there to the city, which is a short train trip. I think it's about $15 extra per night to use the car space and you need to book it.   Ok, so this is the End Freeway sign I mean: http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/GoreHillFreeway/Map/end%20freeway.JPG http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/images/roads/safety-rules/roadrules/motorway-start-stop-signs.jpg  I think it's a barrier but my SO thinks it's a bridge.  I always thought it was a barrier because it's the end of the freeway, but he was saying that the feet are on either side because it's a bridge, and those types of overpasses are over freeways. Plus there are no more bridges, so maybe there are intersections with traffic lights coming up. That makes sense too! So now I don't know what it is. What do you think?         I hate it when anybody throws a verbal jab via a conversation with someone else. If you have an issue with someone, discuss it with them like an adult.    Good luck!   Yes I have a shorter pair and longer pair. I don't really recommend getting longer ones - they're not that practical - the short ones are good tho :)   Honestly if it's in my direct path, I just pick it up and put it in the bin myself. I don't really care about getting my hands dirty. If it's really gross I have a pack of wet ones in my bag.   I was standing at a bus stop and there was a newspaper from the local grocers flapping around all over the pavement. It was driving me nuts because it was about to blow everywhere. I just picked all the pieces up and put it in the bin, while the other 10+ people just stood there and let me do it. Maybe I'm a crazy old woman now or something but argh. I have nothing else to do but wait for the bus.    I got a FILA rain jacket for $50 at some place in Newcastle - one with the meshy lining is good so it doesn't get all sticky. I also have a Kathmandu one that I got on sale with the meshy stuff.  Kathmandu have pocket-it ones too if you want something really lightweight you can carry around. You can view them [here](http://www.kathmandu.com.au/mens/jackets/rainwear.html#!p=2 offset=1948) - just search for pocket-it.  I reckon the meshy lining is worth it though - makes it much less sticky.   You can also get them from Big W but with this weather they'll probably all be sold out in your size. Best time to buy a rain jacket is not when it's raining unfortunately.   If you're going to be doing a lot of walking in the rain get some rain pants too that you can wear over your regular pants. [Example](http://www.kathmandu.com.au/mens/trousers/full-length/pocket-it-rain-trousers-v2-black-6.html)  Another place that is pretty good is Uniqlo. They're more budget end but they have nice stuff. e.g. [Shorter jacket](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-light-pocketable-hooded-jacket-139257.html#53) or you can get a [longer one](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-waterproof-pocketable-coat-139291.html#69)  For gumboots I reckon [Wellies](https://www.wellies.com.au/) is great - I've bought some through there before and they're pretty nice.   I think this is really important. Being able to know who you are on your own first means that you don't rely on another person for your life to be complete. Your life can be complete as an individual. I think it comes from the knowledge that you can enjoy life on your own - and I don't know if many people get to experience that, or if they are too worried about finding an SO to live in the moment. I have fond memories of some of the times I travelled alone and it has stuck with me. I'm not saying that I don't like being around people, or having people in my life, just that I know that my happiness is not dependent on the relationship, the relationship is just a beautiful addition.    :( I never could. Maybe you just have to learn to live with it. Accept it and move on and after a bit of time the sadness will be more distant.    Wounds heal but scars remain.   I've done some through Vistaprint. They were pretty good.    :( Maybe you need a break from the searching for a while? Focus on some stuff that you really want to do with your life?    I'm average but I sometimes just don't care. I've got too much going on in my head to give a crap about what I look like on the outside.   You have beautiful hair   My sister tells me not to buy her kids gifts. She said she doesn't want them to grow up expecting stuff. She always tells me that just me being there is enough. So glad I don't have family like the one who wrote the letter.   Find something they don't really give a toss about and don't want to do... like say, being a blood spatter expert or a mortician who specializes in embalming. When they say they have no interest in that, explain to them that it's just a phase and they will change their minds when they're older. Or... this works well for an embalmer... tell them they just haven't met the right person yet. If they don't get the picture throw in some visual imagery of draining blood and replacing them with embalming fluid to remove the rigomortis. Then explain how when people die they are sometimes purple and a good mortician should know how to apply makeup. If it's not setting in yet describe the smell of rotting flesh and the gases output by bacteria that takes over your body after you die.  Sometimes you just know what you don't want.   The only problem is that question just fuels them to explain more about how they can't sleep because it's uncomfortable.   Best to just remove their feed from yours or unfriend them. They're annoying while pregnant with twins... it's only going to get worse.   My dad was the only person to give me a good response to saying I didn't want kids.   He said... "It's up to you if you want to have kids or don't want to. There are pros and cons to both. If I didn't have kids I could have done other things that I didn't do because I had them. "   He did add at the end "But if you do want them, it's best to do it before 35." But that's the doctor in him talking.   Anyway, I don't know but that was one of the best conversations we've ever had. It just felt like a weight had been lifted from me.   Maybe he's just tired and that's how he sleeps.   I didn't know about this. Sounds pretty good. The data isn't unlimited, but it's heaps.  "This plan includes unlimited standard talk, text, MMS and voicemail plus 500MB of data within Australia at a cost of $2 a day."   I wouldn't rely on it. I'd probably just get a SIM.   ALDI https://www.aldimobile.com.au/   One prepaid plan has 3GB for 30 days for $30 https://www.aldimobile.com.au/plans/datapacks I think it's 3G not 4G but still cheap, and on Telstra which has the best coverage.  When I was in the US I just got a data pack and used Skype to make calls.    My boss asked me to let him know when we're planning to have kids. Umm... even if I was planning them, which I'm not, I'm not going to let you know!!  (On phone) "Hi boss. Just letting you know we're about to copulate. Any day now. "  Yeah uhh no.   I've had mixed results depending on who it is. My school counsellor wasn't very good and gave me some terrible advice.  I see a psychologist now who is really good, and understands most of what I need from the sessions. The first session should be kind of a getting to know you thing. You can talk about anything that is bothering you - no matter how minor it might seem. I don't know what it's like for everyone else but for me it is about gaining a better understanding of myself and as a result learning better coping skills. I have had periods where I felt I could do it alone but then I crumble over time, so I keep going back. When things are better I go less frequently, and when they're bad I go often.    What type of counselling is it? Are you going to a psychologist or something else?   Thanks! :)    I guess you just have to choose something and go for it. Is there anything you really want for your life?   I'm in my 30s from Australia.   I just finished paying off my debt last year. Yay! Except I'm old now.   I wish someone would tell this to people in Sydney where the median house price is above AUD$1m (over US$780k). :(   Well if you need to talk... I'm here. I have no experience with family separation but I can be a good listener. My parents separated when I was young too.  I also found this booklet about coping with going through a separation (including when you have kids). Maybe it will help you to think about a few key things.  http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/publications/cs1144    I am like you, my brain just won't stop. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, and it makes my depression even worse. Sometimes I keep myself busy only to have nightmares because all those repressed feelings are coming out when I sleep.  What makes you think you're a failure?   I have found going through this process works for me a little. Maybe you can try it and see how you go? I usually like to write it out because it gets it out of my head and onto paper.   1. Notice you're feeling uncomfortable emotions.   2. Identify all the emotions you're feeling - angry, sad, frustrated, annoyed, etc.   3. Once you've done that try to rationalise them - why do I feel this way? Did I do something or did someone else do something to make me feel like this?   4. Figure out - is your feeling/reaction helpful? If No - then you need to let it go e.g. by forgiving yourself. If Yes - work out what action you can take and when. Then until you can take that action, leave it aside and don't think about it anymore, until the time you take the action.     I see. I hope you can get through it. Another option could be to change schools. Is that something that may be possible for you? Maybe now you've lost weight people won't have that image of you. Can you talk to your parents about it and see if they have any ideas for how to deal with it?    Well I used to know someone in school who used to have good comebacks. So when someone would call him fat he'd yell at them and say "At least you can fix fat, you can't fix ugly!". Maybe you can make jokes about them back and see if they ease up. If it doesn't help, then maybe you could try talking to a school teacher or counsellor for advice on how to deal with it. They might be able to sit down and have a simple chat with you and your friends and talk about it between you and what is acceptable behaviour, because I can tell you that is not how a friend should be treating you.   There are a lot of people standing around outside business services like it is recess. No wonder the trains were always late.    First, congrats on losing 40 pounds. That's amazing! I am trying to lose a bit of weight too and it's so hard so I can appreciate the effort that must have gone into that. That is an incredible achievement right there! If you have a healthy BMI then that's even better. :)   It sucks that people are picking on you. Please try not to let them bring you down. Either they are saying mean things unintentionally without realising how much it is hurting you or they have an ugly personality and are really trying to bring other people down to make themselves feel better. If you think people are doing it unintentionally, you can ask them not to, perhaps they don't realise what they're saying. If people are doing it intentionally then ignore them, and remind yourself of your achievements already, because it is no small feat to lose weight. It takes an incredible amount of self control and determination.    Can I ask how old you are? Are you in highschool? People in highschool pretty much suck. I had one person come into my highschool and give a talk about how highschool matters so much and how you'll reflect on it being the best days of your life. I can tell you they were WRONG about my life. Sure, maybe for them it was the highlight, but for me there was so much more beyond school, and for me at least it was a lot better.    I think the first step is acknowledgement and acceptance of what's happened. Yes, it is utterly shit that this situation happened. It sucks that when you needed to and chose to confide in someone in confidence they broke your trust and your life got screwed over. You were just looking for a shoulder to lean on and instead you lost a future you had envisaged for yourself, and now you're going down what you feel like is a lesser path. Ok yeah, that sucks. I won't sugarcoat it because that's a pretty raw deal you got. But part of accepting it is realising that it's in the past, and the future doesn't have to be the same. You can change the future - you have that power! And it can be a different path and still good.  So the next step is to decide what you're going to do now. Ok, so you picked community college. What are you studying? Do you like it? Do you want to continue? If not then what other options are available to you? Do you see any of them as things you'd like to do? Sometimes I find it helpful to think about problems as if I was an outsider and it was a friend in the same situation as me - what advice might you give them? At this point maybe all the choices you want to be available to you aren't, but that's okay, if it's something you want then there should be other ways to get there.  You might not feel like doing all this, I get it, but you're in a bit of a slump and you are the only one who can climb out of it. Sure you can lean on others for support - maybe if you don't feel like you can trust the mental health system, instead try anonymous support phone lines or chat rooms for support. Start by setting yourself small goals to begin with and try to take each day at a time, focusing on making each day count. You might still have bumps in the road but each day you do something positive is a step in the right direction.   Don't give up. You can still have a good life, it's just that now you're travelling a slightly different path than the one you previously had in mind...    :'( I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you got through to talk to someone though, and that they were able to help. Hopefully now you have somewhere to call next time too.   Thanks! This is really interesting. Do you know how many public holidays each of these places gets a year? That's also paid work in Australia - Are public holidays paid to full-time staff in most other countries?   Did you get through to anyone?    I know this message is late but I am going to write it anyway, in the hope that you do read it.   Please reach out to someone, anyone, and talk it through with someone, even reddit if that's all there is. I don't know what your situation is but I hope you can get through this and if you do I hope you read this and consider that strangers on the internet care enough to write a plea to you and beg for you to reconsider. You must be in a lot of pain, but know that you don't have to be alone.    Try not to be too hard on yourself. Interviews are not particularly good at judging someone's aptitude, so in terms of an entrance requirement they kind of suck.   Is there something else you could consider studying? I've been rejected from a course I wanted to do and I did something else instead. It turned out to be a better choice for me, maybe there is something else for you?  If you are sure you want to do floristry and horticulture maybe you could try getting some experience in a florist, so when you apply you have some experience in it. Then if you were to apply in January next year they should look on that favourably and you will also have improved yourself. Usually there is more than one road that leads to the same destination.   What do you think?   Can I ask what problem it is that you're trying to discuss? Perhaps it would help in finding a suitable person to talk to? If you don't feel comfortable saying so, then it's okay.   Oh man, I can't believe how hard it is for you to get through to someone. :(   Perhaps you could try the suicide hotline again? It sounds like the person you spoke to wasn't very good, but there might be others that work there that are.   Is it an option for you to go see a doctor? They might be able to refer you to a counsellor or something. If you are able to get through tonight then I suggest this.   If you're really struggling to find someone to talk to perhaps a church minister would also be an option. Personally I'm not religious but if you just need someone to lend an ear perhaps it might help. Again it depends who you talk to, but they may be able to spare some time with you and really listen to you. Some churches offer counselling services that charge a small fee based on a sliding scale depending on income.   Just trying to throw some options out there. I hope you can find someone.  Please don't give up though.      Which siuicide hotline did you call? Was it this one? http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/   You could try some of the numbers here, though I can't tell you which are any good - sorry: http://psychcentral.com/lib/telephone-hotlines-and-help-lines/000173    I should have mentioned that there is a grieving process, and you will go through it. I think it's important to know that no one way of grieving is the right way, and you will have your own way of dealing with it. The way I have gotten through it is to do my best to be a better person. She was studying to be a psychiatrist. She was beautiful and smart and caring. I can't replace her but I do try my best to be a better person.   I also had a friend last year who passed away suddenly one weekend. He was 32 and he had an undiagnosed heart condition. He was so happy with his life and he was out celebrating the birthday of his beautiful girlfriend the night before. I had spoken to him on the friday and he was showing me all the arrangements he had made - he had gone to so much effort to make her happy. In stark contrast to my school friend he wanted so much to live. He had a beautiful life laid out for him and he only needed a chance to live it.  I took a few months off to figure out what it is that I want from life. I make more time for the people I care about, I make more time for myself, I won't let work take over my life again, I will do the things that I have always said I would do but got too busy to do before. I will try my best to help those in need. I also realised that I would never take my own life because I couldn't stand the suffering that it would cause.  To be honest there is nothing that can take the pain away from losing a dear friend. But over time you will find a way to cope, and if you can, you will find a way to make your life matter. I wish you the best of luck, and never feel like you are alone. If you ever need someone to talk to who knows what it's like... I'm here for you.   My best friend from high school committed suicide last August. The last time we talked she was moving cities and I said I would try to catch up with her and never did. I thought it was only 6 months but when I looked back at my facebook messages it was over a year and a half.   I was really upset. We went through everything in highschool together, and to know that she felt so alone and felt like she had nowhere to go for help killed me inside. I was on holiday when I found out and I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I wasn't balling my eyes out or anything until the funeral. I didn't even take tissues because I didn't know how I was going to react but as soon as I saw her coffin, and pictured her lifeless body in there it just broke something in me. I bawled my eyes out. She didn't deserve this, and her family and friends didn't deserve it. I was mostly angry at myself for being too busy with work and not putting in the time to go see her.  I don't know what to say to console you, I suppose I just want to tell you that I know something like what you're going through. It still upsets me. She left a note but her family chose not to share it. I don't know how she did it and in some ways it doesn't matter - it's done. There is a pain inside me that will never go away, and I wish so much that I could go back in time and save her. I wish so much that she was still here.   If you can't find a number try this: http://www.7cupsoftea.com/   What country are you in? I only know Australian support numbers :(   A brain injury is no small thing, and thank goodness your mum cares about you enough to ensure you got the right diagnosis and treatment. I have had a series of sports injuries including a recent concussion, and it's nothing to mess about with. I lost my vision too for a short time and then fell asleep for a few hours straight after. Mine wasn't as serious as yours but it's been weeks now and I'm still feeling the effects of it.   I'm so sorry to hear about your girlfriend. Maybe she still cares about you, and it sounds like she was hurt because to her it might have seemed like you were emotionally cheating. I can hear that's not true, because you still care for her, but she must be having a very hard time seeing that. Maybe when you feel up to it you can try talking to her and explaining this again to her - when it's less fresh. It might not be too late. However I can speak from experience that distance relationships are very difficult and trust is so important, so if trust can't be built, then it might be a very difficult relationship to maintain.   You sound like you're still young, and yes, things haven't gone well for you. But you sound like you have the resilience to keep going and working on improving things. Perhaps the best thing is to focus on your recovery first and foremost.   Also just a tip from someone who has been riddled with injuries - try not to binge eat too much junk food. I did that when I was injured and really depressed and it's really hard hard work to get rid of. Focus on your health - good eating habits will also help you sleep better and will aid your recovery.     :( You sound exhausted. Have you considered consulting a financial advisor who can help you with your finances? It sounds like you're really trying to make the situation better but perhaps you don't have all the tools you need to get out of it. Perhaps if you can't spare the time and/or money you can try asking on reddit for a free place to call to get assistance? I don't know the right sub for this, but maybe try /r/personalfinance . Sometimes it might just be a matter of getting an outsider to take a look and see what other options might be available to you.      Was there some criticism in particular that you had difficulty taking on? Was it constructive or was it just plain hurtful? Do you think it could be in your interpretation of their statement or do you think that's how the message was intended?   First question is - do you think you will like speech therapy? And what other options do you have? The best way to go about this is to think about all the options available and weigh up the pros and cons. Then you might have a clearer picture about whether you're making the best choice from a few available choices.  In terms of student debts, you have to think about if the investment is worth it? What else could you do with the time and money? If programming is an option you're considering, is that something you would enjoy doing?   While education is an investment and I generally feel it is worthwhile, if you aren't improving your outcomes then you really need to think about what your options are. It sounds like you're clever enough to be in the position to have choices, which is good, but it sounds like it is agonising not knowing which path to choose.  Don't worry about what society expects, think about what you want from your life. Some people would be fine in carrying the student debt because they are passionate about what they want out of life and know that's what they want to do and the study will enable that. There is no right or wrong. It's really a personal choice, and so you need to try to think rationally about what it is that you personally want from your life.     Also can everyone please occasionally check that both headlights are working? I nearly drove straight into a one headlight car thinking it was a motorbike.    How did everything go for you?   I thought I was the only one concerned about the big knife. Is there some reason to carry a knife around there? Is there a birthday cake cutting or something?    It's not that I don't understand this and I accept it. I don't hate the guys who are looking for a date or anything like that. I was just opening up a perspective that perhaps a lot of engineers and IT guys may not have thought about.  Also I guess I'm saying that if you're willing to be a friend to someone without trying to get them to go on a date with you straight up, then you might have more luck. I ended up with a couple of guys that way (just to be clear, not at the same time!).   This is a great idea. They should sell them at the change room from bungee jumps in discreet vending machines.   If you're interested in buying an apartment request a Section 109 certificate. (http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Buying_property/Buying_into_a_strata_scheme.page ) Main thing to pay attention to is any financial issues or special by-laws.  You can have a small sense of community if you get involved in the executive committee which helps run the building - but I warn you - it is a lot of work. It's nice to be a part of running the building though an awful lot goes into it that you don't realise unless you're on an EC and it can suck the fun out of it. It's also frustrating living in a building with a lot of tenants moving in and out who don't give a crap about the building and leave their rubbish every time they move out. For me it has been an eye-opening experience.  Given the choice I'd choose a house every time. It's not that much fun hearing your neighbours have sex in the bedroom above you at 1am - loud enough to actually wake you from your sleep. It's also not fun when they decide to have a large party in a tiny apartment on a weeknight cause they're uni students and you have to work the next day. Also smoke drifting in from your pot smoking neighbours, or people who own dogs that bark constantly, or when the upstairs neighbours install floorboards so now you can hear everything they're doing... etc. etc.   Honestly I try not to get too friendly with neighbours. We live too close together to be friends. I can hear all their conversations from my neighbouring unit. I hear when the ones upstairs pee in their toilet. I can hear the tv shows the neighbours on the other side watch. Ever heard that phrase good fences make good neighbours? Well we don't have fences. I say hello and if we bump into each other in the foyer then we might discuss the latest building news, but that's about it.   On the plus side, it's cheaper.    You can wear non ads on your shirts too. Like inanimate objects like I dunno a tree, the moon, etc. Just to make it interesting... for decoration... like a Christmas tree.   ... a trip to the Maldives where I went scuba diving for the first time, saw whale sharks (I didn't even know about them before I went!), saw reef sharks, saw stingrays feeding out of a Maldivian man's hands, saw a whole bunch of cool fish I'd never seen before when we went snorkelling with a marine biologist, went stand up paddleboarding, went swimming, saw a giant sting ray swim casually below our villa, stayed in luxury and saw the other islands too, but in the end had the best time of my life. I also met an older couple there who were a lot like us but 50 years down the track with no kids and seemed totally happy and that was the best wedding gift anyone could have given me and my husband - to see it was possible first hand. And to see a bunch of beautiful coral atolls was amazing. I'd learnt about them in school and never imagined I'd actually get to go there!  Since then we've met a lot of happy couples without kids on our travels overseas and after that I have no doubt that whatever happens I will live an interesting rich life full of experiences whatever they may be.    What about brothers/sisters? 'cause if I ever did this to one of our pets, I could easily be expecting a bruising from my siblings. Not that I ever did this, because I love animals. I did a rubber band slingshot into my brother and he made a better one than mine and slingshotted me back, so I got a bruise for a week like a paintball spot. I never tried to slingshoot him again.    Thing is I think he's trying to be nice. And I do want a slightly lower workload because I don't want to work 18 hour days and weekends anymore. I want to be able to work more sane hours like other people in my company do. They just won't put those people on the out-there projects like I get because they have a family... argh. I guess I just didn't need it to be framed that way to me.   The other thing is I don't even want kids but my boss is telling me he wants to lower my workload you know... just in case... because I'm around that age. Wtf? I told him outright I had no plans to. I feel sidelined. (Btw I'm female)   Kids are hurting my career and I don't even want to have any!   This is messed up. Why oh why? Whatever happened to leaving things to the imagination? One day those kids will see those photos on Facebook of their parents and them naked for the whole world to see. I think I would die inside from internal cringing.    It's a weird idea because from what I've seen and experienced is that men with kids go home much earlier than men without. I am more surprised by this statistic than by women with children earning less than cf women, because this just seems so counter intuitive to me.   What about people who post photos with their baby while they and their baby are naked and then they get their husband naked too so they can show me how bare they can get. I don't need to see that. Just like you don't need to see me naked on your Facebook feed.   This makes me feel as if the person who wrote this quote has never done anything worthwhile in their life.    This sounds weird but could it be that men want kids to keep their mothers happy? As a wife I used to get a lot of pressure (which of course was unseen by my husband) to have kids from my mother in law. I can see how that could affect some men.    I'm so sorry to hear this, and I don't know what to say. It hurts to feel like you were on the same track and then things suddenly changed, and you got hurt. Just know that just as you can have a fulfilling life without kids, you can also have a fulfilling life without him. And you're not just an incubator, you have so much more to offer. Don't forget that! Hugs.     I left a lot of friends behind because of this type of thing. I hope you do find friends who will better understand you. You're growing apart because of life changes. It sucks they can only see their perspective. I won't say the attitude will change but I do hope you find friends who don't diminish your life experiences because they somehow think theirs are more significant.   I don't understand why men would get promotions from having kids. Is it perception that men that have kids are more successful or something, leading to a promotion?  Like in the way that taller men get promoted/hired more readily?    Not sure... maybe it's having kids? Maybe you're already half way there so may as well see it through? Maybe you have more control over your life and circumstances by then and feel less inability to change the things you don't like? Maybe if you were going to do it you already would have? Maybe other life threatening illnesses just happen more.. suicide rate may be the same.   It's probably because he feels like he isn't good at helping him. I remember when my parents split my mum would talk about it with me and for a while I let her let it out but after a year it got a bit much for me because she was crying all the time and I couldn't help her. I asked her if she could talk to someone like a counselor or something because I could see I wasn't helping and it was also upsetting me a lot. I wasn't trying to be mean and I wanted to help but I was too close to be impartial. She did find someone to talk to and she gradually improved over a few months. Maybe he just didn't know how to help or didn't have the skills to.    Do you mean total power loss or just performance reduction?    Wow you actually have NBN! I thought it was a myth!    I have an idea for improving the show. I'd like to see commenters from /r/diy explaining how each of the renovators have screwed up. Or I could just go read that sub instead I guess...   You know how when you're in high school you have a certain group of friends, and you think you're pretty close, but then when you leave school it changes, and you may still talk to your high school friends but you make new friends, ones you have more in common with. Those friends understand you and what you're going through at that time, usually because circumstances have changed. Your high school friends might have a different vocation, and not understand you as much anymore. They're still nice people and all but you just don't connect like you used to. Then when you get a job you make a new set of friends, 'work friends', who understand how things are at work, and you share your experiences and lean on and trust each other for support.  I think even romantic relationships can be like that. There are people who you need at different points in your life. Some people think they will find 'the one' who they will spend the rest of their lives with and sometimes that is the case. But often people need different people at different stages of life, and that is okay. Also one person often can't fulfill all your needs. Sometimes you need friends to fill the gaps.   I think the next steps for you are to first see if your discontent can be resolved, and if it can't then I'm sorry to say that you will need to work out a way to move forward without her.   Starting with the first step though I think you should talk to her. Tell her how you feel and ask her how she feels about the situation.  Ask her for ideas and discuss ways things could be better. Consider making a plan together to improve things and then you are both aware of the steps forward.  If you really already resent her then I think that you need to stop thinking as if breaking up with her would be hurting her, because staying with her hurts both of you, and even though it's hard it is often the best thing to do in that situation.     You're probably better off just buying a new one. There's a Reece at Taren Point. See if they're open tomorrow and go get one. Then you just need an electrician to connect it. The pipes are the simple part.      	95
 pan is just for people who don't want to identify as bi + have a special snowflake status, so yes pan is really bi (because let's face it bi get the shortest end of the stick here), therefore pansexuality is not real and redundant (as well as biphobic tbh).  the argument for all these other genders are meaningless.   some of SJWs are in upper middle class or upper class, I think (at least that's what I heard). At least, they are well off.   because any other pronoun would be unladylike   I agree with everything you said  they need to stop making up genders as well as falsely claiming some of these genders either especially with 'nonbinary'   yes, escape velocity   they fight against men  http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism     karma (not a stun), Leblanc (not a stun), lux(not a stun), varus(not a stun), ahri (try charming her), amumu (ult does not stop it; try landing bandage toss or engage without bandage toss), anivia (q moves too slow), ashe (block the arrow), brand (need combo), cass (needs to be facing cass), Elise (see ahri), heim (aoe stun is very small), irelia (needs to be lower hp), kennen (takes too long to stun), morg (takes too long to stun), nocturne (takes too long), shaco (needs box set up), shyvana (only cc is ult), syndra (needs to land eq), tf (takes too long), Viktor (gravity field takes too long), xerath (see ahri), xin (takes too long), yasuo (needs build up), ziggs (need to sacrifice escape)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HvVBRzK0eY   (she kills people in under 2 sec and they had high amounts of cc)  TL;DR **YOUR** logic is flawed   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HvVBRzK0eY  they had plenty of cc yet katarina can kill a whole team in under 2s   thank you, very helpful  	9
