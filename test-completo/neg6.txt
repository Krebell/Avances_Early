 Personally, I get sick of everyone constantly bashing The Happening and posting "what? no!" every time it is mentioned. What do you see way too often?   Oh, I misunderstood. I don't suppose they look like anything. Paradise is of course subjective, so I don't believe one is a penthouse suite and the other a fire pit, although there are passages to "lake of fire" in Revelation. Again, that could be imagery. What I meant initially, is I don't know of a movie that accurately shows a person dying and then living in Heaven for the remainder of the movie, or vice versa.    Ben Stein actually seems like he'd be a cool dude to bbq with and shoot the shit.    I believe in heaven and hell. Everlasting paradise and everlasting misery. I think without taking artistic liberties, its kind of hard to make a movie about. Does that make sense? I could be wrong though. There may be a movie I haven't seen or forgot about.    Damn it. I like Tucci, but he really does seem like he's capable of being a real prick in real life.    I met Tom Green once after one of his standup shows. His standup, albeit not too great, really humbled himself and he fessed up to knowing he screwed up in showbiz. Kind of made you think the guy was approachable and not just a total weirdo. So, afterwards, I walk up to him just to thank him for his work and whatnot, and the man wouldn't even look me in the eye and respond accordingly. He had this shitty "oh great another fan" way about him that really turned me off from him.      Unload your garbage here.    Depends on your views of the afterlife ;) As a Christian, there aren't too many movies (at least not that I can think of right now) that depict the afterlife as I believe it. I'm going to go with Beetlejuice. I think it was a super creative approach to the subject.    You could go either way here. Ace displayed a lot of lunacy when he was playing chicken with the truck. He was obviously prepared to be killed in order to prove his balls were huge. However, you don't see that same kind of ballsiness when he's held at gunpoint. He allows himself to submit in front of his friends and walk away defeated. This all being said, I think he is capable of killing Chris BUT it also may have just been another game of chicken.    Reddit knows who he is, thank you.    Elliot, so Smelliot, whats up dudester?   and I worry about the dolphins   How did he disappear?    Watch it again. Still holds up.    Its all in good fun, man. Different strokes.    Can you do a Mummy porn? Rick and Evie but then Imotep shows up and joins in?   RAUUUUUUUUUL   How dare she have a face! The nerve...   What the hell is the matter with you?   I'm just razzin. I mean, you never know, but I doubt it.   Rumor is he won't take a part unless half his lines can be screamed in someone's face.    Charming, suave, loveable? I agree. Fuck him.    They play only ONE character and any deviation is uncomfortable and awkward. Who fits that bill?   You gave me this tiny winkie      There's so much content in the Bible that it is very easy to forget and overlook aspects like this. This was helpful for me too, and I really appreciate you posting. Thank you :)   I don't care what Neal's doing. Where's Charlie?   You like Osso Bucco, Charlie?   "I had better sex in prison"  	29
    My fianc, but the remote to the tv is in the other room      I'm moving to Providence in the coming month with my fianc.  I'm 31 and with no children.  I've been told I would like downtown or east side Providence (not East Providence).  I know nothing about the area.  Any suggestions on neighborhoods, apartments or surrounding areas to live or avoid would be great.  -thanks          Is there not an appropriate time?   Sagging pants.  It's really stood the test of time from the 90s on  	8
 I don't care about men forming clubs. I do care about the actions of a few of their members. I never said anything about other frats. Just one in general.   Thank you! I don't let it bother me. I understand that this isn't a problem and extreme worry for other, and it's okay that they don't understand. You have to be ready for that anytime you make a post! I'm just glad you've understood this and take it seriously.   Would you like me to on you the professors email so you can ask him yourself?   I never said it was reported. Most rape goes unreported, and honestly being accused makes me more than hesitant around them!   Thank you for being so nice and realizing that I am honestly afraid of this! I talk to my boyfriend about it, and he is super wonderful! I might go to the campus counselor and see if he/she can help!    That is very true! I just try to be prepared and ready for any situation   One of the girls in my class was recently talking about how they basically haven't changed. That most girls in general try to avoid them because they are still being accused of rapes recently   I worry about that too. Just not as much. Maybe I'm a chronic worrier. Who knows?    Thank you! I don't really get a chance to talk to many peers at the college because I work full time and take classes. It mostly scares me because my apartment is located by all the frat houses, and one of the frats that was recently reinstated that was originally shut down for rape. Apparently, much hasn't changed, sadly.   It is 1 in 4 at my college. Our professors mention it at the beginning of every semester to try to get girls to better protect themselves.   I'm not trolling. I'm being honest. Nothing feminist here. I am a feminist, but I don't hate men. Never have never will. I don't want special treatment for being a girl.  	11

 I disagree 100% - I thought it was an excellent adaptation of a very challenging (i.e. massive) story!  Eddie's performance was excellent and I wish him many congratulations!   $1.5m every week or $43,000 per hour (assuming a 35 hour week - 2 hours every couple of weeks makes this number a touch higher!)  I wonder if he takes an accountant to the toilet... ;-)   Question: what rights have they got to terminate your service outright? I.e. if they decide that you are costing them more than you pay them, can they simply cast you adrift?  No trolling or shilling here (don't even live in the US) - just interested...   Good quote from British pop star, Robbie Williams when asked if he "looked" when his wife gave birth:  "Yes, it was awful. It was like watching my favourite pub burning to the ground"   Couldn't watch it. Gnnnnn, awful!   It's a strange thing, but while I was on honeymoon in NZ (I'm from the UK normally!), I popped into a large bookstore in Wellington and there in front of me was a brand new Matthew Reilly book that I didn't even know was coming! It was the first Jack West novel and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it during the rest of our holiday and on the way home. Funny how things like this stick in your mind nearly 10 years later!  If you could bring any under-recognised novel (or series of novels) to the big screen, which would it be? And no, you can't pick your own!  Best wishes from the UK!   Too many to mention, but here are a couple that perhaps you've not heard of:  Out of the Sun by Robert Goddard read by Derek Jacobi. Excellent book and superb reading. (In fact, any of his Cadfael readings too!)  39 Steps by John Buchan read by Jack Davenport (nasty officer fellow from Pirates of the Carribean)  Life on Air - written and read by David Attenborough. Honestly, this is head and shoulders above any others that I have. It's truly excellent and informative.  The Belgariad by David Eddings read by Cameron Byerley  Where Eagles Dare by Alistair McLean read by ??? ( sorry, not useful, but I love both the story and presentation)  There you go...a few to be going on with :-)   I have his Hobbit reading - also excellent!   Needs moar three wolf moon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007I4HHOI    Wow, Rosberg did 700km today.  Think about that: 700km behind the wheel of one of the fastest cars in the world...in a single day.  For those in the Uk, Renaults old F1 car broke Richard Hammond in just a few laps...!  Whatever else is said, these guys have the endurance sorted.   Heh, I've just reread your comment and that is indeed what you said!  Damn, just woke up and brain must have been addled.  Can I have a downvote for my OP please ? :-)   My (UK) grocery delivery gives me a one hour slot, so none of that stupid partisan shit can go on.   Oh, and the drivers don't handle any payment, are super friendly and helpful and tipping simply isn't necessary.  Sorry, its an archaism.    And the winner of the award for the first moan about engine noise for 2015 goes to....  Get over it. F1 has moved on.   Down doobie do down down...   Anyone notice that the linked website had a click-through ad before the article and then obscure half of the screen on my phone with another big advert.  Pot, kettle etc.   So then, how many teams that skipped the first test have gone on to do well in that year's championship?  Not many, I'd be willing to bet...   Hamilton fan. Upvoted.  Nothing like competition ;-)   Top tip: Using a cloth, clean the wiper blades with isopropyl alcohol - will smear far less.   The normal method is to have a spare set of wheels, so it becomes a simple wheel swap that can be done yourself at home. It doesn't take any more space in the garage either.  Personally, I run steel wheels with winters, so save a little corrosion on the alloys in the winter months. Others I know have bought alloy wheels specifically for the winters, but I'm not that vain ;-) (Also BMW do some really nice looking trims that look excellent on the car)  Recently bought a full set for my wife's Renault Megane - 400 for the set, including steel rims and the absolutely excellent Nokian WR D3 tyres. Highly recommended.   Yorkshire here, winter tyres on both cars.   Why wouldn't you? After all, I just spread the wear over two sets of boots and the winters work better when it's cold even if there's no snow. Obviously when there is snow, you don't get stuck... :-)  Take the long view and it doesn't even cost you any more.  (Note: most of my colleagues run winters now - seems to be becoming more common, at least around here)   Interesting thread. Honestly, I think the solution for a lot of the problems on here is simple:  Get new friends.  I have a circle of friends that I've known for many years. When we eat out, sometimes we split, sometimes we don't. We always just know when it works and when it doesn't and its never been a problem.  Note: I don't drink myself, but others do. We just take this into account with a quick bit of mental arithmetic - I've never felt short changed.  Tipping is easy, of course: We don't live in the US, so aren't completely obsessed with it ;-)   Never watched Top Gear?  Break down and you'll be left behind. It's just how it is :-)   Standard practice would be having a spare tube ;-)   Yup, no tube or way to fix a puncture? Stuffing your tyres with leaves, moss or whatever else you might find is a pretty good way to get you home.  Sometimes necessity breeds innovation :-)   They were filming a segment for the new series near Skipton. Looks good stuff.  (Source: Me! Was sat with them about an hour ago ;) )   The King's Speech, masterfully delivered by Colin Firth.  Oh, wait. No, the idiotic MPAA gave it an R rating for its language, even though in the UK it was a 12a. Gratified to read that the director refused to re-edit out the profanity for a more commercially acceptable rating.  You have a strange country, my friends...   You cynic, you! ;)      While the great man is still with us, read (or better yet, listen to) his excellent memoirs, Life on Air. I can think of no more relaxing way to be entertained than to listen to him tell tales of his youth.  Highly, highly recommended.  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/140846750X   Pork Scratchings. No question.   Or, to give a slightly more positive spin, they get to take some very well loved characters and place them into a different universe to allow us, the movie-goers, to experience how life might be for them if things didn't entirely follow Roddenberry's idealistic path.  Its an interesting idea and one I'm happy to watch play out.   Note: my wife saw both new films in the cinema, something that I really struggled with for the latter TNG films.  The hard core purists can hold out all they want, but they won't get it - what they'll get is nothing at all. A franchise cannot live forever without evolution and the recent reboot has, in my opinion, secured Trek for me for a few more years...  Maybe we'll get a new series too :-)   Wat.  I'm not sure that many others agree with you there judging by the steamingly high rating on RT (95%).  You are also aware that their choice of an alternate timeline as a plot device actually allowed them (and in fact required them) to make changes to the universe. No more pandering to Spock trying to come to terms with his human side on Vulcan any more ;-)  Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed them!  	33
 Well profootball reference has weekly stats in this format: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2012/week_1.htm  They also have a link to copy it in CSV format.  From there you could just convert the raw numbers into fantasy points.  As for the copying and pasting, if you don't have any programming experience try using web scrapers like this one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn?hl=en  Not sure if that specific one is good but try using something like that to save yourself from having to copy and paste everything.  Also if ya don't know how to program you should try out Python or R, both have a good community and a fair amount of tools for statistical analysis.    Would love to see this analysis done for previous years as well.  While this is interesting information, it is still a small sample size.   footballoutsiders.com does a good job rating defenses.  They also rate olines and dlines.   Well I traded him the previous week. I sent him, asiata, and ertz for Rodgers and Gronk.  I felt good about the trade when it happened, less good when asiata scored 3tds, okish when Gronk got a garbage time TD, slightly better now that Ryan has lost 3/5ths of the his oline (including Sam Baker).  Also a heads up for Ryan owners, he plays 1 less home game this year b/c of the london game so that's another negative for him, as he does play better at home than on the road.  Also I wouldn't bank on his WRs to stay healthy for the year either.  Julio Jones was the biggest injury risk at the WR position coming into the season: http://sportsinjurypredictor.com/top-injury-risks-2014/    There's that, but it isn't enough for local governments, hence all the tickets.   It all depends on what you can get for him of course.  Before this weeks games I was able to package him, Matt Ryan and Ertz for Gronk and Aaron Rodgers.  You could probably do better after today's game.  You've seen his best game of the year so if you want to flip him for something else go right ahead.

 Cross post this at /r/ShigatsuwaKiminoUso/   The Visual Story: Creating the Visual Structure of Film, TV and Digital Media by Bruce Block   http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Story-Creating-Structure/dp/0240807790         I liked what was done with Leon's character. A tragic outcome for a person consumed by anger and revenge. But I hated the super vanilla end fight. The super perfect golden haired prince who had about the perfect childhood ends up saving the day (rolls eyes). I get there's supposed to be a parallel but it doesn't have to be so black and white that one character gets put on a mountain sized pedestal.   I hope it goes more into world building. The sense of adventure and camaraderie is already there, it just needs that little bit of world detail.   [Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/12/shingeki-no-bahamut-genesis-temptation.html)   Ronja's dad is such a drama queen. It's a cheesy character gag but I kind of like it.   "It's all the same whether you're here or not"  The call back to that line at the end and the delivery of "I'll be here with you" were perfect and painful.  I'm with everyone here, Tsubaki needs to confess at this point. The emotional build up is at its crescendo and it would be a shame if it gets dragged out.   Personally I like [Anime News Network's Top Anime list](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php?top50=best_bayesian) better. I think it's a lot more varied.   "Stop moving the ball you jerk. The shit I have put up with this guy."         http://gfycat.com/GiganticCaringDrongo  Are gfycat html5 links not allowed here?   That fight scene between Saber and Kuzuki was actually kind of disappointing. Lots of single character shots and insert shots instead of showing a two person fight choreography.   But in this fight scene it was Kuzuki rushing forward when Shirou all of a sudden turns into a master swordsman. I'm gonna call a spade a spade here, it's an action shounen style in the nick of time power up.      [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 10 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/12/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html)   Exactly, there's nothing inherently bad with tropes it's how you use them. Storytelling has been around for a long long time, there's a trope for everything. Saying a story or character is bad because they fit a trope is lazy criticism since any character and story, if you simplify them enough can be distilled to a certain trope.    Yeah, people love to blame the studio when things don't go right but I think a lot of the time they're just hired to animate and the production committee that's paying them have the final say on things. This is also the reason why low sales doesn't always mean the studio lost money. They're paid to animate and they're not investing their own money. Low risk work in exchange for not having full creative control.    A friend in denial of his or her feelings is a common romance convention but this manga just does it right. It's the little things, like the piggy back ride, the beach footprints, and the popsicle flavors that make it feel sincere. Reminds me a bit of how Cross Game made me feel, although Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a lot less subtle.    This part was adapted so well. Really did well in expressing the bond between Ki-ja and the villagers. This was also the part of the manga when the humor started  to come to its own and the episode pulled it off.  [I really like the ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgvc0Teh3B8)   Deen also produced, Urusei Yatsura, Angel's Egg, Maison Ikkoku, Patlabor, Ranma , and Patlabor: The Movie. Most of them are considered to be old school classics.  I also wasn't aware that Deen did Maria-sama ga Miteru series. Very pretty anime.  It's very unfortunate that recency bias and the circle jerk mentality lead to lack of appreciation of a studio's older works and contribution to anime. The saddest example of this is Toei.         lol Birk got onii-sama'd. I want the Borkas to be more involved in the story.    Wow, not a single mentioned of Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in a Shell, Patlabor OVA, Patlabor 1 2, Angel's Egg) and Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, The Tale of Princess Kaguya). Well at least someone mentioned Takahiro Omori, who's so ridiculously under appreciated.  Out of the big name directors Oshii has the most distinct style. He plays with rhythm a lot, both with editing and visuals. His shot length tend to be longer, which produces a slower, more meticulous and contemplative rhythm than most anime. A style that really fits the content of his movies, which mostly deal with thought provoking themes.  Takahata is the mature side of Ghibli. His characters are more complex and nuanced than Miyazaki's. This is very much evident when the character drama in The Tale of Princess Kaguya is compared to The Wind Rises. Kaguya just offered a more compelling character with a more realized internal struggle.   That's what alcohol is for.   The childhood flashbacks in this movie were way too relatable. They were effective at making one harken back to childhood memories, both the good and the bad.   I'm usually not a fan of bringing a character back to life whether it's an actual revival or a fake death but this is one of the few exceptions.  Shirasu's betrayal was rage inducing but also sad at the same time.   Considering how wacky some anime endings can be at times, I wouldn't be surprised if some directors did come up with the ending through stream of thought brainstorming.   The extended Emi flashback definitely could've been included in the last episode but even if that was done Kousei's performance wouldn't have fit into one episode. In the manga the performance is a little but more than three chapters long. Emi's flashback was extended to make the cutoff of Kousei's performance less awkward.  The show has been a very faithful adaptation of the manga, so the flashbacks were suppose to be there. The performances would've been emotionally empty without the flashbacks. You can argue about their placement and perhaps the story should've began from the very beginning but altering the story structure so much is something the manga author might not agree with.   I hate Alan Anderson.      New weapon looked awesome.   Mushishi does more with storytelling and human drama in one episode than most anime can ever do in one season.   Missing Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This is like making a list of serious TV dramas and leaving out The Wire.   [Hak's fortune cookie.](http://i.imgur.com/SR0gssC.jpg)   Using Kousei's internal monologue to present the parallel between Kaori and his mother was really heart-wrenching.  Tsubaki's friend dropping some truth bombs. To be fair to Tsuabaki, seeing Kousei be so smitten by Kaori is very discouraging.   Ok, this post explains your complaint better.  My point of contention with your initial post is that it's such a simplification that it can be applied to a lot of shows. It's just a dramatic device, how it's used determines if the characters and story turn out well or not.  Ping Pong is multitudes better than this show but uses the same dramatic device. The obvious difference maker being Ping Pong has much better execution and justification for using it.   So basically like a lot of anime drama or drama in general.  Although it's a bit more frustrating here because Shione is double dipping in this dramatic device.         The snowy scenery looked so good.  Rumphobs know how to make the best of a bad situation. They got a free swing!  Looks like Birk is about to save the day again.

These girls should be ashamed...that room is a damned mess.   I think your topic might be too ambitious. Showing the evolution of any medium or genre in a span of 40 years is a huge undertaking in terns of time and research...that is if you want to do it right. This really feels more like a topic for an extensive research project or even a thesis.  An evolution of a medium can't just be distilled to a few shows/movies representing each decade.

[Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 8 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in_27.html)   Shhh...there's no room for logic when it comes to anti-Toei circle jerk. It's also sad that people use this to dismiss the studio. A studio that's been around since the 1960's and have contributed so much to anime.   Some people just keep to themselves even from people that are close to them. He wasn't that open of a person to begin with. After becoming a host to an alien parasite and then basically merging with it, it actually makes sense he would be more secretive and closed off.  Also, hearing about how his mom died, seeing what she became and then seeing her die again as a parasite would make it really hard to lie about her death. Lying about it is almost like trivializing the whole ordeal.   No! Dammit No!  Well, we all saw this coming but still can't help hoping for the best.  Kousie is getting the Clannad After Story treatment but without the supernatural stuff.   Polygon's character animation is much improved in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja:  http://gfycat.com/PowerlessGaseousBernesemountaindog  http://gfycat.com/UnsightlyEuphoricAiredale  The facial animation and phonetic mouth animation being the biggest improvement.  Polygon most likely had a higher budget in this show than in Knights of Sidonia. It's a 7:00 pm show with Ghibli's name attached to it.  Also Knights of Sidonia had it's "sakuga" moments:  http://gfycat.com/PhonyImpartialAngora      Hmm...I guess the point of this episode is to show that the Mattis can do just fine without robbing people. From what I've read from the wiki, showing this is also a set-up for later developments. I think the episode could've been firmer in conveying these things.  [Loved the animation here](http://gfycat.com/PowerlessGaseousBernesemountaindog).   I really like how the girl never really felt alone despite being visually presented that way. Would've been easy to portray her as isolated and lonely but instead the episode focused on how the love of her mother and sister kept her from feeling that way.   http://myanimelist.net/animelist/yodsanklai  I don't bother with rating shows and updating my "watching list."  Quite boring.   I always thought of Archer as a proxy for what some viewers think of Shirou, that is he can be an idiot at times...or maybe a lot of times.   Would totally watch a Zoro harem spin-off.   I only recognized it because of Nodame.  For anyone wondering it's the piece at 17:54 mark.  [Schubert Piano Sonata No.16, D.845](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G0lr9yUgJI)   Really hoping Polygon's vastly improved animation in Ronia the Robber's Daughter shows up in the newer Sidonia seasons. Of course just like traditional animation budget is a factor.   The last two chapters had me welling up while reading them.  We finally get the whole story why Kousei's mother was so forceful. She was desperate to ensure his future with the only way she knows how, which is through music, and in a short amount of time. Not that it made her actions justifiable but it provided a reasoning and we come to understand her more as a character instead of things being painted as black and white.      Ronja is the cutest tsundere.  This episode taking a turn for the eerie side and doing it well was unexpected. That emotional scene was very convincing too.   Again that felt too easy and unearned for Kyoya. Just like the necklace gift, him finally expressing his feelings to her did very little in addressing the problems between the two. There's no actual reconciliation going on, no show of remorse and very little understanding between the two.   ~~4KMBBKTK6WH~~  ~~JJZV8QK9QMR~~  ~~5D6XFLB5HRF~~   [The blow-up doll scene was funny](http://i.imgur.com/83CJEcs.png). The guy next to the doll didn't even bother telling her!   Another happy ending. The family is reunited, plus Gen gets to keep his super strength. Also Ginko got himself a nice robe.  [Mushishi Zoku Shou S2 Episode 5 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season-episode-5.html)    [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 6 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in_13.html)        ___ [Episode 5](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html)   Let the man dream.  Hanayamata characters for 2014's Time Person of the Year   Looks like it was Martinet that got Amira to steal the God Key.      Hopefully D-Will stays healthy.  The next four games of Suns, Warriors, Blazers and Heat are going to be an early litmus test.   Dunno how it happened but for the last 10 episodes I've found myself progressively rooting for the Jaegers. I was even rooting for Justice Girl even though it was quite obvious she was going to get beaten via ass-pull.   That was incredibly honest and really true for most people.   Deen's best years were in the 80's  * Urusei Yatsura  * Angel's Egg  * Maison Ikkoku  * Patlabor (OVA)  * Ranma   * Patlabor: The Movie   Most of those titles and maybe all of them are considered to be classics.   Souta no Harem  Noel is softening up Shione for Nonoka. Best wing girl.     Mattis's reaction and the awkward silence when avoiding Ronja's question was pretty funny.   Looks like the wives are going to be the voice of reason in this rivalry.       Got hit with the feels when it zoomed out to show the town people supporting him.  So Botan and Hirari are 300+ years old?   [This scene was great.](http://youtu.be/JDdG1C6ydOk)  The tracking shot follows Kousei and slowly reveals Kaori. As Kaori comes more into view in the frame, Kousei spots her and comically hides from her. It then switches to Kousei's POV, which puts the audience in his shoes and makes it easy to root for the guy. The insert shot of the sandwich (suggesting he wants to give it to her) shows him finally mustering up some courage, then only to be thwarted by Watari.  [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 5 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html)   I just want him to hear his own music again.   I thought Mohawk guy's incompetent communication skills exacerbating the situation was funny. Just watching things progressively get worse as he kept on putting his foot in his mouth was really amusing. Miyamori being the final piece to his domino effect of fuck-ups was a great way to top it off. I can't hate on Mohawk guy, his antics made for some good situational comedy.  I really like that the show presented a reasonable voice to discuss the situation between CG vs traditional animation. The notion that CG and traditional animation can work together and animators from both sides can learn from each other reflects the collaboration between Ghibli and Polygon. I think those two studios working together is a great learning experience for both.      [Shingeki no Bahamut Episode 5 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/shingeki-no-bahamut-genesis-episode-5.html)   until someone gives me a good reason to jump ship :)  Kaiser x Favaro   Mattis's Hysterics:  http://gfycat.com/FearlessIllfatedIsabellinewheatear   http://gfycat.com/UnsightlyEuphoricAiredale   The flashbacks could've been handled better. The way it was told felt disjointed and having to connect the dots got in the way of the flow of the drama.  The ending was really sweet though.  [This is a beautiful shot](http://i.imgur.com/ITziPw8.jpg). The [golden spiral](http://i.imgur.com/whunm7q.jpg) kind of applies to it too.  [Sora no Method Episode 5 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/sora-no-method-episode-5.html)   I'm guessing the last two characters that have been introduced are going to be reoccurring ones. Should be a fun dynamic.   Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke.   My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.  [Mushishi Zoku Shou S2 Episode 3 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/11/mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season-episode-3.html)   Shirou might be significantly less annoying this time.  Mitsuzuri looks so much like Shiki.   Either this or waiting for the manga to end so I can pick it back up and marathon it.   Welp. Thanks for the correction. At least it might have lead people to watching Mushishi.   Really liked the [shots of the eyes](http://i.imgur.com/z9Fm5ZI.jpg) in this episode.  [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 4 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in_30.html)  Edit: corrected link.   With regards to G-Reco, I thought it was amusing when in some scenes Tomino basically abandoned editing and resorted to gratuitous zooming and panning.   This is based on people that have Torne TV tuner/DVR for the PlayStation 3, 4 and Vita. Well, that's a very limited reach.  Here's some actual TV anime rankings:  [September 29-October 5](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-10-13/japan-animation-tv-ranking-september-29-october-5/.79854)  [October 6-12](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-10-20/japan-animation-tv-ranking-october-6-12/.80115)   Knights of Sidonia had a decent following and that was CG. Ronja's CG is much better than KoS.  I think the lack of following more has to do with this being a children's show.   Yes. People finally get to experience the screw driver arc. I always wonder how Sorachi comes up with these crazy ideas.   I think Ronja took his parents' words about being brave too much to heart lol. She's taunting harpies and trying to jump Hell's Gap.  Admittedly, this is moving a bit slow but I think her encounter with that boy should move things along a bit quicker.   [Mushishi Zoku Shou S2 Episode 2 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season-episode-2.html)   I thought it was fine. Her character struggles are finally being established. I believe the show got criticized about it when it glossed over it in the last arc of the first season. It would be kind of silly to begin establishing her struggles and have her progress from it, all in one episode.  Low self-esteem issues aren't exactly easily fixed.  You're also overly simplifying her situation. She's clearly self conscious about her physical appearance and there's a sense of isolation. That probably has a lot to do with why she wants to get stronger and take part in a raid.    [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 3 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in_23.html)   and [Episode 2](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html).      [Haikyu!!](http://www.hulu.com/haikyu)  Nishinoya gifs time.  http://i.imgur.com/CNKcSWS.gif  http://i.imgur.com/KM95QKe.gif      Three episodes covered 5 chapters. The first chapter is a long one so it really equates to 6 chapters. This season is scheduled for 24 episodes, so that would be around 50 chapters. At least I'm hoping that would be the pace, instead of 70+ chapters being compressed in 2 cours.  Anyway, I ended up marathoning up to chapter 18. Just couldn't help myself, but that was a good stopping point and satiated my curiosity. The most surprising part was the humor. I hope that translates well to the anime.   Well, they just haven't been caught yet.   This chapter hit a lot harder emotionally than the others. I think it's because it provided a clearer picture of how hard it is to remember a loved one who drastically changed towards the end of their life.  This made me listen to Hospice by The Antlers. Now I'm depressed.   Just google Anime-koi. The website should be the first result and you'll find the torrent there.   Fansubbed by Anime-koi   The characters are cel-shaded cg. It's animated at 12 fps, similar to most traditionally animated shows. It's the little subtle movements that make the animation stand out.   The characters feel alive. There's constant facial expressions (eyes, eye brows, mouth) and body language during dialogues. The mouth is animated to match how they speak (like Akira) so there's little flapping mouth effect unlike in most anime. The mouth movements weren't always perfect but I thought they looked good for the most part.  The shadows are dynamic. If you watch the facial animation video again, you'll notice the character's flapping tunic casts a shadow that moves along with it.  For more dynamic movements, I think the videos I posted are representative of the show.  As for negatives, I wish this was fully animated at 24 fps especially since the overall animation is really well done. After years of watching limited animation, I'm used to 12 fps but I hope CG anime would eventually progress to 24 fps. The 24 fps portion of Knights of Sidonia looked really good.  I also wish Ronja's running animation had more variety, she runs a bit too perfectly like a track athlete.   For the curious:  [Mild Spoilers]  [Character animation](http://youtu.be/dANmrvu0RQY)  [Facial animation](http://youtu.be/e7DdALyoZgw)  [Sound design](http://youtu.be/j-VfTUcdBjQ)      [Mild Spoilers]  [Character animation](http://youtu.be/dANmrvu0RQY)  [Facial animation](http://youtu.be/e7DdALyoZgw)  [Sound design](http://youtu.be/j-VfTUcdBjQ)      This episode exuded a great sense of adventure and wide eyed wonder. It was hard not to smile seeing Ronja running through the forest while giggling with excitement.  The grey dwarves were effectively creepy just like the harpies.  Also the sound design in this show is amazing. The sound of the wind, the flowing water, the insects and birds really brought the forest to life.  I think people are really missing out here. This might actually have better production value than Fate/stay night and Shingeki no Bahamut. The background work, camera work, sound design, the facial animation, character animation and the overall atmosphere all have been great so far.   I love how a couple of the earlier episodes somehow connects to this one. The darkness reminded me a bit of the Path of Thorns special and the Cloudless Rain episode also relates.    [Mushishi Zoku Shou S2 Episode 1 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season-episode-1.html)   [Violin scene cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html)   The last few chapters have been feeling rather ominous regarding Kaori. This manga is gonna break me, aint it?   Also, notice that the mouth is animated to match the way the characters speak. It wasn't always on point but I think it looked good for the most of the 2-episode premiere and definitely better than the flapping mouth effect we see in most anime.      [Amira in different outfits](http://imgur.com/a/YQW2i#0) - posted by /u/Superdiddy  [Dance scene](http://youtu.be/uBLjQZhc2QM) [(breakdown)](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shingeki-no-bahamut-genesis-episode-2.html)      Your comment succinctly describes the Samurai Flamenco experience.     Yes, it's my blog. I'm glad you enjoyed that post.   Shingeki no Bahamut Cinematography:  [Episode 2](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shingeki-no-bahamut-genesis-episode-2.html)  [Episode 1](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/shingeki-no-bahamut-genesis-episode-1.html)   Whoa, [MC didn't get window seat](http://i.imgur.com/17wx13I.jpg).  edit: Joking aside, [this episode has some interesting cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/10/sora-no-method-episode-2.html)   Most of the show were done on two's but there were a good amount of well animated sequences, just not as smooth as the clip above.  I thought Space Dandy was inconsistent but it was an experimental show that worked with unique concepts. It was a type of risk taking we rarely see in anime, I think it's worth checking out just for that.   (although most shows are in the 20fps category nowadays)  Nope. Anime is still mostly done on two's.  This small clip from Space Dandy is what animation done on one's looks like: https://mediacru.sh/RoqPZSo9xRBV  I would say most shows aren't close to looking that smooth in a consistent basis.     **The motion they used didn't even call for it really**. Unless they used the model elsewhere, they would've been better off making it using traditional animation all the way through.  There's a reason why most camera movements in z-axis are done in CG and that's because it would be more difficult and time consuming with traditional animation while yielding marginally better/worse results. If that part of the scene was done traditionally the animator would have to painstakingly redraw the cobblestones to account for perspective changes. This is time better spent on character animation. Using CG was just the most efficient option while still yielding the desired results.      Nice CG during the Moonlight Sonata solo, well animated and barely noticeable. The characters have nice chemistry right off the bat but I'm really hoping it doesn't turn into a love triangle drama...I need a break from that.   I like her as a foil to Akane and as someone who might challenge her ideals. There's also gotta be a reason why she hates latent criminals, which could make for a nice back story.   On another note, the frame rate in Pixar movies (or in anime, actually, **since most anime is also done at 24fps**) likely isn't really an issue because there are certain things animators do (and specifically avoid doing) to make animation smoother at a lower frame rate. The choppiness you see in CGI is likely because the computer is purely mathematical -- it doesn't really think "Hm, this needs corrected slightly," like a good animator will.  No on the bolded part. Yes there's 24 frames in each second but with most anime only 12 out of 24 are unique frames and the rest are repetition. It's animation done on "2's." With cheaper anime it's done on "3's." This is aptly called Limited Animation.  Pixar movies are fully animated, meaning 24 unique frames per second or done on "1's"   CGI looks very choppy unless it's 60FPS  You find Pixar movies choppy? Those are animated at 24 fps.   This post updated some of the totals.  http://www.someanithing.com/2239   The manga seems to be regarded well. So, I checked out the first chapter and the anime is pretty faithful so far. Although trying to fit 29 chapters into 12 episodes might be problematic.         Oh wow, that was surprisingly really good. The animation, the art, the direction, the ost, and the voice acting were all on point. Most importantly it was a really fun watch.  This show has that pulp fantasy feel to it.      Omori will be busy with this for a while, which ruins my hope that he might be working on the new Natsume sometime soon.   This was like reliving the mess that was Captain Earth. A bunch of jargon and stuff happening with very little in a way of narrative to make sense of them.  I wish the music wasn't so muted because that Yugo Kanno soundtrack is great. Although, the orchestral music sometimes doesn't fit the vibe of the show.    Then how can you stand anime which is mostly animated at 12 fps or less. Hell, sometimes it's not even animated and we just get a bunch of stills, characters just flapping their mouths with zero body movement or characters sliding across the screen.  	150

My brother Teddy died on December 11th, 1999 during our annual family Christmas party. He was 12 and I was 9. I wish I could say it wasnt my fault, but at the end of the day, the whole thing had been my idea.   I'm from Woodbury, Minnesota as is my entire extended family. Every Christmas my parents would host a holiday party to eat, drink and gossip. It was always a boring event but I loved seeing all my cousins. The adults usually stuck us kids in the basement or the loft but that year my brother convinced them to let us go sledding at the park instead.   We bundled up in our purple Vikings parkas and loaded up the sleds with blankets and our pockets with hand-warmer packets. Then me, my brother, and our cousins Mike and Jeff set off for the sledding hill which was about a half mile down the road.   As soon as we were out of view of the house, Teddy stopped.   You guys wanna do something fun? He asked.   Hell yeah!   Of course!   I want to go sledding." I muttered.   "Yeah, well, sledding is for babies, said Jeff.   "That's what I was thinking too!" His brother added.   Teddy smiled. Good. Because I want to take you guys somewhere *way* more awesome.   "Where are we going? I asked nervously. Mom and dad will get mad if they look for us in the park and we're not there."   "They wont look, theyre too drunk, Teddy laughed.   "But-"   I think we should go to Rocking Horse Creek." He added coolly.   Rocking Horse Creek was actually more of a small river than creek but it had been called that for as long as I can remember. The creek had been named by neighborhood kids whod found an almost life-sized rocking horse sitting abandoned and half submerged in the water. No one knew where it had come from just as no one knew the actual name of the river. Because no one had ever been stupid enough to tell their parents that they went there.   "But Rocking Horse Creek is almost an hour walk from here!" I whined. I was already cold and didn't feel like walking that far.   Mike snorted. "Pfft, dont be a baby. There're extra blankets if you're cold plus hand-warmer packets in your pockets.   Yeah, Jeff added, and if you want we can pull you along in the sled just like the baby you are!   Mike and Jeff laughed. But Teddy didnt and he punched Jeff in the arm.   Stop it, you guys! Im not a baby! And why go to the creek anyway? It's probably ice."   "Because it will look hella cool! Teddy said.   "Yeah, I want to go!" said Mike. "We could tie our jacket strings to some sticks and go ice fishing!"   "Yeah!"   "Well, Im really good at ice fishing, I lied, So I *have* to go so I can help you.   *Sure* you are. Jeff rolled his eyes.   The walk didn't take an hour; it was more like 35 minutes, though it did feel longer due to the cold. When we approached we saw that the river was indeed frozen over. The ice looked several feet thick, though it was hard to tell. Jeff and Mike were really excited about it and kept testing their weight on the thinner ice of the riverbank.   I sat down on my sled and drew a couple blankets around me. *Im smaller than them so Im colder*, I justified to myself. Ted, Mike and Jeff stood on the riverbank and threw rocks onto the ice to see if they could break it. When they failed to produce even the smallest crack, Jeff announced it was time to play Ricochet Dare.   I hated Ricochet Dare. As soon as Jeff suggested it I felt a cold stone drop into the pit of my stomach. Ricochet Dare was something we'd been playing since we were little kids. The rules stated that if you were dared to do something and you didnt do it the game would end and you would be the new "Wuss" (and this ridicule would go on for weeks or even months). However, if you did do it then you got to dare someone in return. Generally, the dares start off mild but with every round the stakes get higher. The game would only end when someone inevitably wussed out. And, of course, that person was usually me.   *But not this time*, I thought as I shrugged off the blankets and stood up, pushing my hat up from my eyes. I had to redeem myself and make Teddy proud. I had to show them I wasnt a baby.   "Come on!" Jeff yelled at me. "You go first!"   "Okay. What's the dare?" I asked with false bravado.   "Hmm..."Jeff said. "Okay, you have to take 3 steps out onto the ice."   I eyed the frozen river warily. "Three steps?"   "Yep, and not *baby* steps, real steps."   Stop it, Im not a baby!   Then prove it.   I took my first step lightly and paid close attention to the give of the slippery mass beneath me. There was none that I could feel and the ice made no sound of protest underneath my feet. I took the two last steps quickly and then turned around and half-skated back to shore. My brother gave me a huge smile and a high five.   I dared Mike to take 4 and half steps. Mike dared Ted to do 6 steps. Ted dared Jeff to do 10 steps. And then Jeff dared me to walk all the way to the opposite shore.  The ice hadn't made a sound since we had started the game, instead remaining as silent as death. Still, there was something unsettling stringing through the cold air and the silence.   I stalled for as long as I could, trying to decide if I should complain. Jeff's dare was actually two dares and I didn't think that was fair. Technically I would have to do it twice: once to get to the opposite shore and once to get back. I was afraid of falling through to the cold water I knew was raging by under the ice.   "Come one, don't be a baby, just do it." Mike said.   "Little baby-waby afraid of the icy-wisy?" Jeff mocked.   "Stop it you guys, I'm not a baby! This dare isn't fair - it's two dares!"   My voice was drowned out by Jeff and Mike's mock baby cries. I looked at Teddy for help but he was laughing. *Laughing*. My older brother didnt even attempt to stick up for me, he was joining in with them!   I felt my lower lip wobble and tears fill my eyes. *Dont cry! Babies cry, youre not a baby!* I jerked my head back to river so they couldn't see my red face and traitorous tears. I felt a sob begin to bubble up through my throat and I knew I couldnt let them hear it.   I would die before I'd let them see me cry.   I took a deep breath and ran across the ice as fast as I could. And for a moment I actually hoped I did fall through. They would be in so much trouble and they would feel so sorry that theyd made fun of me and called me a baby. With every slap of my boot I listened for the telltale sound of cracking ice. But none came and before I knew it I was on the other side.   I raised my fists in the air triumphantly and waited to hear their cheers. When I turned to look back, they were still standing in a circle together, laughing. They hadn't even been watching me. They missed the entire dare.   And I wanted to cry all over again.   I swallowed the tears and was about to yell that I wanted to go home. But just then, I noticed something dangling from the tree above them. How had I forgotten? I was the only one who'd noticed it and I realized it was my ticket to revenge and redemption. But who to dare?   I stood silently watching them as they joked with each other and pointed at each of them in turn, silently mouthing to myself.   "Eeny, meeny miny, moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go, eeny meeny miny moe."   My finger landed on Teddy. *Good*, I thought. *He's supposed to be my brother, he deserves it the most.*   I cleared my throat.   "I dare" I yelled across the small river, interrupting them. They turned to look at me, almost surprised to see me standing on the other shore. So they *had* forgotten about me.   "I dare," I started with renewed anger, "TEDDY to rope swing across the creek and land on this side."   There was silence as, in tandem, all three looked up at the rope hanging from the tree above them. During the summer we would take turns swinging on it and cannon-balling into the water; and if you pushed off the tree hard enough, you could actually make it to the other side of the creek. Id seen my brother do it many times.   Teddy's eyes got wide and he looked at me as if I'd sentenced him to death. Jeff and Mike immediately started prodding him, telling him not to be a wuss. I smiled smugly from the other side of the river. I hoped hed fail the dare. Itd be just what he deserved.   It didn't take much name calling for Teddy to climb the tree and grab onto the rope. He tested it a few times and then hung on it with all of his weight. It held like it always had.   "When I get over there I'm going to dare you to do jumping jacks in the middle of the creek!" He yelled at me. Thats when I realized my mistake. If Teddy dared me to do that I would most certainly wuss out and then theyd tease me until Easter. I sent a silent prayer up to God that Teddy didnt make it to this side of the river.   "On three!" Mike yelled to Teddy.   I watched Teddy count silently to himself and then push off from the tree as hard as he could. He swung in a long, deep arc just like he always did. I watched the scene with my fingers crossed, hoping the rope wouldn't go far enough and that he would have to land back on the other riverbank, his dare unfilled and the game ended.  But I could tell immediately that he was going to make it and somberly stepped backward to make room for him to land.   And then suddenly the loudest sound Ive ever heard before or since rang through the air  like a gunshot.   *GROAN*   *SNAP*   Teddy broke through as soon as he hit the ice and the rope and tree branch followed him down into the darkness below. I felt my feet moving under me as I slipped and slid my way out to where hed gone in, sheer panic crushing my chest like a vice. All three of us were on our bellies groping into the angry, jagged hole within 10 seconds. We searched the watery void but all we could feel was the tree branch below us. And within a minute, we couldn't feel anything at all- our hands and arms had gone numb.   Jeff pulled Mike and I to our feet and started running for the sleds.   "Leave his sled here, we need to get out of here now!"   I felt cold and dead. I stumbled blindly toward the sound of my cousin's voice.  "We need to save Teddy. I want Teddy. He's in the ice. We have to get mom and dad." But I was blubbering so badly by the end that I doubt they understood a word of it. And despite my slurred protests, I followed them through the woods, confused and cold.   But after a while I couldnt feel the cold anymore. I couldnt feel any pain, in my heart or my body. In fact, I couldn't feel anything at all.   Mike didn't say a word for the entire walk back but Jeff went on and on about the "plan".   We would just say that Teddy decided to go home before us and that he had said he was going to take a shortcut through the woods - the other woods on the far side of the road.   I just nodded for awhile, even smiled at his plan. God, to this day I dont know why I smiled. We were almost home by the time I began to process what he was saying.   "No. I have to tell dad to save Teddy." I told him. I was surprised by how flat my voice sounded.   Mike just kept walking forward in a daze but Jeff whirled on me.   "Its too late to save him but you can save yourself! Its your fault this happened because it was your dare. They will take you to jail for murder and put you on death row; its an open and shut case. You can't tell anyone anything. Ever."   And I dont know why I believed him, but I did.  The hardest part of the day wasnt watching my brother die or the long, cold walk home. The hardest part by far was pretending like nothing was wrong when we got there.   *What do you mean you haven't seen Teddy? He should have been back by now, he started home an hour before us.*   I couldn't keep my poker face for very long, though, and I started crying. My dad thought it was because I was so cold that my skin had begun to turn white.   The adults immediately mounted a search of the woods between our house and the park, which of course, turned up nothing. By nightfall they had called the police.   Search and Rescue searched the wrong woods for the next 24 hours because they believed our story. The sledding hill had been crowded that day but a couple of people were sure they'd seen us there.   The day after that they intended to search the other side of the forest - the side Teddy was actually on - but a blizzard rolled in overnight and that search was called off. My parents were told that where ever Teddy was, he was most certainly dead.   Parents in the neighborhood stopped letting their children play in the woods, even in the summer. My own parents wouldnt let me leave the house for a year. I grew up angry and spiteful. I hated everyone, but no one more than myself. I applied to college just to get away from my parents, whose constant love and support felt vile and wrong to me. I wished they would have another kid so they could give their love to someone deserving and stop talking about Teddy all the time.   I got into U of M. My grades sucked and I drank a lot. My parents pressured me to excel since I was their last horse in the race. I never returned their calls or emails.   I lived with the guilt; just barely, but I lived with it. If nothing else, I could take a bit of pride in the fact that I was surviving.   Drunkenly one night, I finally told a couple of my close friends about it. They agreed that it wasn't my fault, that shit happens, and that Teddy wouldn't want me to dwell on it. I made the dare, but he climbed the rope.   That night was a turning point for me. After being validated by people who actually knew the truth, I cut back on the drinking and I picked up my grades for the last two semesters.  And somehow, it was enough to graduate.   A year later I got an invitation to an engagement party at my parents house. Cousin Jeff was getting married to a girl he'd met in the navy and I was invited to celebrate their love with them. As much as I always hated going back home, I wanted to support Jeff. Somehow, just knowing that he was living a full life despite our shared burden made me feel hopeful, like I could too.   The party was quieter and more reserved than the parties my parents threw when we were kids. They had become less fun since Teddys death: more refined, more somber. Jeff was quieter than I remembered, too, but he was clearly happy with his new fianc, who seemed like a very nice girl. And though a wide smile was spread across his face, his eyes betrayed a certain guardedness, especially when he looked at me.   I got up the courage to talk to him only once. We shared an awkward hug and I congratulated him on his engagement and asked him about his brother. Jeff told me that  Mike was addicted to heroin and living in Arizona somewhere. I said that it seemed Mike had never really recovered. Jeff said he didnt know what I was talking about and walked away.   I spent the rest of the party hugging relatives, making small talk and pretending to drink (sobriety is suspect in my family). After awhile I went outside to take in a cigarette and a moment of peace. And in the secrecy of the autumn air, I started to cry.   This party should be boisterous and loud. My parents should be lively and laughing. Mike should be running around the party daring people to take mystery shots. I should be cheerfully telling stories from college and talking about my plans for graduate school. And Teddy should be here instead of lying dead at the bottom of a river bed.   I flicked my cigarette under my car and wiped the wetness from my cheeks. I knew what I had to do and where I had to go.   I had to see the river that had haunted me since I was nine. Had anyone been back to Rocking Horse Creek? Was Teddy's sled still there? Had they replaced the rope? Had the creek dried up? This was my worst fear. It had secrets I didn't want to live to see revealed.  I lit another cigarette as I walked and began to list all the reasons this was a bad idea. I spent the hike either begging myself to find the strength to turn around or begging for the courage to continue on.   I arrived at Teddys grave before I was ready.   The creek was loud and the water was moving quickly - recent rain in the area to blame, no doubt. The rocking horse itself was in bad shape. Only its head was visible above the water now and it was so rotted you could barely tell what it was anymore. No one had replaced the rope.   I sat down next to the creek and took it all in. It was hard to believe this was the same place from which I still woke up screaming. It seemed to have healed since taking Teddys life. If it could heal, maybe I could heal too. The tree was so full you wouldnt think itd ever lost a single branch. The creek innocently bubbled by, full of life and vigor. Everything here was so different than I remembered.   Even the rocking horse.   Where the toy had once been cheerful, almost animated, it was now just a morbid, misshapen head. Its eyes were pointed directly at me and they bore a soulless stare right through me. It sent an involuntary shudder through my body and I turned away from the horses head in revulsion, I immediately saw what the horse had been looking at: a sliver of red plastic jutting out of the ground behind me.   Teddys sled.   My reaction was visceral and I had to lean over and vomit in the grass beside me. It was real. It had happened. Had I been pretending it wasnt real? Was that why I had really come here? To pretend that the past was gone and didnt matter anymore? How could I forget that what this place really was?   I stumbled to my feet and began walking down the riverbank away from the buried sled, pausing every few feet to dry heave. I just wanted to get away from it, that thing that was all that remained of my brother. Everything that used to be Teddy lay at the bottom of the river now. I pulled a cigarette from my pack with shaking hands. As I tried to light it I tripped over something and fell forward, my cigarette rolling down the riverbank and into the water.   It was a rope. And I knew right away that it was Teddys rope.   I kicked it away from me, it was worse than the sled. If I had anything left to throw up, I know I would have. The end of the rope lay deteriorating on the riverbank with the length of it disappearing into the murky water of the river. And maybe I am morbid or sick or crazy, but I suddenly I decided that I wanted to know, I wanted to see.   I crawled over to it and picked it up. It felt just as it did all those summers ago when I used to swing from it into the water as Teddy clapped from the shoreline.   I began to pull the rope out of the river.   The water was fast moving and the rope was heavy. The creek didnt want to give up its secrets so easily and it rebelled against my efforts. Still I pulled harder. Just as I felt I was coming to the end of it, something long and thin breached the surface of the river. I saw it for only a moment before the rotted rope snapped and it sank back into the dark abyss.   I almost dove in after it. But as I stood on the riverbank, my brain screaming at me, I realized what Id almost done. What if that was Teddy? Would I want to see?   Breaking from my trance, I hurled the rest of the rope into the water and fled into the woods. My lungs struggled to draw breath and the trees began to spin around me. I anxiously lit yet another cigarette and let the shudders wrack through my body as I waited for the nicotine to calm me.   I stood there, in the middle of the woods, the broken rope 20 feet behind me at the bottom of the river and took short drags off my cigarette. And when my breathing had become bearable again, I felt someone watching me.   It was Teddy, of course. He sat with his back against a tree, faded purple parka still bright in the mid afternoon sun, and in some parts bleached almost as white as his bones. Ripped foil from an opened hand-warmer packet was clutched in his hand, still remaining after all these years. He stared at me accusingly; the deep eye sockets of his skull were somehow not empty, instead they held a knowing consciousness that said he knew what we had done. He knew we'd left him to die.   *But we hadn't known that, Teddy! We hadn't! We didn't know you crawled out of the river. We didn't know you were freezing to death as we ran home to bury our secrets! We would have saved you, Teddy, if we had known! You know that. We would have saved you!*   I yell this at the skeleton, in my head or out loud I'm not entirely sure. But Teddy just sits there staring me; thirty yards from the rocking horse, twenty yards from the broken tree. And I know he'll sit here forever. Because Jeff and Mike don't need to know that our sins are far more terrible than we'd ever thought. I know it is only my burden to bear. And I can tell as he watches at me in the fading sunlight that Teddy agrees.  [C.W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)   You're not alone.

I'd start [here.](http://www.buffettnews.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40 t=93180)    The reason I didn't go to work.  http://imgur.com/ACAmvgo   Most schools are closed anyway. My office sent an email not to bother coming to work. Snow day!!!   My kid's school is in a delay but we called her out. We'd have to take 2 highways to get there.    Nobody in my house went to work today.    When I was a kid I lived in a beautiful house. My mother and my older sister were artists; they painted, sculpted and danced their way through life, challenging and inspiring each other. They created and scrapped works of art in a constant rotation. Our house was forever changing and evolving into something new like it had an organic, vibrant life of its own.   My memories of those days and that house are so very vivid.   Our family room was usually some shade of orange (my sister had painted it for me - orange was my favorite color).  We had a marble bird-shaped fountain in the middle of the kitchen (which I used to splash my mom and sister),  There was a sculpture of a small dancing man on our landing (which I always high-fived),   And of course, the hallway that was painted floor-to-ceiling with fish (which I always laid on the floor to "swim" through).  And, finally, my favorite thing of all, a staircase that my sister had painted like piano keys (although I'm pretty sure it's only because she was in love with her piano teacher).   In short, my house was a magical place that the neighborhood kids couldn't stay away from. Suffice it to say I had a lot of friends.  Since we had the most exciting house in the county, people would always ask to come over and visit. My parents threw countless BBQs, dinner parties, open houses; just give them something to celebrate and theyd throw a party.   I had so many wonderful memories of my life from before the night Anna died. I had so few of the night that it happened. And, perhaps worst of all, I had no memory of the only moment that really mattered. Until I did.   My father owned a locksmith company with my Uncle Peter and they were out on call that night. I think mom was home in her room but I can't quite remember.  She was gone a lot in those days. It wasn't until I was older that I learned there were whispers of an affair between my mother and Samuel, the curator of a local art gallery. But that night I'm sure I remember piano music coming from her room. Anna was in bed because she had an early meeting at the gallery to unveil her newest canvas. And I was in my room as usual playing Tomb Raider on my Playstation.   At some point in the night I think I must have heard a noise because I remember pausing my game and cracking my door to look out into the hallway. I recall staring down the corridor toward the staircase trying to adjust my eyes to the dark. I thought there may be someone there so I came out fully into the hallway to see. I remember that for some reason I was afraid to turn on the light so I squinted down the hallway .  There was someone staring back at me. Someone in the dark, someone who had just come up the stairs, someone...I recognized. He stayed completely still, perhaps wondering if I could see him too.   As he stared at me I began feel scared. I wanted to run toward the light-switch but I didn't have the courage. And then, suddenly, in a single breath the figure was moving, sprinting down the hallway toward me.  Too afraid to scream, I fell over backward and scrambled into my room as I watched the figure run into Anna's bedroom. I don't remember anything else from that night. Not screaming from Anna's room. Not hiding under the bed. Not falling asleep.   Uncle Peter and my dad had come home together that night after finishing their call. They spent the night drinking in the garage, which was the only room my mother never touched (and the only room my father could relax in). So it was Uncle Peter that found Anna the next morning. She had been beaten to death; her head was completely caved in. I wish I didn't know that but adults talk loudly when they're upset.   I spent the day hiding under my bed, plugging my ears and crying.  My mom was hysterical; screaming and crying so loudly that an ambulance came to take her to the hospital. My father, not knowing what else to do, sent me to stay with Uncle Peter and Aunt Lydia for awhile. It was only a day later that the police showed up at my uncle's door and asked to talk to me.  They sat me down in the living room and my aunt brought me a glass of chocolate milk. They asked me if I had seen anything that night and I told them I had. They asked me what happened and I told them what I knew. They asked me who it was that I'd seen in the hallway and I faltered.   I couldn't remember.  They kept at me until I cried. It felt like hours. My uncle stood in the doorway watching as the detectives asked me the same questions over and over again. Was he tall? Short? Did he have long hair? Was he old or young? What was he wearing? But try as I might, I simply couldn't remember anything. All I knew was that I recognized him. The detectives tried to hide their frustration and anger but ultimately failed. At one point I was so scared of them I thought of making something up. But I didn't want to send anyone I knew to jail.  My parents didn't talk to me at the funeral and it was clear to me that they'd heard about my failure to identify Anna's killer. David the piano teacher talked to me, though, and he cried. I guess he'd had a crush on Anna, too. Most of mother's art friends came over with a few kind words to say. My teacher was there. Samuel the curator didn't come at all.  A few days after the funeral, a child psychologist came to my uncles house. She asked me the same questions the police did, but in a much gentler way. She didn't get mad at me when I didn't know the answers, either. I heard her tell my aunt and uncle that I had repressed the memory of what I saw and that it happens sometimes when a child is involved in a traumatic event. Uncle Peter asked if I would ever remember who it was. The psychologist said that one day something may trigger it again, but not to pressure me. My uncle nodded, gravely.  A week after that I was sent back home. Or at least, sent somewhere that used to be home. The walls of my house were now all white or gray. The bird fountain was gone, the undersea hallway was gone, the sculpture was gone. Anna's piano stairs were now covered in dark brown carpet.  I found my mom drinking a glass of wine and painting over the stars on the floor of the entryway. She didn't look at me for another week. She didn't speak to me for a month.  My once bright, lively home was now the color of Anna's tombstone. I was left alone in my room most of the time. Occasionally my mother would come by and ask matter-of-factly if I remembered yet who it was that had murdered her baby girl. But I hadn't. The asking turned to pressing, the pressing to demanding and the demanding, finally, to hysteria. My father had to stop her from shaking me and screaming at me several times but I didn't mind it. They were the only interactions I had with my mom, anymore.   Once in a while a detective would come by to talk to me but I never had anything new to tell them. My mother took me to a renowned hypnotist behind my father's back and I woke up screaming in hysterics. To my mother's disappointment I hadn't said anything during the session and didn't remember what I'd seen while I was under. My dad was pissed when he found out.   I really did try very hard to remember. I lay in bed every night for four years squeezing my eyes shut and screaming at my brain to show me what my eyes had seen. But it was no use. The memory was there, I could still see the figure in the darkness. But it had no face.  And because I *knew* that the person I'd seen that night was someone I knew, someone who was probably still around, I was constantly afraid. I hid from my uncle, Samuel, my mother's art friends, even my dad.   But worse then all of that was just knowing that Id failed Anna. I fell asleep in tears more nights than not.  Eventually I was old enough to go away to college. I stopped crying at night and started drinking instead. It came to a point where I couldn't fall asleep unless I was blackout drunk.  I no longer wanted to remember what I'd seen. It had been too many years; the wounds were old and finally starting to heal. I didn't need to know the truth of what happened that night and I convinced myself it didn't matter anymore, anyway.   As graduation neared I was surprised to hear from my dad that my mother was planning to attend the ceremony.  I spent all of my summers and holidays on campus and I hadn't spoken to her in four years. I was hesitant didn't know what to expect.  When the day came, I nervously waited for my parents car to pull up outside of my apartment. As soon as she got out of the car, my mom threw her arms around me and cried. She apologized for abandoning me when I needed her most and she begged my forgiveness. I hugged her back and told her how much I'd missed her. It had taken 18 years, but my mom was finally getting better and it was the happiest day of my life. My parents asked me to come home after graduation and live in my old room while I looked for a job. As any broke, homeless, new graduate would, I excitedly agreed.  I drove home on a Friday and found a surprise graduation party waiting for me when I arrived. And that wasn't even the best part. The best part was that my house was no longer shades of gray and death- it was a menagerie of color and life again. Life that had been breathed back into my childhood home, even dad didn't seem to mind it anymore. The fountain, the fish hallway, they were all back!   I spent the night laughing and clinking glasses with people I hadn't seen since the funeral. David the piano teacher was there, married now, with his youngest son. Uncle Peter shook my hand and told me I'd become a fine young man. Aunt Lydia hugged me tightly. Some of mother's art friends were there, too, and they hadn't changed at all- they still talked loudly and often.   Close to midnight, though the party was in full swing, I decided I needed a break to just quietly appreciate how life could take you to rock bottom and then raise you back up in such eloquent ways.  I wandered around the house, quietly admiring some of my mother's new pieces.  I made it upstairs and found that my room had been converted into a more respectable, adult bedroom with a flat screen and a computer desk. And I was happy to see they'd left me my PS1! I peaked into my parent's bedroom, too, and admired the Saharan theme before walking down the hall to come face to face with the very last bedroom - Anna's. I leaned my head against the closed door for a few moments and sighed deeply.  "I'm sorry, Anna," I whispered before pushing the door in.  Anna's room was a mausoleum. It looked exactly as it had the night she'd died only the bed was made with different linens and the carpet had been replaced. All the blood covered up or cleaned away. I couldn't bring myself to go in.  I suddenly heard a wooden creak on my right and snapped my head toward the staircase. A man was coming up the stairs and he had paused on the landing to lean against the dancing man statue and turned to smile at me. My glass fell to the floor to shatter at my feet.  You'd think a repressed memory would come back to you slowly, ebbing and flowing like a wave on a beach, leaving behind tendrils of the truth with each swell. But it wasn't like that at all. As soon as I saw his face, I knew, and I remembered everything.   The dancing man stared up at me from beside Samuel on the landing. And even though it hadn't moved, I could feel it staring back at me.   The panic began to well in my chest just as they did all those years ago, when the dancing man had climbed the stairs to stare at me in the darkness.  I remember it all now. I remember, too, Annas screams when the statue entered her room. I remember my mothers piano gently playing Vivaldi over the sounds of my sisters bones cracking and her flesh tearing.   I remember when the dancing man, covered in blood, appeared at my door and danced to my mother's music, his smile growing bigger and toothier every second. And I remember when he danced away, leaving a dark trail of my sisters blood behind him. I remember everything now.    [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)        Fascinating response!   It's Jillian.    It had promised to be an awesome day. My dad was finally going to take me deep sea fishing off the east coast of the island. Like most kids on the island I wasn't allowed on the east beach. It was for a stupid reason, of course: a mile out from the east shoreline there was a 500 ft drop off, an undersea cliff, and they didn't think it was "safe" for us.   I think my dad agreed to take me to the east beach because of the divorce. Both of my parents were trying to win custody of me. They wanted me to choose. I just wanted my family back.  We made a plan to boat around the reefs for awhile, snorkel and let me practice my free-diving. I had been working on it for a year and I could already free-dive down to 21 feet! I wanted to break the world record one day. We found deeper and deeper places for me to dive as we wandered around the unfamiliar reefs and sand bars.  After we had finished exploring a sunken speedboat I decided to sunbathe and snooze for awhile. Dad got behind the helm to take us to our next location.  I was awoken by the shrill ring of my dad's phone. He cut the engine so that he could hear the person on the other end of the line. I thought it must be his divorce lawyer because he decided to take the call below deck.  I peered over the side of the boat into the crystal clear waters and saw that the ocean floor was about 30 feet down. I wondered if I could free-dive that. Then I heard my dad yelling below deck and I realized he must be talking to my mom. I covered my ears, I didn't want to hear that. I decided to try the 30 foot dive just for a reason to get off the boat.  I took several long, deep breaths and dove into the lucid, sparking water. I made it down ten feet easily and then 15,  I struggled to 20 and then 25...I was doing it!  I was almost there, I just needed to touch the seafloor and I could claim victory! I was so close, just a little more, I can make it, I can do it! My lungs began to burn, and I could feel the panic welling.  And then, I was there. 30 feet down!   I quickly braced my legs and pushed off against the sea bed, jettisoning myself up toward the surface. My chest and my head were aching severely now. I swam up as hard as I could, hoping I hadn't made a terrible mistake. Darkness peaked around the corners of my vision. My arms and legs began to feel weak. This had been such a stupid idea, I was going to drown here.   And then, suddenly, I broke the surface.  I took the deepest breath I've ever taken and tread water for a few minutes as I tried to recover. I'd done it!  I climbed up onto the boat just as Dad was coming up the stairs.  "Dad, I did it!"  "Did what?"  "I free-dove down like 30 feet and touched the seabed! See?"  I looked over the side of the boat.  "Oh actually it only looks about 20-25 feet." I said quickly. "But that's still a personal record!"  My dad raised his eyebrow and went to look over the side of the boat. I peered down with him.  "Oh...well now it only looks like around 15 feet. Nevermind, I guess." I frowned.  Dad backed up from the bow and started shaking his head.  "Oh my god..." He whispered.   "What?"  "Sarah, we passed the drop off a quarter mile ago."  "But..."  He started running for the wheel.   "Dad, wha-, what's wrong?" I yelled, alarmed.  I didn't understand. The seafloor was there, I'd touched it just a moment ago. I looked over the edge again.  5 feet...  [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)    Thanks much!   Can someone explain bang bus to me?

Everyone else around me seemed to know exactly who they were. Their lives would fly right by me; their GPSs locked on to destinations while I just sat idling in the street. In high school I never did any extracurricular activities because I couldn't figure out if I was a sports person or a music person. And it was no different in college. I wandered through four different majors, unable to decide who I wanted to be. I just felt like a blank slate.  And if I was a blank slate, Micah York was The Starry Night - authentic, beautiful, perfect. He was my exact antithesis which is what attracted me to him in the first place. He was born knowing *exactly* who he was and what he was about. His confidence and certainty in himself was an all but tangible element of him.  We first met in our freshman year of college; he was a Neuroscience student and I was majoring in History. We dated our sophomore year, after I changed my major to Computer Sciences. We broke up in our junior year, just before I decided I wanted a degree in Psychology, instead. And he asked me a favor our senior year, just after my guidance counselor told me it was too late to switch majors again.  Our last semester of college was beginning soon and Micah had been applying to grad schools. He wanted to get his Masters in Neurobiology and I helped him with the applications when I had time. I knew Micah was under a lot of stress to nail his senior thesis so I was surprised when he asked me over to his house for a party that January. I should have known something was up because Micah was a meticulous student and he didnt throw parties  ever.  When I arrived at his off campus apartment, I considered not even getting out of the car. His flat was dark and quiet, there was definitely no party. Just what was he up to? I picked up my phone to call Micah and beg off but curiosity suddenly got the better of me and I hung up.  When I walked into the familiar TV-less living room I saw two familiar faces and two strange ones.  There was Micah, of course, and Micahs friend Sean Nichols, an Organic Chemistry major. The other two people were introduced to me as Irina Bradley, another med student, and Holly Bishop, a Philosophy major. Irina the med student scooted over and made room for me on the couch. I sat down hesitantly and waited for Micah to begin whatever it was he was doing. He rose and walked to the middle of the room.  "Thanks for coming, guys. Im sure youre wondering why youre here because, clearly, this isnt a party. The truth is I have something of vital importance to ask each of you.  Micah paused, for effect Im sure, took a deep breath and dropped his voice an octave.  I have selected each of you to take part in the greatest experiment of not only your lives but perhaps even in human history. I am asking you to take part in my doctoral thesis."  I rolled my eyes. Classic Micah. He may be many things, but humble wasnt one of them. Jackass appeared to be, though.   "And what is your thesis?" I asked him nonchalantly, as if his previous statement hadnt been utterly stupid.  "A conclusive essay detailing what happens after human death.  Irina the med student laughed. Sadly, I knew Micah well enough to know he was being serious.  "How do you intend to prove anything?" I asked. "What kind of experiments have you designed?  "Well, Bridget, Im going to kill myself."  The room fell quiet and Micah, mistaking the shocked horror for awed silence, stood a little taller and finally smiled.  "You can't be serious."  "Oh, I am and it's completely reversible. I am going to be the first person in the *world* to prove or disprove the existence of an afterlife."  "We," demanded Sean.  "Yes, we. This paper is going to be our ticket into any university in the world. Wars have been waged for centuries over deities and religions and we are going to prove what is scientifically correct beyond a shadow of a doubt!"  "You're an idiot," I sighed and rose from the couch to leave. Irina followed me but Micah beat us to the door.  "Bridget, wait! At least hear all of it before you walk away. Please."  I narrowed my eyes at him and shook my head.  I want no part in killing anyone. Even you.  "I'd like to hear how it works." Holly the Philosophy major coolly cut in  from her spot on the couch.  "Ah, actually, it's something *I* developed." Sean said. "A cocktail of biological and non-biological chemicals. It's been tested and it's safe."  "*Tested*?" Irina asked in horror. "On whom?"  "On local wildlife.  "So never on a person. I said.  "Not yet but it *is* safe. Sean said quickly.  "So then how *does* it work?" Irina asked. She took a step back toward the couch and thats when I knew they had her.  Micah gestured to Sean.  "I've developed a poison and a biologic. I call them the Romeo and Juliet serums. Juliet is a poison that kills the body. Romeo is a biologic, or antidote for lack of a better word, that revives it."  "Clinical death will only take place for 30 seconds. Micah cut in. No brain damage, no organ damage."  Yes, it truly is perfectly safe; the body will only be dead for a short time. Sean confirmed.  "So, Flatliners." I glared at Micah.  "What?" Sean asked.  "Flatliners, it's a movie. The characters kill themselves and bring themselves back. If I recall it didn't work out too well for them in the film. But Micah knows that since hes obsessed with it.  "That's a Hollywood movie. Micah said, dryly. This is legitimate science." "No, you're Kiefer Sutherland, I pointed at him, he's Kevin Bacon," I pointed at Sean, "and I'm Julia fucking Roberts!"  "No," Micah said hotly, "actually *she's* Julia fucking Roberts!" He pointed to Holly.  "So am I Oliver Platt, then?" asked Irina.  "No one is Oliver Platt!" Micah yelled.  "Well, if we get to choose I'd rather be Oliver Platt than Kevin Bacon." Sean interrupted.  "Sean, you're fucking Kevin Bacon." Micah spat.  "And you're Keifer Sutherland!" I yelled at him.  "THIS ISN'T FUCKING FLATLINERS!"  I sighed. "So I'm not going under."  "No." Micah looked exasperated.  "Then why am I here?"  Micah combed his hand through his dark brown hair. "Jesus, I've been trying to get to that.  "Am I going under?" Irina asked.  "No, just me, Sean and Holly."  "And you think she's going to *agree* to that?"  "Actually," Holly interrupted, rising from the couch. "I already have."  "Why?" I gaped at her.  "Because I want to know, I *need* to know why I'm here, why any of us are here. I want to know what the soul is and where it goes, I want to hold the keys to human existence, love and suffering, life and death. I want to understand our purpose. And I'm getting paid and it's perfect for my dissertation."  "That's another thing," Micah said quickly, "everyone will get paid."  "How much?" Irina narrowed her eyes at him.  "$500 each."  I groaned. $500 was pretty much how short I was on tuition for this semester and Micah knew that. What an ass.  "The Romeo and Juliet serums are safe. They've been tried and tested and they *will* work. Sean and I have rented a house on Emerald Street to conduct the experiment. All I need, all I'm asking, is for you to show up, Bridget. Just show up next Saturday."  "And what about me?" asked Irina.  "Irina, I need you to administer the serums and monitor vital signs. Look guys, this whole thing will take less than a minute and then you guys can walk away with your five hundred dollars and a credit on my thesis. "And what makes your evidence, which is pretty much just your testimony, conclusive?" I asked.  "The serums Sean developed will be available to anyone and everyone and they can repeat my experiment at their leisure."  But I dont think that-  "Please, Bridget, just show up on Saturday."  There wasn't one facet of this little science experiment that didn't make me profoundly uncomfortable. But the way Micah looked at me, the tension in the room, the five hundred dollars...  "I'm not asked, Bridget. I'm begging." Micah grabbed my hands and squeezed.  "I'll think about it."                                      ***  I wasn't really surprised to find myself at the house on Emerald Street that following Saturday. I'd debated about it all week but in the end - all other factors not withstanding - I was curious. Micah was brilliant, top 1% of his class, several published papers; what if he was right? What if he did see something? People have near death experiences everyday and came back with stories. Micah was going deeper into death than anyone ever had ever come back from before and he was doing it in a controlled environment using an experiment that could be easily duplicated. I mean, who knows?  Micah greeted me at the door with a smile that said he knew Id come and walked me to the large, barren living room. It sported tan walls, hardwood floors, lots of hospital equipment and 3 cheap looking twin beds.  Sean and Holly were already laying on two of the beds with nervous smiles on their faces and IVs in their arms. Irina was bustling around checking equipment and looking incredibly stressed.  Micah handed me an expensive looking, heavy camera. "The cameras at the end of our beds are already recording  theyre our static cameras. I need you to walk around and record with this one as well. Irina is going to stagger our injections so that she can handle all three of us. You are simply a witness, nothing more."  "Okay... Micah, are sure you want to do this?"  "Bridget, we've been testing this and as long as Romeo is injected in under a  minute, which it will be, there is no risk."  "Theres definitely risk, Micah. And near death experiences-"  "This isn't a *near* death experience, it's a *death* experiment. Look, I know youre worried, and thats why I wanted you here, to make sure nothing goes wrong. And even if it does, I have stacks and stacks of notes and narratives proving that this was *my* experiment."  "Yeah, but  I couldn't think of anything else to say. Any objection I had, Micah would have an answer for. That's just the way he was. There was no stopping him now; I could either be here to see it or be somewhere else to hear about it.  I chose to stay.  Micah walked over to stand in front of my camera.  Its 12:51PM on Saturday, January 14th. I am Micah York and this is the first attempt of the afterlife experiment.  Micah walked over to his bed and sat down, letting Irina expertly thread a needle into his vein. He lay back on the pillow and  turned to Sean and Holly.  "Remember, guys, as soon as you regain consciousness speak directly to your cameras about what you saw.  Yep.  Got it."  "Okay guys," Irina said with a shaky voice. "Everything is ready."  "Alright, Micah said, excitedly, 30 seconds, that's all. Irina, as soon as the last of the Juliet leaves the tube, hit this timer." Micah pointed to the digital clocks that were set to 00:30 at the head of each bed. Irina nodded.  "Bridget, you film." I swallowed loudly and nodded too.  "See you on the other side," Micah smiled and gave a thumbs up to Holly and Sean who returned it and then settled back on their beds. I hit record. Irina picked up three red tubes of thick, clear liquid from a nearby table. Steadying her hands, she slowly injected the first tube into Micah's IV, and then hit the timer above him. At the exact moment she did, Micah's heart-rate monitor flat-lined. I jumped at the high-pitched squeal and tried to steady the camera.  Irina hurriedly moved over to Sean and did the same for him and then Holly. Now all three EKG machines were loudly flat-lining. Irina put her hands over her ears for a minute and then pointed to a different monitor. "Get this! Bridget, record this!" It was Micah's EEG and there were zero active brain waves. "Get Holly and Sean's too!"  I could suddenly taste a bitter metal in my mouth and I knew I was beginning to panic. This had been a bad idea, a very bad idea. By the time I looked back over to Micah's timer there was 8 seconds left on it. Irina had already loaded up a green tube, the Romeo biologic, to Micah's IV and was just waiting to push it in.  The chorus of all three EKG machines wildly sounding their alarms was deafening. It was screaming at us: Do something! DO something! Why are you just standing there? Save them!  Just when I couldnt stand it anymore, a different alarm buzzed and Irina injected the Romeo into Micahs arm. I didn't breathe at all as I waited for Micah's vital monitors to show life. It took less than 5 seconds for the EKG machine to register a spike. And then another. Micah's EEG machine suddenly flared to life as well. I exhaled.  Irina had just stepped over to Sean when Micah suddenly shot up in bed, eyes wide, and opened his mouth. I was so excited and curious that I almost forgot to hold the camera up. I couldnt wait to hear what he had to say.  But Micah didn't say anything. He just screamed. The surprise and force of it made me stumble back into a wall. It was the most blood-curling scream I had ever heard. And then, Sean started screaming, too. Micah took no notice of him and threw himself off the bed to the floor, slamming his head on the wood over and over again. Sean had also jumped out of bed and run over to the wall to stand just 2 inches from it, screaming at it, as if he didn't know the wall was there.  My shock quickly gave way to panic. Micah's head was already bloody and the sound it made against the hard oak was sickening.  "Irina, help me!"  Irina, who hadn't moved since Sean had knocked her out of the way, stared at me wide-eyed.  "We need to get him off the floor, he's hurting himself!"  She opened her palm and looked down at the last tube of Romeo biologic as if she'd never seen it before.  "You didn't give that to her yet?! Give that to Holly! Now!" My voice was high and wild. I was holding Micah in my arms while he continued to hit his head against the air, as if the floor were still there. And the screaming, oh God, the screaming.  Both Micah and Sean were splitting my ears open. The horror on Micah's face as he beat his head harmlessly against the air, mouth open in a wide O and the sharp, agonizing terror coming out of Sean was enough to make me my eyes well up in fear. What had happened? What had they seen? The camera, long forgotten, lay discarded under Micah's bed where his flailing legs had kicked it. Irina was doing frantic chest compressions on Holly, tears streaming from her eyes. But I knew it was too late, Holly was lost.  "Irina, Irina, call 911." She didn't stop working on Holly, just continued on like she hadn't heard me. And perhaps she hadn't. The screaming... I let go of Micah just for a moment to grab my phone and he was up and running. He hit the front door and smashing his forehead against the glass.  "Micah, stop!"  If Sean noticed us near him, he didn't show it. He just continued that piercing, horrible scream.  Emergency services couldn't hear me on the phone but they had someone at the house within 5 minutes. A very, very long 5 minutes. Irina gave up on Holly at some point and just paced around the room mumbling "I don't understand. I did it right. I don't understand."  They took Sean, Holly and Micah away in an ambulance and they took me and Irina to the police station. They watched the videos. I never graduated but at least I didn't go to prison like Irina. I retreated into myself after her trial and refused to speak to anybody. I spent months holed up in my apartment asking the same question over and over.  What did they see?  And it's not like I could ask them. Sean had screamed until he permanently lost the use of his voice. Now he sits in a room in a hospital facing a wall with his mouth wide open as if he were screaming. And somehow, that's worse than the screaming. He hasn't said or written a word since that day. Micah, he's in a hospital too. Sometimes he screams and sometimes he's quiet. Sometimes he thrashes and sometimes he lies as still as the dead. I have visited them both many times, begging them to tell me what they saw. But my visits were fruitless until this last time.  Yesterday when I visited Micah he was in his screaming stage. I sat with him and let him scream waiting to see if he would transition to one of his catatonic stages so that I could speak. When I was tired of waiting I leaned in close to his ear and I asked him.  "Micah, what did you see?"  His screaming slowly morphed into an insane, uncontrollable laughter Id never heard before. His doctor, whod been just outside, came running into the room.  "What did you do?" He asked, alarmed.  I just asked him a question." I responded, quietly.  "What was the question?"  "I asked him what he saw."  We both noticed the sudden silence at the same time. We slowly turned toward Micah to find him facing us, no expression on his face.  "It's all waiting for you. It's waiting for all of us." Then his mouth fell open into a large O and the laughter slowly began again followed by shrill, horrible screams.  I left the hospital that day wishing I had never come at all, wishing I'm never met Micah. I drove home with tears pouring down my cheeks. *What did they see? Whats on the other side? Do I even want to know?* But it really doesnt matter anymore. Someday Ill find out. And so will you.  [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)      Thanks!   I wonder who the girl was...   [Cabin in Northern AZ](http://imgur.com/NHBezCR)  or  [Minnesota sky](http://imgur.com/9FpY5wB)    [United 93.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_93_\(film\)) I just don't think I could handle the emotions.    I never learned to drive a stick shift.   So many posts about Robin Williams- I'm sure he could have used them yesterday. It's a reminder to always let the people you care about know it- the last chance to is rarely predictable.   I live in a backwoods, crappy town in the Midwest. It's a boring, medium sized city carved out of the dense Ozarks of Southeast Missouri. Growing up here had been difficult. I come from a large, violent family and it was no secret that the Cooper kids got beaten. Of course, lots of kids around here get beaten. That's just the kind of town it is.  Since I wasn't allowed to have any friends, I'd concentrated on my grades so that one day I could escape to a 4 year university on the other side of the state. I never thought that after graduating Magna Cum Laude from MSU I would end up back in Harrington, and I might have killed myself if I'd known it.    I often wondered about where I had slipped up along the way. I'd had a bright, exciting future in front of me, far away from Harrington and the drunken, redneck family I'd left behind. But it didn't seem to be any one thing that brought me back. It was just a series of missteps and bad luck. There was no one thing to blame, which made it all the more frustrating.   Teaching English at a community college was a far cry from the literary agent I'd dreamed of being. Every day that I woke up in Harrington felt like a failure. The only thing I enjoyed about the town was the crisp nature that surrounded it. My small home backed right up to the Ozarks and every weekend I went hiking in the woods to clear my mind; always taking the same path by the river and always coming home refreshed and content. I considered them my mini-vacations and they kept me sane.   But it was this very practice of mine that lead to the single most horrific moment of my life. It could have been anyone in town who'd found her - hundreds of people go out into those woods- but it wasn't just anyone, it was me.   I don't know what came over me that Sunday, but for some reason I didn't want to hike my usual trail. Maybe it was the difficult week I'd had, or the fact that my hand was feeling so very stiff (I'd broken it years before) or perhaps it was because my creepy stalker had been dancing on the fringes of his 100 yard legal restriction all week. Or maybe it was everything combined. For whatever reason, I decided on a change in my routine that day.   Since I had brought my GPS I decided to let my thoughts and body drift where they may. I wandered lazily and mindlessly, letting the fresh, cool air purify my soul, as it always did.   I thought about the exam I was giving the following week. I thought about taking my dog Clara to puppy training classes. I thought about calling in another complaint about Doug the Stalker. I thought about everything for awhile and then I thought about nothing.   After about an hour I realized that I had stumbled onto a narrow,  barely visible trail. The crisp, thin morning air was slowly giving way to it's warmer, heavier brother. I decided to follow the trail for a quarter mile or so and then turn around and head back. According to my GPS, I was only about 2 miles from home, which wasn't that far at all.  I lost the trail twice, but was able to pick it up again after a few moments both times. Just as I lost the trail for a third time, the tree line broke and I was suddenly standing in a small clearing. I could tell immediately that there was something not right about this place, something ailing. The grass was yellowed and dead  and an old, gnarled Burr Oak tree sat in the middle of the glade under thin, weak sunlight.  This place was Creeps-town. I took out my phone and snapped a few photos hoping to somehow capture the eerie aura of the clearing.  I walked around the burr oak, stepping over thick, low-hanging branches. I raised my camera to take another photo when something that shouldn't be caught my eye. There was color between the leaves that had no place in the sickly yellows and sullen browns. It was a pink shoe.  I walked closer, curious, and wondering if maybe kids used this place to smoke weed or drink.  But when I got closer, I saw the shoe was far too small for a teenager. It was the shoe of a young child - and there was a young child still in the shoe.  I've felt many horrible things in my life - failure, disappointment, pain - but I have never felt anything so horrible as I did when finding the bones of a small child shoved into the alcove of a tree. She was curled up in the fetal position, her broken body much too large for the tiny little alcove. It was a wonder that she had fit there at all when she was more than just bones. Her clothes were mostly gone, at least on the exposed side, and her skull had cracks and angry indentations. I vomited on the trunk of the tree and then I'm ashamed to say - I ran.   I ran all 2 miles home, the need to share the burden of this knowledge with someone, anyone, was urgent in me to the point of hysteria. When I finally broke the tree line into my own backyard I fell onto the grass in exhaustion. I stared up at sun, trying to blind myself of the memory. But I could still see that dead little girl.  When I could breathe again, I took my phone from my pocket and dialed the police. They came within minutes and I somehow found the strength to stand and meet them in the driveway. I explained everything that had happened in short, choked sentences and handed them my GPS to show them where the body was.   An officer wrapped a blanket around me and another brought me bottles of water. After that, everything happened pretty quickly. I sat in my kitchen  and watched out the window as crowds gathered and media arrived. The sound of helicopters came and went from overhead, both police and news choppers alike, I'm sure. I stared out the window shade, praying that the crowds couldn't see me inside.   As dusk began to settle, I found Doug in the gathered crowd of news correspondents and neighbors.  He was at the very front of the police tape and he watched both the spectacle and my window, evenly. It was the first time he had ever actually broken the restraining order. I tried to find an officer but I found my bed instead.   The long, emotional day gave way to a deep and sound sleep. When I awoke the next morning, I saw that media vans from St. Louis had arrived and that the cops had set up roadblocks on my street. I called into work that day and the next and finally I told them I wouldn't be coming in the rest of the week. I stayed home and worked on my novel, trying to ignore the circus our town had become.   Identifying the little girl took almost two weeks but someone in the media had named her "Sarah".  I saw the headline "Who put Sarah in the Burr Oak tree?" land on my front porch one day. It seemed the media was drawing comparisons between our case and the *Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?* case. I never retrieved the paper.   Finally, the coroner's office released a statement that the 6 year old girl had been identified - name withheld while they notified the family - and that the likely, though not conclusive, cause of death was blunt force trauma.   Two days later I was asked to come in and give a recorded, official statement to the lead detective on the case. I went over everything I could remember from that day in extreme detail, even seeing Doug in the gathering crowd. The detective nodded his head throughout my testament and then, when I was finished,  pressed stop on the recorder and left the room.   I drummed my fingers on the table and absentmindedly stared up at the camera in the corner until he returned ten minutes later.  The door opened and the lead detective walked back into the room with a stranger in tow. He was tall, tanned, and sported slicked back white hair. I instantly disliked him.  "Ms. Cooper, this is Dr. Watner. Do you remember Dr. Watner?"  "No. Should I?"  "Not necessarily." The doctor replied.   "Why am I still here?"   "Because of Sarah." The detective sat down across from me.  "Is Sarah the girl in the tree?"  "Sarah is your daughter." The doctor answered.  "I don't have a daughter." I said shaking my head.  "Jessica," the doctor began, "we met several years ago when your daughter first disappeared. You blamed a man named Doug Ozinga for taking her, you were hysterical about it. Do you remember that?"  "I know Doug Ozinga, I have a restraining order against him. But that's where my part in this ends, I don't have a daughter." I repeated, slowly.  "Jessica, I'm going to show you some pictures now that might upset you."  The doctor spread three large photos out in front of me. As soon as I saw their content my hands began to shake. But I wasn't afraid. I was confused.   "I don't remember these pictures. I don't know who that is."  The photos were of me with a young, blonde girl of about 5. We were both smiling and hugging.   "Do you agree that the person in this picture is you?"  I continued to stare at the photos. There was no denying it, I still had some of the clothes I was wearing in the photo.  "Yes."  "And does the child in this picture look at all familiar to you?"  The answer was no - and yes. She was a stranger but I felt like she was stranger who I'd seen before somewhere. Memories began to tug at the tips of my synapses and I tried to let them in but they were hazy and butted.  "Yes." I murmured, my eyes never leaving the page.  The detective leaned forward in his chair. "I'm so sorry, Jessica. The body that was in the tree has been identified as your daughter, Sarah."  "What..." I was lost, and suddenly feeling terribly alone. "What do I do?"  "I think you should take some more time talking to Dr. Watner, you're going to need support now."  "And what about the little girl? I saw Doug Ozinga on the day the body was found, he was at the crime scene!"  "Yes, I expected that."  The detective stood up then, and Dr. Watner followed.  "We will return shortly. Here," He handed me my phone. "You should research your case. It might help you remember anything else you may be repressing. Would you like me to call your family?"  But I had no family. "No. I'm just really scared and confused right now, I need to think."  "I understand," the detective said as he followed Dr Watner through the door.  "Wait!" I yelled suddenly, rising from my chair. The detective stopped and turned around. "When are you going to arrest Doug Ozinga? Do you have any evidence on him yet?"  "Jessica...Doug Ozinga doesn't exist."  He closed the door behind him and I fell back into my chair. It's been almost two hours and they haven't come back. And it makes me wonder why I'm still here.   But I kinda think I know. I had a daughter who disappeared. Doug Ozinga doesn't exist. And I found a dead body in the woods.  [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)                    Part 3 doesn't complete the novel, there are still 12-13 chapters left. Does anyone know where the rest of it is?   I climb out of my car and survey the intimate piece of wooded glen before me. It's quiet here, and cold. I have come to this secret, isolated place everyday for the past week. It used to be Our Spot, but now, it is only Aiden's.  I sit on the grass and I stare at his tree and I feel the chilled, thin air whip the hot tears from my cheeks. I shake my head to try and clear it as the familiar questions bleed into my mouth, begging to be asked. How could he have done this? What drove him to it? Why didn't I see the signs? Is it my fault? I bury my head in my hands, partly for warmth, partly in despair. We were happy once, we were in love. This was Our Spot. And now when I look at Aiden's tree, all I see is death. And so I'll sit and contemplate our short time together and try to reconcile it all as I have done everyday since it happened.  **3 months ago**  *I don't remember a time that I didn't love him. We went to preschool together and I watched him from afar. Our parents weren't friends or neighbors, we just happened to live in the same school district. I spent a decade loving him in silence. In high school, he joined a band and was well-liked. He was cool without even trying, one of those types. I was the shadow in the hallway, the unregistered blip on the lunchroom radar. I was something to step around, just a dismissive object out of the corner of their eyes. But, I had my own friends and they were as diffident as I was.*   *The first words I ever said to him were: "Thanks, you don't have to do that if you don't want to, even though you offered to."*   *Stupid words. Asinine words. The words of a child. I had dragged my friends to a party and Aiden was there. We had never drank alcohol before but wanted to be accepted as one of their own, so we sipped on their wine coolers. Except Annie. Annie didn't sip, Annie got drunk. We tried to hold her up as best we could and Aiden saw our struggle. He wasn't drinking. He was so responsible, so mature. He offered to drive us home. I didn't have my car. We said yes.*  I watch the wind dance between the branches of Aiden's tree. The long, spindly boughs are barren and with nothing to catch the gales, they move only slightly, as if slow dancing with a lover. It doesn't remind me of us. Your tree is strong, but then, it had to be, didn't it? I wonder how long it takes a man to die, hanging from a tree. I pull my jacket around me tighter as if it were a safety blanket, but it can't protect me from the questions. Where were the red flags? What does it say about me that I missed them? That I missed all of them?  **2 months ago**  *Aiden called me and invited me to a horror movie. How did he even get my number? I suppose the way cool people get things that they have a mild interest in - passively and with minimal effort. We sat in the back of the theater. I tried to get my courage up to touch him, but I was failing. And then, at the first jump scare, I grabbed his arm, involuntarily. His hand immediately closed over mine and he held me there, smiling and stroking my fingers. Afterward we sat in his car and talked for hours. He was nothing like I'd thought. He was humble and creative and deep. And he showed me a smile I'd never seen on him before. I called it My Smile, because it was only ever for me.*  *I wanted to hide that we were dating from the school but Aiden didn't care, he wanted the world to know. After two weeks I met his parents and he met mine. He drove me to Our Spot after a party and kissed me for the first time. His lips tasted like cool mint. Our Spot...it had been my favorite place to go, in real life and in my dreams. It had been beautiful and warm, the magic of our young love reflected in a twinkling canopy of stars and shimmering, red autumn leaves*.   But now it was just a grotesque pile of dirt and dead grass upon the skin of Mother Earth. The trees, once whimsical and droll, now looked like sharp, unwelcome daggers jutting intrusively out of the tender, hallowed ground. It looked like it hurt. If I could, I would tear the trees from her body and fill in the holes with soothing, white snow. Oh Aiden, I need to know why you did it! Why did it have to end? What drove you to such extremes?  Did he do it because of me? Or had it been buried deep within him all along?  I stare at Aiden's tree, willing it to give me the answers I crave, but the tree is silent and lovely, masquerading as an innocent, peaceful life. But I know it's not. It has played it's part.  I loved you, Aiden. I told you so under this tree, and you told me, too. We were stronger than the demons, together, I know we were. How could someone like you, so loving, so creative, so beautiful wind up here - hanging from an ugly Sugar Maple, your body as empty as it's crisp, black branches? I had been so blind. To him and to what was slowly happening around me.  **1 month ago**  *I can't put a finger on exactly when it started or why. It's like trying to remember the precise moment you fell asleep upon waking the next day. The details are hazy and blurred, it seemed to happen over time and yet all at once. He still winks at me, he hugs me. We go places together and we kiss. But the smile he reserved only for me seems to have disappeared from his stock of facial expressions. I don't realize then that I'll never get to My Smile again.*  *After a week, I begin to wonder if he is falling out of love with me. So I offer him the only thing a girl like me has to offer someone like that. My innocence. Aiden smiles gently and asks if that's what I really want. I tell him yes. I know that the night will be painful and beautiful and that I will blossom into something different and lovelier by the morning. He considers for awhile and then strokes my hair and tells me he wants nothing more. He promises not to hurt me. He promises not to touch me if I don't feel right about it when the time comes. He keeps his promise. We choose a night after a party to drive to Our Spot. I am happy again, for a short time.*   The light in the sky is growing dimmer, now. Colors begin to bleed into the horizon and I know I must go soon. The wind has left Our Spot and the air, though thin and cold, is somehow stagnant. Had Aiden's last breath of air been like this: stale and decaying? Or had it smelled beautiful as Our Spot once had, like fresh pine and starlight?  I would find no honest answers here. Only lies or silence.  ***7 days ago***  *I find it cruel, whether intentional or careless, that Aiden bought the rope while I was with him. I met him at the Home Depot where he worked and he said he had to buy something after he got off the clock. He said it like it meant nothing at all. It was a long, white rope, just an innocuous weaving of fibers, selected unceremoniously from a red bucket of ropes. How could such a plain, ordinary thing take away something so precious to me? How could it dare? It was nothing, just a bland, boring and common coil of rope- limp and lifeless. It had millions of brothers and sisters in the world just like it.  It just doesn't seem fair, like it assumed too much of itself, to take something so important away. I wonder where the rope is now.*  *We went to the party, my last party with the man I loved. Unlike Aiden's sudden, yet somehow gradual change I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew something was wrong that night. Aiden stood across the room from me, whispering with strangers and staring. It was an odd gaze. He didn't try to hide his stare yet somehow still seemed ashamed of it. I began to feel sick then. It was my first and only red flag. I finally had a sign that something terrible was going to happen. But it was too late then.*  *I remember more than I wish to. Aiden noticed my state and helped me stumble to a bedroom. Four men followed him in. Aiden was true to his word, and never touched me. Perhaps there is comfort in that. A different man tied me with the familiar, course rope. It hurt my wrists. Funny thing that it is that pain I concentrated on more than any other.*    *The man I loved stood in the corner and watched it all. He smiled and laughed with them as the men did the disgusting things they did. Through the mist I could see them and I tried to remember every detail but halfway through it all my brain shut off as if there were a sudden power outage in my body. And the things they did in the dark...*   *When I awoke I was laying on the floor in a darkened room. The rope, like the very core of myself, had turned from snow white to a hot, unfamiliar red.*   *I didn't get to take Aiden to the Home Depot but that's okay, I bought the things I needed with his store discount anyway. Then, I convinced him to get in my car. Then I convinced him to drink a Mountain Dew. Then I drove him to Our Spot and penetrated him four times with four ordinary, common nails I had chosen at random from an ordinary, common black bucket. I found out that day that I enjoy poetic justice. Once he was stuck to the tree I sat down in front of it and watching him writhe for awhile. I thought he would be dead by the next day. But he wasn't.*  I get up now and walk across the glen. Our Spot has changed as I have changed. Where I had once been clean and white and pure, I was now dirty and red and noisy. The glen had once been lively and busy with red-orange leaves dripping with so many promises. But now it was white and quiet and dead. The glen and I had stolen from each other, swapped our souls in the dead of night.   I step up to Aiden's tree. His wounds are no longer bleeding which disappoints me because I am still bleeding. It has been five days. Pieces of his feet are missing and chucks of flesh from his face and thighs, just as chunks of me are missing inside. We are inside-out mirrors of each other and this calms me.  Aiden hasn't moved since I've been here. It seems that the elements and dehydration have finally killed him. I give a satisfied smile. I call it Aiden's Smile. I pull off an orange glove and place my hand against the thin, waxy skin of his face. He opens his eyes just a fraction and parts his cracked lips to speak. He makes no sound as there is only ash in his throat where his promises were cremated. I frown and sigh in disappointment as I prepare to make the drive home. I had hoped this would be the last I'd see of Aiden's Spot. I guess I'll come back tomorrow.   [C.

These are text posts made by verified users about issues relevant to the scientific community.    The basic idea is that our practicing scientists will post a text post describing an issue or topic to open a discussion with /r/science.  Users may then post comments to enter the conversation, either to add information or ask a question to better understand the issue, which may be new to them.  Knowledgeable users may chime in to add more depth of information, or a different point of view.    This is, however, not a place for political grandstanding or flame wars, so the discussion will be moderated, **be on your best behavior**.  If you can't disagree without being disagreeable, it's best to not comment at all.  That being said, we hope you enjoy quality discussions lead by experience scientists about science-related issues of the day.  Thanks for reading /r/science, and happy redditing!     ##**Science Verified User Program**  /r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic.    #**What flair is available?**  All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar. However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...  We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even on occasion music.  It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.  The general format is:  Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)  When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.  #**How does one obtain flair?**   First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available. Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .  This can be provided several ways:  1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification.   Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.   2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.   3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record.   This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.   Thanks for making /r/science a better place!                Starting on April 22nd, PLOS and /r/science will begin a weekly AMA series as part of the Science AMA Series to bring authors from the PLOS journals to reddit.  [See the announcement from PLOS here](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/)  PLOS, an open access journal, and /r/science, which does public review of journal articles, makes for a great fit, one that we are excited to bring to our readers.    If you have suggestions or requests for AMAs from PLOS authors, email them to plosreddit@plos.org  Tune in every Wednesday for a new PLOS AMA!     I've been trying to zone in on the fix for months, but I haven't had the time to really find the root cause. It's not the .organic-listing css, it's probably some inherited css from a different part of the stylesheet.   I'm sure it's obvious to one of you, help?                  Post your questions here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/32oan4/science_ama_series_we_are_charon_pierson_journal/                           Post your questions here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/31zpzy/science_ama_series_we_are_fred_whoriskey_and_sara/   First off, I don't think this can be done, but I'd very much like to be wrong.  We in /r/science would like to track the number of readers who look at our AMAs, we get a lot of requests for the information and right now I have to email the admins and wait for them to get back to me with a number, I can't look at changes over time, or any other handy stats to let us know how people are using our AMAs.   If we could embed a smart pixel via CSS we could gather some data on this, but it appears that all of the images that the subreddit CSS pulls need to be hosted on a reddit server, which would make our tracking pixel just a pixel.  Any thoughts on how to do this or am I stuck continually harassing people to get data?                          Please don't submit them either, we are committed to keeping /r/science a serious discussion of science.  We know reddit just loves a good prank, but there are many other places to do so.  Yes, we totally hate fun.

 Can't recall if Robocop has a beginning title screen, but it has an awesome end title screen   Jerry Maguire...actually ANYTHING from Cameron Crowe.    The Killing- Such a great late noir/heist movie and with so many great actors. Sterling Hayden scares me with his delivery of lines and his cold, stone face.  	3
 This will confuse the Allah out of terrorists.   This movie was clearly about mind control and MK-ULTRA      I think the responsible party has already expelled... Twice.  	4
 It could be uncontrolled diabetes. Two men that I worked with died of it relatively recently and one guy was actually talked about as being on the road to "eating himself to death."   Thanks.    "Seem" is the operative word. I've definitely had pimples come out during the day. You just tend not to notice the difference in your face from one hour to the next, but a break of eight hours makes it pretty obvious when you've got a new spot.   Do you know if they're actual paintings or Photoshopped?    Thanks.   This is best of? Seriously?  Most people are craven sheeple and it's not remotely surprising that when somebody in power tells them to jump, they ask how high. It's a lot harder to figure out why some people act truly selflessly, putting themselves at risk in order to help or save others.   When somebody explains that, that'll be worth a best of.   I thought that was his mother.    A Discovery of Witches  I was considering reading that series. Skip it, then?   Which books? Titles?   Because they want to live on the Upper West Side the same way that you apparently do. And the UWS is not even one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan either, especially once you get out of the Lincoln Center area.   Don't take cabs.    Yeah. I don't remember doing homework ever, though there must have been.   I also didn't get particularly good grades, especially in high school. Seems to me that doing homework helps build a work ethic and keeps kids from coasting on their intelligence.    Recently finished Whatever by Michel Houellebecq. It had an unnamed narrator, but it was a really short book so it didn't matter. Too bad it wasn't as good as it could have been.  The beginning was an absolutely vicious skewering of office life and office workers. The middle had a touch of American Psycho to it. But then the end just petered out into nothingness. Perhaps that was part of the point, but it had more of the feeling that Houellebecq just didn't know how to sustain the story.    Have you read his other early books The Chocolate War, I Am the Cheese, After the First Death, and The Bumblebee Flies Anyway? They are so good and so disturbing. His later books were weaker.  Some other YA authors who don't get any love here: Ron Koertge, Pete Hautman, Kathe Koja, and Paul Zindel.   But seriously, some card issuers do now offer one-time-use codes, and those are secure.  Good one, I never heard of it. I wonder if my CC has this option.   WAT. Also: WAT.  This seems like a fantastically bad idea all around.   Then how do you use it?   Yup, Kingkiller Chronicle.  Not fantasy/SF, but the romance in the latest John Rain book Graveyard of Memories by Barry Eisler had a whiff of "have you ever even talked to a girl?" about it, except that Eisler is married, so clearly the inability to write a decent romance is not necessarily about a lack of personal experience.      Because they have a sexy accent and you don't.   It goes way back to the belief that the Jews killed Jesus, way before Jews were moneylenders.   I have blue tissues in my bedroom right now.   Some of them are counterfeit, some of them are refurbished but don't tell you that, some of them are older/discontinued models, some of them were originally purchased with stolen credits cards so it didn't cost the seller anything to buy... so many possible reasons.   No. Just go to Europe where men regularly sit with their legs together and crossed at the knee, not at the ankle. This is entirely cultural, not physical.   It's supposed to be the ten sons of Haman from the Purim story as mentioned below.   A freilichin Purim!   Google "The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition." It's available in lots of place.   This is absolutely incorrect.   Not the mention that living conditions in Gaza are particularly bad because of Hamas, not because of Israel. In fact, Yasser Arafat's widow, Suha, sued Hamas, blaming them for the situation and for being unwilling to give up violence and negotiate with Israel.   I don't know what you're wearing or where you're shopping but plenty of my clothes have the label on the side toward the bottom.    Nobody knows. If they did, breast cancer testing wouldn't be as controversial as it is. When they pushed early detection they found more and more cancers but it didn't seem to save a commensurate amount of lives. Why? Because it turns out that a significant number of these cancers would have resolved themselves on their own and had they not been found through testing, nobody would have been the wiser. So instead we save a few more lives, but put a lot of women through hell for nothing.  Problem is, nobody knows once a tumor is found whether it will resolve itself or not so the thinking see-saws between earlier testing and later testing.   This is seriously untrue. In some countries women are killed for saying they were raped. In some they're not allowed to drive. Or go outside without being escorted. Or go outside without being covered from head to toe. Forced into marriage in their teens. Have no right of divorce.   Palestinians are not remotely treated anything like this.    Wikipedia's source actually says there were up to 6,500 Danish Jews and 1,300 of their non-Jewish children through mixed marriage. Of these 7,800 people, 580 didn't escape and 464 of them were sent to Theresienstadt.  Though other sources do give other similar, but not exactly the same numbers.    OP's article says there were 7,800 Danish Jews, so clearly the number hasn't been pinned down exactly, but it's certainly below 10,000.  ETA: See below.   It's really disgusting that OP's grandma wrote a sweet and lovely card and grampa gets props for basically signing his name.    I think I misunderstood your comment earlier, and possibly other people did too. Upvoted now, for what it's worth.   First, there were very few Jews in Denmark, about 6,000, compared to about 140,000 in Holland, and more than 3 million in Poland. Most of them were so assimilated as to be indistinguishable from other Danes.   http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/countrymen-untold-story-denmark-jews-escaped-nazis-bo-lidegaard-review   There is an old Kabbalistic belief that at any given time, 14,400 Righteous Among the Nations (Gentiles who are willing to help Jews).  I don't know where you got this number or definition from. There's a concept that there are 36 righteous people among the nations in every generation and they "sustain the world." It has nothing to do with helping Jews.  There's another concept that any non-Jew living in (ancient) Israel and was pious was called "righteous among the nations."  And finally, the phrase "Righteous Among the Nations" is what Yad Vashem calls non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust. It's not kabbalistic, it's just a slogan that they appropriated because it sounds good.   What it really means is that Danish Jews were so assimilated that they were barely identifiable as Jews anymore. So while what the Danes did was a good thing, if the Jews had been less assimilated, they might not have done it.    If you live at home, you have to move out immediately, if not sooner. If not, then you simply have to stop talking to your mom about men and realize that she cannot prohibit you from doing anything because you are an adult.   She sounds like a very bitter, very unhappy woman. She has no right to take out her regrets about her life on you.   This is what the Save option is for.   A few men  And women. Ada Lovelace is considered the world's first computer programmer.   Normally I downvote all "should I read the book or watch the movie first" questions because the answer is almost always "watch the movie first so that you're not disappointed if it doesn't live up to the book" but I'm upvoting this because funnily, I have that movie out from the library right now myself and I totally forgot that it was based on a book. So, upvote for reminding me.   I kept reading the title as a "man-mouse utopia."    On the way home tonight a car was backing into a parking space and a pigeon was slowly walking out of the way. I was really scared for it. Thankfully it turned out okay but I'm always worried when I see pigeons too close to moving cars.    **Fatal Fortune, by Victoria Laurie**   I recently read Broken Monsters. There was a slight bit of horror/sadness. I didn't think it was too extreme, but you sound like a more sensitive person than me.  It's a great book for anyone who liked True Detective.   Third Wave feminism is sex positive -- Second Wave wasn't.    Icebergs, polar bears, northern lights.  Post in /r/travel to get more real answers.   At first I thought Quantico sounded interesting, then it sounded like a rip-off of The Recruit.      You're right, but at the same time I don't disagree that my writing lacks heart. I think it's a valid criticism.    Maybe I'm not writing with a burning passion but I don't think most professional writers are. They always say that you're not supposed to wait for inspiration, you're supposed to set a schedule and stick to it.  I can't do both. I can write in an inspired way but inspiration isn't going to sustain a novel-length work. Or I can write a novel methodically and apparently not have any heart.   I don't think the Martian had any heart at all and I couldn't have cared less about about any of it but it wasn't boring, so I kept reading. But most people seemed to have loved it.   I read On Writing a long time ago. Seems like it's time to read it again.   I'm looking at m-w.com now and I don't see that definition. Could you link it?   Even 95% heart and 5% head can work.  Sure, but now it's the opposite way around.  Of course it's a metaphor but the idea is that I'm intellectualizing too much. And the person who said this wasn't wrong at all in her assessment.  You know who writes like this a lot? Orson Scott Card. Occasionally Brandon Sanderson does too.   That's advice someone gave me recently. Has anybody else ever gotten this advice? How did you deal with it?  I'm not sure this is something I'm capable of doing. Maybe I should consider changing genres to something like SF where writing from your head is prized (I'm thinking of books like The Martian). The problem is that I don't read SF too much anymore and have no story ideas for it.    Hm? I wouldn't recommend calling a woman "sir."   How do customers refer to the men? As "Mr."? Then yes, a woman should be referred to as "Miss."   More likely it works on people who are not depressed at all, but are simply lazy and don't know how to motivate themselves.   Children: Boys and girls from ages 18 months to 10 years.   Grandparents: On the elderly side and can't do things that are too vigorous.    If the house is up to code, then I'm 100% right.  Why do you have any reason to believe the house is up to code? Again, you have never seen this house, have no idea what condition it's in. To tell somebody that something is okay without having examined it yourself is the height of irresponsibility.   Most   Most is not all.   That electrician saw this house and you didn't. You're the moron.   That's not safe. You're not supposed to use space heaters with extension cords.  http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters  As I said below, I know somebody whose house burned down from an electrical fire so I don't think this is something to take lightly.   I really don't understand why you're arguing. I'm sorry this is not something you're familiar with, but this is a matter of safety for yourself, your family and anybody who might be living with you or in your building. It's not something to be defensive about because you've never heard of it.  Do not overload circuits. Never use extension cords or multiple plugs with a space heater, and make sure the unit is not plugged into the same circuit as other electric appliances.  If your space heater is plugged into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) and the GFCI trips, dont assume there is something wrong with the GFCI. Immediately stop using the  heater until it can be checked by a professional if not, a serious shock could occur.  http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters  During use, check frequently to determine if the heater plug or cord, wall outlet, or faceplate is HOT! If the plug, outlet, or faceplate is hot, discontinue use of the heater, and have a qualified electrician check and/or replace the plug or faulty wall outlet(s). If the cord is hot, disconnect the heater, and have it inspected/repaired by an authorized repair person.  http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/Safety%20Education/Home-Appliances-Maintenance-Structure/098.pdf   You cannot Google what's inside your house. I have a friend whose house burned down from an electrical fire. The "story" is not implausible at all. Space heaters are notorious. But you want to Google? I Googled. First result: Space heaters involved in 79 percent of fatal home heating fires.  http://www.nfpa.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/space-heaters-involved-in-79-percent-of-fatal-home-heating-fires   It's worth getting a professional opinion instead of risking burning down your house.   How could doctors be utilized? The government can regulate doctors but they can't give them money and tell them to give the money to patients who've lost weight.     The government can control what businesses do. They cannot simply offer people money for weight loss -- there's no mechanism for it.    You can get out of the rut, if you just... do it.   This is not a shoe advertisement. The trick, I'm now convinced, is to just go ahead and do it, whether you feel like it or not. Because you know what? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT.   Pick something you've always wished you could do.   That's great, but I have a friend who's depressed. There is nothing she's always wished she could do. She literally has no interests aside from reading and watching TV.   That's a good idea, but they have to be careful: My friend was told by an electrician that the outlet in her bathroom was not strong enough for a space heater.    So mark this thread Explained.   Because colors have cultural and personal associations so we gravitate toward colors that we feel have meaning for us.   While what the other comments say isn't wrong, this is a students' show and putting the craziest designs first is the equivalent of clickbait.    Those first two examples are not their natural skin color.    I think in Europe they must use the word tower in a different way than we do in a America. That's not a tower, it's a building. The English definition of a tower is a tall structure that's taller than it is wide, usually by a lot. That flak tower is fairly short and squat.   A little late to this party but from searching, over in /r/books about four months ago a lot of people expressed this opinion, but more recently if you say you didn't like it you get crucified.   I agree with everything you said except for the bit about Hugo Lamb. I didn't find any of it compelling. I basically had to force myself to read it, not because the writing was bad or boring per se but because there was literally no character that was of any interest or any storyline that I cared to find out how it was resolved.  The sum of my feelings is that it was a poorly-stitched Franken-novel.    I don't understand the "bus stops" data. There are a ton more bus stops than this showing.   And yet it has everything to do with it. The current scope and incarnation of Chareidi society wouldn't exist today if the Holocaust hadn't happened.   From what I've read, even on the surface it's not entirely consensual.       More often used for Shavuot.       And some people don't do anything special with their hands aside from holding a prayer book.   While Reddit is full of aggrieved MRA's. Natural enemies.   It's by using new ingredients or in different combinations. While they will all get your hair equally clean, they will interact with different types of hair differently. It is more obvious if you have long hair than if you have short hair. So some will make your hair smoother while other will have an impact on the volume, for example.   Could be dehydration, which is why they always recommend drinking a lot of water the day before donating blood.   It is unlikely that your wife's veins are collapsing unless she's a long-term intravenous drug abuser.    Movies can be sued for having the exact same name too. That's why Lee Daniels' The Butler isn't just called The Butler.    Blocks, Lego and the like. Little people/dolls/action figures. Pretend store, kitchen, school(!). Reading. Trampoline. Cars. Arts and crafts. Board games.    Have you ever been sexually assaulted? Honest question, not being a twat here.  I've been bullied and my biggest "win" came through words. And it took me a long time to get there because for too much of my life I was also given the advice to just ignore bullies.   People sometimes think they will react in a certain way, and when the time comes, it somehow isn't how it goes.  This isn't a case of being cornered in a dark alley and feeling panicked. The girl had enough presence of mind to speak up the first time, she just needs the lesson reinforced that just because an authority figure says something doesn't mean they're always right and doesn't mean you have to listen.    Said to the teacher, "No, I cannot and will not ignore it and if you don't take appropriate action, I'm going to the principal's office to report both the student and you."  In other words, be assertive, not aggressive.    What makes you think rock is bigger than pop in Japan?    Aside from what's been said, people tended to go to sleep earlier.   "Early to bed and early to rise, etc."   I edited. It's not under 18, it's under 21.   After years of snapping up credit cards with ease, the Credit CARD Act of 2009 will make it much more difficult for anyone under the age of 21 to qualify for a credit card.  Under the new law, which takes effect in February 2010, no one under the age of 21 will be approved for a credit card offer unless a parent or guardian or spouse is willing to co-sign, or the young adult shows proof of sufficient income to cover the credit obligation.  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/under-21-credit-cards-hard-to-get-1.aspx    The early books are excellent, the more recent books are not bad.   Watched about 15 minutes of the TV show, didn't seem true to the books at all. But who knows, it might be a good show if you haven't read the books.   Most credit cards require a co-signer for anybody under ~~18~~ 21, so I don't understand how this is a problem. Don't co-sign for him.    Why do we get so upset at the "gawkers" that slow down to 10 mph to look at a fender bender and cause miles of creeping, but yet when we get to the accident we still slow down and check it out?  That's a classic case of hypocrisy. "Do as I say, not as I do." Either stop slowing down or stop complaining about other people doing it.   its all about personal experience during development  It's not. It's also to do with genetics. There are plenty of people who were abused as children and are still brave and/or thrill-seeking. In fact, sometimes people who were abused are more likely to be thrill-seekers than people who weren't.   For a heterosexual man in prsion, how can homosexual rape be a pleasurable substitution to masturbation?  The same way that sticking your dick in a pie or a fleshlight is. A hole is a hole. It doesn't particularly matter what it's attached to when you're desperate.  If it's to show dominance, what's wrong with just beating the crap out of the guy?  Because men are much more terrified of being raped than being beaten.   /r/titlegore   Elon Musk got his money from PayPal, not from inventing a product that society actually needs.    While we've explored .00000000000001% of the universe. Maybe there should be more zeroes in there.  There isn't remotely any "such" emphasis on space exploration anymore. In the olden days the space race was a proxy for the Cold War.   Henry Cavill? Or that other guy that looks like Henry Cavill but is supposedly somebody else.    At least in academia it is absolutely possible to plagiarize yourself. I haven't seen it mentioned regarding fiction but that's probably because you're not going to sue yourself for plagiarism and neither will your audience.  But either way, like you said, reusing the same themes, characters, etc., is very common. Though if the author reuses them to extent that they run out of anything new to say about them, I consider that literary cannibalism.    I read a handful of books in 8th/9th grade that had a huge impact on me though I'm not sure I'd go so far as saying they changed my life. Haven't felt that way about a book since and I've long since graduated high school.   It's why in the past in China long fingernails were seen as a sign of nobility.  Exactly. Noble women didn't have to keep house any more than their husbands had to farm.   Lolita. Turned my stomach and had to stop reading it.   It's just boring.    Talk about yourself, your interests, your studies, your job, funny things your friends have said, books, movies, music, the weather, flowers, the Internet, clothing, pets, your family, exercise, diet, art, politics, religion............  I mean, there are a million and one things to talk about. But honestly, this is not a real relationship, so you shouldn't sweat it so much. I have an Internet friend of like 10 years already and we've never met and we don't talk very often, but he is somebody that I'm glad to "know" and I leave it on that level.   If his depression is specific to his job, you need to sit him down, figure out what the problem with his job is and how he can fix it, even if it means going to his boss or HR and asking for some kind of special accommodations. But if the job is just another symptom, then he is genuinely depressed and needs professional help.   Your grandmother sounds like she's very lonely. Maybe make an effort to spend some quality time with her every day (at your convenience, not hers) and then hopefully she'll back off with the comments.   There is no right way.   I'm a fan of the Five Love Languages theory. One of the ways of showing love is gift giving. But either you feel uncomfortable about receiving gifts for some reason or it's simply not something that makes you feel loved.   To a certain extent, this is an intractable problem. If the two of you stay together, one of you has to change. If he does other things that make you feel loved, then I recommend it be you. Otherwise, it should be him because there's no sense in having a boyfriend who you don't feel loves you.   Valentine's Day has a historical foundation too. It wasn't "just sort of created" any more than Christmas was. You get Christians saying that Christmas has been become too commodified, so they can try to "take back" Valentine's Day if they want, too.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine   And women did physical work like cooking, sewing and child rearing, where long hair and nails also get in the way, so this doesn't work at all as an explanation.    Not only the apostles. There were lots of followers that don't get any kind of NT mention. Jewish-Christians were integrated into Jewish society and there were litmus tests to see if people had adopted Christian beliefs.   That's later on. The Romans and whatnot weren't the original Christians.  	117
 I actually agree with this guy somewhat about the cards he says is bad. The build he posted is pretty good. But it would need some updating since that deck was pretty much built for a year ago.   Cyber Dragon Zwei sucks. You don't need it. 3 CD, 3 Core, and 3 drei is all I've ever needed as Cyber Dragons go. So remove the Zweis, the Jinzos, and whatever that last monster is at the end. You just don't need them.   Remind me again where I can get a build with Ridley added in!   If we never listened to music, we'd probably never have volume levels dawg.      "I'd just like to take a moment to say I shouldn't be on the jury because I'm sleeping with the defendant, Drew Carey."   "Introducing Tyler Perry's..." *rips up paper* "Let's be honest. It doesn't matter what we put here. It's gonna suck."   If it was a dragon, then it'd be easy to integrate. But one deck having better use for red-eyes because it's a dragon type doesn't automatically mean red-eyes would be an inherently worse card. In fact, Dragon Rulers with Red-eyes would be even worse than a dragon-ruler deck without red-eyes. You know, when you're actually building it with the purpose of trying to build the strongest deck possible.  Quite frankly, your point is invalid since Dragon Rulers wouldn't want red-eyes in their deck anyway.    The whole reason I didn't get MM3D is because my N64 copy still works fine  So does mine. But I still got MM3D. The new game is amazing. The bosses were revamped, there are two new fishing holes, and a few items were changed around. Also, there are 7 bottles, improved design choices, and more often than not, we got what is in the Japanese N64 version instead of the USA N64 version.   Because Evolve claimed to be so much more than it was, costs $60 to play a game developed for freemium format, and has over $200 in DLC AFTER you buy the game.   I probably would. There would probably be a lot of decks that would benefit from something like this. Plus, it would obsolete all normal monsters with 5 or more stars with less than that much attack. I.E. Red-eyes Black Dragon.   "Do you know why I pulled you over?"   Replace the marketing team with one that will focus toward avid gamers in the making sure people know the Wii U is not just a tablet or accessory.  Make the Wii U Gamecube adapter and bundles available on our site with a strict 1 per household limit. I would do the same thing with Amiibo and other hard to get items.   Cinderella 2 and 3. Little Mermaid 2 and 3.   Could they fucking not?   "It was then, when Drew Carey realized his best friend was indeed regrowing his hair back, he knew he was in a world like no other. A world like, the twilight zone."   Actually, all you need is an Internet connection.   It's funny. I've accidentally unplugged the cable box in the living room a few days ago. I've been thriving on Netflix without a care in the world.   "Just so you know, I've never done it with a girl before."   http://www.ebay.com/itm/WII-U-GAMECUBE-CONTROLLER-ADAPTER-FOR-SUPER-SMASH-BROS-/251866615186?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item3aa46b8d92  This one in particular is the one my girlfriend has.   There are people who already pay $10,000 for a regular watch with the same amount of gold.   Do you need a 3rd party adapter to test with? I'll totally send you one if that's the case.   Will this work with off-brand adapters in the near future?   So... if this was able to support the off-brand 3rd party ones, the ones that try to look like the official one, that would be great. I tried just to see if it would work with my girlfriend's adapter. (Her parents did the buying, which was a stupid decision since they don't have a fucking clue when it comes to electronics.)   Said the person resorting to insults.  I'd really like to see anybody here complaining about the size make the same OS with all the same 1:1 features and have it be significantly smaller than what iOS right now. Really, if they can do it, go ahead. I know I can't do it, but if I really wanted to complain, it would be to Apple's feedback page, not to strangers on a place where insulting me gets you nowhere, points don't matter, and nothing productive gets done.  iOS 9 is rumored to be a stability and slimming down of the operating system, so let's hope that's true. If the code really is sloppy, maybe a huge stability update will deal with it.  In the mean time, you can stop trying to prove that you're intelligent to people don't fucking know or care about you.   I wouldn't say this set is that good. It's mostly fox doing the same old same old fox stuff on a Lucario that sort of gets a decent string every now and then. (I'll admit, better strings than I could pull off on Lucario, but not the best strings I've seen.)  Very last game was a bit intense, but outside of that, nothing I found too extraordinary.   Might want to work on the UI. Maybe it makes sense when you touch things and get the hang of things, but right now, just at a glimpse, it doesn't make sense.  The one I'm using right now on iOS, [MLP CCG Assistant](http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/dd/be/e7/ddbee787-03d0-db4a-6fb2-0a3d28d992a2/screen406x722.jpeg) takes care of both players. It's clear, it's concise, and there was no confusion in learning how to use it. And starting a turn even gives the turn player the proper amount of AT depending on the winning player's score.   "Honey, please, I'm in the middle of teaching Sex Ed."   Combine a lot of megabytes, you get a gigabyte. That's kind of how it works. There's a virtually uncountable list of features in a lot of these operating systems. We're getting to the point that anything you can do on a computer, you can do on your phone. So why do we expect the OS to be smaller just because it's on a smaller form factor? That's completely absurd.  And operating system is an operating system. And they are all just tools to move files and manage/use applications. In that respect, Windows and OS X are just the same with different skins. Well, each with their own unique file handling/productivity enhancing features, but that's beside the point. So how do you assume I don't know shit if I'm comparing operating systems? Check the fucking mirror.   Long story short: My girlfriend attempted suicide. I found a cipher online that convinced me I could reach her by posting my message publicly and having someone decipher it. I attempt suicide shortly after. My sister goes through something similar. We land on the local small town news. Other suicides around town follow shortly after. I go to console one of the families and see the cipher in a painting on the wall. I want to take it away, but the deceased's mother wanted to keep it because it was the last painting he did.  So now I'm here, writing what will be my final warning to you.  The mother that held on to her sons painting posted on one of her social media accounts yesterday. She committed suicide shortly after. This is what her post contained.   Nz Tup, O'n dunoph vu tii zua.   Vjiz xupv cimoiwi ni, cav O lpux Omm tii zua. atv ci qevoipv. Zuas qeopvoph nelit ni nott zua nusi epf nusi. Xjev ot ov Ovt tu cieavogam. Omm etl zua eheop xjip O hiv vjisi.   Tov vohjv txiivjiesv.  I put it through a reverse cipher thanks to a few online tools. Here is what it actually said.   My Son, I'm coming to see you.   They wont believe me, but I know Ill see you. Just be patient. Your painting makes me miss you more and more. What is it? Its so beautiful. Ill ask you again when I get there.   Sit tight sweetheart.  When I visited the house, I passed myself off as family just to see the inside. An investigator told me that she had bashed her own head against the painting her son had made. When a shard flew off, she picked it up and jammed it in her throat.  No sign of forced entry or struggle. A suicide by anybody's analysis. I couldn't believe it. But, I fucking knew it. This is how suicide spreads. A fucking demon gets into our head and makes us believe that we can reach that person again. It's a siren's song.  Dont seek the suicide cipher.   Guys, there are rich bastards out there already spending this amount of money on watches and jewelry that don't do anything.  You don't have to spend 10k on it. You don't have to buy it at all. But if you really want one, they'll be as low as $350. So really, people, stop losing your shit over something you don't actually care about.   Because there are apps included with the OS and features that become universal such as copy/paste, typing, highlighting, showing the time and status bar. That's like asking why is OSX or Windows 7 so huge when it's just a finder to get to applications.   I suppose there should also be lawsuits about storage devices promising a certain amount, and you figure out that what you got is actually only 98% of the advertised amount.  No, really. I'm tired of people complaining that their 8 GB drive doesn't hold their 7.5 GB file because there's actually only 6.9 GB on the drive. My 500 GB hard drive doesn't even have 500GB. It's actually around 490 GB. It's frustrating.  In case these companies haven't heard, a Gigabyte is 1024 Megabytes, not 1000.   I do agree that active members alone won't solve any problems by itself. It does take a step in the right direction with the right kind of activity. We could have 1,000 members posting here every day, but if only 1 is submitting good content, and nobody is voting on what's good and what's bad, we're just going to continue getting swarms of bad content. This place becomes a mine field with the occasional treasure that takes too much effort to search for.  I personally like your idea of getting the posters involved in submitting vines they make and using this place to promote their page. Why isn't this a real thing yet?  Submit your ideas in a mod message, and we'll start discussing them.  Thank you.      Clipping a shuffle onto your clothes isn't really wearing an iPod.   Hook should be AXNextFrame. Not Vbi.   Hazy Problem Fixer  Spell Card   This card cannot be destroyed, banished or removed from the field by any other card's effect. On your opponent's 3rd end phase after this card was activated, send this card to the Graveyard. Once per turn; you can Special Summon 1 "Hazy Flame" monster from your deck. If there is a "Hazy Flame" monster in your graveyard during your draw phase, you can add it to your hand in addition to your normal draw.  Hazy Flame monsters take way too much to get their power plays which can be stopped or undone quickly, so they need to be able to regenerate advantage, make plays without using too many hand resources, and they need to be able to get cards out on the field. Not to mention, it sucks that Hazy Pillar is stupid weak to removal making Hazy Flames weak to that.    Do people even realizes there are watches that do nothing but tell time and still cost more than this?   "Wait, how long did Rosie Odonal eat nothing but bacon?"

Just hold your finger or thumb down on the image. You'll see a green bar filling up on the top. When you take your thumb off, it pauses the recording.   If you use chrome, you can use Vine Client. A link to the extension is in the sidebar.   Then why don't you do a bit of help and actually report spam? As a new mod, I'll be on from time to time to make sure any shit that isn't actually vine related is removed. And we're not trying to be all funny vines. We are trying to promote all areas of vine.   I hope you and more people start a habit of regular voting. It's the only way to make sure we're on a path of improving the content for everybody.

As long as ANYTHING THEIR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO ACCESS IS TRANSFERRED AT THE SAME SPEED.  What a fucking moron.   This post was removed since it wasn't a vine or a youtube compilation of vines.  * Vines are 6 seconds or less. * The content was far longer than 6 seconds * The content was not compilations of 6 second videos   The mods here have been disappointed in the lack of voting in this subreddit. This sub has more than 10,000 subscribers. Almost 11,000. Vine is a very popular trend right now even with its changing nature and that it's two year run already settling its place in social media.  The fact is, some of out top posts aren't even garnering the amount of upvotes that some subreddits get with fewer subscribers. Far fewer subscribers. Let me give you some examples.  [Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/vine/comments/2y4qi6/7_days_in_6_seconds/): This is a very well made vine. Not to mention a perfect loop which is a difficult trick in vine. This is the kind of think I would give a like. Maybe not revine since I only revine specific vines, but that's beside the point.  18 points, 83% upvotes. That means there's at most 22 votes on it.  [Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/vine/comments/2y2com/checking_your_bank_statement_after_a_night_out/): This vine has a theme that does rely on reading the caption or description, but luckily that is put into the vine itself instead of assuming you would read it. This makes it good to put in compilations since youtube compilations rarely put the information of a vine. Definitely something I find funny and gave an upvote. But...  25 points, 80% upvotes. That means there's at most 31 votes on it.  ---  This is pitiful. Are there really less than 40 users here willing to upvote and downvote? Don't be afraid to downvote things you don't find entertaining. Or things that are just distasteful. We're not telling you to upvote everything. But with 10,868 (at the time I'm writing this) readers, we should be able to get a few hundred votes on each one. But we're averaging less than .003% of our userbase actively participating.  Things you should upvote:  * Vines you like * Vines with themes you want to see more of * Vines that are funny * Vines with creativity * Vines that show talent * Good YouTube compilations * Text posts about vine or asking for help  Things you should downvote:  * Vines that aren't funny, creative or show off talent * Vines that are offensive or distasteful * Troll vines * NSFW vines * YouTube posts that don't credit viners * Things that aren't vine  DO NOT...  * Downvote Youtube compilations unless they are poor or don't give credit * Downvote vines just because you don't like the user * Mass downvote every post just to troll  ---  Please be more active. We could make this a great and fun subreddit to visit. And we wouldn't mind getting some of these posts on the front page. We're not expecting you to make us a default sub. As cool as that would be, that's a bit too much pressure and really only goes to top quality subreddits. We aren't there yet. We're nowhere near being on the same level of many other subreddits.  So if we just all make a habit of visiting /r/vine and upvoting a few posts that we like and downvoting a few that we don't, we can improve the quality of our posts and userbase. Once a week, it's easy, and it takes only a few minutes and you'll find content more enjoyable as you go along. After all, that would mean you're actually voting on the content.   They go to download then they're done. Torrents are p2p, aren't they? Why would they need to go through a server?   Whether you're the top or not, you need your servers up. Don't see how being top would magically strain it.   How many STDs did I get from my cheating ex-girlfriend?... Oh, shit!   [Here's a link to what I previously talked about](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2xp7fc/survivors_guilt/)  Like I said, more suicide attempts started surfacing in my town after my sister and I both had attempted. In such a small town, it was big news. But I wasn't prepared for this. Remember that cipher I found that made me think I could reach my ex-girlfriend? In case you don't, you can [read about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/). In other words, we'll get to that.  I looked at the house of one of the families. After my sister and I attempted suicide, three successful suicides happened nearby. Almost too spooky to be coincidence. Government has called to tell news stations to stop broadcasting. They think its encouraging suicides.  But, I know suicide is not a way to get attention. What good is attention when youre dead? Seek help, dont seek the cipher.  I found a cipher to try to talk to my ex-girlfriend who had killed herself after three weeks of our long-distance relationship. After I stopped thinking about suicide, I couldnt see the cipher anymore.  On the wall of one of the houses, though, the cipher hung from a frame. The parents of the deceased put it on the wall as a memorial. He was a painter, apparently. Something I would have never known if none of this had happened. I asked if I could see it. I wanted to sneak it away from them so they wouldnt look at it. They kept such a close eye on it since it was the last painting the deceased had painted.  Maybe it wont have adverse effects though. There's no instructions, and it looked like it was painted from memory. It was barely close enough to be recognizable.  Im stuck just waiting and hoping that nothing happens. Regardless, I'm continuing my therapy. These posts and my therapy talks help me take that wreched image away from my consciene.   "Alright, PUSH Mrs. Johnson."   I love watching both HC and Markiplier. Mark's very funny and has fun commentary more often than not. And it's mesmerizing to see HC simply not give a fuck. Seriously, he may jump or pull back every now and then (and that's *not* a joke for the internet to enjoy), but this guy just doesn't get scared.   So was I. But then something completely different showed up at my door.   He is just one guy who makes the games in a matter of months. While we may think of a while as a few months in the game industry as we're used to waiting years between certain games, He's able to write out a new scenario, new mechanics, and work them out in a matter of months. So he may have taken a few weeks out of his life to chill. But since he has the basics of the engine down, he can make it much faster than it took him to make the first one.   This game definitely requires a bit of luck on top of knowing what you're doing. And figuring out what you're doing is difficult. I'm still having trouble getting past night 3.   He's  UX expert. Not a videographer.   "Next... Oh, Mr. Beiber. Good thing for you killing teen pop isn't technically a sin."   "WHO WANTS TO MEET AN UNDERCOVER AGENT?"   Dear Drew Carey...

"GET OFF THE STATE KENYE"      My girlfriend was browsing random subreddits. She stumbled upon this subreddit and let out the biggest squeal because she knows how much I love Whose Line Is It Anyway.   I cant warn you enough that if you do feel the need or desire to end your life, stay away from those thoughts. Surround yourself by those around you. They definitely care. And if you fail an attempt at suicide like my sister or me, you would probably know that you never feel more loved until after youve accepted that youre still alive.  My theraputic rant aside, there seems to have been three suicides in neighboring cities.  In this context, you're likely going to think I'm crazy, but I'm considering everything I've been through.   * *[First Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/)* * *[Second Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/)* * *[Third Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2w37oa/i_made_the_news/)* * *[Forth Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2wkgih/my_little_sister_is_in_the_hospital/)*  The shorter version is that I had a girlfriend who committed suicide. I put a ciphered message to her online hoping to get the message to her in purgatory. Thoughts of the cipher drove me to thinking I could be with her again if I committed suicide. My sister went through the same thing with one of her closest friends and attempted suicide shortly after I did. The pandemic is making the news. There are have been more suicides.  Theyre not releasing any names or locations, but I wanted to let people know that now is the time to let everyone know that you love them.   Im hoping the suicides and attempts stop. I feel responsible. Since I made the local news and got so much attention, it has probably put the idea into a lot of others heads. They all have one other thing in common: these people supposedly all lost someone to suicide in recent days. The news has been calling me asking me to speek out, but Im not sure if that would yeild any success. I might anyway since Im already speaking out against it here.  I am going to visit the families over the weekend. Or maybe just in the next few days. Its not final, but I hope to find something that shows that it wasnt me. Hopefully, the investigators didnt take away absolutely everything.  Wish me luck. Oh, who am I kidding? What am I possibly going to find?  Nothing but guilt.   Wasn't aware I was down voted. People can hate all they want. Doesn't mean I'm wrong.   Figured this out long ago. I bet a lot of us did. Nevertheless, congratulations on that find. Not many people would find something like that on their own. A bit of an oversight by the dev team originally. But whatever. I guess it was there for those who were a bit smarter than others.  On the whole climb up, assuming bomb hovering isn't your thing (or you're on the 3DS version), you can actually [climb the stone tower playing the elegy of emptiness as few as 4 times](http://youtu.be/spBCTSy0Ddo?t=1h43m).   To post something like that on something as public as vine or reddit is just distasteful.   So you basically want people to hate you for stuff that auto plays and makes noise on the Internet? It's generally frowned upon, even if it's not an ad, so have anything with sound embedded to auto play unless it's the main content of the page like a YouTube video.   "I'm so glad I practiced on my brother yesterday."   I wish I could remove this just for being distasteful. As much as I want to, it technically doesn't break any rules.   "Blame my girlfriend. She never finishes anything for me."   "I'm sorry sis, but when you don't open your legs, something's gotta give."   "HELP ME"   "Hi I'm Drew Carey, and *this* is how you perform a vasectomy."   "I've been doing better ever since I stopped putting my fingers in."   "OH I don't want her you can hav'er  She's too fat for me.  She's to fat for me.  Much too fat for me.  OOHH..."

I'm afraid I'm too high level and no elite's ever spawn, so nothing ever drops.      How do you keep from getting too specific?   How many other people work in your css?   I like the idea of less abstract, general, presentational naming conventions.  Why does that work better for you?   How accurate is your aim? How much time is spent refactoring names like .tall_box into .front_page_call_to_action into .cta   Why would I want to display an old CTA that I'm replacing?   So in a case where content remains the same but the presentation to the user changes.   How would your naming change if it was the presentation that remained the same but the content changed?  So for example:  On a portrait phone the container is 100% of the viewport's width and height and an image is displayed.   On a landscape phone the same container is 100% of the viewport and a different image is displayed.    How do you keep your class names from getting too crazy in BEM?   What happens if the purpose changes?   Why are higher levels of abstraction better ("content" instead of "box" in your example)?   How important is semantics and why?      That's too bad :( Best of luck in whatever decision you make. Contract fun can be very rewarding!

Thanks this really helps I know an important part of he mesmerized in groups is reflects, thank you.    Thanks I'll go have a look.   That's an axe in his other hand, no idea who he is.   Thanks but I'm looking for more mesmer specific tips, not my first level 80 but thank you anyway :-)   Just hit 80 on my mesmer just looking for any general tips for dungeons, I've read the pve sticky on the gw2 forum, but any tips that are not well known that may help?   That makes it okay then she is registered with the NHS thank you I'll let her know today about it, yeah I've told her that myself, her mother especially though is very strict on these matters though, but like you said she wouldn't let her daughter suffer over it.   Yeah I know but neither of us have had any other sexual partners, so I'm not completely convinced either way STD or not she needs to get it checked and treated, just trying to find the right place to do that.   I didn't say it would be a bad idea just as she hasn't lived here long she doesn't have a personal doctor to go to, otherwise that would be our first option.   This does cost money though right as I checked the website it's pretty pricey, neither of us really have the money at the moment to be paying for treatments and tests and such, I'm going to have to try and convince her to see someone when she's home in Greece she's just scared of her parents knowing about it and would like to get tests and treatment before she leaves (Which I don't really think is possible given she's leaving Friday) but thank you for the suggestion, I will give it thought I don't want her problem to get worse because she's embarrassed.   I know that but i'm still confused by this, not sure how i can i apply this knowledge to work out how many more electrons than protons it has?   Thank you i found the equation for it earlier can't remember it off the top of my head   My girlfriend has found some small lumps on her vagina, she said it's itchy, and painful and she said it burns when she pees, not sure what it is, she's a student here in the UK and doesn't have a doctor to go to, also she's going back to Greece this friday, she wants to get checked as soon as possible, does anyone know where she can go to get this done for FREE? Really need your help reddit :-( She's in sheffield if that helps. (Not sure if this is the right sub for this direct me if i'm wrong)  Edit: Okay guys sorry i seem to have found a place we can go to, sorry to bother you /r/sex !  But just in case any suggestions would be nice as we will have to make an appointment and not sure when she will be able to get checked, do you guys know of any walk in centres?   also if anyone can help with this too If a heater uses 17kJ of energy in 5.2s, what power is it?    If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? Not sure how to work this one out.   Ah thank you so much the anwser is 2 it's simpler than i thought!   If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? I'm not sure how to go about working this out? Any help would be appreciated! Sorry if this seems easy to you guys.

You saved a couple that would have likely drowned were it not for your courage. Not many others might have succeeded as you did in such a dangerous situation. Personally I think the couple should contact the Governor General to suggest you be nominated for an award. You certainly deserve it.      uhm...boss...exactly how many eggs did our customer order again?   Well...it was obviously drunk when it froze.

They simply just have to ask for collection during a mass.   Amen!   Obviously the key to a great relationship.      RIP to your dear friend...OP.   He has improved a lot...it's dangerous.   I think it's their way of filtering who is desperate and flip it around and expose those first.  	165
 It's whatever they feel like in any given situation. They're basically covering their asses as much as possible with these "regulations".   **PLEASE READ**   nbsp;  Please don't give this game any more promotion. They are already trying to sell us exclusive DLC which gives paying players an edge in battle with extra weapons and equipment. We as a community have to stop promoting such bullshit practices by developers because if we don't no one will.    Source: http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront/buy   Thanks for your time.

I hooked up my N64 a few days ago and after about 30 mins of removing and inserting the cartridge I said "fuck it I'm I'm doing this old school" even though I read it was bad for game and console. Guess what, it worked instantly. It's like magic.   I got my N64 out a few days ago and was for a while trying to get to work. the only way it worked was after a good blowjob to the game and console.   It took me way too long to realise, I'm done for today.    ..no reason to praise them for something so small   A small gesture can go a long way, especially in today's money grabbing environment.    Their wrestling games were the best ever. These new ones reallyyyyyy suck.   Nah man you guys are missing out! The bananas is where it's at!      Wait, what? no split screen?? That's kind of killed the hype for me. My favourite part is completing the story with friends. Normally hook up 2 xbox's together so we can have half a screen each.

Not what you are asking but my most recent and surprising glitch was in Witcher 3. **SPOILERS AHEAD** It's when you are travelling through worlds with Avallach [Ciris elf friend, not sure how to pronounce his name] and come across the world with the deadly gas.

There was something extremely alluring about him.     What this guy said!!   [It happened again](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/screenshot/55ce1842-0dcc-4ca7-82ad-8068d73b6d13?gamerTag=kiwi1990 scid=de360100-3ae5-4fd5-a7da-9d3d6b481c3d), I just wanted to play some gwent man.   HAHA! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SEOR POOPY PANTS!!    ..and most don't have beards!   Yeah the main story line in Skellieg was a bit of a let down. I went over on way too high of a level, did a couple of main quests and was already being told to got back to Novigrad.   The outcome is not the same. My play went off without a hitch, people applauded and I bowed like a boss.    I just mash the jump button when he is in the air.   I just walked away like a Boss. That sack of flour is mine now bitch!   P^s^^s^^^s^^^^t, ^^^^^it's ^^^^^a ^^^^^she. ^^^^^I ^^^^^made ^^^^^the ^^^^^same ^^^^^mistake ^^^^^and ^^^^^got ^^^^^crucified.   Definitely got the moves like Jagger.         Just because something looks like it may be a threat does not give the officer the right to murder a civilian. The police have to completely change their manner of conduct to keep in par with the military style of policing that they seem to love so much. Before a single shot is fired you must confirm that the "enemy" is armed and dangerous. A good way of doing this would be making an officer confirm with his partner before opening fire. Instead of just thinking he's a gun totting bad ass sheriff saving the town.   This is my theory. A lot of these cops are pussy's. They are constantly scared and will react to **anything** they think has a slight possibility of endangering their lives.    "OMG he's turning around, he *might* have a gun!"   Another thing I never understood is why carry real ammunition if your main objective is to arrest a suspect. Rubber bullets will stop a man in his tracks and guess what, they don't kill.   If he's not Homeless RCMPolice then who is?    I think you meant Cervezaa!!   If it were to have the actual PC components built into the keyboard then I would be amazed. This is just stupid.   Ayyy lmao.   I'm not from the states so I had no idea it was supposed to be a mocking jay, I've always seen a man doing the Hussain Bolt but now that you mention it, yes, it definitely is Johnny.   spend less than you make   Is this not common knowledge in America?   If you have a decent PC to begin with.    I've been a PC gamer for 5 years now, in that time I've gone through 3000 worth of hardware. Why? It's my hobby, I like doing it. Do you need a 3000 PC to play games? No. No you don't.   nbsp;  And this is exactly what I mean, you will end up wasting more money than if you had bought a console. Yes I know he claims it is his hobby **but** that is exactly what it becomes for everyone and that my friend is where the money goes, you will end up upgrading parts and spending a lot of money.    I agree about the prices for games and subscriptions, they can be a bit outlandish but I'm happy to pay it if it makes gaming a simple and enjoyable experience. Also don't get me wrong either I have nothing against PC gaming, to each his own. What gets me is when people claim PC gaming to be cheaper than console (strictly talking about the rig). I paid 350 for my console and that will last me for the next 5 years or so. I highly doubt you can build a PC for that price which will play all the games that come out in the near future without having to upgrade a few components. I just don't see how it can be cheaper apart from game deals and subscriptions.   Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles.   I wanted to take my finger off but I just couldn't.   Care to explain how this simply is not true? And don't give me a list of cheap parts that barely get the job done.   It's gotten to the point where I really don't care any more, nothing is ever going to change. The rich will continue to get richer whilst stealing from the poor. It has been happening for millenniums and it sure as hell is not going to stop now. This is the world we live in.   We know it was actual game play, that's why it looks crap. CGi trailer would've been better IMO.   So play it with the camera panned out is what you're saying? You cannot defend the graphics in the trailer, they are crap. Only reason you would do so is because you're a fan boy. This would have been any other game and the trailer would've gotten Rekt, but since it's a Bethseda game, let the Reddit circle jerk commence.   Reading that has fucked with my eyes.   It is, I haven't played a game that took me this long to complete the main story line in very long while. I was obviously doing some fucking around but most of the time I was questing. Just finished the main quests yesterday and I still have a good few days of content left if not more.   ...except a huge hole in my wallet where my money used to be.   Don't know why these fan boys are down voting you. I've never played Fall Out so I can't say much about the series. But I can comment on the trailer I saw and it was just meh. The visuals are crap to say the least and this is a trailer, which will always looks better than the actual game.    Buy a console, problem solved.   Buy a console. You'll save money in the long run.   I found him!   See Obama?? Go up until you reach the few last rows of seats near the top then a few columns to the left. The guy in white sitting in front of the woman in white, he is clearly not form our time.   French. Can't stand it, even in their accent you can tell the entire nation is stuck up it's own butthole.   ...and this is why I don't buy digital, can't trust it. No internet, no game.   This and the ability to deselect quests so I don't have to remove it entirely from the HUD.   Oh well I ended up just leaving it locked. I'm guessing either the devs forgot **or** it may be a treasure hunt quest and the key is elsewhere.      Ok so I'm in the Elven Ruins collecting the Sunstone. I have obviously had a good look around and picked up a tonne of loot. I have opened all chests, except one which of course is locked. I have searched everywhere, been doing so for a good while now but no luck in finding the god damn key.   nbsp;  It is the chest in the room with the door [The only room with a door in the entire elven ruins] and also had two ghosts protecting it, but none had the key. Does anybody know where this key is??   Not going to uni, I'm 24 now and feel like I will never get that "going away and discovering myself" stage of my life.   Any body else read that in a Mexican accent??   ...and to top it off it's a repost. Scum Bag OP.   Some one call the facts police cause /u/Lawnsrevenge just got checked!   Disney basically paved the way once Walt died.   Hey OP I have an idea for the inventory if you would like to add it in. Drop Down lists like used in the Bestiary and Alchemy tabs. They could still keep the same format as now (i.e weapons and armour, usable items etc) but just add subsections (i.e Oils, bombs, potions etc). That's my two cents, nice list hope they see it!   might be a bit late but be careful though they might not stay forever.   Thanks!, I'll test it with a few misc items and see how it goes.   I'm at work now but I'm pretty sure it's that one. The description says something along the lines of "Gerlat found this letter as soon as he arrived in White Orchard and proceeded to read it". You may be right by saying it's bugged because i know for a fact the I have raped White Orchard. There is nothing left to do there except this quest (and I hate leaving quests in my quest tab).   It's like asking how many bowls of your favourite cereal you've had in your life.   No fucking way, did you record me playing?? I did this exact thing yesterday whilst on this exact quest.   I'm with you on this. Now I'm going to be extra vigilant for loading screens just because they promised.   does it stay there indefinitely though?? Cause if so I'm going to find myself a nice little abandoned house or cave to use as my stash house.   Ok so I have a treasure hunt which you receive in White Orchard. I never read the letter as I was new to the game and had no idea what I was doing. Now I'm nearing the end and have this treasure quest I cannot complete because I must first read a letter I found at the beginning of the game which I sold not knowing it was important and ofc I have no idea who I sold it too. So yea just keep them, they weigh 0.01 so there is not point in getting rid of them. Hopefully the will update the inventory menu and make a separate section for notes   books.  	111

 I see your humor by-pass is fully integrated   SteamOS   EA back to 'worst company ever' - it's a lock-in this year, definite Oscar.  But seriously, if they can't keep their software to its own sandbox and also **request** access to other HD areas, perhaps they've opened a whole new malware vector.  Caveat Emptor   Then there was that whole [hospital donation fiasco](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/garth-brooks-awarded-1-million-in-hospital-lawsuit/), which legally went his way - though you've got to wonder how he was commemorating his mother's memory with it.   Haven't read the book but apparently it doesn't really explain the disappearances either.  Nonetheless, I'm leaving the Leftovers until there's an opinion on the whole season.  Also never going to a movie that Lindelof has had anything to do with: Cowboys   Aliens, Prometheus, Into Darkness, World War Z. I'm surprised he gets writing offers.   I don't remember Malaria being a threat in Japan either.   Nobody, not even a Dubliner, should stay in Dublin for more than a fortnight at a time. If you do, the nonsense closes in around you, a bubble of regurgitated cant that smells of stale bullshit.  No, that's just you sweetie   There is no better way to guarantee that Climate Change is a real danger than have Rupert non-scientist Murdoch try to minimise it.  He's such a shameless shill.     Cheers for the info and bought a bottle today!!!  Didn't last too long in the fridge :)  All the best with it!   Her family?   As I understand it, this would have involved the BND clearly breaking the German constitution.   I guess that reveals the NSA's approach to such legal frameworks more than the German government's response to the offer.  edit: In fairness, /u/trot-trot your recent comment history looks like someone on auto-pilot or beyond frustration or replaced by a bot. Your points are going to be lost with such walls of text   links.    Sorry about the THE      If the NSA were as successful and useful as they claim they are, the Boston Marathon bombings would never have happened. The culprits would have been caught in flagrante as a show-of-strength and a public reminder of the NSA's value to the US. They were even given specific warnings about the brothers from Russian agencies.    When I remember the internet is ~20 years old, I reckon the NSA have all the info they need to blackmail any USA politician for life.  They must be able to de-rail the political campaigns of anyone they choose with simple innuendo, shame   embarrassment. They'd keep evidence of wrong-doing, if any, as a trump card.  So if someone wants to get into politics in the US without their say-so, they would have to avoid all interent   voice coms from the day they were able to use them until the end of a successful campaign - i.e. next to impossible.  Can we rename them the **N**osy **S**tealth **A**dministration now?   'driven by jedward'   Just tried his name via DuckDuckGo and there are plenty of links about it, couldn't see the Herald one admittedly.  This one is a toughie I reckon, I can see why maybe after 5 or 10 years - someone should be allowed to 'live things down' especially when there's no obvious 'public interest', the event isn't a continuing one or the people involved aren't politicians etc.  But it's just going to be so near-impossible, then the Streisand effect ...   It's hit   miss, but such a good place for a rest during Christmas shopping.   Tis only a mild detour though, then a quick rest in Grogan's on the way and they'll be nearly there :)   I want to hold them responsible for poisoning national conversations with bullshit   lies.  Then of course there's all the hacking they're currently in and out of court for.   This one, definitely this one - you can add the Stag's Head in too on Dame Court. It'll be on your way from Hogan's to McDaid's anyway.   True, I'm hoping the need for water might make this one special though.   Jesus Tapdancing Christ, can the government set up a commissioner to slap Phil Hogan every time he wants a glass of water!  And:  It was confirmed yesterday by Taoiseach Enda Kenny that Irish Water is to be taken out of the control of the Department of Environment, which is now run by Labour's Alan Kelly, and brought under the auspices of Michael Noonan's Department of Finance.  If Fine Gael think they'll survive privatising water, I'd like to see them try.      And he couldn't even cost the water charges for everyone before he left, after 3 years.  Am I right in thinking that he still has to be approved in the EU before he can take the post?  Oh, there will be a by-election too I suppose, or does he keep both?   "Any differences that we have are most effectively resolved through established **private channels**, not through the media"  Are there any left?   Citing an anonymous U.S. official  citing?   Such a happy looking lad that Patrick Coveney ;)   I'd like to know the reasoning / market-forces behind the Price of New Games in the EU region (Sterling prices too), my views:  * All main platforms are x86 based these days - I thought this would have helped reduce dev costs and so prices.  * Game assets are built high-res to ensure PC porting (if not already done on PC beforehand anyway)  * It's making me avoid release-day purchases as I can spend that 25 difference on many other games, and frankly other things in life, especially when I can't see a 25 improvement in next-gen games overall.  * It's not just a Sony thing, so apologies if this sounds targeted, but at the current prices I won't be getting release-day games anyway.  * The Second-Hand market is having a field-day with this, so I can't see how the current pricing is benefiting devs.  * Counter-point, games like Watch_Dogs are selling anyway - but I can't be in a small minority, so I reckon a 'market-starvation' effect will be short-lived and ultimately will back-fire.     And now they're calling for an inquiry into policing? What are they going to find?  Who do you mean GSOC, AGS or Prof. Scraton?

If anyone is wondering, Ming needs a reality check on climate change and he'll need to make it clear:  [Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Information  Brendan Howlin in regard to his recent statement that climate change deniers need to be swept aside, if he is aware that everyone accepts that the climate has been, is and always will be changing, though there are many, including eminent climatologists and scientists, who question whether that change is anthropological, or man-made; the way in which he will sweep these people aside; and if he will make a statement on the matter."](http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000062#N6)   Which seems to be a pity. I think it was on an old Vincent Brown that Elaine Byrne talked about tribunal costs - an alarming 500 million yet also recouped 1 billion.  I've tried to find a link, but can't.  Though I suppose the chances in this case of recouping money via a tribunal would be, at least politically, zero.   Ah, thanks for the clarification.  I guess we won't be getting a tribunal any time soon then.   Does this mean that the banking inquiry can go to the High Court to unseal those cabinet meetings?  Has there been a discussion about this already that I've missed?         If he wants to pontificate about getting 67 billion back, he has my blessings.   I'm not sure people are forgetting it, I think they're just ignoring it.   hehehe   Bloody hell, that link.  If only TDs were in such a rush for legislation that actually helped the whole country.   I'm not sure how accurate that is but it's nice to hear something about it mentioned in the EU.   I think the EU is going to suit Ming more than the Dil did.      I thought this was a joke piece when I saw the headlines.  Are TDs really going to spend political capital assuaging Garth Brooks   Aiken's greed?  There were both happy to go with 3 concerts at the outset and they still can.  If they don't want **their** original plan anymore, well too fucking bad for them.  And TDs saying this is damaging Ireland's reputation need to shut it, their abject fawning over a few concerts certainly is making us look like eejits.   I think tweeting the PS3 master key that geohot unearthed spelled the end of that relationship.   In conjunction with games being storable on an external hard-drive, could there be an additional hacking risk / vector in allowing this feature?  It's the first reason for cancelling it that popped into my head.   Into a 3v voucher is about the only thing I can think of, not exactly using the account online but nearish.   For added confusion here are two other articles on it that appear to contradict each other:  http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/govt-defeated-in-seanad-vote-on-free-gp-care-for-under-6s-635858.html  http://www.thejournal.ie/government-loses-another-seanad-vote-1562521-Jul2014/      And if Garth truly  "cannot begin to tell you how badly my heart is breaking right now   he'd be happy to play 3 rather than none.   Cheers!      Another thing that needs to change is the price tag in the EU, 75 (~$100) is too much for a new AAA.  I've gone from being a regular release-day buyer on the PS3 (where new games are 50 to 55) to a definite second-hand buyer on the PS4.  The games haven't suddenly become 25 better or more interesting, the reverse if anything.  So the lull in gaming for me will probably last till December, when I'll be able to buy games for a reasonable price.  So glad I went for Wolfenstein at 50 on release, rather than Watch Dogs at 75.      Surprising as that is, and rumour-mill notwithstanding, this:  Dr James Reilly as Foreign Affairs Minister  is gob-smacking.  He might still be have a ministry position!?   Don't forget to post to /r/marijuanaenthusiasts :)   I guess 'wistful nostalgia' isn't quite the same   Tigger   I'm going to disagree and go with 'distraction'    Touch :)      In fairness, the artist's definition is:  'words found in foreign languages that cannot be Anglicised word for word.'   They're beautiful and interesting.  While I'm typing, are there words for a 'seasonal lake' = [Turlough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turlough_(lake) in other EU languages or has it become a loan word?   So did the government not check with Sky or UPC before this announcement?   So cry to Aiken, fuck there are better things for the country to be focusing its attention on.   If only we'd something of the same standard as the BBC, but for RT you'd have to pay people to watch it.   If ad companies aren't paying for people's broadband, they don't get to decide what's on it.   Cheers for that, I'd no idea about Palatines.   He said he had stockists in Dublin, unfortunately I can't remember where, though you can buy straight from him in Slane.  Bulmers kinda gives me the horrors, but this stuff is great.   And let you do all the 'tasting', taxi so :)   We'll have to go for a little spin so.   The maker was saying yesterday that there are no known examples of the tree left in Ireland, but he's hoping one will be found somewhere.  And I think 'Cagogee' would be a good name, the first hard 'g' making the second one softer.   Dreadful isn't it, and it's a complete shame - it is lovely cider.  I'd actually drink cider more regularly if it tasted like this stuff.     Yeah, I've no idea about the Irish origins of the name but I reckon something like 'Keeva' would be better and still refer to the manufacturing technique.   While I'm at it, does the Indo know what a fada is?      www.cockagee.ie   If they keep this kind of thing up, the church here is going to end up like Buddhism in Japan, only requested by people at birth or death ceremonies and ignored the rest of the time.   https://panopticlick.eff.org/   Needs more Kim jacket.

And it's way too sunny to be looking at settings anyway.   Good, better than yesterday morning which was a false no-hangover followed by the real hangover in the afternoon.  Nonetheless managed to go to a debate on the 'right-to-be-forgotten' at the Hay festival which while more introductory than anything else was still interesting.  Susan O'Keefe recounted the story of a teacher who told her students to bring an embarrassing photo into school the following day and they'd put it on the school gates.  The students were understandably horrified. To which the teacher replied 'well you put them up online everyday' and the students seemed to get the point.  The representatives from Google   Transparency International were good too - the debate could have gone on for hours I reckon. Probably just as well that it didn't though, the hangover came back with a vengence. Naps were had.  So today I'm all sparkly, up at 7 trying to work out why my home-server is in a mood (or at least the powerline plugs are) and looking forward to the food tent's Beer   Tapas thing at 6 today.  Kinda wish it was earlier.   I thought this was resolved, there can be 3 concerts which is already 3 more than the agreement with the residents allows.   Today in fail upwards ...      I think you're confusing questions with word-salad.   Which actually caused a few problems last year, as there is a hay festival just over in Trim at about the same time.   Hay Festival - https://www.hayfestival.com/kells/index.aspx?skinid=26  /notkidding   Oh, I like that one.   Wasn't that the interview that made Martin McGuinness leave before his turn?   Ok, I'm heading out now.  Cheers, I'll try to ask the question from /u/BLUNTYEYEDFOOL if I get the chance.  Edit: So didn't get the chance to ask the question, they were limited to questions on WWI in line with his new book. He was excellent, and comes across as not so glowering unless he encounters bullshit which was only one of the questions asked. Great talk, 10/10.   it's not meant to be serious, look at the guinness one   Just as a side note:  [The Communist Party of Ireland has still not submitted the required statutory documentation [on campaign donations] and the commission referred a file on the matter to the Garda on May 19th.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/files-on-fg-ff-political-donations-referred-to-garda%C3%AD-1.1854072)   I'd love to see it too.   The geographical, geopolitical and theological-cultural* advantages they would have would be astonishing.  My grandparents could never have imagined the Queen of England would have an official visit to Ireland but it happened, it was great and there were no problems.  *I'm sure there's a better word for that, but I'm off to sleep now.   All terrible awful things and seemingly intractable in terms of negotiation. But did Hamas spring from nothing? No it sprang from how they feel they are treated.  It doesn't forgive their views or aims, but it does indicate how to weaken them as a driving force in this lengthy conflict. If Hamas are the obstacle then the solution is stop letting them have causes and events they can point to for support.  NI isn't like Israel, but once UK forces killed civilians in Bloody Sunday the conflict radically altered. Similarly, Israel's sometimes disproportionate responses to provocations and Palestinian violence gives Hamas all the cause they need to garner more support.  Cooler heads have to prevail, or the conflict really will be endless.   All very important distinctions in history, but the point I wanted to make was about the possibility of similar solutions, or at least the real possibility of a solution. Something NI didn't have for a good while.  Nothing improved in NI until everyone decided the negotiation table was better than attending funerals, and preventing further radicalising events.  As for calls to genocide by Hamas, they are crazy and also not every Palestinian.  Calls to wipe out Catholics / Protestants / Republicans / Unionists haven't vanished in NI either but the anger   grief necessary to create those views has reduced.  tl;dr - Negotiations are the only way out, anything else will be genocide for one side or the other. And if that happens, 50 years from now threads like these will still be posted.     True, but then again the Middle-east has had 1,500 years.

 Dude, Johnny gets SOME blame. The idea that he doesn't is silly.   It was,  but I was moving to Atlanta,  and missed the whole thing.     Bad form. Go Browns.   This year looked rough on paper, and then playoff calibre teams' seasons tanked and we beat 'em.   Yeah, historically he sucks against the Bengals.   [Can't tell if I am being down voted by Hoyer fans for saying I am sure Manziel will get better, or if I am being down voted by Manziel  fans for saying he threw interceptions...]( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/131/399/fry.PNG?1307468855)   The people who are calling this season a "Sinking Ship" and that we "screwed up all season by not playing Manzeil" should read this. This has been the most exciting season of football since 95, for me. We have made some great steps forward, and we get to finish off the season letting Johnny get ready for next year. I dont hate it. No more controversy. Go Browns. *edit: I spell like a Steelers fan*   Only a Browns fan calls 7-6 after 14 years of 5 or less wins, a sinking ship. I'm not calling for a QB change, but I am hoping that we can keep in perspective how much better we are, and let that be a building block we are proud of. Todays game sucked. Now to next week.   Sorry. I was downvoted to hell and told this is how we think on this sub, so I am just holding the line that the fanbase set down. It's our fault, not the refs, sorry. Go Browns.   He did throw 3 (2 were upheld) Interceptions. *shrug* I'm sure he'll get better.    Did you think this fanbase, with the way it treated a 7-5 QB after only one other winning season in 15 years, would give Johnny a break?     I agree with this. It would have been nice to get the same for Hoyer. I am all in with whoever we pick, I just think the infighting over the QB makes me yearn for Connor Shaw.    To quote what was said by /u/slapdog238 : "As a Browns fan who has lived all over the country, I can assure you, every. single. fanbase. thinks the very same thing. It's a copout. Our team is simply not playing well." Though I agree with you.

Good looking out!   Inherited them from my uncle. He's only 13 months my senior, and his dad (my Papa) is a long time season ticket holder, and his buddy used to be the equipment manager through '95 and the Ravens kept him on. But that's a long story for a pair of shoes. I'm just lucky as hell to have 'em. Thanks again. Go Browns.   Rocking out the vintage TEAM NFL kicks, and my Battle of Ohio towel from the 2012 home game with no advertisers marks on it,  and to celebrate wearing the vintage kicks; My new Haden jersey. Go Browns!      I say this with all sincerity. I want to be excited. I have been so disillusioned by the Hoyer Hate Vs Manzeil Hate on the sub that I am having a really hard time being getting there. I'm Brown and Orange till I die. Heres to getting excited, and a unified fan base. Go Browns.   Does anyone know where they are dumping the raw files?   Very true.   Indeed. I've always liked old school Seahawks fans.    I'm a big fan of Hoyer's. I know better than to buy a Cleveland QB jersey.   [Top Jerseys Seller]( http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1066076)   Yes   A little tight, but I suggest if your player was on the team in 2012, look for one of those. They rock and are super comfortable.   It got to me in 3 weeks, my child. Though I had to ship it to GA, then have it shipped to me in WA, because of some thing about keeping the payment in escrow while it processes. You might get it in 13 days. I have had quick turnaround on both of my orders. Blessings on your Secondary from my new favorite nickname: Interception Jesus.   Also, owning a Reebok jersey and  Nike jersey, I can officially say the Nike ones are not as stylish.      This is why The Haden Jersey is in the mail.    Thanks for the consideration, this was a powerful evening for me and I thank anyone who gives this picture a shot, in advance.      Totally understandable!    I am LBQT, so if I could please post this picture, that would be perfect.    I knew it was Lil John when I read the headline "Fox sends little person to Cincinnati press conference" Epic. I would sport that flair all day.   Love me some Little John!      Totes fake. I was about to say: "I hope Hoyer knocked Johnny the fuck out" because this crap would be the ugliest, least mature move, ever. I'd stop watching the season if my man acted like that.   I'll upvote once for ya, Professor.   All I'm saying is: I get it. He pawned a ring. Now let's move on and get back to the rest of the library of songs by Sublime. All of which are amazing. It breaks my heart that there is a song that I dont like.    So, 'Yes'. It's okay. You'll chill, and gel, eventually.   Pawn Shop by Sublime    New Browns fan?   Go Browns   Pettine's awesome.   He's usually clutch. If the only time he hit the field was a clutch situation, then the odds are in his favor of being really good, plus, (and I am officially excited to see him play) Johnny's GONNA get hurt with his style. It's not 'if', but 'when'. He was lucky to not have gotten hurt on that TD scramble. He took a crazy hit to the side during the play. Plus we know that Hoyer is better than any backup or starter since we got back in '99, so he's a safe bet. If he can't get a starting job somewhere, I hope we sign him as a backup.   He had a good run. I hope we keep him as a backup QB. Heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrreeeeeee's Johnny. Cundiff should retire to Baltimore.   This is actually full of truths.    They should change that jumbotron THIRD DOWN graphic to any other color combination than the current Yellow and Black.   Yeah, or when the Big Brown D gets pentatration to stuff the tight end. Big fan.   I say we bring in Manziel to kick. He has college experience.    That honor is reserved for that slack ass Raven in a Browns uniform. I swear to Christ that Baltimore is paying him to miss kicks, on the side.   /r/skinwalkers   Wow...this is trash.    I think this is the closest to what will actually happen.   I've been pretty much addicted since I found it. [Nice to meet you.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hi.gif)    Ahhhh, snarky insults. A rarity on reddit. It's possible that this is a couple months old. I searched the sub before I posted it because I work a lot and dont always stay abreast of my string and two cans. I'll just go back to reading the posts on this sub. Thank you.   I was not hip on the all nude spreads, penetration, or more hardcore posts. I respect and hold (somewhat) your opinion. I dont want people to make a job out of filling our sub with woman-flesh. I can-not, however, as a warm blooded North-East Ohio sports fan, turn down a girl when she has Cleveland Browns Pasties on and tells me she is proud of us beating the Falcons, and would I like to reward the sub with her ample chest? I'm probably going to take that picture and post it every time. Not because it's pornographic, but because we all earned it, and deserve to bask in the gifts given to us by our supporters. You will PROBABLY not see any more pics from me on the subject, but I also cant promise that another girl from my church isnt going to be like "Hey! you beat the Colts! Lemme take a boob picture in a cowboy hat for your sub!" I wouldnt have the heart to not take and share the unique bounty that being a winning Browns Fan on this sub generates. I'm sorry if you are offended. And I'm not annoyed by your opinions. I'm simply down hearted by the energy that has swept over this sub, recently. People attacking other subs, attacking our own members, and a general air of "We are a serious ball club sans shenanigans" has me a little down, but your opinions are sacred, because they are your opinions. Go Browns   This is akin to saying "I like presents,  but save all your gift giving until Christmas. Don't give any gifts until it's seasonally appropriate." But that's just my opinion.  I can look at harlots on the Web all day,  but bare breasted Browns fans only exist in certain places,  and I want to see them whenever our female fans are ready.   They aren't mine. I only captured them on film. I agree with people not asking for boob pics, but if a female Browns fan can't take a picture of her ample bosom in celebration of a win, then I dont know how we can call this THE Browns subreddit. If people were hounding folks for pictures, I could understand, but freely given Brownie Boobies being down voted when it's part of our history, dare I say, part of the very lifeblood of our membership; like beer and bad memes and down voting to punish people that are different. It's part of us. Dont hate. Participate.   These were the same boobs that can be found [in this pink bra](http://i.imgur.com/DUd72BT.jpg) These were a gift for beating the Falcons last week. Go Browns!      Just posting the news coming through the wire. It's not my job to prove or disprove, only to populate the sub with conspiracies, and that being said, yes, more evidence.       Tim Tebow won a playoff game for the Broncos. Does that mean they shouldn't have replaced him with Peyton Manning?  And as of right now, the only thing comparable between Manzeil and Manning are that they both start with M-A-N.   Yeah, splitting the energy of the fanbase isnt my favorite idea. I would rather have the conversations here. I'm all in on Hoyer, and I wouldnt want to spend all my time with people who just wanted to talk about him. *This in no way is an endorsement for either QB. We Bark Together*   [Do The Money With Me!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/wic.gif)   I was really happy to see this happen when it did. 5 ints and no tds over two games is the right time to put someone on the bench and make them  watch their replacement. He did better than I thought in certain cases, and worse than I thought he would be in others. Good stuff from him though, and I'm glad he got his start. I do not, however, think they will keep him in next week. Just a hunch. We'll see.   But you did say this:   Ahh, the victim complex. Classic!  Which is the same as   you're too much of a homer to see it.  in that we dont need to trash each other on this sub. We're supposed to be the best fans in the NFL. Let's do that. We dont need to blitz each other when there is so many boobs, beers, and dogs with hats to make us the envy of /r/nfl. It's all irie.    Not everything is about you. Jeeeesh!     you're too much of a homer to see it.  We dont need to call names. I'm one of the most chill fans out there. I'm just commenting that I saw a lot of busted calls. I DONT usually see or say such things. You generalized me on a single opinion. Again: We're all on the same side, here.   And you are being all aggressive, attacking and mean. I'm not the thing you're mad at. I'm on your side in this sub.    He says as I watch illegal block after holding call not get called against the Red White and Blue.   He says as I watch Orton Draw the D offside by illegally shaking his head and arms and not being called.    He says as I watch the yellow flags increase to 8 vs 5 for the Bills   I just want to know what they have to do to get to wear those black and white stripes.   In the KITCHEN!!!! Ishmaa'ily is a MONSTER!   When did being a smoker start being called being an "ent"? also, where does "ent" come from?   Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison were all found dead with white lighters in their pockets, and then Jerry Garcia coined that they were bad luck. Also, historically, black and white were the only colors of bic lighter, and you could more easily see the resin from the pipes you smoked with it, making the cops more easily recognize your pot smoking.    White lighters are bad luck. Retake with a new lighter.     **E**   A flea.   They've played 11 and it's 12 weeks in.   "The Browns are still the Browns"? That's racist sir. You're racist.   Best division in history is the current AFC North. Never have all the teams in a division been 3 games over .500, 13 games in.    I don't have that problem and I am subscribed to a bunch of subs   I can't upvote this enough.   Gotta admit that this doesnt happen to Hoyer, Thomas, Haden, Gipson, Dansby, Whitner, Dray, Pettine, or anyone else on the Browns.   Johnny Manziel might not be a trouble maker, but trouble sure finds him. Cant wait till he's the starter and is still doing BS like this. This junk makes him look like a thuggish child. Who let's their crew beat the shit out of folks? Plaxico. Next thing he'll be shooting himself in the leg and wearing sweat pants to night clubs.    Most of those mistakes were to Gordon, to be fair. I bet the rhythm is way better next week.    Browns.   Going Browns in 3....2.....*holds single finger up quietly and points to you*   Nope, people on this sub sometimes use the downvote and a lot of ugly talk as weapons when they dont agree with you. Not just your issue.   **O**   *Insert lecture on knowing and/or repeating history*   I can appreciate that you feel comfortable likening an interception in a football game to the genocide of a people. I'll keep that in mind for next time. Also: "Downvote for likening an interception in a football game to the genocide of a people"   Because its Browns History, and its in the current news stream.   Thank you for noticing. I have been all over reddits nfl pages, and we totally compete for best put together and aesthetics. *EDIT: [Case in point the Arizona Cardinals Subreddit.

You should just be happy with the reinstatement. Dont try to get free Omaha Steaks from people.    I agree. I'm just sharing the news on the wire.   As my colleague above stated, as shown to us by the Large Hadron Collider experiments, all signs point to "Go Browns". It was more important than finding the Higgs-Boson. Surprised you didnt read about it.       It's WAY worse than Hoyer, who is in the 70% range.    Johnny Jamboogie is the savior of instagram, not Cleveland. That's the Destroyers job.   Hoyer-wut?   I hope you enjoy that low hanging fruit! Also, his win percentage is 40.6% L33t4shure   Ooooo!

 "talented" youngsters (whether or not they are truly talented) are expensive nowadays. Every team want's to pick up some of these people to sell years later or hope that they become the next big name.                  Not sure if tradition is 90% better... I almost always open with Liberty, because I know I will end up with like 8-10 cities after battling some opponents. I think Liberty is worth it as a long term investment, if you plan to fight (which almost everyone has to playing higher levels).  But you are probably right, tradition is better for beginners.  Honor is also important, should at least unlock it to get culture points for killing barbarians. This is almost always my 1st or 2nd unlock.   Building some wonders yourself will make your battles easier (e.g. build the great wall yourself, or status of zeus). Some wonders (like the Oracle) have a one time effect, so I tend to build those myself as well, if possible.     But I heard that bees only sting others when they are in absolute danger. If they don't "know" that losing their stingers will kill them, wouldn't it be more logical to sting more often?   It's another way of playing, not necessarily good or bad. Teams often have short corners prepare as a surprise weapon against their opponents.         clippy was such a fun character, wasn't it?   It's true that from a ranking perspective, when someone moves up (because they improved), someone has to move down (even if their playing level stays the same). But Levon is just losing lots of rating points and playing badly, so yeah, maybe it not just about someone moving up and down the ladder.      If this is true, it's really surprising to see how getting engaged has such a big impact on your career!      Anyone know what happened to him? Why is he losing like every game? Please come back and show us some good chess!         Wasn't he believed to be the next C Ronaldo? Just 7m now?   So essentially, Juventus sells half of him for 10m, and buy 100% of him for 18m next season? That sounds pretty good.   I didn't create the list, I found it on my LinkedIn network.   How many people feel mad?             When they say (I didn't create this list, btw) Ideas are worth shit, they don't literally mean it I guess :)   E.g. it's better to own 0.1% of Google than to own 100% of your own startup with just yourself.  Meaning: you should not be afraid of raising money and diluting your own equity position.    Yeah, I am just in the process of learning how to do this!   Thanks! This is really, really helpful!         1) Not really, there are a lot of position available (at least when I was in my undergrad) and a lot of the unpopular jobs get no applications. You need to be receiving OSAP to qualify though.  2) Wages will all be at $11.25 (when you start), some department will add an extra $1 or $2 on top of it.  3) I worked at the Alumni Relations office at Rotman when I was in my 3rd year. It was great, fun and you get to know a lot of alums who do interesting things.  4) Work study should be the easiest (and most flexible). If you know programming (since you worked at IBM), perhaps work as a contract developer for others?   Ahh, I know what the problem is. It's thearima.com, no www in front. Sorry about it.   1.

Learn to move on if youve exhausted all efforts. Be honest with yourself. 50. Have fun!    That's exactly what I am asking here.  It is possible to fill in the missing values with averages, it's also possible to even throw all entries with missing values out (due to the nature of the problem - we are not looking into making a prediction for every company, just pick out the better ones). I guess what I should ask is if there are methods that can handle missing values (i.e. the classifier implicitly deals with them). I think trees is such a type, although I am not terribly sure.      Edit 1: The scenario is the following:  A venture capital firm would like to predict which companies are interesting based on some stats like money raised to date, the industry they are in, # of employees, etc. And they get this information from 3 online databases. In some of the companies available on the databases, information are missing. My guess would be they are missing because the firm is small or has been inactive for a period time, and hence not updates.   I really don't think there are ideas that nobody else has done before, in the sense that it is entirely new. Most ideas that you think about are probably tried before (which you may not be aware of, since there are so many startups out there).  I would suggest talk to people about it. Speak with your family, friends, and talk to people online. One advice I'd give you is don't be afraid that people will steal your idea, because they won't.   Please look at mine as well, thanks!  www.thearima.com      Yeah, I had that feeling too.    I liked it, but I think there are too many unnecessary deaths.      Take first year seminar courses.   It's not the worst since it's not part of your so-to-say core courses, but still failing a course does not make your transcript look good.  I am assuming what you are taking is MAT223 (correct me if I am wrong), and since this course usually does not curve students, I'd recommend speaking with your instructor immediately and explain your situation to him/her (e.g. I don't come from math and am taking the course for my own curiosity, I need to go to grad school for reasons xyz, blah blah blah). Sometimes this will help because the instructor is often a student (grad) himself, so they have some sympathy for students (not always true though) and maybe would bump up your mark by a few points. I'd also recommend seeing him in person (prepare your speech) instead of sending emails.  Other than that, not much I can suggest. Perhaps take some easy courses to make up for your GPA if you failed or did badly.   In the New Yorkers cover story profile, Marc Andreeseen talked about how he and Ben Horowitz are building a different kind of venture capital business.  One of the key elements is offering services to startups within A16zs portfolio beyond money. This approach involves 65 in-house specialists focused on executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing.  We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years, Andreessen said.  It got me thinking about whether VCs should be providing services to startups, rather than simply giving them money, advice and, theoretically, networking opportunities. Should VCs serve as service agencies that can proactively meet the needs of portfolio companies directly or indirectly?  Many startup entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, are smart, but they dont know what they dont know. They may be excellent developers or engineers, but they have limited knowledge or expertise about areas such as sales, marketing, finance or hiring.  To be successful, startups need to make the right decisions about multiple things and hire the right people. Some of their hires will be external  consultants, contractors, part-timers, interns, etc.  The question is how do startups make sure they attract the best talent to drive growth? They could spend time searching for good fits through research, asking their networks for advice, or simply hiring their friends (a common HR tactic).  But perhaps a better approach is having their VC become a one-stop HR destination for whatever a startup needs. Some of these services could be delivered by in-house specialists, while other services could come from a roster of strategic partners.  This could be a more efficient and effective way for startups to operate while VCs would achieve two goals: ensure their startups are making the right decisions to achieve their goals, and delivering value.  For better-financed VCs, it may be financially viable to have in-house expertise. For other VCs, it could involve building a roster of partners with a variety of skills. These partners would not only be hired guns but could be tapped for their expertise in other, non-formal ways  e.g. coffee, phone calls, etc. This would create a success-driven ecosystem that would eliminate some of the operational challenges facing startups.  What do you think? What role should VCs play to ensure the success of their startup investments? Are VCs about capital and advice, or should they be more pro-active?

Original Source: http://www.markevans.ca/2015/06/22/beyond-money-vcs/   Yeah, any sport at the competitive levels is intense. It's very different playing badminton yourself (most likely in a relaxed way) vs. watching it on tv.   I think this is targeting a really, really niche market, and your value proposition (The goal is to create a well known and respected community that can address the failure of crowdfunding platforms to allow effective community policing of campaigns) will attract little people.    leadership, for example.      Being a good player, imo, is more than just technical skills, and I think Maradona has way more of these than Messi (not saying that his techniques are inferior).   I think at least one of Berardi or Zaza will join.   I suggest talking to others in person. This is much more helpful than trying to find some user testing groups.   You can also try userpeek, which, I think, this the relatively better user testing group.   Is this the AI playing or a human player?   wow, first time as well.      Sad to see them go. They used to be a club with great players.                          	67
  was covered in medical bandages from   No, I don't notice...      Thanks!!!                                            	17
 whites are still good haha   some reds do it to me, most don't. wish I knew more about catching the ones that did  	2
 I wish I could afford to travel to all of them.  Just beautiful.   This was the year my parents moved to Las Vegas.  May check out the Google Earth mentioned in the comments below.  So many memories.      Just not sure where I should post this..         Great looking couple!  They look like they should have been cast on the Mod Squad.   Dream on.  I have a 401(k) that is 30 yrs old and is worth about the same as it was then.   Their deal will cost me about $400/mo.  I remember I was not working and had to pay taxes on my unemployment.  That also happened during that period.   And sat on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors for 12 yrs.      I hope Dems do not get passive, and actively pursue voter registration of these folks.         They actually paid more -- 110%.   Gret comments.   That was beautiful.   You will spend a lot of time driving between sites.  You may want Tito look at travel times.   You're missing all the wonderful parks in Utah!  Check them out.   Nice.      We would have two more crazy senators.   Wow.  Just having Bernie tour the country would be great.   Me too.  If you go back further, you have FDR which I think was our best president ever.  Would have liked to live during his tenure.  My grandparents loved him.   I loved to listen to Clinton talk (yes, he is the explainer in chief), but he was not our best president.  The trade bills hurt Americans, except for CEOs on international companies and repealed the Glass-Stegall Act.  That being said, unemployment was the lowest I've seen in my lifetime.   They turned off the debt clock in New York City because it was going backwards.  They didn't want to pay bonds off before they were due, so essentially we did have a surplus.   They may shift the burden to state governments, but usually with the money.  It's called block grants to the states, and states decide thier priorities.   Most local governments are paying for medical care now at County Hospitals that can't turn people away.     Medicare, Part E - E for everybody.   Thank you!    I can't find my saved items on Reddit anymore.     I just learned that.  I've been upset over the fact that I didn't go see it when I was at Black Rock.   For sure.   I think small businesses were better off before the large corporations took over.    Based on your opinion.  I'm not sure how you could factually document why smaller government is better.     I'm not sure how good it is now, but it used to be that veteran's had the highest satisfaction with their health care.   I think Section 8 was to get federal money to private investors who could buy housing/apartments and get their mortgage paid by the government.  Section 8 made a lot of people money.  They was also a huge HUD scandal during the Reagan administration that cost us billions.  You don't hear anything about it today.   I used to think that the South would only vote for a republican OR another southerner, i.e. Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton.   They turned against both of them though.  Jimmy Carter, a real evangelical!   Time to revisit the "Two Santa Theory" of republican tactics: http://www.democraticunderground.com/10021632181      Single payer would make sense.  Some parts of the economy should be for the public good, not private profit.   I also wonder how much they are paid to be trolls.   Seniors use to vote Democratic because they were grateful for medicare and social security.  I can't believe how they have changed.  It's got to be fear.   I have a legend I would like to know if it was true or not.  My parents told me that prior to central air conditioning, hotels bought cooks cases of beer to cool off during hot desert summers in Las Vegas.   She is a real artist.  Very creative and beautiful.   I think you are right. They should pay a price, and they were heading towards bringing down the world economy - because they didn't like a law.   And how much did it cost?      Yeah!      Many employers USED to think of their employees as family, and care about their wellbeing.  Now, it is only the bottom line.  I think alot has to do with local, small businesses vs corporations who don't know or care about the employee.   http://www.weather.com/news/science/nature/worlds-most-amazing-places-fly-geyser-20130617   He was active during Clinton's impeachment.   I think you are right.   How about a war started on false premise, or the econy collapse. Those two items should be enough.   I read a book recently that said World War I didn't end until the fall of the Berlin wall in the 1980's. I think this guy has it right. They are still fighting over state's rights which should have been settled in the Civil War.      Right now, Matt Taibbi.   I saw Ted Cruz's father on C-Span and all I can say is that I understand why Cruz is the way he is. His father is an absolute lunatic.   There is a great book published during the Bush years called "The Banana Republicans". http://www.amazon.com/Banana-Republicans-Turning-America-One-Party/dp/1585423424   You are absolutely correct.  There may be only 30 who consider themselves moderate.  There is plenty of documentation to back this up.   I love their sense of humor.  That's great.   Unfortunately, you are correct.   My favorite politician EVER.      I kind of like that idea.   Religion is based on faith, not reason.   There are a lot of wonderful Christians who do help.  I know them!  But as a group, they are capable of bringing the whole system down - like in the debt ceiling confrontation happening in congress, or the lack of belief in science and the denial of global warming, which will create untold horrors.  And, in the end, do we really want children to go hungry?   There are probably programs at your county that will pay for a year of your schooling for a year of paid service.  You should talk with the counselor at your college.       The above post is a repost from politics to Vegas.  Let's hope this guy isn't right.      It wasn't a filibuster; it only looked like one on tv.   I wondered about that too.   There are sure a lot of right wing folks on reddit.                      I guess you never read John Locke.       They tried to in Wisconsin, and lost.            http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3RYvO2X0Oo While my guitar gently weeps by the Beatles   I'm just sick thinking how seniors are now mostly republicans. Dens brought them social security and medicare. They used to know this and support dems.   FDR was amazing. Can't believe he hasn't been mentioned.         I'd like to see a test showing how you could change people's minds about a social issue in the short run.                Exactly.  He was awfully quiet during the Bush years.   That's the best definition I ever read.  I would post it if it was in an article format!  Thank you.   Reading the comments, I can't believe how many redditors are republican.  Are they ALL on reddit?   We don't need to cut the size of government.  We need to go back to collecting taxes from those who can afford it.  A big country needs a big government to do big things.   So, we stop educating children????      Many of the rich don't want to pay taxes to support it.    I could only wish.   I want to be a Millennial.   He needs to be fired.   I've been saying this forever:  We need to look at a new way to distribute money rather than basing it on work - guaranteed annual income?  I don't see another way for the long term.      Good article.  I watched Elizabeth Drew religiously on PBS during the Watergate hearings.      I want to sign and send it out to all my friends, but I can't get in to the petition!  Will try later today and see if it is the same.   You did great.   Plentiful jobs at low wages.   Thanks for the posting.  I was wondering where the other bridges were located.   WHAT: Rally for Nevada Jobs  WHEN: Clark County Commission Meeting, Tuesday, September 3rd, 9:00am  WHERE: Clark County Commission Building, 500 S. Grand Central Parkway, Commission Chambers  You can also RSVP for this event on Facebook by clicking here:   https://www.facebook.com/events/598520623545902/     Interesting concept.  I used to think they had not been in control of  congress for so long, they didn't know how to govern. When they did control Congress, they did a terrible job on it. I still believe that they don't know how to govern, but how we got there may be different than what I thought.  We do have a problem with the constitution and giving them more representation than they deserve.  I'm not sure we will ever get them out.   A few years ago (when I was 60), I started dieting - I did my own diet of low carb, low calorie.  It was tough.  It took forever for the weight to start to drop.  I started walking - a little more each day - and did leg presses at the gym to get my strength up.  It took a while, but easily got up to 3 miles/day x 6 days/week - 20 minute mile - about 1 hr/day.  I only lost 30 lbs, but my pant size went from a 20 to a 12.  I stopped and it all came back very quickly.  I'm having trouble getting motivated again, but I know it works.  My doctor was really pleased with my vitals.   I hate thiefs.   Interesting take.  You may be right.   I haven't been to Burning Man, but I've been to the location (Black Rock Desert) for other activities.  It is awesome.  It is so big that when you are on the desert, you can see the curvature of the earth on the horizon.  It would be easy to get lost too.      You are right.  Nevada ranks #1 in the inability for people to find full time jobs.   This is the second qilded age.   I think that is the rule in Las Vegas.  Some restaurants pay like 2.00/hr expecting their employees to make it up in tips.  I think it sucks.    That's the point.  Lift low-income workers salaries and everyone's rise.   Music was great and we felt we could change the world.  We failed unfortunately, but it was a good feeling.   I remember those!    I have a friend who started buying electronic cigs from China with about $300.  He has built up his business where he now has 4 stores.   Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.   There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day.    WHAT: 1st shift  WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101  WHEN: 5 AM   WHAT: 2nd shift  WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101  WHEN: 9 AM   For more information on the strikes contact:   Jocelyn Torres, ProgressNow Nevada Action,  jtorres@pnnaction.org, 702-767-2089 *This was cut and paste from Facebook.            I wonder who has the "in" for contracts to do it.   A lot of boomers believed in politics and public service.  Trying to stop the Vietnam war and starting of the Peace Corps. We thought we could change society.  Many changed in the 80's however.  It's too bad that we failed.   Thank you for your thoughtful comments.  I couldn't have said them better.   Years ago, we had an anti-welfare march in our town with people who think just like you. I was volunteering at our local legal aid office. One of the leaders of this anti-welfare march was there seeking assistance. He had had a heart attack (no insurance), lost his job, then his wife. He was trying to get some help. He regretted his previous stance. The lesson is that we are all one step away from poverty.  I now work at a welfare office.  When jobs were available, we had a lot less clients. People on the whole prefer to work.   You direct your anger at the wrong folks.   Campaign finance reform.   Yes, I wish that Dems would have tackled this issue first when they were in power (rather than health care).     It drives me crazy when I hear people say that Republicans freed the slaves.  The Republicans who freed the slaves would all be Democrats today.         Everyone should read your response. It was great.   Really good point.  I wish I could give you multiple upvotes!   I haven't read the article yet, but I wanted to start a co-op in my community.  It is against the law.  Our electric company provides a partial rebate to few homeowners every 2-4 years to have it installed  for outrageous costs.            Little late now, but I go to the dry lake bed headind towards Laughlin. Young just before you get to Boulder City and it is on the right. Next time.   People could get paid, and live a higher standard of living.   I agree.  Right now, work is just a way to distribute money for people to live.  And how many people are doing jobs that they hate or are not really productive to society.  	143
    Milk. Why would you get weaned off the milk of your mother only to go onto the milk of something that's not even human? Most people won't even taste breastmilk when they're adults but have no problem with breastmilk from cows when they're adults.   The dais should be as follows: 1. Sarah Silverman 2. Amy Schumer 3. Anthony Jeselnik 4. Jeff Ross 5. Natasha Lagero 6. Nick Kroll 7. Pete Davidson 8. Snoop Dogg   I beg to differ. Toplexil tastes great. Like the end of a caramel custard cup.   That's honestly what you get for storing someone somewhere you're going to fart a lot. Also think about how many of her particles get in their noses every day. I'm all for cremation but the storage is horrible, you can't just leave her there and expect everything to be great.   Hey! What's my fastest ticket to Canada? I'm 21 and I just finished my B.S in Biology in Lebanon. I'm willing to do a Masters degree in anything as long as it gets me out of my country to work somewhere else.

EFS is NFSv4 which means:    * Stateful (authenticate once, probably kerberos)  * Mountable AND shareable (EBS can only be mounted in one place, S3 can be shared but not easily mounted)  * Actual directories. No S3 doesn't have actual directories.  * On-the-wire operations (I don't have to download the entire file to start reading it, and I don't have to do anything special on the client side to support this -- it just looks like a normal POSIX file handle)  * Shared unix permission model (S3 doesn't do actual unix permissions. EBS does, but can't be shared).  * Tolerant of network failures (UDP IIRC with plenty of retry logic) So I can actually open a file remotely, seek around all I like, and if there's a network problem it will just wait for the problem to resolve rather than forcing my client to deal with exceptions (configurable, of course).  * Locking! Clients can actually correctly lock files. Let's see S3 do that.  * Better caching than S3 -- clients can actually see what all of the other clients have been doing and make informed choices about whether to use a local cache or refresh the cache from the network.  * Big files without the hassle (no multipart upload / multipart download, 64 bits for file size = potentially huge files)    There's probably more I'm forgetting.    EDIT    Who says you don't have to mess around with mounts? EBS makes you mess around with mounts. Maybe not if you use a pre-made AMI, but if you go right now and add an extra EBS drive to an existing EC2 instance you definitely have to mess around with mounts.

 For us, it was something along the lines of "The weather decks are now secure to all hand. The smoking lamp is lit in the DC shop."  As for announcing rough seas, they never really did that as the motion of the ship was usually enough to tell you when things were going to be getting worse.   I will do that! Thank you :)   I will do that! Thank you :)   Even at it's worse, there was never a "We may not survive this" feeling. For the most part, everything was ops normal, but more vomit. And this wasn't even the worse that we saw that patrol. There were concerns for those out on the deck, but when those concerns arose, the CO secured the weather decks (basically no one goes out). But it was actually easier for those at the helm as they could see the horizon. That's the key. When you feel sea sick, put your eyes on the horizon as it gives you a sense of stability and  your body can acclimate.    It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Of course most of the crew spent a good portion of their time sick...      I will!   Thank you so much for your help!   There in lies the rub. I no longer own the camera. It was dropped into the ocean on my last patrol back in 2005. I've still got all of the exif days on the pictures but the camera is long gone.   Mother nature is a powerful force   Thank you!   It was a rough ride though!   Perhaps, but I still find it beautiful         That's amazing!   Thank you!   Thank you!   Fantastic! Thank you very much!  Do you know if that $55 would cover future photography as well?   My concern is the cost. Would I have to register each photo or just the fact that I took a large group of photos?   I have recently started posting some images I took years ago to reddit (as can be seen in my history). As I understand it, because I am the photographer, the copyright is inherently mine. Recently, I found a website was taking images directly from a subreddit and rehosting them on their own site. Twice I asked the site admin to remove my images and both times they have complied. However, this last time, they responded demanding that I provide proof of ownership of the images. I'm wondering if I should watermark each image and how to protect myself and my IP in the future with these images. Any advice is welcome. If I don't respond right away, chances are I'm asleep as I work overnights.  Thank you for your time and assistance.

That is a beautiful shot   We were deployed with the navy and ESG5 back in 2004-2005. After the deployment, instead of going back through the Pacific, we proceeded up through the Suez, with a stop in Jordan first.       No matter how much I've searched, I can't find an importer anywhere in the states :/   It was amazing when I was there. I remember at one point going somewhere and we turned and found the [Alpine Cheese Festival](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/events/event-29543533.html). It was amazing! I want to go back soooooo bad .   I had such a blast there! I want to go back so badly         Gold Ancient Mariner Adm.

 If you look at the mic/headphone plug, there are 4 sections. The headphone/mic jack has 4 conductors to handle everything separately:  * Left channel out * Right channel out * Microphone in * Common  For a headphone that doesn't have a mic, there are only 3 conductors. The mic conductor isn't touching anything so there isn't any input signal to process. The phone senses this and leaves the on-phone mic turned on.   You are absolutely right. I meant my comment to be specific for this bill and re-reading my comment I can see that I was too generic, hence the confusion. The bill got filibustered. The Senate had 3 cloture votes on the House bill--maybe more, I stopped counting-- and all failed.   In the Senate, legislation requires a 60% majority (60 votes) to pass. Republicans don't have 60.   If it's not ridesharing, as Uber themselves and many others on this comment board have called it, then what is it?  Hint:  Starts with a "T."   [Uber drivers are getting 1099-Ks](https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/read-uber-1099) starting this year.   1. Uber's drivers are 1099s (hired contractors).  2. Uber can fire a driver, which they do all the time. You get fired if your rating is below 4.2, if I recall. This means they're more than just a service. They're an employer.  3. Ridesharing would work this way:  I'm in San Diego and going to Carlsbad. I have a few extra seats and can give somebody a lift. I use Uber to make a few extra bucks. 'Cept that's not how it actually works. Uber doesn't tell the driver where the passenger is going. This is to prevent the driver from making a decision based on the destination. This completely destroys your belief that it's "ridesharing." Sorry to burst your bubble.      You get a pass because you're saving the planet.   I'm in Salt Lake City.  Even when you are in a 270 degree cloverleaf, you are probably doing 30 MPH when you come out of the turn and there's (i'm guessing) 500 feet or more before merging. Surely most cars can accelerate from 30 to 65 in 500 feet?   I guess that's probably the reason. They don't realize that it's the  relative difference in speed between two cars that makes a situation dangerous.    The tiny engine cars obviously aren't what I'm referring to. 95% of cars in the U.S. can easily be traveling at 65 MPH within 2/3rd of most freeway on-ramps.   Mostly to get announcements from the groups that I'm a member of and to get time-wastable news links from sources like IFLS. I also think it's kind of cool to see what my older, over-30 friends are up to. Before, I would only see them maybe a few times a year and in those times we usually forget half the important stuff that has happened since the last time.   Facebook is evolving. It's definitely not the platform it was one or two years ago. It's not the communication platform like it once was. I've noticed a lot of changes in what people are posting now. Video has really taken off and FB has done a really good job incorporating it. I think FB is like Vine + Pinterest + Twitter, but not necessarily better than any of those other sites at what they do. It's just a kind of one-stop-shop.   I think 3.6 will suffice.      Comcast customers were reporting shitty Netflix streaming. User testing gave [proof](http://www.measurementlab.net/static/observatory/M-Lab_Interconnection_Study_US.pdf) that Comcast was throttling traffic from Netflix. Comcast denied, denied, denied.   Netflix caved and [paid a ransom to Comcast,](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790) suddenly no more problems. Netflix also signed a similar agreement with Verizon--who was doing the same thing--a couple months later.  Netflix complained to the Feds, which started the ball rolling on reclassifying broadband as a utility to maintain net neutrality.      Why doesn't the U.S. retaliate by raising tariffs on cheap Chinese goods?      Imagine two people on a moving train and they are throwing a baseball to each other. If you're on the train and watching them throw the ball, it wouldn't look any different than if the train were not moving.  The airplane is like that ball. It doesn't matter whether the Earth (which is like the train) is moving or sitting still.   Thanks, that's helpful advice.   What's your commission rate for full commission, and are you under sales goals?   That's really helpful. So you like all commission rather than base + commission? It seems like it would appeal to confident and aggressive sales people.   I will be hiring salespeople for a startup software company and I want to get feedback on how you like your commission structure, or whether you even have one. Do you help set your sales goals and do you think they are realistic?   Then they should go get skillz. Software support positions *start* in the 40s, green developers are getting 70s and sometimes 6 figures.  If somebody's attitude is to say "fuck you" then that's probably why they're stuck at minimum wage.   Why should every job pay a living wage? Minimum wage jobs are not considered skilled jobs. They are jobs that unskilled people can work at to gain experience and develop a good work ethic that will help them advance in their careers.  Society will always and should always have jobs that are not going to pay a living wage. A living wage is the incentive to do well at your job and get promoted or get better employment.       True, the 1948 war was such a huge factor. King Abdullah I of Trans-Jordan was promised the West Bank in a secret deal so he held back a lot of his forces and never fully committed. To me, that was the most critical piece. Israel was on the brink. There were so many ways that could have played out but the chips fell a certain way because of politics, which Israel played masterfully.   Before World War I the entire middle eastern region was a part of the Ottoman empire. Ottomons began as orthodox christians but transitioned to Islam. They were benevolent towards non-muslims, and granted them religious freedom. For most of the 2nd millenium AD the religious makeup of the empire was mostly Christians though the rulers were muslim. Islam gradually grew through the population and became the majority. There wasn't really much religious animosity in the middle east during this time.  The ottomans backed the wrong side and were defeated in WWI. A power vacuum was created and the British were given control of the middle east in what is called the British Mandate. They drew arbitrary lines creating countries without thought to ethnicity, which started the trouble.   After WWII the British ended the mandate and gave up control. A guy named David Ben Gurion dreamed of a Jewish state and had been pushing for it through the first part of the 20th century. He saw the withdrawal of the British as the perfect opportunity. He worked with the Mandate to create a Jewish, muslim and christian state in Palestine but the borders were never finalized. There was massive jewish immigration out of Europe during WWII, escapees of the holocaust. England and the U.S. were the primary recipients of the immigrants and this was creating a lot of political tension. Ben Gurion promised that a Jewish state would attract Jewish immigrants, taking the pressure off them, so his plan became a desirable solution for the U.K. and the U.S. as well. As soon as the British handed over control (literally on the same day, if I recall), David Ben Gurion declared the Jewish State. the U.S. and U.K. immediately recognized the state, much to the anger of Islamic palestinians who were living there and who were the majority. (I believe Jews were about 15% of the population at the time.)  TL;DR:  Jews, christians and muslims have been living in the area for thousands of years in relative harmony. David Ben Gurion declared a Jewish state when the British vacated control, and the U.S. and U.K. recognized the State, and convinced the U.N. to follow along. Muslims pissed ever since.   When the U.S. Constitution was written, a representative democracy was a new concept from the enlightenment but was completely untested. The founders were well versed in history though, and Roman history showed the dangers of populism in a republic. To mitigate against the possibility of the people really screwing up and electing some popular tyrant, they created the electoral college. The belief is that the college would be more thoughtful and could override a bad choice by the voters should they feel it necessary.   Who's arguing? I wrote what I believe and respect that others may disagree with me. To me, it's more than semantics and calling Professor Hawking a mathematician is like calling Thomas Wolfe a linguist instead of an author. But again, that's just me. I'm not here to force my viewpoint nor am I passing any judgment on physicists, mathematicians, linguists or authors. They all do different things that have some overlap.   When your body starts feeling cold the blood vessels to all of your extremities begin to constrict, including your penis. This helps keep the blood circulating around and warming the most vital organs to protect them. Your penis doesn't have bones or cartilage. It's size all comes down to blood being pumped into it. When the blood leaves, it shrinks.   To add to this and help define irony:  Irony is just communicating a thought by saying the opposite thing. Describing your new Mini Cooper by saying "It's sooo HUGE!" is an example of this.  Sarcasm is using irony in a critical way. Example:  Your friend walks into a tree and you say "That was smart."  The difference is your intent, whether it's just to be funny or critical.   Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist, not a mathematician. The discipline seeks to explain the physical world using math since a lot of it isn't directly observable.   Requesting tl;dr for the tl;dr.   [It's suspected that we've tossed in](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2078470/Teamsters-boss-Jimmy-Hoffa-buried-cement-General-Motors-HQ.html) a union president or two.   Imagine you're sitting in a moving train passing another moving train. Both trains are on the Earth, which is rotating. The Earth is revolving around the sun. The sun is moving through the galaxy. The galaxy is moving through the universe. What's your absolute speed? It's an impossible equation. You can only measure speed in relation to some other object--how fast your train is passing the other train--but not how fast you are moving through the universe.   Sand is a great desert topping too but, alas, not a good foundation.   Very enlightening. Thanks.  In-situ would result in faster start-to-completion times typically, yes? Reminds me of the hybrid "design-build" rage in the U.S.   This is probably a topic for [/r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit).   All celestial bodies except black holes emit radiation. That radiation is comprised of many frequencies depending on the matter that it's made of and it's not hard to figure out what those frequency components are. When bodies are moving relative to each other, those frequencies get shifted slightly due to what's called the Doppler Effect (think of a train passing you and the noise it makes as it's approaching vs. traveling away). The faster they move the more the shift is. By looking at a spectral graph of a celestial body we can calculate the speed at which it's moving away or towards us from that shift.  There is no true speed, only speed in relation to a point or another celestial body (such as our Earth).   You can program a PBX to display pretty much anything you want for caller-ID. And sometimes a PBX is misconfigured so it displays an extension number that can't be dialed-back. It's best to make it a policy to ask so an emergency dispatcher can make it a part of their routine. There's already enough to think about without having to decide whether to ask for somebody's phone number.   Computers use binary computation because it's really easy to just consider an electrical signal as either on or off instead of splitting a voltage into, say, 10 possible values which would greatly increase the chance of making a mistake when reading the signal's value. In a binary math system each digit in a binary number increases the range by a factor of two. A single digit has two values, 0 or 1. A two digit binary number has four values, a three digit number has eight values, and so on ad infinitum.  The bytes and kilobytes refer to memory, either RAM or on a hard drive. You reference data stored in memory by referring to the *address* of the data, i.e. where that data is stored (addresses are sequential, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Computers use binary values for addresses. If you were using 8 digits for addresses, you can have up to 256 memory locations. A 10 bit address has up to 1,024 (a.k.a. 1K) locations. A 16 bit address has 65,536 addresses (a.k.a. 64K).      She'll make somebody a nice husband.   Thinking about it more, I think the answer is this:  You are right, but the only place where the forces count is right at the mouth opening, not at the tip of the noodle. Where I got stuck is thinking that because the noodle is a cylinder, the pressure can only act on the end of the noodle. But in actuality, the pressure is acting on the cross section of the noodle right at the lips and it doesn't matter how long the noodle is.  I'm not 100% on this explanation but it's better than anything else I can think of.   Thanks for the diagram and really, thanks for taking all the time to explain. Your diagram is what I was thinking too but I just don't think it's a satisfactory answer. Here's why.  Imagine an *infinite* noodle. If it has no end, this explanation would conclude that an infinite noodle couldn't be sucked into your mouth. Of course, I haven't tested this hypothesis but my gut says that's not the case, that indeed you can keep sucking an infinite spaghetti noodle. Then there's the problem of pushing on the end of a limp spaghetti noodle--I don't think you can make it go where you want it to go.  This is why I threw this up on ELI5. I can't reach a satisfactory explanation by myself.   Ya Paint sucks. Google draw is only slightly better but meh, it works for this kind of thing. I sent a request for permission.   Because it's in the Constitution.   Or rather:  Things don't suck. They blow.  Physics geek t-shirt idea!   I understand the beer bottle bursting. I wasn't thinking of the cap or the end but the midsection. the pressure is pushing on the bottle wall. The bottle bursts outward. *I get it.*  Maybe [this will illustrate](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1e24LQwskqeEmaX8R3DhFMYXKXnbaQ4UzBWZu3XJ4EOs/pub?w=960 h=720) my question better than my words thus far.  Edit:  Imagine a piece of paper on a table. For my hand to slide that paper across a table, there must be friction between my hand and the paper. If it were frictionless, I would not be able to move the paper across the table. And that friction is, of course, created by the roughness of my skin and the paper.   Oh shit, my ass is on several hard drives.   The beer bottles I understand. Its surface is orthogonal to the direction that it bursts. You push on a flat surface, it moves in the direction of the force. How does that translate to the noodle, whose surface is cylindrical but parallel to the direction that it moves?   So the air pressure is acting on the roughness of the noodle. *If* the spaghetti noodle had a perfectly smooth surface, you couldn't suck it in, right?   Sorry, misspoke. I meant air pressure, not force.   That air pressure must have a surface to push on, right? A noodle is cylindrical so there isn't any surface can accept a force which pushes the noodle inward.  Well, except for the very tip of the noodle.   ^^^ What he said. I meant *air pressure* forces.   Oh boy that's an entirely different beast. Nobody knows how gravity actually works, just that it does.   Having a hard time wrapping my head around the "fluid" part. I can push an uncooked spaghetti noodle but have you tried pushing a limp one? Doesn't work so well!  Edit:  Oh you mean like water through a straw? Fluids aren't compressible so if they are constrained in a straw then they can behave like a solid.   Edit:  I mean *air pressure* forces can only push, not pull.   Even if a solo pianist has played some piece a hundred times, it's never plays the same way twice. The same goes for a good orchestra, but it would all sound like shit if every musician did their own thing, holding some notes longer than before, playing some parts louder or softer than normal. A conductor is needed to be the creative force during a performance. Good musicians are needed who can respond to the conductor's cues and make it all come together.   It could be a honeypot as well.   HDMI and DVI are both digital video standards but there are two differences that will explain why desktop PCs tend to use DVI rather than HDMI. First, most DVI ports also provide analog signals and HDMI does not. This means you can connect a VGA cable to a DVI port using an adapter. Since many existing monitors are still analog, this was an important design criteria for desktop PCs.   Second, HDMI carries audio. This is really important for signals going to a TV since all of them have built-in speakers. Most computer monitors, on the other hand, don't have built-in speakers since most PCs use external speaker systems.  There's more demand for HDMI on laptops because people are more likely to plug laptops into TVs since they are more portable. Few people will unplug their tower, keyboard and mouse to take it over to a TV. But you'll notice that even laptops that have HDMI ports will also have a DVI port. (Yes, there are exceptions, I know.)   The amount of debt is one piece, interest rates are another, and currency is yet another factor. Debt rating is a measurement of the risk of default. U.S. government debt has one of the best debt ratings in the world. The U.S. dollar is also highly sought because its value is stable. All of these factors make the amount of debt less of a factor to the U.S. than that amount would be to another country who doesn't have as favorable of conditions.  Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing if used well. Let's say you invented the SuperWidget 2000. By yourself, you can make one a day, around 250 a year without working weekends. Let's say a rich uncle saw one of your widgets and is willing to help you grow your business by loaning you money at less than 1% interest to build a factory, buy machinery and hire and train workers to build the SuperWidget 2000. Now you are employing 100 people and building 100 a day. Your income has gone up 20X, thanks to your uncle. You would be crazy to turn down that sub-1% loan. That's exactly what the rest of the world wants to do. U.S. pays interest rates in the 0.1 to 0.3% range on our debt.    Default is when you don't pay. The debt doesn't all mature at once, just like your mortgage that has monthly installments. The U.S. debt has varying lengths. The debt limit is completely made up my Congress.   Ice is lighter than water so it rises to the surface. Ice will keep forming on the surface until there is enough of it to protect the water flowing beneath it from continuing to freeze. The water is still flowing, just underneath the ice.   Giuliani is not a grown up.   Oklahoma is the U.S. equivalent of Somalia.   I wrote that scene. When I was 12.   Yes, I'd let them in then I would call the po po.   I don't have a problem with wanting to believe in God as long as they respect other religions and non-believers. I feel the joy of love as much as anyone else. I hurt as much as anyone else when my mother died. Just because I know that emotions are synapses firing in my brain doesn't make it any less powerful to me. I also feel sympathy for others, no matter what they believe in. To me, it's not religious. It's just being human. If I ever join a religion it would probably be Unitarianism.   I apologize if anyone took it that way. That was not my intention.   Generally, you're not allowed to shoot somebody unless you can make the case that it's self defense, that you feel your life is being threatened. In most states, feeling that your property was being threatened doesn't rise to that bar, and it certainly doesn't if the person is in the act of fleeing, regardless of whether they are carrying your property.   How much time did it take for you to realize that Star Wars was a work of fiction? That's about how much time it took for me to realize the bible was a work of fiction. If you take the position that the bible is a scientific paper consisting of a hypothesis, an experiment and a conclusion then its conclusion would have been shown to be erroneous many times over.   Dont' forget to have a tourniquet when they cut themselves pulling out the knife.   So a bit of manual digital darkroom HDR ?   If you have bought anything, you've paid taxes (at least in most states). If you live somewhere, even if you rent, you pay taxes (your landlord passes these costs to you). If you are employed, even at minimum wages, you pay taxes (your employer withholds these and they also pay employer contributions that you don't see).  If you're an adult, chances are high--very, very high--that you pay taxes.   There are a lot of great companies, many started and staffed by some very hard working and entrepreneurial people. That's a big part of the equation but not the only part. One of the reasons why you can earn that money is because taxpayers and government helped create an environment with good infrastructure, regulations and laws that foster and protect free market competition.

 I am unsure on who to start,Deric or Ousted.... :\    Captaining BWP for the sake of it :)      It is not common in synchro dimension, but the tops and security probably has heard of it like how the top headquarters in every dimension knows about all the other summons.    Yes, but not every single one.    We should start tolling all highways, so it needs to run a profit.    No because only blue state urban folks use Amtrak. Why should rural red state people subsidize something that they don't use? We need to fund and build more highways and airports if we want to use money wisely. ;)   You sure these are the best evidence to be against TPP if freetrade has been proven by most economists to be a net benefit for everyone in the GDP sense.   Keane and Zardes aren't starting together at the top. Also Landon Donovan is gone, so it should have been expected from last season that LA doesn't have that assist maker threat.    Colorado's Postponed game .   Should workers be free to move from country to country to get better wages?   Economics has a lot of outside factors and can't really be scientific proven.   Example: Nobody can scientific analyze to the exact point how a minimum wage increase can affect the economy.    In capitalism, yes.... it is inherently darwinistic.    Labor Particaption was also worse in the 1950s than today's.  One person can easily provide family income.    It similar to a budget deficit. We are consuming more than we can afford.   Revenues = Trade Exports  Spending = Trade Imports  When we say we are exporting more through more jobs, we are increasing the rate of trade exports but ignoring how much trade imports we take in.    I agree. Trade is supposed to benefit all parties involved. Nobody should "lose" or have an "advantage".   Now, we have a time delay to get back to the original aggregate demand.   Those are small compared to the whole equilibrium market, so it doesn't affect equilibrium all that much.   So... We should continue on a negative trade balance? What are the benefits of a trade surplus, where we export more than we take in?  In economics, something has to add to zero because nothing is infinite.    Question: aren't the workers, who make the items are also a portion of demand, so if they lose their jobs, should demand of the good shift to the left as well?   Are there articles by economists that day TPP is a good agreement? I want to read them as well as economists who say that it isn't, even though it is known that trade = benefits everyone.   In trade, everybody gains so there shouldn't be any losers.   What happens when everything is at world equilibrium with goods, wages, prices, etc?    How will TPP address the trade deficit is the main concern? So far our trade policy has increased trade deficits.   how about the Mexican economy and it's different sub groups in the economy? Shouldn't trade be a benefit for everyone?   The middle-man business will obviously want to buy the cheaper-made good because it is in its best economic decision making.   What are you trying to lead me into? Opportunity Cost? Comparative Advantage?     Ya. I am taking economics right now in college, so I might not be a complete expert on this topic, bur I do enjoy learning about it. If I faced off against a person with "supply side-centric", I will probably lose. However, economics is a "dismal science" as noted in the economics subreddit and it really just depends on your opinions.    Not all economists are conservative, but the science relies on a capitalist supply and demand graph.   I honestly want to see a debate between economists vs protectionism    You sure? Don't they have a lot of evidence that say all freetrade = met gain for everyone?   Clarify this please? One person is trying to obtain 1 million orders of f500 vs 1 million of another object?    Economics the dismal science    next what is the point of national borders if companies, workers, migration, and prices of every good in the world are at world equilibrium?    Why are there "trade advantages" if freetrade is a net benefit to everybody involved? There shouldn't be any losers in trade.    I wonder why doesn't shifts of the labor supply factor into the equation   I have always wondered how would Sanders face against an economist on free-trade's pros and cons? Most say yes to TPP and free-trade.    I agree. Other countries have amazing modern infrastructure for public transit, trains, airports, seaports, etc   there is a correlation with an increase in trade deficits with an increase in freetrade in the past few decades.    Any link to articles?   The same logic is similar to perfect competition businesses. One Business can't affect the market's price. They take the market's given equilibrium price.    It may be true in a way, but I only stated this because people have been saying that protectionism never works at all, even though it had for decades before the Great Depression.    I wonder why the Highway Trust Fund isn't getting major headlines since the deadline is coming up.   one person making a change in purchases doesn't really affect the market. You need a massive amount of change by buyers or a change in macroeconomics policy making.   protectionism worked in America from the beginning of our founding to the 1920s      democrats and republicans had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings. parties used to be regional rather than ideology.         Most Businesses don't even run on profit. The ones that do run on profit are large corporations or businesses with ideas/goods that are superior to the current market state. Most small businesses close and file into bankruptcy with a couple of years.   Most infrastructure systems are natural monopoliess.   While we debate an issue of whether to even have intercity train travel, Europe, Japan, South Korea, RUSSIA, CHINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, etc are building miles and miles of rail and in some cities within these regions have better transit than us.   This is so ridiculous. We need to increase spending on Amtrak.    Why do you have Thunder Sea Horse but no Batteryman AAA? You have only 1 specific name for seahorse.   Yes but is is easier for republicans to gerrymander because Democrats live in clustered urban areas and minority dominated areas in the west and south. Republicans have a larger access to land size since they come mostly rural areas, which are very sparse.   Yet, America was more socialist when our grandparents were young in the 1930s to 1950s.   NASA was a socialist program to defeat Soviet Union's Capitalist space program.   Marginal Income Tax Rates were above 90% on the wealthy.  !950s had the largest infrastructure spending in our nation's history with the interstate highways, which would cost 1/2 to 1 trillion dollars in today's money.    fusion recovery is recyclable and a bit less of a dead draw than the other fusion cards.   -1 or -2 Quickdraw and replace it with chronomaly golden jet, so galaxy soldier's effect goes off.    the effective tax rate would still be larger. if today's effective tax rate is 0% and sometimes negative for wealthy people and corporations, then wouldn't the effective tax rate back then be high? According to this "lots of loopholes" logic, today people are receiving a lot of negative tax rates.   Like $15 to $30 depending on the rarity?   I thought that conservatives believe that entry level jobs are supposed to be "part time"    Ya. Either way, nobody could have really expected Bingham with SJ's below average defense to do well against Houston's offense + Bingham's ability to save a penalty.    Don't forget that Houston still faces the Toronto's defense that still isn't great.    Giles Barnes :D   Same. Though, Deric hasn't been doing so well. It might be the absence of Horst. If we can get Horst to start both games, then I will start Deric.    ya. Though I just realized that I have 2 more transfers since I only used 1 last round. I am thinking of replacing subs for a good sub.       ishizaki should be on people's radar when Zardes and Keane play as forwards.    So this is how we can compete against developing countries. Good job America!   Galaxy is good in OTK decks.    Madison only wanted a republic to stop the masses of the working class to vote away rights of minorities, who were the wealthy landowners at the time. Minorities didn't mean racial minorities, sexual Minorities, religious minorities, etc.   I rather have a majority rules multiparty proportional system which every developed country has. You think they have mob rule and uninformed citizens and vote away rights of minorities?    yet we still claim that we are the least corrupt out of the rest of the developed world   Right.... Are Republicans going to talk about their support of free-trade, Patriot Act, drug war, privatizing infrastructure, reducing urban development programs, increasing police officers, etc in Cleveland?  Yes. Those are the "solutions" to solve any urban problem in America. Of course, there are other issues by which they will differ themselves from Baltimore like family values, responsibility, education, etc, but you can expect no talk about any of the major issues above.    Should have started Ousted instead fo Deric   No Wildcard usage :o   Only in America where opposing majority rules is good because conservatives fear that they vote away rights of minorities. What James Madison wanted when he created a republic was to stop the rule of majority against the minority land owners.   you have got to be kidding me. James Madison wanted a republic so individuals can think for themselves instead of the majority opinion?   Roids   I want somebody who isn't centrist Hillary and divisive as democratic socialist Sanders but is still electable to the American Public.   Ya. I was planning on that.    ^ I know that incentive by Republicans. I want a candidate, who isn't too centrist like Clinton nor too extreme like Sanders, but still can be electable.    I don't see any good transfers investments, if I transfer out Arrieta, Villareal and Jacobson. I only transferred out Gehrig for Polster to save 0.2 million and get a more attack-oriented defender.      Republicans want a more liberal candidate so they can gain moderates in the general election.   you need a way to get rid of common singles first to make up any remaining losses.    I don't think Robles is a good investment even after the double game week, so not really.   The yugioh community is basically people with a lot of $$$ already. Those people go to locals, regionals, and nationals. Konami already makes a lot from them because they will always buy. There has to be a reason why investors aren't investing in Konami for the TCG yugioh.   Honestly it just depends on the consumers of yugioh. We need to expand the market base so konami will make money in America.   I wouldn't recommend getting Powers since Colorado's attack isn't that great. Forwards must score if Powers wants to get assists. Then, again, if you have Colorado Players already on your team from past, keep them there because you will never know what the future will hold and you have double the chances.   Training Field  Spell Card - Field Spell  You can normal summon "roid" machine-type monsters without tributing. "Roid" Monsters can target their own monsters for attacks. When they do, the attacking monster gains 300 ATK and the battling monsters are not destroyed by battle. If this card is destoryed by a card effect, you can add 1 "roid" card from your deck to your hand.   I slightly added more effects from the anime version.   I know. I am just satirizing the people, who say free-trade will improve enviromental laws.   For the past couple of seasons, FC Dallas always starts the season strong and then falters for some reason.   I captained FINLAY! :D    Yes. I did. :)   Free-Trade helps to introduce competition and increase living standards for everyone on all sides. Why should anybody be concerned about the enviroment, if the economy grows? The freetrade and competition will reduce the negative enviroment externalities.    Yes. I said that statement to keep people aware that the Republican Party and some Conservatives didn't always support free-trade during their history and Democrats/ some Liberals used to support free-trade.    Yes in a way, but not exactly. Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings.  Democrats purged out their conservative southern faction after the New Deal Coalition and the emergence of the social progressives to the dislike of Southern Democrats. Republicans purged out the Northeastern Liberal Establishment before the 1980s, but began in the 1964 GOP National Conservation, when they don't want moderation at all/hated the Welfare/Big Government (which had grown under 1950s with an increase in marginal income taxes and new spending)   I though Conservatives are nationalistic and would oppose free-trade because nations wouldn't live within their means and we would be dependent on other countries for goods and services. Self-Reliance and Personal Responsibility anyone?   If free-trade is good for all sides economically, then why don't they just release the trade negotiation details to public before they sign it into law? Is it in secert to ensure US's interests are kept? How? Shouldn't everybody benefit?   Keep in mind... Mexico is supposed to increase living standards every year as a result of NAFTA's free-trade. What has happened since then? Drug Cartels, Mass Murders, People still living in shacks, even though they work in manufacturing jobs, pollution in Mexico City, etc. Why are the TPP negotiations in secert, if everybody benefits from trade according to economists? Why do people say that it has to be secert to ensure USA wins a trade? How? i thought in trade... everybody benefits.    The Republican Party used to be the party of high tariffs and protectionism. Keep in mind, the US economy was reliant on protectionism until 1920s. During that time, we went through a huge industrial boom. Yes, protectionism was also one of the causes of the World Wars.    cool! I never knew that he did this AMA before, so ya. :)   Syrus Truesdale with better roids to face off again Yugo's Speedroids   What is your favorite yugioh deck?   True, but I mean as a result of the political forces.......you had more globalization of the markets, since the 1970s.    I know, but basic economics say yes. Also, most economists during the period of 1980 to 2008 agreed that it worked. Right now, most economists still believe free-trade is a good thing. How is not viable? Where are the supposed "economists" who can debate the issue of trade, inequality, taxes, and amount of government spending?   It is really a toss-up. Deric seems to be getting a lot of bonus points, even if he doesn't get clean sheets.   Isn't trade a good thing? According to economists, all free-trade deals are good economically.    Shouldn't the a more freemarket economics, deregulation, a reduction in government services (to reduce deadweight losses) help to expand the economy and reduce inequality during that time? After all, we expanded free-trade, lowered taxes, reduced the size of the government spending, spent more on military, etc? '  	108

I can't think of a single agency that doesn't use the term  That's the point! Southern Company isn't a common, public, or unbiased funding source. They're a company. Their motive isn't uncovering scientific truths, it's making money. (Yes, companies fund lots of perfectly good science. Clearly that is not the case here.)   And it's not a "we're too stupid" defense, it's a "you're too smart" one.   Not to get into a whole thing here, but...uh...[remember Sandy](https://www.google.com/search?site= tbm=isch source=hp biw=1038 bih=893 q=Sandy+NYC+underwater oq=Sandy+NYC+underwater gs_l=img.3...5657.8552.0.8746.20.10.0.9.0.0.303.919.6j2j0j1.9.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..12.8.614.4MvcdDFQvN4)?  Because I do. In fact, I remember seeing the road in front of my apartment so flooded that when the waters finally receded, there was a ~10 lb Atlantic Cod flapping around on a sewer drain.     I get what you're saying, I'm not disagreeing. I'm telling you that you're expecting the media to operate as though they're publishing PhD's, and expecting the public to understand things like publishing PhD's. It's just unrealistic.   The focus on the term is just a heuristic. No, it's not technically 100% accurate. No, it's not the key issue. *It's just a symbol that people can understand.*   Having the slightest idea what you're reporting on  I hate to tell you, only the most experienced and educated reporters have any clue what they report on. If you'd like to change that, convince more PhDs to stop writing peer-reviewed studies and start writing for the public.  Something that most PhDs don't know and always have a hard time dealing with: mainstream media is written for an 8th grade reading level.   Let that sink in. 8th grade.   That's the standard you can to hold them to.    the use of the term 'deliverable' in no way implies such a relationship.   I mean...it kind of does though, if the other option is that there's no relationship at all. It isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the study was done on the company's behalf. Which means he's not independent, and he should declare the funding.   What is the purpose of paying attention to their coverage, when they admittedly have absolutely no idea what they are doing?  Then don't. If you demand perfection you'll always be disappointed, and you can go ahead and stop doing anything outside the ivory tower.    [Make it happen people!](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=sloths+are+slowbears)    A billion Catholics would beg to differ...   Yes. Wouldn't have helped the fact that they've been debunked, but it would at least make him honest.    I guess I should have added that he claims to be independent, but if it's a study for a company in exchange for funding, then it's not really independent. Right?   I just think you're holding the public media to a higher standard than they're ever going to meet. You can't expect the public/media to understand the details of publishing. Of course it'd be nice if they followed science as closely as pop culture, but that's just unrealistic, you know?     For the most part whatever public institutions or private universities they work in...    Except Gore's not publishing studies without disclosing that funding.   So you've inadvertently made the opposite point you tried to. This shows that Soon's not a scientist, he's an advocate.    I hear you, but that's kind of the point. The fact that he considers them deliverables but *failed to disclose that to the journals* is the problem.   Though you're right, journalists/editors are going to use that term as a shorthand for the public.    Is there any indication his work is biased or fraudulent?  Yes. He's been debunked repeatedly by scientists who aren't being paid by fossil fuel companies.                            http://www.polarresearch.net/index.php/polar/article/view/26612               Oh not to worry, you got it!    /r/fatfishhate   "business as usual scenario" would not, it assumes a continuing reliance on fossil fuels.   But some of them would, yes.

You've seen Kung Fu Hustle, right?! If not, drop what you're doing, build a time machine, travel back far enough to find a Blockbuster, and rent Kung Fu Hustle.    Young Jackie Chan is the only person who's more entertaining a fighter. His Drunken Master is [great just by itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Hf8l_TUaU), but a whole lot of fun to watch [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OBuMA2qEk).    Me too! Just the right amount of style to his fighting.   Check your TV and see if you have the El Rey channel. It's a weird channel that's mostly kung fu movies and stuff from the 80s, but branded around Mexican wrestling because that's the only original programming it does.   Yus. This is my favorite one yet. Perfect!   (Helps that I've seen the movie recently.)   Tell me about it! I went to Coney Island last Sunday and got a little burned after laying out for just a little bit. Then the next day I went to work without a sweater and about froze!    Yes, people who mine and burn the dirtiest fuels will need to find new jobs. Which, as the quote in the title points out, will be outnumbered at least 2 to 1 by the new jobs created.

We would hate to put a dent in the profits of the richest companies in the world! Heaven forbid they earn anything less than a bazillion dollars for their product that's polluting the atmosphere!  Privatize profits and socialize losses, that's what I always say! Yay corporate socialism!    Right, because businesses just up and quit when the EPA regulated lead in gas.   Businesses just up and quit when the Montreal Protocol phased out aerosols and coolants.   Business just up and quit when we ended child labor.   Oh wait, they didn't? And that's just the fearmongering every industry does every time there's a threat of regulation? Oh, hmm.

Look real close.   This was an assignment when I was in college film school. The person is not me in the video, hes a friend of mine. This was shot about 5 years ago. The assignment was to combine video and music together so they complement each other.    Damn that took a lot of work to get that shot. The lighting had to be just right. Pain in the ass for less than a second of screen time.   The use of slow motion and speeding up shots really helped in giving it that real feel.   Yea that's my favorite shot. I was constantly spraying my friends face with a spray bottle of water to keep the cold sweat look going.   Yea It fits really well      One of her I did awhile back... [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/XgnQPwQ.jpg)   Another one of my favorite songs by them. Thanks for posting this.         Yea for sure. I have been using streamers lately but they do hit hard but like you said its worth it when you don't want to loose it. Ive been using OpenRocket and it really gives you a lot of info I can use for better launches. Thanks a lot for recommending that!   Thanks for your advice. Your definitely right about there being to many variables to be able to predict landing area. I was hoping there was some equation where you input thrust, height, and wind speed and come up with a 10X10 foot estimate. But like you said, it wouldn't be something you could do on the fly.   I'm looking for some basic math on how to figure out where my rocket will land (with or without parashoot) Right now I'm using basic C6-5 Estes motors so I can look up all the statistics online for the thrust. Any advice would be appreciated.     Nobody cares about your birthday.    What a waste of time watching this. THIS IS NOT FUNNY! AT ALL!   Why is this funny?    Agreed. Those titties took me by surprise.   Its not. downvotes all around.      You can actually visualize sound traveling in this gif. As people are hearing GO! it takes a moment for sound to travel to someones ears. So the people in the front go first and everyone else follows.                  Agreed. poetic and insightful. It must have took awhile to write it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7dLU6fk9QY         I can see this dude being about 400 pounds with no neck and a learning disability.    Or maybe its a trap to keep selfi taking, duck faced people off the streets.   That a good point. I feel like we would break them if we told them that. Their face would get a permanent confused look forever.  	46
 We are all friend now.    Im just a girl, like any other, on reddit trying to find dank maymays.    The long con. I like you                           I changed the sub default.             I made the sub nsfw for default. Although there isn't nearly as much porn as I was expecting. I'm considering making it normal and just tagging individual things.          Done                  Ok I made it, /r/gasmaskgirls                                    There was this forest beside my school and I would go there and build forts.   One of my friends, lets call him caleb, because thats his name, would go with me sometimes. We usually worked during lunch or after school since we both rode our bikes home and our parents got home late. But sometimes we just skipped school to do it. It started out small, with carving paths between these short palm trees. Four of them made a nice "room" area and you could carve paths between 2 to form "hallways." We worked on this for months.   But the entrance was near our recess area and one day someone saw us going in. They of course told everyone and the next day at recess, dozens of kids are trampling over our fort. It hurt. It felt like an invasion of privacy. It was our hard work and they were trampling all over it.   Well, as the administration does for harmless things  they over reacted and banned us from going in the forrest. A couple weeks later, caleb and I got a detention for being back there.   That didnt stop us, that made us more determined. We would rebuild. We went further back into the forrest and found this place where someone dumped house construction scraps. Plywood and 2x4s and miscellaneous things. We started making a huge fort and using these things to build. The trees were taller further back and it was a heck of a challenge, but two kids with some determination can do alot over 2 years in middle school.                 That the world doesnt exist and was all made up around us a la Matrix style. Or even like The Truman Show. Imagine that the world really is a stage and everything is fake. Every friend you have is an actor, every place you have been to is a set, every road or plane flight you have been on has just been circles you drove in. What if the maps were wrong and that road trip you went on was just a loop that kept you in something the size of your state? What if every interaction you ever had was orchestrated by a producer of a show pulling the strings.  How would you know?  That is the biggest thing about this. The most appealing. How could I prove it, that it is all a lie. I used to think about this a lot in high school. We really would have no way to prove it. I ended up realizing that there is no point in thinking about it because there is no way to prove it sufficiently.   And suppose it was matrix style. What if we were on a computer? Our brain is all electrical signals anyways, what if we were a brain in a lab being probed and every smell, image you see, thing you feel, idea you remember is an electrical signal coming from a computer putting it there.   How can you prove that the world actually exists in the way we think it does? What if we were just some game, some 3rd grade martian's science fair project? We wouldn't know any better than a sim in your video game would.                                                                            i just dread when people ask me the "Where are you from?" question because i know where it goes every time.       Outrageous reimbursement idea from here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/30qcdb/its_all_about_the_tall_nonfat_chai_lattes/                                                                                                                                 My bro and I used to be really close even though we were 9 years apart in age. His dad left our mom before he was even born and he never met him. My dad left when I was 2 and he was 11 and I barely remember him. Because of this my mom had to work two jobs to support us. One of those jobs was at this engineering company where she worked as a cleaning lady. She worked from 9pm to 5am as did all the cleaning staff so that they wouldn't disturb any of the engineers.   Because of this, my bro and I would spend a lot of time together. We became really close and even though he had a decade on me, it wasn't like a weird father-son relationship where he had to take care of me. I bet I had to take care of him just as much as he did me. We would do whatever to calm the boredom of being alone so much  When we weren't getting in trouble, I remember we liked to play on a used n64 my mom got from one of her friends who's kid got a PS2 for christmas. We would play the crap out of it. We liked to play either mario64 or donkeykong64 and we would play on the same account to try to complete as much as we could as quickly as we could. When he couldn't beat something, I would, and vice versa. We also liked to jump this fence right next to our house that blocked off a canal. He would always have to help me up but once we were over we would play around over there. It was fun finding abandoned stuff like washing machines and other trash. We also would go in the forest and make forts. One time we found this place where someone dumped scraps from a house construction. We had a bunch of oddly shaped plywood boards and some 2x4s and made this huge fort.   We would hang out there a lot until my uncle told me there were snakes over there and I was too afraid to go over again.   Our song was Kyrptonite by 3DD. We started liking it when his friend got a playstation and we would go over and sing on singstar. We were always good at that song and put our entire effort into it. After a while we would just start randomly singing that song and it became *our song*.  In 2006 he went to college and left me. When he first left we would talk on the phone like every other day and he would fill me in his classes and tell me how different everything was. After enough time he started making new friends and our calls became weekly, then monthly, and when exams came we barely got to talk. His sophomore year I bought him the *The Better Life* CD for his birthday. I shipped it to him because he wouldn't be able to come home for his 20th birthday.   He got it 3 days before his birthday and called me and we talked for hours. We hadn't talked in couple weeks so catching up was good. He was getting into the core classes and was learning VHDL which is a hardware description language that EE's use and he had to design a processor for a class. He was swamped with work but still talked to me. After so many years of listening to this song, we never had gotten the cd.   He was going to college to become an Electrical Engineer because of the stories our mom told us about the engineers from her work. She would always describe the labs and the work on their white boards with us and always told us she wanted us to go to college. She wanted us to have a better life. The better life. The CD was perfect in every way. He wanted to help my mom move into a real house. He wanted to help pay her back for all what she had been through for us. He wanted her to never have to worry about money again.   He told me about the processor project and about a solidstate class he was taking where he learned about the physics of transistors. He told me about the people he met at his school's IEEE club and about a design competition he wanted to enter. His team was considering something on placement aware devices. The idea was that if your phone could know where it was, it could change setting such as ring load if in a bag or vibrate softly if on a table.   It was good to talk to him but that call, like all others, came to an end.   Everything was normal for two years, we would talk occasionally, he would fill me in on the awesome things he was learning and I wouldn't have much to tell him about middle school but he would still listen and give advice.   Two years later we got a call.  At 11pm an officer called. My mom was at work so I had to take it. He told me that my brother was in an accident and to notify my mom. I froze. I didn't believe him. I wanted it to be a joke. I hung up and collapsed on the floor crying. It felt like I was hit by a brick wall. I couldn't swallow, couldn't breathe, couldn't move. I felt cold and had no idea what to do. After I managed to stop crying I called my mom. She asked me if it was a small accident, if he was ok, or what. I repeated what the cop said, that he was in the hospital. That was all I knew or managed to understand from the cop.   My mom got someone to take her work and my uncle drove us 5 hours to my brother's school. We had no idea what was happening in the mean time. My mom called the hospital a couple times and they updated her but didn't want to release too much over the phone or something. When we got to hospital at around 6am, a doctor told us he had died at 4:56. I remember it hadn't even been an hour so we must have gotten there a bit before 6am. A girl was leaving a party and was drunk and ran a red. My brother was on his way home from a lab and she crashed into him. The cops said she was speeding when she lost control and barrelled through the intersection. She had been ejected from her car and landed off to the side on the pavement. My brother was crushed in the car.   After a couple months she recovered fine and was sentenced to probation. The judge said some bullshit about how she was a good student and this was her first offense. "The knowledge that you took someone's life was enough of a punishment." I was so mad that she got off so easily. I followed every news article relating to her, tried to get as much info about her, basically stalked her. She seemed so happy, had no remorse. She ruined our lives and gets to forget about it eventually.   Thats what it is like to be 13 and lose your best friend.   I eventually got over her a couple years ago. I finished high school last year. Life goes on. I got into my brother's college, started last semester, and I am going to be an Electrical Engineer too. There isn't a day I don't think of him. I want to get my EE degree for him. Do what he wanted and help my mom.   To live a better life.   I can't even listen to that song anymore.   I will always miss you, superman.                                 	122
  When you destroy secular dictatorships in Iraq, Libya and Syria, the result is Islamic State extremists. When you depose a duly elected government in Egypt, the result is Islamic State extremists. Seems no matter which way you turn the wrench, it ratchets to the same position.   I do not understand your criteria for inclusion. If my strident commentary is considered a violation of reddiquette, I can adjust to community standards. Please clarify.   The ongoing catastrophe at Fukushima gets little media coverage, considering how central it is to the critical issue of a sustainable industrial future. Many hail nuclear power as necessary alternative to fossil fuels, with which even James Lovelock could concur. While Germany has prudently decided to decommission its nuclear reactors, aging units stud much of the developed world. The disaster at Fukushima was a Black Swan event, where a mega-earthquake produced a tsunami sufficient to top a seawall and drown the backup diesel generators necessary to cool the offline reactors. Japanese have great technical prowess, but failed in due diligence. What then, can we expect as less meticulous nations, especially China, proceed on the nuclear pathway at full bore?  I grant that this article by Robert Hunziker, posted first to the Counterpunch.org and now forwarded to Oilprice.com by Zero Hedge, comes via two sources that tend toward hyperbole. Likewise, Dr. Helen Caldicott has stood in the anti-nuclear pulpit for decades, foretelling imminent disaster  but Cassandra did prove to be accurate. Some facts are not in dispute. Three nuclear reactors melted down and these are still leaking large quantities of radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean. Four years on, the status (or even the precise location!) of the melted cores is poorly understood, and though many billions have been spent on the cleanup effort, full containment of the radioactive waste could take decades  that is, if the means are found to do so. See this related item http://phys.org/news/2015-06-small-robot-interior-fukushima-daiichi.html. Robots get fried -- yes indeed. We do not need robotic chauffeurs, what we need is superhero robot.       Shuddering is justified. How have the Western publics allowed this shit-fest to recur? Granted, we suffer distraction from the debacles of Iraq, Libya, Syria, et al; through continuous, economic corrosion; by our daily witness of the accelerating destruction of the biosphere  but in permitting our leadership to resume the Cold War, we have abdicated the last of our civic responsibility. What is most disturbing about Max Fishers rambling explainer is not the catalogue of mutual intrusions, threats and policy shifts by the opposing camps, it is his one-sided assumptions of culpability. Russia (or Putin) is aggressive. Putin (or Russia) is paranoid. While the military colossus that attempts to bestride the world is the USA. The Russians do not arm Mexico; why is the new Ukrainian Finance Minister a lobbyist from Chicago? I see Russia as being realistic in preserving its national interests. As is typical of Americans (including myself), Fishers analysis is lacking in historical context. I will spare the reader my amateur recounting of the past century, but for two salient points  the Soviet Union was a failed and murderous vehicle for the preservation of the Russian Empire, and most of these new members of NATO were either minor allies or extensive collaborators with the Nazis in their genocidal war against the Russian people. (Poland is an exception; however, if not the Red Army, many more Poles would have perished in the death camps.) Why do we stir the ashes to rekindle so much hatred?  I find it laughable that Max Fisher seems critical of German pacifists. Rightly, Germany understands that Russia is now their vital economic partner, for an exchange of manufactures for resources, and perhaps, from experience, they are not as sanguine as he is of the success of a NATO blitzkrieg capturing Moscow. I do hope our generals do not expect something similar to our romp into Bagdad. Equally astounding is his characterization of Eisenhower as the reluctant nuclear warrior. He should read the recent history by Evan Thomas, Ikes Bluff  its thesis is that in the event of any Soviet (or Chinese) aggression, the grinning Ike threatened (intended) to respond with a nuclear first strike, an all-out massive retaliation. He did not believe in limited war. Thomas suggests that ulterior purpose of the Interstate Highway System was to facilitate the evacuation of major U.S. cities in advance of our nuclear attack.  While avoiding any criticism of the reckless expansion of NATO, or our creation of a failed Ukrainian state, Fisher seems almost glib in presenting scenarios for nuclear disaster. However, the article is a valuable warning of the stakes of the approaching US elections. The thought of another idiot, reckless Bush brother or the vapid, jet-setting Mrs. Clinton (she of the Russian reset button prop) as the next Commander-in-Chief should really make us shudder. Let us hope that both Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders make respectable showings, and their campaigns become the nuclei for an effective, dual opposition to all of these mad geopolitical adventures.    Being deficient in financial and technical resources, I do use Microsoft products, and while they have steadily improved over the decades, they have typically been the opposite of innovative. Of all the technology tycoons, the founder of Microsoft is least capable of meeting an urgent need in high risk investments in breakthrough technologies  should you need an underperforming knock-off to force on a captive consumer, only then he is your man. Nor does his miracle of the automobile metaphor inspire confidence  that implies relying on a consumer and market driven solution to the Carbon Crisis, albeit one generously larded with public subsidies. Mr. Gates has been a public booster of the works of Vaclav Smil, but seems to have missed one of the professors vital points  the infrastructure of energy production and distribution are enormous investments built over decades. As eleiti cites above, what is required is a massive, crash program, and a consortium of the principal, and principled, governments must take the lead of it. The World Wars offer parallels, but the scale and stakes of this enterprise dwarfs the scale of those efforts.  In his most analytical mode, Mr. Gates must understand this, yet his intellect has one pathological drive  he covets status. This is why he built a voracious and innovation killing monopoly, and the Gates and Wife Foundation exists to perpetuate this egotistical quest  I expect that the Taj Mahal too, avoided estate taxes. Income derived from fossil fuels is a reliable prop for his Foundation, and should others divest from these industries, that also could undermine his eponymous, good works  an astronomical cost indeed.   Attention Mr. Gates  all that you covet will not long survive you. Sell all that you have and give it to those who are willing and capable to do what is necessary. Achieve that noble fame, or alternatively, you can continue to be an asshole.      	7
 Hows it going so far friend?   It exists and you WILL get to it. Imagine how incredible it will be. Finally feeling content and free. You have to put your heart and soul into climbing out of hell. Practice meditation. Seek psychiatrists. Do everything you can. You get one life. Its worth fighting for even for 10 minutes of bliss at the end.    Haha. I also always get really existential and upset with the idea of non-existence at night. Don't worry, its usually a night thing and tomorrow morning you will feel fresh and fine.   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alan+watts+death  Watch any Alan Watts video on death and it will make you feel a lot better. Death isn't something to be afraid of. Realise that you are the universe.   Hey! Don't worry you will be fine. Go make a glass of water and fill it to the brim with ice. Make it so cold it almost hurts to drink and then drink it.   Relax...It's only an exam. You are not dying. Imagine you have been fighting a war for the last 5 years. A gruesome horrific war. And all of a sudden teleported to you right now about to take an exam. You think that person would care about taking this exam? Who cares if you fail its only an exam. Of course you'll do your best but it doesn't matter if you don't.   Also change your mind from "I'm going to fail this exam" to "I'm gonna do as much as I can to pass"    Is it night time where you are now?    Yeah I completely see where you are coming from. You should work really hard in the next few days and try and get into med school then (but with the mind-set that no matter what happens you will still be happy). Don't under-estimate yourself. Of course it's not an ideal situation but its still possible. Do what you can with the cards in your hand :)   As a 19 year old guy who is a HUGE game of thrones fan. I can 100% tell you that your boyfriend does not watch it for the boobs. Also the first few episodes may make you feel like there is always nudity but it really gets less and less frequent as the show goes on and got more popular. The show is amazing and you should absolutely watch it if you are interested.  I think the real issue here that you need to address is the  fact that you get jealous at the thought of him looking at boobs. There was a really good video posted a while back where the guy explains scientifically why a guy might look at another girls breasts as its biologically programmed in men but also that literally 95% of the time if you were to ask them about that girl later on in the day they wouldn't even remember them. A guy is biologically programmed to look at breasts. Yes he might have a "hah boobs!" moment for about 5 seconds but after that he will forget about them and in no way should you feel jealous because he wants to be with you!  I'll actually try and find the video because it was really interesting.    Sucks that you are stressed! Exam season is always the worst. Nikosi Johnson said Do all you can with what you have, in the time you have, in the place you are. Whenever I feel bogged down with feeling like i'm "too late" or I've "run out of time" I change my perspective to one based off of this quote. It's not about what you haven't done in the past but what you can do now. Imagine you have a clean slate now and your just going to try your hardest in the time you have. Almost imagine a God-like deity coming down and controlling the body of kirbias for the next 4 days. Ask yourself what they would do in that situation and do it.   Also, from my own personal experience. Don't panic and work extremely long hard hours and burn out. Work smarter, not harder. Stay hydrated, energised and happy. Take regular breaks and study in small 20 minute bursts. Also look up the syllabuses or previous exam papers and see what questions/topics are most likely to come up.   Most importantly though, relax. Although exams can seem extremely important at the time, almost as if your whole life revolves around the next week or so, this is not the case. If I were to ask your older self about that stressful exam period you would either not remember it or say that you wish you weren't so stressed at such a prime, young and happy part of your life! :)   Once you're out you'll feel better! The sun is amazing for making you feel good but you have to actually leave the house for it to have an affect on you. Within 10 minutes you'll feel great. Go ride! :)   I play enhancement shaman and hunter, always nice to speak to fellow wow players :)   Also, when you do feel up for doing some of these tasks, do them one at a time. Don't look at it like "oh no I have all of this to do how am I gonna do it!?". Get a piece of paper and physically write one thing that you are going to do at a time and take it slowly. Break down complicated goals like "I'm going to get a job" into individual steps. It doesn't matter how minuscule these steps or progress is as long as you are making progress no matter how small it is! :)  	11
 I would take you out anywhere your heart desires 3   Apparently, in the future, global warming has clearly flipped the earths seasons on it's head. What we used to know as wintry Christmas time, is now the prime season for a tropical vacation, full of beach parties and sunbathing. I wonder if they still have presents.   Omg, you are too cute. I love your makeup, I love your hair, I love your socks. You are precious    I know a person who will be looking for a roommate come August or September. Who loves reading, Netflix, knitting, and art; and who's boyfriend loves tabletop gaming, lol. House will be with two other people in their mid-late 20s, 1 male, and 1 female. You will have your own room, and possibly your own bathroom. How do you feel about dogs?   Now that deserves a salute   Oh, haha. Well, regardless, you're still the cutest thing ever :)   You should check out a game called Hero Academy   Yes, yes they do ;)   If I was attracted to them, and we had chemistry, yes.

 I'm all for agreeing that the sky isn't falling, but this is still something to take note of:  A customer did something that sling doesn't like, *and they noticed*.  Then, sling *terminated their account*.  Depending on what the customer originally did, or what services they were using, this could be the start of something significant.

But in an earlier movie we see the image of the [comic] Phoenix Force move through the water at Lake Alkali(sp?).  So, a lot of us see that as the Phoenix Force coming to her to save her - showing it as a separate and self-conscious entity, like in the comics.  edit: grammar    Oh god yea, the mods at TheTVDB are horrible.  They could easily track/present information in multiple ways, but instead they give everyone a big *fuck you thats why*.   Journalists are writers, and they have to paint~~s~~ pictures of stories with words.  The kid was an honor student.  That's his most recent claim-to-fame.  Its completely reasonable to refer to him as that.   Its a joke, because you are being overly defensive.  I'm sorry that you dont get it.  You still need to take a break from the conversation.   Exactly.  The only thing saving Logan is his fast healing-factor counteracting being torn apart (I don't even think his adamantium figures into this).  Nothing else on his person should be surviving the onslaught.   Because [in the comic books] the phoenix force isnt a mutant ability.  Its a "cosmic" entity/power that takes over people.  Part of Jean's ability to control it as long as she did was relying on her mutant mental powers.   WAITRESS:  Doesn't matter.  Got tip.    You need to realize that not every situation a cop is forced into is going to end up with the cop doing the wrong thing.  And no one is saying it is.  You're getting really defensive really quick.

When telling a story, in any medium, these are things people want to know.  Its interesting, and its how you tell a narrative as a writer.  With that said, as far as I have heard so far, all this kid was is drunk and belligerent.  I'd love to know why he was shot and killed.   This is pretty much the one thing that dissapoints me about 3.33.  I only give it a pass because I realize that a lot of time has passed since Misato last saw Shinji.  She has clearly seen some shit.  But, as a fan and a viewer of the rebuilds, it is seriously annoying to not have a better understanding as to just wtf has tarnished everyone's attitudes so much.     I think this is an otaku version of a newish womens-fashion thing I recently started seeing infomercials for.  The "thing" is this band-like fabric that wraps your torso and goes over your pants.  The main thing about it is that if you have a short shirt, if you bend over of whatever, you wont expose your midriff.  If you crouch, you wont expose your panties/whale-tale.  I dunno wtf you call it, but its some sort of modesty apparel, so you can still dress in trampy styles, but not expose your undies.   I loved it.  But I can understand the hate, especially if you weren't expecting a massive divergence from the original storyline/timeline.   You're partially correct, and I have corrected my original response.

Thanks for the re-education on this. Amazing how memories can be distorted over time.  I recalled buying the colored graphic novels before seeing the movie in the US.  No doubts that the original first-run manga was b/w.   I've been really enjoying it - and I didnt think that I would going in.  Half-way through the first season I found myself thinking to myself, "This is like a great version of TLOEG.  I wonder what Alan Moore thinks of this".   How odd.  I thought I was already watching a new series/reboot of The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen...  it's called Penny Dreadful, and its on Showtime.   Clearly, you are done with the internet, and should see yourself out.   Pull this kind of shit in the wrong area, and you'll come out to find your car flipped over.   Ahh, the far-end of Little Tajunga Canyon Rd?   Are you sure about that?  Because the one I owned (25+ volumes) was not printed by Marvel, and they actually cut english-language production before the US run was completed - with the remainder released in B W and on much lower-quality stock.   you cannot "stream" without transcoding.  If you want to direct-play subtitles, you can - typically if the subtitle is in a separate file, *and your Plex client supports it*.  As an example, my Samsung TV can direct-play .srt (SubRip) subtitles.  So when I use Plex on my local lan, I make efforts to never have to stream/transcode, and am able to direct-play everything.   TIL they are related.   You ain't got no lube, Lt. Dan!   no stabilization can help this video.   The movie HAD to pull out all stops artistically, because the comic was a top-notch digital-color very high-quality graphic novel.  At the time, it was the most beautiful comic I had ever seen.  I didnt even know that level of "comic" quality was possible at the time.   The original comic in Japan was huge (in length/depth) in comparison to the movie.  I was shocked they did as well as they did.   I love this sub.   Although he approached it incorrectly, to give him the benefit of the doubt, he may be attempting to prevent his own liability against sexual harassment.  By this, I mean, he has to constantly observe his students for their physical behavior.  He was to watch for posture, as well as foot/leg/arm/hand positioning.  As a man, I can only imagine this leaves him open to accusations of lecherous behavior.  I dont think there is any "right way" to approach this with him, aside from genuine honesty.  He used stereotypical male humor to approach an issue, that unfortunately perpetuates a sexual bias.  If he seems sincere, it may be better to just let it slide.  Not everyone is an expert in political correctness, nor is every situation an appropriate teaching moment.  Again - only if he seem to be genuinely sincere in his policy reasons, I would approach this after-the-fact, with him directly or to his employer.  Doing anything during will only add to the discomfort of the situation, and continue to downgrade your paid-for learning experience.  Thinking on it more, I wouldn't approach this with him directly.  I would approach the company, so it can be a learning experience at a higher-level, and hopefully be something that is disseminated to all of their staff.  I would keep my name out of it, and if the teacher seemed sincere, I would not name him specifically either.  I would want this to be a positive outcome event, not a negative one.  If it becomes negative (if someone is penalized, loses their job, etc) the moment of positive influence is lost - and negative stereotypes will be further enforced.   or Nazis.   **I am not a doctor.**  In my experience, if you didn't put anything new on your face, this is an allergic reaction to something you ingested.   was disappointed it didn't say "too long" on his crotch....   \\\_()\_/      balls deep.

 And thus the slow and calculated conquest of the word by GabeN begins.   This is my greatest fear...   They'd probably like this over in /r/VirtualFreakout    I would totally love to draw cracks on the floor with a pencil!   A new vegas DLC where you travel to the heartlands of the leigon. Inside the totalitarian regime you can either choose to help Caesar suppress a large rebel, or, you can support the cause, bring down the harsh dictator and creating a new series of smaller states. Yet another option would be to fight both sides for your, or the NCR's gain.  I'd really love to see this because the legion is so hyped up in the vanilla game and we see so little of it in the game that it's honestly a bit of a tragedy. Bethesda missed a golden opportunity with the legion, think about it, roads, aqueducts, law enforcement, all of these are things that are mentioned in the base game and never delivered upon. It'd be awesome to see all the public works built by the romans that Caesar surely would've recreated.  Plus, it would give a nice moral lesson and parallel history, the rebels representing barbarians and the legion representing the legion. Because after all...  Rome. Rome never changes.

  I'd like to see a situation where we'ed get to see the public works built by the leigon. Think about it, if caesar is actually basing himself off of the old caesar's of the roman empire then he would surely adopt one of the practices the romans were most notable for. It'd be nice to be able to go a bit deeper into leigon territory to see things like roads and aqueducts and water purification systems. That's part of why the old empire was so successful.

You'd need to have a good understanding of CSS, HTML, probably Ruby, Javascript, maybe PHP. And you'd have to understand how to organize a database effectively. Next, you'd have to get a host. I doubt your internet is strong enough to hold more than 100-500 people in your web server so you'd have to get a pro hosting company to help you there.  Then would come the trouble of hosting the server, making sure it all runs smoothly and efficiently. Server management, making sure you don't explode, etc.  Then you'd have to attract people. If you just want to be able to talk to around 10 people then you might as well just get an IRC going. If you want to attract the kinds of visitors that omegle gets then you'd have to have some form of viral marketing going for you.   Alright, your server runs fine, the webpage works and looks good, you've got a couple thousand people on and it all looks good. You go to chat with someone and they say "ASL?"  Well great. Now you have to moderate it to get rid of people like that. Good luck having any freetime at all because you're so pre-occupied with making these people behave.  Alright, let's say you put filters in place to auto-block these people. Well, they all leave, after all the people who just ask "ASL" leaves (Which is 90% of omegle) you'll be left with a couple hundred to a thousand people who actually want to talk.  But guess what! they don't want to be on anymore because now 90% of the population is gone and there's no one to talk to.  So good job, you've got maybe 30-50 people on at a time who are actually good to talk to. Talk to them. Eventually you run out of strangers and everyone gets bored.  Now, if you keep paying the server bill then people may, occasionally pass by your site, pop in and see that it's a ghost town and then promptly leave.  Is this what you want?   No one can defeat him. God save us all.   You should probably seek some form of legal action against her.

 Who invited 2014 CJ Wilson?   You can't be serious   Except against us. Give him a rest against us, you know, so you don't blow out his arm. Then I'm okay with this.   We didn't score..hard to blame Morin completely. Yes he let them wedge the game open a bit, but we didn't score. Richards loses even if he gets the last out there.   This sub is ridiculous, no sense of perspective on here at all.    Yeah it seemed that way from what I saw of the situation. Same thing seemed like it happened to Adam Eaton too, more or less.  You guys are ekeing your way back to respectability though, hopefully in a couple of seasons you'll be back in contention. Goldy sure is fun to watch.   Thanks Latrell   CAN WE SCORE PRETTY PLEASE OUR OFFENSE IS GOOD I PROMISE   A lot of Angels fans thought he got thrown off by the Home Run Derby, but yeah he just wasn't that good at all after May.   Yeah trading Upton was Towers having an axe to grind right? He just didn't like his lack of hustle/grit/whatever. And Trumbo is a vastly inferior player, yeah haha.     I was of the opinion Trumbo was a drag on our offense because of it before we dealt him. Most of the homers he hit the year before were in April or May. He was flat-out bad after the All-Star break that year.  Yep, that's exactly what happened to us with him too. When he's hitting Trumbombs it's okay, but when those stop flowing he becomes a strikeout machine and huge drag on the offense.   Haha I was actually just making a joke from Infinite Jest, where Canada and the US keep arguing whether it's The Great Concavity or The Great Convexity.  But yeah, that too!   I guess I replied sloppily, my bad. I didn't mean we shouldn't be getting more than we have been (you're right, we're down), we just shouldn't be getting much more. This area isn't supposed to get much rain, and that's what I read you as saying.   Weave's velocity has been on the way down for a few years now, but at the beginning of this year his fastball dropped all the way down to 83-84, and he's gotten thrashed a couple of times. He said himself he felt like he was throwing BP on the mound. That being said, he's a gamer if I've ever seen one, and I still have faith in him. He threw a complete game shutout against the Astros his last time out. It'll be interesting to see if he can produce for us. Even though he started Opening Day again for us this year, realistically, he's our #3 at best.   Convexing!   It's actually turning into a big deal that people don't understand this with the drought. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what southern California should be able to support population-wise, amongst most people. People don't understand the urgency of water conservation because there are no signs to them that we're running out. Water comes out of the faucet when they turn it on, and that's the only interaction 95% of people have with their water supply.  But anyway, yes, baseball is good and I like it.   Was counting it in Gold Glove defense, but yeah, the dude can unload the ball.   Yeah to be honest, I thought we got an unbelievably good deal. His career OBP was under .300 when we dealt him. Even though he was a fan favorite, I was psyched when news of that deal came through. It's worked out well too, Skaggs was good last year before TJ, and Santiago has an ERA under 2.50 right now.   Glad this is noticed. Kole is a really good player. Gold Glove caliber defense, plus 15-20 HR pop and a .300 average in the leadoff spot. He's the sparkplug for the team too   Wow that's bad. Good old Trumbo.  How do you guys feel about that trade?   No we shouldn't. Mediterranean climate essentially means coastal desert.   It's okay, I was cussing at the out-of-town scoreboard when I saw you guys take the lead.   This is a pretty steep discount since he wants to stay in LA; annual value is roughly what he'd get on the market, but he'd have gotten at least another year.   He gave us a pretty substantial discount because he wanted to stay in Socal. He was looking for 4 years/~$37 million, and likely would've gotten it, given what elite closers are going for nowadays. Awesome news for us.   X-rays came back negative actually   Yeah the time calls were getting later and later. In the 10th it was justified cuz of all the looking down at second, but in the 11th it was just silly a couple times.    I was at the game and I didn't think he had any chance of scoring when I saw the ball off the bat. Wasn't even close at the plate, Featherston scored easy.    Yeah, I'm skeptical of extrapolating a pace this early in the year, but he's definitely running well.   Yeah the steals declining is almost exclusively due to Pujols hating it when people in front of him go. I'd say we'll see at least 30 from him this year.   What are you using to say his speed is declining? I watch him play all the time, and he's super super fast.  He runs a lot less ever since he moved to the 2 hole in the lineup, because Pujols really doesn't like it when people on base in front of him are trying to steal. But Pujols has gotten over it a bit, and he's opening up the running game a little bit more.   He has 7 stolen bases so far this year.   You guys are currently dead last in the majors in BABIP (and here I was feeling bad for us at 28th). You'll rebound.   Ouch. I saw something about how you guys were really lucky in 1 run games last year, so paying the piper I guess :/  Still, it has sucked to have Zobrist out I'm sure. And Doolittle being on the DL can't have helped your bullpen.   This will change, it has to change..right?   I mean, they've definitely done it before, so who am I to question it?  But still, I didn't think they were gonna be very good, and so far they're not. Plenty of time to turn it around though. They have had some poor injury luck.   Am I the only one that didn't feel like they were actually gonna be that good?   I hope so too! I really like Efren.   Gotta be the Astros right?   Efren has to stay in the minors for at least 10 days since he got optioned back, so they called up Krauss instead.   Moreso than anything else, it's the TV thing. You guys don't bring new markets, so you don't bring new money, and therefore have nothing that the conference really wants.   It makes me happy.   Sucks for us, awesome for the bullpen. Get fresh, cuz it'll be 3 weeks between off days.   Colon being the best in the "teehee, fat guy pitching" sense. Both of them were really good for us.   I forgot about the best one. Totally forgot he was on the team that far back.   WAIT THIS IS THE SAME KEVIN GREGG  HOW  I JUST ASSUMED. "GREGG'S NOT THAT UNCOMMON OF A LAST NAME"   The Rockies don't need an ace, they need a whole rotation. And if you're trading any of the cornerstones (Arenado, CarGo, Tulo), you better be getting established major league talent AND prospects.   But I'm sure the fact that the Phillies are rebuilding and just so happen to have an ace on the trading block has nothing to do with your willingness to trade the Rockies' star players for an ace.   I'm excited to have you guys in town this week. Never seen Tulo, CarGo, or Arenado play in person, and I'm stoked.  (pls don't beat us though)   This is awesome.  Might be cool to try and work in the culture around the game, like all the ballpark food (good way to teach some of those words too), and clips of people celebrating, that kind of thing.   **A River Runs Through It, by Norman Maclean**   I can understand that perspective. I usually recommend Thousand Autumns as a starting point for Mitchell because it's a more traditional narrative structure, but still has really good examples of a lot of Mitchell's hallmarks (like you were saying).   Thousand Autumns does have an unusual rhythm to its pacing though, so I can see how you'd feel that way.   Does anyone have any context?   I picked up *Disgrace* by J.M. Coetzee at a thrift store with no expectations, and it really delivered. A haunting look at a man growing old and realizing he never really figured much of anything out. Devestating, and incredible. Read it in a couple of days.  *A Prayer For Owen Meany* also got me. The novel inhabits such a weird but wonderful (in a weird way of course) world.   There's not much fiction, but there's a ton of great outdoor nonfiction writing. John Muir, Edward Abbey, Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall, Sigurd Olson, Henry David Thoreau, Eric Shipton..try a few, see what you like.     Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Larry McMurtry are all very known Western writers.   Oh yeah basketball has very little to do with it in most cases, and a limited role at best. As has been proven by every single conference realignment move.   Grantland is an ESPN property, so Simmons will be leaving there too.   We've been really glad to have him, dude's been incredible. Walk-off double two nights ago too   Seconded. I think Thousand Autumns is a really good Mitchell book to start with.   I mean to be fair, if La Tech couldn't get one in any of the last 3 years, and you guys couldn't get one last year...safe to say an at-large isn't gonna happen.   The Angels being only 3 games under .500 is actually kind of miraculous and deeply troubling at the same time.   The perceived weakness of the team, starting pitching, has actually been pretty good outside of Weaver, who's "throwing BP out there", as he put it himself.  But the bullpen, one of the strongest in the league last year, has given away 4 or 5 games at least, already. Largely because we have Huston Street in the 9th, Joe Smith in the 8th, and who the hell knows before them. Smith had some bad BABIP luck that caused him to cough up a couple games, and now Street's arm is about to fall off from being literally the only reliable guy so far this year, and it's showing (2 blown saves in a row, including 3 runs in the 9th last night to fumble away a 2-0 lead and the win).  But the most troublesome thing to me is the way the offense has looked. Outside of Trout and Johnny Giavotella (who has been amazing, and is making a lot of Angels fans really glad we traded Howie, which is something I never would've thought possible), the offense is sputtering mightily. Calhoun has gotten it going as of late, and I think he'll stay there. Pujols has had bad BABIP luck, so hopefully that changes. But this is the main reason we're losing games. We had the league leading offense last year. In the past week, we're scoring less than 2 and a half runs per game, and that seems right about our season average. It's a small wonder that we've been losing games with our bullpen. That's what happens when you give a razor-thin margin of error.    TL;DR Angels have sputtered in a big way, but surprisingly because of the offense, not the pitching   Big outfield, both aren't very good defenders anyway, and Myers is being forced to play CF even though he's a corner outfielder because Kemp and Upton already take the corners.   That's not in their defense haha. The Angels were dickheads for the way we acted, and the Yankees are too   Guys, this is supposed to be funny. Just laugh   I saw a few people with us in third, but no one had us lower than that.   Street's been pretty good for us :D   Jackson's not seeing the majors any time soon. Organizational depth. Still, nice to get something, anything, back for a guy we cut.   It's ridiculously well established that the best teams don't always win in the playoffs.   I mean, given the sheer amount of talent you've been able to call up in the past few years, it's about damn time the cupboard is bare.   Yeah I know I was mostly just being sad hahah. Dude's been awful. Although he's starting to hit the ball harder.   That makes me really happy to hear. It's seemed like he's doing well from afar, glad to hear it's indeed the case!    Certainly not this year...   We don't hold the schools to the standard of full 4 year scholarships. Players lose their scholarships, and it's not even rare.   It wasn't meant to be a bulletproof comparison, just an illustration of the fact that sometimes 1 hit is a big deal.  Hamilton wasn't good in the series, almost entirely because he was playing through injury. That homer was incredibly clutch, and should have won the series for them, and is even more impressive given the injury he was playing through. Both of those things can be true at the same time.   He had a sports hernia..  In related news, Kirk Gibson was pretty worthless outside of his home run in 1988.   Yep, exactly. There's also the Mudiay approach, he played in China this year (although a lot of people think it's probably because he wouldn't have been eligible at SMU).   I could actually see the NYY fan turnout going down a bit without Jeter there to vote into the starting lineup yet again. It'll be interesting to see if that has an effect.  But on the real, ARod. That would be amazing.   He can go to the NBA one year after graduating high school. Everything that has come out indicates he will graduate in June, so he will be eligible to enter the NBA Draft next year.  This point has been a particularly obstinate piece of misinformation.   Well, there's always *Fight Club*.   Yeah it's really not close, the 2011 team was on one to make it to the title game.   They were a 3 actually.   Wow, thanks for all the legwork! I want to say someone had a Gordon triple timed between 10.5 and 11, which would tilt the math towards a bang-bang play, but holding him was definitely the right call given how it went down. Just a fun thought experiment.   Pete Kozma and Daniel Descalso look identical when wearing hats   Wish I remembered where I'd seen it so I could link you, but I saw Gordon's fastest time to 3rd last year compared to the time at which Crawford got the relay throw, and it seemed to show that Crawford would've had a good chance to get him, but that Gordon would've had a chance to be safe as well.    THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S HARD OUT HERE SOMETIMES   My impression of that play was that he was charging it hard to make it look like he could get to it, when in reality he was never gonna get it and was only charging it to feint Canha into not scoring. Which worked.   Ian Kinsler. He's just always come off like a colossal douche to me; glad he's out of the division now.   If he would've been sprinting out of the box, the times suggest it would've been a play at the plate.  Given that he was not sprinting out of the box because he expected it to be a single, the consensus is that he was out by 40 feet if he turns.   WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT. I WAS BEING NICE.   IT'S OKAY BRO, JUST GET JOSH TO A PLACE OF PERSONAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY AGAIN SO HE CAN RECLAIM HIS LIFE AND WE CAN ALL WATCH. BASEBALL IS BETTER WITH A HAPPY, HEALTHY, EFFECTIVE JOSH HAMILTON.  EXCEPT AGAINST US, PLEASE DON'T DO IT AGAINST US. AS A FAVOR FOR EATING THE CONTRACT.   Not in the past 2 weeks.   I almost feel like you should have to commit to your appeal if you make it now. Like if you file it, you have to take it all the way through. Just to keep people from doing this.   THANK YOU BASED TROUT   *The Financial Lives of Poets* by Jess Walter. Dude is just a really funny writer in general, but this one especially made me laugh.   Really? I'd always heard the opposite, but I guess none of those were sourced.   That was a great inning defensively for Featherston.  	92
 Two of the victims who are still being forced to live around the predator and the predators supporters it's the same as trying to talk to a abused child while the abuser stands over his shoulder giving the kid death stares. Theirs no way you can get an actual idea of what is going on in that environment.    Are their any studies on this? showing trans suicide rates in more progressive regions versus more hostile? that would be a good study.     Been agreeing with your post in glad to see their are advocates like you for transpeople. But i was reading through one of your links about trans people throughout history, i'm a history major myself http://www.bilerico.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php and allot of this seems to be speculation heavily based on the instances of crossdressing or genderless deities.  Much like how some people use the presence of societies worshiping female warrior deities as an example that their have been female warriors when deities themselves are more of a ideal in not actually a factual basis, other examples like in south america of women dressing as men also does not reinforce this idea. In albania it's common for women to dress up as men if they're no men remaining in order to lead or protect their families, while i'm not outright disagreeing but allot of the cited cases don't to be transgender but more akin to a mulan if you will. Not people who actually identify as the other gender.    Very informative thank you.    Not a hater of trans people please don't dm me. But question is it true john hopkins officially stopped performing reassignment surgery and declared this a mental illness?      Not disagreeing but you'r comfortable others may not be. I think this really will always come down to how people feel on a case by case basis.    I don't get this, one minute we're supposed to get over human body issues and next we should all have non gendered separate stalls for privacy? are we becoming more progressive or conservative?   Their perspective if heavily influenced by their family is not theirs but a orchestrated ploy by the family for pure PR.   Bitchball more like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07mBfR8erMY   You're the people who are shitting on america just for being america. That's the definition of nationalism, you think your country is better then america, you're better then us because you consider us ignorant. That's the height of bullshit nationalism, i could easily go off on the shithole you more then likely live in but i don't, that's why i like my country, call us conceited but we could careless about 99% of other countries. We do not spend half of our free time bitching about some country we have never been to, will probably never visit and does not effect us in any way. Only you come on reddit, american site, using google a american search engine, with a fucking laptop, cellphone or computer probably from america to bitch and moan about the very country providing you with the tool's to call them ignorant. Do you see the level of irony in that?  All of the comments i have seen have been nothing more then a circle jerk of f america because that's popular. Jesus get over yourselves, if we compete then we compete. Have fun flopping on your grass, i did not say we could be the best i said we could compete. Only thing worse then a boastful fool is a dismissive fool like yourself.  Your issue is you think you're the end all of soccer, where you from? i bet your country is not even that great, but you condescendingly act like your the master of it, do you even play? jesus i can admit i'm inexperienced but at-least i state this, you act like your opinion is any more factual then mine, jesus it's like that movie on the Jamaican bob sled team, you know little about how our country develops our athlete so stop talking like you do. We don't know what would occur until it bloody happens, all i know is that in general we dominate the world Olympics in various competitions. Our population is the WORLD! we have immigrants from Ecuador, Brazil,Spain England etc, you really think we could not be a competitive soccer team? you act like your clubs don't recruit internationally  and are made up of players from across the globe. You act like a us team could not do the same just shut it.   If you think that theirs some magical knowledge that is ingrained into your blood stream at having a good soccer team or you need some great culture to kick a ball around then just stop it. Your the same as the idiots who say we would be the best at soccer from the get go.    Pretty fly for a white guy.    Tell that to the sikhs.    True but it goes into the american thing. Americans are not white, we're americans. Majority does does not wipe out the fact they're Tuareg and other darker skinned algerians.     http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/algerian-traditional-dress/ It's alright while most algerians are pretty light Tuareg also come from algeria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people Just call me him a Tuareg   You mean cricket? is that the thing with the bat or is... oh wait you mean the biggest sport where it's not really sport but where you pretend to be injured for 10 minutes. I think that's called acting where we come from, one opponent that happened to at one point or another controlled or influenced one third of the world.    No were not claiming anything. We simply stated we could compete if soccer was more popular in america, just like we could compete if cricket became more popular in america. This is not a claim but a well established facts, america does amazing in the Olympics. On a international scale we repeatedly shown we're definitely top ten in most sports.  I could give a fuck all about your football, but stop acting like you idiots have a set recipe for making great football players. England invented the sport in they suck at it, yet i here people making the same bullshit excuses about how america is only good at sports we invent. I have no idea who does guys are, so i have nothing to compare them too. It's not about having 6ft tall beast though, you are stereotyping because you have a onesided view of american athleticism, we have 300+ people we're not all Michael jordans, have you seen american quarter backs? look at brett favre? you call him a example of athleticism, a QB does not have to be a adonis of athleticism to be good or even great at the game some of the best one's were couch potato's. we can find 5ft7 guys just like we found the women for soccer.  But to do that we need coaching staff, we need people to actually care about the sport. Jesus this is why america does not care about world opinion, you assume we're ignorant and not conscientious then are shocked when you're proven wrong. You guys are the most elitist jackasses i have ever seen, all we're stating is that we could compete, just like we always do and we could be good. Because guess what, that's what being an american is, even if we suck we don't give in, we keep practicing and trying harder. We don't believe in defeatism or relegating ourselves to being underdogs. Maybe you guys should stop being assholes in maybe try learning this thing called sportsmanship? oh wait no you guys are just a bunch of ultra nationalist who use football to talk shit about other countries while decrying america as a hive of uberpatriots fuck off.    "And the reason it never became popular is because you kind of suck at football. It's really a catch-22 moment for you guys. You're not good at football because it's not popular, and it's not popular because you're not good at it."   You contradict yourself saying Americans don't suck at football because we don't care but because we just suck in general. Then use this to say you don't care about women soccer that's why the us won. It's contradictory bullshit. Your an idiot. We could give a shit about soccer, we care even less for women soccer yet we still won it. Nobody cares about half the sports america competes in during the Olympics yet we still get gold, get over yourself. Sucking at a sport does not mean you don't care about it, plus we don't suck at soccer our men team is actually pretty decent from what i hear.    The american's who went to the moon, winning the space race, developed most of the technology you're using right now to say we're shit at most things and the people who dominate the epitome of athleticism every 4 years when the world collectively comes together to get stomped by the us Olympic team. Yeah buddy keep on, you're just a delusional hater. God i really do hope soccer becomes more popular in america just so we can stomp you idiots in it.      In how well do they do in the Olympics? at the end of the day we have a set record for performing good in international event. Jesus we just won the female world cup, obviously Americans can compete on any level.    TIL to be good at soccer you must be born in Uruguay, have soccer in your blood, you must be born from your mother being impregnated by a soccer coach and you must eat a thousand blades of grass from the purest soccer turf. Only then my apprentice shall you master the ability of flopping.   In my experience their seems to be a bunch of people made about the women world cup still hating on americans for saying we might actually be able to compete if we cared to play.    Unique skill set, i'm pretty sure we can flop with the best of them.  320 million people who do not even know soccer is actually called football versus 3.5 million who's only chance of ever having a better life is through football..... yeah makes sense.    God this is why we don't like you soccer nations. Ingrained into your culture? jesus stop being full of yourselves. The fact England sucks shows how bullshit this argument about culture is.    Hakkzpets um we just won the women's world cup. Are you guys retarded or what. It's not popular because we don't care about soccer, we named it soccer for a reason. Now stfu in wait for the next olympics so we can dominate you little third world nations again.    How is it asinine, people are posting we only do good in sports that are popular here but no shit, that's how it works. Would spain,brazil or any of those countries be good in soccer if they were not extremely focused on them and very popular. America dominates in the Olympics, if we focused on soccer we would more then likely at-least be competitive to a certain extent. You in user https://www.reddit.com/user/CptMurphy think we're talking about oh we throw in a few running backs on the field and some point guards in bam we can win the world cup, no we're saying that if we focused our athletic resources and got kids into soccer at a early age like the rest of the world does, we could be on the same level as the rest of the world.  Remember america is a sleeping giant, don't wake us up.    Tell that to japan about baseball or china about soccer.    China loves basketball, japan loves baseball along with most Caribbean countries.    True. But we also dominate the olympics. Oh in we just won world cup thingy or w.e the world calls not football.    Bro i'm a zionist shill not. I don't use alternate accounts. If i did i might have more karma lolz. What am i praising kurds for? you're assyrian i'm guessing? i'm sorry if you feel like the kurds are pressing for control of territory your people want but i still support them. Compared to other parts of the region they're the best chance for stability.   If basra was safe then why did they change the gulf cup because of security concerns? listen i'm not against you i just support kurds. I don't dislike assyrians and i support all secular people, i dislike the iranian government yet i like their people because i know they're moderates. I've talked to a number of southern iraqi's on fb in i understand that they're atleast moderate enough to talk openly with jews/pro israeli's in even support israel, so that has drastically changed my view on shia. I don't particularly care for sunni's but the kurds are sunni in i respect them.  In yes i know about the embassy bombing, i know the kurds history, there are various groups who even kidnapped some foreign nationals back in the 90's but what's your point. I'm not stating that the kurds are perfect, israel has done questionable military strikes in the past but i still support them. The kurds are atleast in 5 different conflicts right now from isis, to syria, to the FSA/various rebel groups, turkey possibly and next it may be iran for all i know.    /r/shitredditsays basically they link reddit comments and have a circle jerk talking crap or making witty statements about the user in his comments or his "complex" or compensating or w.e basically like brigading without actually brigading. But who knows they probably pm the user too. I don't know how they do not get banned.   Aww now i see. You're mad because the kurds are building a state on your territory.    Indeed. Did not know this?  It has been said that the history of almost all of the Jewish holidays can be summed up succinctly: "They wanted to kill us; we won. Let's eat." Why has anti-Semitism been so pervasive in so many countries, in so many time periods and for so many reasons? (One begins to wonder. Perhaps there is something wrong with the Jews and Judaism? After all, there is an old Yiddish saying -- "If one person calls you a donkey, ignore him; if two people call you a donkey, buy a saddle.")  Between the years 250 CE and 1948 CE - a period of 1,700 years - Jews have experienced more than eighty expulsions from various countries in Europe - an average of nearly one expulsion every twenty-one years. Jews were expelled from England, France, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, Spain, Portugal, Bohemia, Moravia and seventy-one other countries.  Historians have classified six explanations as to why people hate the Jews:  Economic -- "We hate Jews because they possess too much wealth and power." Chosen People -- "We hate Jews because they arrogantly claim that they are the chosen people." Scapegoat -- "Jews are a convenient group to single out and blame for our troubles." Deicide -- "We hate Jews because they killed Jesus." Outsiders, -- "We hate Jews because they are different than us." (The dislike of the unlike.) Racial Theory -- "We hate Jews because they are an inferior race."  As we examine the explanations, we must ask -- Are they the causes for anti-Semitism or excuses for Anti-Semitism? The difference? If one takes away the cause, then anti-Semitism should no longer exist. If one can show a contradiction to the explanation, it demonstrates that the "cause" is not a reason, it is just an excuse. Let's look at some contradictions:  Economic -- The Jews of 17th- 20th century Poland and Russia were dirt poor, had no influence and yet they were hated.   Chosen People -- a) In the late 19th century, the Jews of Germany denied "Choseness." And then they worked on assimilation. Yet, the holocaust started there. b) Christians and Moslems profess to being the "Chosen people," yet, the world and the anti-Semites tolerate them.    Scapegoat -- Any group must already be hated to be an effective scapegoat. The Scapegoat Theory does not then cause anti-Semitism. Rather, anti-Semitism is what makes the Jews a convenient scapegoat target. Hitler's ranting and ravings would not be taken seriously if he said, "It's the bicycle riders and the midgets who are destroying our society."    Deicide -- a) the Christian Bible says the Romans killed Jesus, though Jews are mentioned as accomplices (claims that Jews killed Jesus came several hundred years later). How come the accomplices are persecuted and there isn't an anti-Roman movement through history? b) Jesus himself said, "Forgive them [i.e., the Jews], for they know not what they do." The Second Vatican Council in 1963 officially exonerated the Jews as the killers of Jesus. Neither statement of Christian belief lessened anti-Semitism.   Outsiders -- With the Enlightenment in the late 18th century, many Jews rushed to assimilate. Anti-Semitism should have stopped. Instead, for example, with the Nazis came the cry, in essence: "We hate you, not because you're different, but because you're trying to become like us! We cannot allow you to infect the Aryan race with your inferior genes."   Racial Theory -- The overriding problem with this theory is that it is self-contradictory: Jews are not a race. Anyone can become a Jew - and members of every race, creed and color in the world have done so at one time or another.(correction jews are a ethno-religious group)  Every other hated group is hated for a relatively defined reason. We Jews, however, are hated in paradoxes: Jews are hated for being a lazy and inferior race - but also for dominating the economy and taking over the world. We are hated for stubbornly maintaining our separateness - and, when we do assimilate - for posing a threat to racial purity through intermarriages. We are seen as pacifists and as warmongers; as capitalist exploiters and as revolutionary communists; possessed of a Chosen-People mentality, as well as of an inferiority complex. It seems that we just can't win.     Of all the extreme fanaticism which plays havoc in mans nature, there is not one as irrational as anti-Semitism.  If the Jews are rich [these fanatics] are victims of theft. If they are poor, they are victims of ridicule. If they take sides in a war, it is because they wish to take advantage from the spilling of non-Jewish blood. If they espouse peace, it is because they are scared by their natures or traitors. If the Jew dwells in a foreign land he is persecuted and expelled. If he wishes to return to his own land, he is prevented from doing so.  - Lloyd George stated in 1923     "The uniqueness of anti-Semitism lies in the fact that no other people in the world have ever been charged simultaneously with alienation from society and with cosmopolitanism, with being capitalistic exploiters and also revolutionary communist advocators. The Jews were accused of having an imperious mentality, at the same time they're a people of the book. They're accused of being militant aggressors, at the same time as being cowardly pacifists. With being a Chosen people, and also having an inferior human nature. With both arrogance and timidity. With both extreme individualism and community adherence. With being guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus and at the same time held to account for the invention of christianity."  - A speech about the irrationality of anti-Semitism  by professor Michael Curtis, of Rutgers University, 1987    Oh look neo-nazi's complaining about a positive story on jews. LOL   I already explained this. Muslims did not save him in ww2, it was Christians, now he feels a personal obligation to help those who helped him. Christians are a extreme minority in the region directly being persecuted, they're in the same position he was in back in the 1940's.  While i'm sure if he see's a fleeing muslim family he would not be like, you guys are not christians get out, he is focusing his efforts on christians because that's where he can do the most good and save the most people while also satisfying the debt he feels to those Christians who saved his life. But once again, people like you are not doing shit, just complaining, unless you want to fight isis be quiet.    I'm pretty sure the kindertransports had allot to do with their religious values not in spite of them. Christians are odd like that, one minute they're doing pogroms the next they're supporting jewish statehoods. You do realize Christianity is a offshoot of Judaism correct? once again millions of muslims, only thousands of christians. He's trying to help the most persecuted people who's very life is in danger.   Yes i'm well aware, it was also non existent until very recently for their to be any kind of terrorist attack in Iraqi Kurdistan and it's extremely peaceful compared to well any other part of iraq. In yeah but i agree, their maybe some islamist factions but of course there are, kurds are in the middle-east, it would be surprising if this was not the case  but atleast the kurds stick up to their radicals and implement moderation and secularism which is more then then allot of other countries do.    Pm me. How did it ruin the message of the film?  	37

I don't have a passion for anything I lost interest in most things about the age of 10 (idk what happened to me maybe some event or one of my childhood operations something gone wrong) after losing it at 10; my time became occupied with philosophy and just wasting time mindlessly or on intellectual things like science and math.

Possibly, i'l test around, I have been paleo for a month strict            haha, i have a rule of thumb, ask the question, why should I do that? rather than; why not?  What good evidence is there for me to eat grains? viola   Its better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing, than a long life spent in a miserable way. Alan Watts  I might pick the dream; I just don't want to be a hippy with a wasted life haha. On a serious note; Indeed the dream.   Working with ambiguity and a mix is fine.   My concern is the moment that I have to take the leap, the moment I have to be decisive about making the project a full time commitment.       My concern is the moment that I have to take the leap, the moment I have to be decisive about making the project a full time commitment.  Money isn't a concern; knowledge is good; time is a factor.

God damn this traumatised my childhood. Even one time I had psychosis after a fever in a village. I was having a dream where I was in a place similar to the pit in the dark knight rises. There was a briefcase being opened with millions of dollars.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  During this I was experiencing the worst feeling in my life it was truly like hell. I then felt like I was a tiny particle in that massive pit, destined to be there for eternity, unseen, unheard, nobody to save me or find me. (I'm an atheist now but my early christian upbringing might be related to the dream)  ___________________________________________________________________________________________  I went into automatic mode where my mind controlled my actions, I walked downstairs and started screaming, "I'm a stick! I'm a stick" I started banging my body against the wall and I managed to snap out of it. Most uncanny event that had ever occurred to me. Few years later I developed depersonalization and severe anxiety, still haven't got rid of it.   I sometimes think when two people are having a meaningful conversation, the conversation coming from the two parties is about a different topic, they both are convinced that they are talking about something but they both are applying a reality from their life experience, and words fill the gaps of missing meaning.  	87
    Nice!  It goes to show that I should read an article instead of just skimming through it.  Thanks for letting me know!   While I agree with the sentiment, I just can't see this actually passing.  SW is (unfortunately) a HUGE money maker for southern California so I don't see the reps from that area allowing it to pass.   Hi Skrillex!  I wanted to thank you for introducing me to the dubstep genre.  Do you agree with those that say dubstep is a dying (if not already dead) genre?  I believe there are still some phenomenal dubstep producers creating amazing music, but it seems as though many people believe that the popularity of the genre will never again be close to what it was in 2011/2012.   I have what was described to me as a corn sensitivity, but is essentially an intolerance (intestinal cramping, IBS, other digestive discomforts).  I've been dealing with it for about 6 or 7 years now, and you definitely learn to pay attention to the ingredients in food.  The cool thing is that recently there has been a bump in cane (or beet) sugar popularity, at least in my region of the U.S.  You have to avoid things that you used to consume regularly, but, at least for me, there were great, albeit more expensive, alternatives available.  If anything, I feel more freed to try new things and diversify my diet than I do limited by not having (many) corn-derived products.  Good luck to you on your new edible adventure!   Don't herta yourself coming up with one.   I have a 2 foot tall brachiosaurus statue in my yard!  He's not as interesting as this guy, unfortunately.  We sometimes put a little mask on him for Halloween, but that's about it in terms of dressing up.   If you're looking for rap over a dubstep beat, one of my favorites is [Like This (feat. Virus Syndicate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xishhKPQ9Nw feature=kp) by SKisM.  Flux Pavilion was who really got me hooked onto dubstep - [I Can't Stop is one of his most well known songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9rewnLFYw) but he also does a song called [Do or Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNqRuyFSXk) with rap from Childish Gambino.  I also recommend [Dodge   Fuski](https://soundcloud.com/dodgeandfuski).  I love [Zomboy](https://soundcloud.com/zomboy) as well.  If you're interested in a more melodic/chill kind of sound, Seven Lions also makes great melodic dubstep.  His remix of [Running to the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZREifFcEs) is one of my most favorite songs right now.  A majority of the dubstep artists I listen to are signed on to either on [Never Say Die Records](http://www.wewillneversaydie.com/mixes/) or [Disciple Recordings](http://www.disciplerecs.com/mixes/), both of which release free mixes made by their artists periodically.  I'd say my favorites at NSD are SKisM, Zomboy, and Eptic.  Disciple Recs is younger, so I only really know Dodge   Fuski (who used to be with NSD), but I'm really liking what Pegboard Nerds and Astronaut are putting out.  You should also check out the artists over at [OWSLA](http://owsla.com/artists/), which is where Skrillex and Seven Lions are signed.  Kill Paris, Kill the Noise, and Porter Robinson are also great from OWSLA.  As far as trap goes, I don't listen to much, but I do like things by Brillz, LOUDPVCK, RL Grime, Buku, and Baauer.  Sorry this turned into a wall of text, but hopefully this will help you find something you like!          I'm currently going through the grad school application process which involves emailing a huge number of professors about their labs and I'd say my response rate is about 50 percent.  It seems like a majority of the professors that I have interacted with in this process and also during my undergrad are more than happy to help students, especially ones that show an interest in what they work on!   If you strike out here, I'd suggest looking up research papers on a particular marine mammal-related topic you're interested in and emailing the authors.  It's likely many of them will be too busy and will decline or may miss your email altogether, but I'm sure you'd find someone willing to talk about his or her research!

 Thank you for the advice, I try to finish what I started and then I leave, fortunately it worked out in the end and I was not coached.    Thanks Captain Hindsight!    I will definitely try this, thank you!  	3
 thank you!  i definitely don't look at Roger the same way anymore.   wow that's pretty mystical.  good thing the wolf was such a gentle teacher!  	2
 How else would they communicate the message quickly and assuring everyone heard it?   I grew up rural and on a farm and went to school with rural / farmer kids. Can't recall ever seeing a casing at school.   Lockdown = kids are locked in classroom, crouched silently hiding in a corner.  Police immediately attend looking for threat.  Secure school = classrooms and outside doors locked, business as usual inside ie: teaching.   It was a secure school, the headline is completely incorrect.  Edit - who downvotes fact?  A lock down and a secure school are two different things.  The headline says the school was in lockdown, but the story clearly states it was a secure school.  I don't give two shits about Karma.   Just puzzled who would downvote a factual contribution to the thread.   PTSD and depression are comparable to an itchy ass?     How much are your property taxes a month?   You've drawn a conclusion the men were executed.  What evidence convinced you so?   There's an alien peddling a bicycle at the centre of the earth, which makes the earth spin.  Let's discuss it.  If you disagree or downvote me, your a paid shill or a troll.    Staged with crisis actors.

I've hit an age where I watch a video like that and I just shake my head.   What about pulling them all and getting dentures?   Ok  	16
 a lot of that stuff can be explained by Velkas involvement, because returning to the asylum is beneficial to the undead (and allows you to get to the painted world, an area with heavy velka associations, it's reasonable to assume she had some impetus in this stuff.  1) The stray demon has the Titanite slab, and its beneficial to the CU to fight him, therefore, the floor was either broken by a third party trying to help you (velka, possibly gwyndolin) or was broken during the same time dilation that all of Lordran is experiencing (enemies are different in the asylum too, you could have escaped thousands of years ago)  2)Peculiar doll is likely supplied by Velka, seeing as the painted world is the best grinding area in the game, and gives you lots of god killing items, and also has a strong Velka association.  3) Anastacia is the only Firekeeper who still has a body, although why she doesn't dissapear like everyone else is unknown, perhaps it's something to do with the way of white?  4)Rats have a high drop rate because they've been eating humans  5) This is a genuine oversight, much like ciaran using the dark/gold tracers after giving them to you  6) Snuggly can again be explained by the velka association, you put some garbage item down, and the giant crow replaces it with actually useful stuff.  You're confusing **ambiguities** with 'making sense'   So you've never played dwarf fortress?   WOW Kim is 29? Never realized, she looks so youthful!   Hey, with a new planescape game out soon and all the divinity stuff, why don't you give planescape:torment a try?   Sarkeesian's ever gaining snowball of popularity continues. To be honest, I'm slightly worried that it'll make all criticism of Sarkeesian be branded 'pro-gamergate' which would kind of suck, as I'm honestly not much of a fan of the 'Tropes vs Women' series.   He was on the podcast *before* TB started burning bridges by saying things like 'Sarkeesian's death threats have nothing in them, otherwise she'd be dead'. All of Tb's interactions with Jim have been one sided on  his part, and *I personally* doubt Jim will want to associate himself with I guy who he's pretty opposed to without TB making some sort of sweeping retraction of his GG support.   TB's also been burning a *lot* of bridges lately, particularly with his post saying that white privilege doesn't exist, which seems to have soured his relationship with Jim sterling.    Someone attempted to do it again with MGSV recently too, they set up a crappy youtube account with weird, surrealist with obscure references to MGS lore, which is exactly the kind of thing Kojima would do. The community didn't really bite though.   If you're looking for games with secret finding communities, check out the Arkham city forums/secret hunts. Recently, Rocksteady revealed an Easter egg that was hidden for *years* in Arkham city, despite the fact that the game had a very active secret hunting community (especially after Rocksteady did the same thing with Asylum), the code for AC was pretty difficult to decipher too, unlike for GTA V, so when the guy found the most recent egg (AFTER he found basically every wall with no collision detection in the game) he must have been pretty shocked.   Well, the race of larger than average people are never named, but they're clearly separate from humanity (not descended from the furtive pygmy), and are relatively powerless compared to say, Velka, who takes a more conventional 'God' role of manipulating stuff/ not having a human form. Who's to say that the Gods in dark souls are really God's, and not just half giants whom were called Gods by a Humanity which knows nothing better? Perhaps the chosen undead is a vessel to punish these blasphemers?   Probably the ultimate demonstration of this is him shooting Darkseid with a gun in Final Crisis, essentially killing him.   The vagrant wiki page   Ornstein is too tall to be a human, even ciaran apparently isn't human.   Vagrants spawn in set locations though, so everyone who dies in that area has a vagrant spawn on that spot.   But within the context of the *game* it's not presented in a humorous way, whether or not you think Kojima has the 'credibility' to present such a scene, or whether or not you think that Kojima has mishandled sexuality in the past,thus making him a hypocrite doesn't change the fact that in ground zeroes, it *is* represented negatively, and not in positive light. I think it's perfectly valid to claim GZ or MGS is disturbing or sexist or whatever, but not because of the sexual elements Kojima included in a decades old game. If you're going to claim that, why not claim that Jim sterling shouldn't be able to say anything or sex, considering that he said all that sexist stuff a few years back, and had a podcast which almost entirely consisted of him sexually harassing Jonathon Holmes?   It's a fantastic read. The making of the Room is even more bizarre and weird than you would expect, particularly as Wiseau spent millions of dollars on the film.   No, I was just wondering why you thought that the bomb was the objectionable part in ground zeroes, rather than pazes poorly written treatment in that game as a whole. Why do you that sexual harassment being played for laughs in one game shows that it's played for laughs (or titillation in another game? Those elements aren't played humorously in ground zeroes, particularly in the "context" of the game itself. Ground zeroes is a very hamfistedly written game, but that doesn't make things like Paz getting raped sexist.   Chie and the protagonist (I think) from persona 4, a PS2/vita visual novel/dating/jrpg game.   Ha, and on the very day I decided to re-read the disaster artist.   Every Hanz zimmer song must by necessity be re-used over and over by television companies trying to make things more 'epic'. Can't wait for Interstellar to be overused too.   You've also got characters like Para-medic, who's a female character who is never sexualized, and has an almost entirely platonic relationship with snake. I think it's cool that the MGS game include these elements, as opposed to games that just include a token action girl or whatever.   I'm not sure why these elements, other than quiets costume, are inherently sexist (we also don't know why quiet dresses like that/gets tortured yet, whilst I think it will almost certainly be given a bullshit reasoning, we should probably wait for that)   If you're bringing up Ground zeroes, why not bring up the audio tape where the villain forces a kid to rape a much older girl? That game had a shitton of awkward, hamfisted sexuality elements.   MGS3 also had para-medic, who is my favorite example of a male/female platonic relationship in a game, and EVA, who was deliberately sexualizing herself to steal nuclear pans for China, which she succeeds in, although YMMV on how progressive that is. Whilst I think that Kojima *does* include some sexism in his games, the games do also have some progressive element. (at least, for a videogame) Hell, you had a romance minigame with Kaz in peace walker.   I honestly think Burch was trying to humiliate GG in his original tweet, because the way he specifies Dtoids DLC scores seems like a trap. Dtoid actually gave relatively low scores to the borderlands 2 Dlc, in particular, the  [sir hammerlocks big game hunt review] (http://www.destructoid.com/review-borderlands-2-sir-hammerlock-s-big-game-hunt--242877.phtml) is *very* disparaging of Burch and his writing. I'm really surpised so few people brought this review up.   GG seems to be incapable of saying good AAA game is bad because of it's 'SJW agenda.' If they think that liberals are supposedly warping the industry to pursue a 'liberal agenda' they would be attacking Dragon Age and Borderlands and Metal Gear, which are games that go out of their way to be inclusive to people, but they apparently the don't care about ethics enough to let it stop them enjoying games, despite their arguments to the contrary.   He did, he kept getting dicked about by the studios for it though. It was announced alongside Hulk and Iron man.   Well, it was 'his' movie when he started making it before the MCU even started.   Yeah, I did think about amending that whilst writing it. To me, Hornets are inferred by the fireflies and that jazz (It's never really indicated that insects are any different) and a Hawk is shown on the Hawk ring, and I think may be referenced in some capacity elsewhere. Crows are also a pretty common element in Lordran, so we can sort of assume hawks would be able to survive as well (everything in Lordran would kill a regular lion, as shown by how wolves have adapted)   So just a bit of lore based speculation. But I've been pondering recently about Ornstein, more specifically, his totem animal, the Lion (or Leo) is a weird exception to the naming rules of the four knights, not only is it the only four knights animal we never see in the game, but it's also the only one given a Latin name, which gave me an interesting idea.  What if lions are fictional in the world of Dark souls?  Think about it, the only thing in the game that comes CLOSE to being lion-like is the Chimera (sanctuary guardian) and the big cats in darkwood, which are both fairly monstrous. How would a lion be capable of existing in Lordran? Ornstein, a famous trophy collector, would surely have some representation of his favorite beast if it were to exist. This adds a interesting dimension to his character, perhaps he looked upon the Chimera and dreamed of a lion, maybe his mother  told him of the man eating monster known as Leo to keep him up at night, hell, maybe, the sanctuary Guardians are actually his pets, which are known as 'Leos' in the world of Lordran, and their deaths cut him off from the world.  It's probably bullshit, but it's my kind of bullshit.   I'm pretty sure they never stop coming.   Both Jim Sterling, Yahtzee, and Jonathon Holmes have been talking about how Bayonetta a negative female character in their opinion (I saw it a lot on my twitter feed a week ago, as well as comments from Elsa from the Dtoid community) BUT they also stressed that it's perfectly fine to disagree with that viewpoint.   Malmo forgets and forgives :(   rated PG-13   You can find the more synthy version on Itunes. (at least, I think it is) The song is written and performed by metric, who were the real life inspiration for Clash at demonhead, All of their songs have a similar style ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtd8ArvH_s)    Because metric wrote the song. I believe you can find the more synthy version on Itunes anyway. Metrics pretty great too, they have a lot of songs like black sheep.   Like what happened with the animated film in the 70's?   Although not as badly as the third person review. Those sound effects....   Dwarf fortress is basically all about weaponising babies.   And the voice acting, which needs to British to keep consistency with xenoblade.   So Destructoid is retroactively wrong for saying the game MIGHT be good, and nominating it for two categories where I'm guessing that every game of the type was there?   "Oh Gee, I'm so happy my SURFACE PRO TABLET from MICROSOFT CORPORATION allows me to speak to my friends on SKYPE whilst also playing FIFA with me mates on my XBOX ONE, supplied by the kind folks at MICROSOFT"      I was mocking people who thought various plot points were too complicated, such as the Doctor and Clara lying to each other. To me, these elements were easy to understand, and not really the issues they were being claimed to be. However, maybe I just hold too much stock in viewing audiences that I expect them to understand these plot points from my perspective. That's genuinely my bad, I'm sorry.   When did I ever say those were the plotholes my hypothetical redditor was referring to? I mean, you do understand I was referring to the absurdity of the complaints, because the way you said "I don't think they did?" in regards to Gallifrey really makes me think that you thought I actually didn't know it wasn't meant to be there (Although I saw a lot of confused people on the discussion thread, which I thought was absurd)   She was as flesh out as she needed to be that you felt bad when she died, that's all that was needed.   Yes there was, the doctor said she was going to be a companion in earshot of Missy and she killed her. The audience is attached to her, so when she dies it shows how bad Missy is. Whats not to get?   I can't believe a character I LIKED dies in a TV show, and I felt bad! What terrible, terrible writing!   Judging from the discussion thread, this made a lot of viewers into ten year olds again  MUM why were the doctor and Clara both lying?  MUM why did the master escape gallifrey?  MUM why is it so boooooorrrrinng?  MUM why did Osgood die?  MUM did the master die?  MUM why is the master a girl now?  MUM why did they bring back Gallifrey?  Seriously, its like people were watching the episode taking notes on which plot holes they could complain about to get Reddit points. Sure the episode had problems, like the out of place scene with the portal to heaven at the end, but the bulk of it was great, emotional stuff.    I think it's better to keep lautrec alive from a story perspective. Having him kill Anastasia and then having to fight him to get her soul back is much cooler than kicking him off a cliff, and is relatively intuitive.    Konami let's Kojima do whatever the hell he wants, they killed castlevania, they killed silent hill, Kojima is the last Bastion of konami's game dev division, if they were really that worried about backlash, they'd have taken out the child rape in GZ.   Well, TPP isn't really that much bigger than mgs2, and that twist didn't ruin Kojimas career, despite the fact that Raiden was widely hated.   Fantastic, I really appreciate the effort. Just a quick question, but is anything major from a lore perspective equivalent to say, Kaathe from DS locked behind world tendency?   IT's on sale for 3.49 on the PSN store right now.   Yeah, I just played through the first level at level 1 without dying, so it is pretty easy, that said, I'm still really enjoying it, particularly the reveal of the sanctuary kid.   Since I downloaded it digitally do you mind giving me a quick heads up on world and character tendency?   So I'm a big Dark souls fan who just bought demon souls in the PSN halloween sale, do you guys have any advice/pitfalls I may fall into after having played Dark souls? Where do the key differences lie?   All over my pancakes   Sorry, I only have enough flour and eggs to make syntax error pancakes.   You don't have to watch anything, but I DO recommend checking out the madoka tv tropes page, particularly the 'YMMV' page. It explains a lot of stuff about the madoka fandom before the movie was out.   It sure was an incredible coincidence that the captain happened to be bluffing when Duncan roled a two. I'm glad Duncans SKILL helped him out in that situation   My headcanon is that Bloodborne is set in Carim, the continent that gets mentioned in dark souls, the Continent of treachery and deception, and the worshipers of Velka, god of crows.   You should definitely check out the series. The first 2 metal gear games are a tad dated, but are still great games, and do begin the story of the series. MGS is the MSX scaled up a bit with fancier graphics and excellent cutscenes, MGS2 was well ahead of its time in terms of game storytelling, even if it is one of the weirdest and trolliest games ever made, MGS3 is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest action adventure/stealth games ever, MGS 4 is mainly a capper to the series, and peace walker is another amazing game gameplay wise, but has a simpler story. It's really worth checking out the series.   Yeah, It's presence on this sub and Lewis and sips twitter feed has been practically non-existent. Did you also know that they also play Civ 5? I would never know that if I just followed this sub!   Perfect Blue. You know the movie Black Swan? a metric tonne of its content was taken from this movie. It's also one of Terry Gilliams favorites!    Thanks for the late reply, I really appreciate it!   It's one of the best farming spots in the game, too. Just cast poioson fog on the clumped up undead or do an AOE and you'll get thousands of souls each time.    That's exactly what Kojima *would* say if he was covering it up!   Well, one could argue that you should have really dodged out of the way at that close a range, or at least kept a fair distance so not EVERY bead hit you. The dark bead further imbalances an unbalanced game, but the since the only way to get a 'proper' duel is if the other guy plays ball (doesn't gank or use some nonsense AOE, has a perfect internet connection etc) Other than that, the DLC is probably the best part of the game anyway.   Well, dark Bead IS a pretty rare and obscure power, at least for the first few months of the DLC release, and it's hardly like Dark souls is that well balanced in the first place.   I actually thought the boss fights were pretty fantastic as a stealth combat character. In particular, that boss felt like a highlight to me, as he has fairly low health but you're empowered.   Ah, but it's already happened! Think of all the feelings that will be released in players hearts! It will be magnificent!   Yeah, I really hope we get to see para-medic in TPP because I'm assuming her betrayal of big boss hit the hardest.   MGS 3 still had the top down view at launch. It wasn't until substinence that it became the best game in the series, and it's kind of difficult to give a re-release a 10/10.   The twin gargoyles isn't impossibly difficult, the second only appears when the first is at 50% health, and solaire gives them more health anyway. The baldur knights and armored boar are far trickier at that stage in the game.   Nope, trying to continue the joke!      I think they shied off from making ghost rider tie-ins in event books after he basically won World War Hulk on his own, but chose to let hulk live.   Have you fought Artorias? He pretty badly overshadows gwyn in the 'have a proper swordfight' department.   Eh, I personally feel that we should wait for the second cour to get a full picture before we judge it. I feel that the duality between Slaine and Inaho was played up nicely and contrasted with the princess/rayet parallels.    I like Inaho because he is, or potentially is, an interesting character. He's essentially a cold, calculating, sociopath who happens to be fighting for the good guys. If he came back, after being shot by Slaine, he's probably do way worse stuff to the martians, and that would be neat to watch.

' former roboteers from SPECIFICALLY the first series of the UK robot wars, what was it like to deny an opponent the unquenchable thirst of battle by beating them in the pinball round?'   The DLC wasn't ever really intended to be conventional DLC either, it was meant to be a bonus for PC gamers. Although because of this, PC gamers didn't discover what amounted to the best area of the game for ages, which made the poor PC port more apparent.    To be fair, democracy v anarchy WAS where the majority of the lore and conflict came from.   Even though the PC version was bad... it was totally worth it for the artorias DLC.   You'll also want to see if you can summon solaire for the fight, and get an xbox controller. The game is NOT designed for keyboard at all, and is unnecessarily hard using it.   Because all cut scenes are in engine, which allow's for some neat things like custom gear appearing on you're characters, even in flashbacks. It's similar with a lot of RPG's, you just don't notice so much in stuff like WOW or FFX   Shulks in the trailers though.   It's due to getting the game to run on the systems. You can't have such massive explorable areas without making a few compromises to textures in the foreground.   Looking forward to fans saying every video CONFIRMS YOGPOD RETURNING! instead now.   The TOTG is pretty close to the second kiln, isn't it? Perhaps the blast from the kiln reached the Tomb, hence why there's so many worshipping skeletons in Nito's room, who were probably frozen in place when the blast hit. I personally doubt that Nito has anything to do with the curse of undeath. The curse is clearly meant to be alien to the other forms of undead in Lordran, such as the skeletons (body, but no mind) and ghosts, (Mind, but no body) the whole reason for Nito's lack of power is that people have stopped dying conventionally, in fact, one of the themes in dark souls is that *hundreds* of factions (all the covenants, all the nations, the demons, the skeletons, the darkwraiths, seath Gwyn) are powerless in the face of the curse of undeath, and nobody knows who's causing it.   Although I have been mobbed by anti abortion campaigners in my British school, so I wouldn't say it's not an issue. However, I don't see why it's interpreted as an analogy for abortion when it's really a pretty basic 'utilitarianism doesn't hold all the answers' analogy.   Eh, my personal problem with listen was that it's not ambiguous enough. The alternative explanations make sense to the CHARACTERS, but they don't make sense to the audience. The characters get no evidence the monster exists, but the audience get a tonne, to discount the monster existing, we not only have to assume the characters train of thought, but take the perspective that the CAMERA is lying. We see a hand grabbing people under their beds, we seen a 'child' act nothing like a child and have an alien face. We have to assume that Doctor wrote 'listen' on a blackboard for no reason offscreen, and we have to assume the semi-easter egg of the pressure door subtly whispering 'listen' didn't actually happen. The episode is supposedly ambiguous, but the audience has to mental gymnastics to make it so.   DOES LIQUID HAVE PREP TIME?!?!?!?   Well, before the boss room (The area with the baby skeletons) you can see that Nito had  a LOT of worshipers, so Gravelords might also have been pretty popular.   ah, that sword scaling does make sense.   Gough still has huge strength in order to use his greatbow, In fact, all of Gwyns archers favor strength by using greatbows  Artorias doesn't have stats in everything, he's clearly not a magic user. His armor could also be said to be fairly gender neutral too.   Ornstein is still working for Gwyn, or at least using the Armour that Gwyn gave him. He also has a pretty androgynous armour, so much so that many players though he was a girl in the first few trailers. The silver and black Knights armour is definitely more Masculine than androgynous too,a t least for me, although YMMV on that.   I was gonna point them out, showing how mildred is one of the few females usin a melee build, and how she doesn't work for Gwyn. Laurentus is also the only spellcaster who doesn't wear feminine clothing, which further corroborates it a bit.   I'm only semi trolling. Everyone under Gwyns command that has a dex or INT based build has a noticeably feminine armor set, even his son, gwyndolin, whereas everyone who uses a strengh/faith build has way more masculine armor.   I think it's more to do with Gwyns weird approach to gender. Everyone who uses a DEX or magic build HAS to wear a dress, because only women can do those things, and we need to make you as much of a woman as possible to fool people!   Thank goodness, the speculation was getting *silly*   As, so the multiple duncans were all just a blip in the system. Glad to have all that speculation cleared up.   Ha, I did the same thing on my first playthrough till I got my ornstein gear. It still amazes me how you can run up stairs without falling over. Interestingly enough, that gear belongs to the best spellcaster in the lore after Gwyndolin, so it kind of live up to those stats.   Yeah, but I don't think that's such a huge flaw to make the entire episode the 'worst ever'. I enjoyed the whole utilitarianism conflict and stuff.  	104
 'The Theory of Everything' was good too.   (and) Gravity(2013), Source Code(2011), Cloud Atlas(2012)   Great news.Loved the movie. I think its the best movie of Tim Burton.  	3
 You mean the Reagan one, the Bush one or the Obama one?   If all apes are great, then none of them are.   Jesus liberals are actually brain dead.  Says person who claims to have voted for Obama twice?   http://www.wallstreetsectorselector.com/investment-articles/editors-desk/2014/11/u-s-dollar-continues-rally/  http://www.ft.com/fastft/236542/us-dollar-strength-pushes-asian-currencies-lower   Yeah, again out, OK Bye.   discussion = shitpost, got it   gone already.     Okay, just unsubscribed, you can go back to preaching to the choir now, seems to be all you really wanted to do anyway.    Just pointing out that a little over half those suicides in the U.S. are also gun deaths, so saying that there are more suicides than gun deaths isn't exactly accurate.   A gun shot is thought to be the most common and effective way to commit suicide, and accounts for 53.7% of all suicides in the United States.  http://www.suicidemethods.net/suicide-methods/   and yet in your past you did not have school shooting.  The earliest known U.S. school shooting was the Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four men entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed schoolmaster Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children (reports vary). Only three children survived.   The lapels and ties of the two gentlemen on the right, closest to the signage, would make me think it's about 1962-63, but the younger gentleman on the left is sporting a slightly wider tie and lapels, suggesting '66-67 maybe.       1987 Yugo GV Sport for sale for $14,500, four years ago.  http://www.carscoops.com/2010/07/found-for-sale-1987-yugo-gv-sport-with.html   See, that's the thing, you can find 25 or 30, mint '79 Tran-Ams for every '76 AMC Pacer. Less desirable cars become rare a lot faster than desirable ones.   Pretty much nailed it as most any other eras are mostly recycled pop that's been just slightly ruralized with nostalgic lyrics added.    All blacks used to vote Republican and most whites in the south used to vote Democrat. Things change.   The Richest 1% of Americans received approximately 23% of the pre-tax income in 2012.  http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/american-inequality-in-six-charts    If the GOP wants to win anything, they need to put forward serious contenders.  Who?   I don't think our food   our oil come from the same place or the same people.   For profit police departments? How would not participating in one of those work?         I think you may have made a mistake.   Well, shutting down the government would certainly make it harder to deport five million people.   By that logic, OP is best buds with Peter Suderman.   She'll probably leave them for Bill to wear when he's the First Lady.    Guess they should have actually voted then.   So, he's still working at Fox? Someone told me he got fired sometime ago.   And what about Joe Biden?   But, there aren't any Southerners in Ohio and there aren't any Republicans in the Democratic Party?   Those were the ones that black patrons weren't allowed to enter and had to give their shopping list to the white store clerk and wait outside.   Is Slate not a part of the media?   More women are serving in Congress than ever before.   Doesn't seem to offend all those white people eating at the "Cracker Barrel"?      So, can we stop asking "What if there was an election and nobody voted?"    I don't see how ranked-choice voting would have changed anything for me on Tuesday. In nine of fourteen races there was only one person running and in the other five, there were only two. No third parties or independents on the ballot at all.             Guy sounds like Ron from GTA 5.   I don't know how you got that I thought people were "abusing it to get stoned on their couch", I'm talking about them getting stoned and driving a forklift. If you're being treated chronic/life-threatening conditions, you probably not going to be unloading trucks anyway.    They could fire me for taking pain meds, if I haven't been prescribed pain meds and some people are prescribed Vicodin, but those people are usually told that they can no longer work.     Just because smoking weed is legal, doesn't mean you have a right to smoke weed.   Or the Wedding Singer.   The article says 1970's three times, the video says it twice, and yet you still go with "80's van" in your title?    They should also find Bigfoot and El Dorado.   My guess is he will do what Reagan did in '86 when the same thing happened to him.         Your problem is that you think you are a "Big Man" and that there are "Little People", who for some reason, are not as "Big" as you are.   I wonder if this most is intended to  a) Make me not like Ice Cube because he is a Muslim?  or  b) Make like Islam because Ice Cube is a Muslim?  because I really can't see how someone holding a relatively common religious belief is all that interesting.    Oh now I get it, the early bird gets the worm and everyone else must suck his dick. Winner takes all. King of the hill. Dog eats dog, right?   Yea, donating or learning more does help.    And nobody would be able to avoid paying it like they do now.  Yes they would, by making as few transactions as possible, which is why it wouldn't stimulate the economy or create jobs.   If you think for one minute that corporations are going to say "Oh look, more profit, should we give it to our customers or our shareholders" you will have proven P.T. Barnum right.      They would become richer.  So you concede that only those who already have money would benefit?    Well, when your paycheck increases from no longer paying income taxes, how so?  When the increase in the amount you pay for food, rent, electricity, water, gas, socks, soap, toilet paper and toothpaste is greater than your income tax burden was because you no longer have deductions.   Stone don't kill people, people do.   A consumption tax? How would raising the price of everything stimulate the economy and create jobs? In the long run it would have the same negative effects on the economy as raising the minimum wage would but none of the positives.       an anti-war and anti-corporate Republican   Can you name one?     And yet you still find time to renew your licence? How about an absentee ballot?   I went at 7:30 AM and was in   out in less than 10 min. and my polling place is inside my local elementary school.   Capitalism is like beer, one are two a day is better for health than if you drank none at all, but a case a day will kill you before your time and then some folks are alcoholics.  Edit: I didn't even have a beer yet and I still used "are" for "or".   "re-election bid" as in the Arizona Senate seat he now holds.    The fact nearly 2 in 3 didn't even vote might have something to do with that.      She shook 'em off.   Still unasked is the obvious question, why are whites who formerly voted Democrat, now voting Republican?      Is the President not allowed to have private conversations?   You folks know that shit got cancelled, right?    and stuck in a closet.   You mean Johnsoncaid and Johnsoncare?   And they didn't repeal the interstate either.    Guess not all Jews vote pro-Israel.   Guess not all Jews are elderly.   Your title should be comprised only of the copied and pasted headline of the article and/or exact quotes. The selection of quotes should reflect the article as a whole.   The most likely reason is that this model truck isn't even sold in the U.S. and it would be a waste of money to advertise a product that you do not even sell.   I think that was Rambo.   That one on the left though.   You'd like to have options others don't?   Actually about half the ballot in Alabama is like the Senate race, Republican incumbent vs nobody. You people want a third party, hell I just wish I still had two.     Check my zip code, 36116. In most of the races, I don't even have a choice between one of the two parties, only one, much less a third choice.      He literally just sold a white family to a tobacco farmer in Virginia yesterday.     Naw, can't be. If people are disagreeing with my opinions, it must be because someone is paying them to do it.     Yes, his ex-wife was opposed U.S. military interventions in other countries.             The owners of Walmart are the richest people in America aren't they? Doesn't the U.S. have progressive tax rates?   So we're only paying like 20% more for gas today than we were a hundred years ago?   Do you still beat your wife?   "No!"   The Candidate confirms that he no longer beats his wife.

Are they going to tell your boss what kind of car your uncle drives if you don't give them your lunch money?   Columbus Day, it's like celebrating the day a rapist found their victim or something.   U.S. labor costs rose more than expected in the third quarter as wages recorded their largest gain since 2008, a sign that a long-awaited pick-up in wage growth was underway.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/31/us-economy-costs-idUSKBN0IK19A20141031      How is that possible? Walmart benefits from welfare checks and food stamps just like the recipients do.      Who pays in more than get back?

Yeah, economy up, gas prices down, Jesus we need change.      When Kalashnikov died, I posted a story from CBS news. I didn't edit the headline which used the term "assault rifle". The first and only comment was about my "poor choice of words" followed by my being banned from r/guns.     When I say "Public Assistance", you hear "Wealth Redistribution", I doubt that you are really open to hearing a solution and agreeing with me.      Nope, overqualified. :)    I suppose you think yourself more competent than Congress?;D    If your options are  a) Your child must quit school and work or they will not eat and will always be employed in a low paying job because they are uneducated and their children will also not go to school because they too must choose working over an education.  or  b) The community will pay for your child's food so that the child may remain in school, receiving an education which will allow them to make more money as an adult and not have to choose between having their children working or getting an education.  Would any parent say "No thank you, I would like my children to remain uneducated and poor"?    low illiteracy   would mean that more people in those countries had received an education and could read, low *literacy* would mean fewer people could read. Is that what you meant?   Actually, the family is incentivized to produce educated children who will be more prosperous in adulthood and not need welfare, than children who work instead of becoming educated and will always be employed in low wage jobs.    Countries with low rates of literacy, have high rates of poverty.   Unless that family lives in in a county that provides public assistance, which was my point.   Compare [this map](http://www.glpinc.org/High_Literacy_Clusters/world_literacy_map_unhd_2007_2008.png), with [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Percentage_population_living_on_less_than_$2_per_day_2009.png).   The Bible also never condemns slavery or says that marriage is between only one man and one woman.   Can you name even one bible that does state that Satan rules hell?   Allowing a substantial portion of your labor force to remain illiterate and therefore trapped in low wage jobs is a good way make sure your economy remains poor.    If there is no welfare, no child labor laws, no minimum wage and no requirement of education, this is what happens.     I fight authority, but authority always wins. I've been doing it since I was a young kid and I've come out grinnin', but when I fight authority, authority always wins.   You think they'll look anything like Karl Rove on Fox News, election night 2012?   Only industrious, hard working, self-supporting, bootstrappy people can live in Liberal Cities? So does that mean that the freeloading, deadbeat, 47% have to live in "Real America"?           No it isn't.   Newsmax = That guy in the basement in Night Of The Living Dead.   So, on the one hand we got a Doctor who got a prize from the people gave Obama one for peace and on the other hand we have the CDC, ACLU   the UN? Guess who I'm going with for now?   So everyone could be in the one percent if they just choose to be?   Wait, so Fox News want me to believe that the Democratic party doesn't want Democrats to win?   Did he get that prize the same year as Obama?      When Hillary Clinton was a teenager, she canvassed and campaigned for Nixon and worked for Goldwater '64, and was even elected president of Wellesley College's Young Republicans club. Reagan was a strong FDR New Deal supporter and campaigned for Democrats in '50 and tried to get Eisenhower to run as a Democrat in '52.      Wow, actually says "can ignores".   Garbage, I have no problem charging a citizen, by weight, for how much garbage they produce.            My Guess? 1968.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Elizabeth_Warren#Foreign_policy    Considering that more Americans have been married to Kim Kardashian than have died of Ebola, you could call this more of Cheney's unnecessary defence spending.    Small, well-trained governmental agencies can plan and execute near perfect plans  Why would they if  the bloated federal bureaucracy couldn't coordinate gun control measures after the fact.  If there is nothing to to gained, what's the point?      In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners.   http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html  If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government.   My problem with this is motive, I don't see how the government gained anything in Sandy Hook. What right do you not have now, that you had just before Sandy Hook?   Why would FEMA, the FCC   AT T want the public to think that just any random joker has the ability to hack their system and send out meaningless alerts that should be ignored by them?      Kamala Harris isn't Holder, would she be okay?   I have also heard that there was no Ebola in the U.S. until after Obamacare was passed and it may be responsible for the attack on the Canadian Parliament.      "You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good?

Stepping down isn't accountability, finding or replacing the 263 million that went missing on your watch would be accountability.    We need more dogs Washington.         Like the Taylor Swift thing?   I'm not exactly sure how thinking I might get Ebola would cause me to not care if my bank was going to go under and take my money with it?          And why doesn't this happen to the Germans, Israelis and Japanese, I mean they have U.S. bases in their counties, right? According to Dr.Paul that's all that's necessary for rape, murder and torture at the hands of American troops to happen and yet it doesn't happen in those counties.     The reality is that our military presence in Australia, Germany, Israel and Japan don't seem to be as offensive to the people that live there as you and Dr. Paul would have us believe.   What if the U.S. had military bases in Australia, Germany, Israel and Japan?  [Oh Wait,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_military_bases) we do.

Castro had already taken over Cuba by then, so the price had risen significantly as everything was more expensive in Vegas than in Havana, of course in Tijuana you could watch an actual donkey punch a hooker.         At the time you could buy a coke, a bag of chips, a chocolate bar and a comic book and get change back from a dollar.      I think you mean the lady in the orange vest.   That is Nixon, but I don't think the Grand Ole Opry ever had marble columns.       Maybe posting otr on youtube will get some folks who've never given it a try, to give it one.

Which is bullshit that you seem happy to shovel.    Just like those picture of Russian tanks and soldiers invading Ukraine  Those pictures that *actually exist*?  You mean those?    I really wonder how many people who enjoyed this book did so out of a sense of vicarious nostalgia - that is, nostalgia for a period they didn't actually live through, but like to pretend they did.  I suspect a lot of fans of this book weren't actually alive in the '80s, or else they'd realize just how thoroughly beaten the dead horse of '80s references truly gets.    "the boy racers and their V8s" Which is bullshit as they don't drive those in this country  What sort of country do you live in where cars don't have V8s?    An example of the latter is the Adem in The Wise Man's Fear not understanding the connection between sex and pregnancy.  Well ... this one I can give a pass on.  The thing is, the world they live in doesn't function by the same rules as ours - we sure as hell don't have anything like "unbounded principles."  So I honestly wonder if the Adem are right, and everyone else is wrong.  The whole "playing music makes you a whore" thing is just bullshit, though.   For people who are impoverished in the real world, that first example of repetition is actually pretty depressingly ordinary.  Trust me.   I used it once at an ARCO station about fifteen years ago, but I've never seen it since.  Which is a shame, because it's damned convenient.   I'd love to wake up one day and have 1.5 thousand in my account.   But if it's just sloppy gun and knife work... It's not for me.

How the McDonald's case in 1992 wasn't thrown out in the same fashion is beyond me  I'm guessing it's beyond you because you haven't actually read the details.

Though it's a 2.3Ghz single core processor and 2 gigs of ram, running 32-bit XP.  Being broke sucks.   Instead of the slow, plinking, dreary "chamber music" mentioned below, I prefer to think it sounds like Ronn McFarlane:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDtBUePhlzU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw0fKzJQgeg   Although I guess the first one might sound a bit too ... modern.     I think Pat thinks we're supposed to like Denna,   Part of this may be that *he* knows all the details about her, and forgets that we don't.    And smelter's flu isn't something he could catch, not really. He is a Master Linguist, not an alchemist or an artificer. I believe it is a dennar resin poison because the Medica seemed to be at a loss for how to treat him.   I didn't say he *caught* it, I said he was poisoned.  The fact that he's not an alchemist would make it that much easier.  And the Medica would recognize denner resin poison, the sickness from which wouldn't last day after day.  From Wil and Sim's description of alchemy, the Medica can't really do much about the nastier or more subtle stuff.   Possibly ... but it's more important that *the Maer* describes her that way, not Kvothe.   Denna doesn't visit Kvothe at the University itself, she visits him at Anker's, a place she's been to plenty of times before.  And Herma's illness sounds a lot more like smelter's flu or some other form of alchemical poisoning, leading me to believe it was done by Ambrose and/or Hemme to put Hemme in the Chancellor's chair.   It's still up in the air.

I realize the reddit demographic skews towards the teenaged/college aged who view anyone pushing 30 as being positively ancient, but "young" can quite well be used to describe someone in their late twenties, or even early thirties.  Shocking, I know.    When I was 16 like he is now I had to solder most of my parts to the mobo,  Yeah ... in 2005.  Right.

The FRC campus is also beautiful, on the forested hillside and right next to that meadow.    Digital Path?  Digital Path user here (in Chester).  Fuck Digital Path.   "Drug deals and crime" doesn't quite sum up Westwood.  "Meth, stray dogs, and pregnant 15 year-olds" however, does.    It's gotten slightly better in the past few years, but it's still sort of a squalid little redneck town.  Young's Market is nice, especially since they slice their bacon thick, but expect to pay a lot for gas at the two whole gas stations available (gas prices in both Westwood and Chester tend to be about 50 cents more than the California average).  Buffalo Chips makes decent pizza, and there's a couple of other good places to eat (the Old Mill Cafe being the standout), but precisely dick for entertainment.  There's no in-town bank, just an ATM.  Also, the library sucks, even for a small town.  It's pretty much just a pit-stop for people going somewhere else, both short-term and long-term.  If you're looking to move there ... well, don't   The lack of snow is kind of disturbing.  I mean, there might be some more this week, but ... things are pretty bare in the Park for mid-April.    as long as you trick yourself into believing that you're struggling to follow the story because Erickson's storytelling is just miles of every other author  Or, maybe, some of us didn't struggle to follow the story.   Try reading 1493 by Charles C. Mann - it really goes into the transfer of potatoes from South America to Europe.  Along with a lot of other great stuff.    I can't believe people actually want single cabs by choice  Why not?  It allows better rearward visibility, and you don't accumulate as much crap by continually shoving more into the back of the cab.    You can throw an old VW Beatle about 1.5 miles.  This needs to be done.   What's the hardest part about putting a baby in a blender?  My erection.   I think maybe you should learn English, before posting on reddit.  But it was probably pudding day in the special school you go to, so I can understand if you were too excited to spell correctly, or use particular words in their correct places.   There's a certain fundamental stupidity that is embodied by people who don't understand that diplomacy has a place, even between adversaries.  The U.S. negotiated and signed disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union, a nation that was literally arming other countries fighting and killing American soldiers, a nation that had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads aimed at us.  But the modern Republican betwetting, pants-shitting, sociopathing neocons are blind to history.  They only know that the scary Kenyan Muslim darkie who stole the White House thanks to ACORN is bowing down to Tehran and gifting the Ayatollah with the nukes he'll use to destroy the 51st American state of Israel by ... negotiating to delay Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Or something.  It apparently doesn't have to make sense, outraging Republicans is now as simple as not killing funny-talking brown people.   Northern California, nothing really south of Sacramento.   I'm looking for a nice city that has a good job market for IT and a good nerd and japanese culture with a nice art community.  These are mutually exclusive.    In February it was -15 or some shit, and in July or August we can hit 95. That's 110 degrees difference.  In California, you can possibly do that on the same day - camp high up on the southern High Sierra at 10,000-12,000 feet where it gets fucking cold at night, and then drive down to Death Valley fifty miles away to bask in the sun.    Ambrose finds out Kvothe has been stealing much of his tuition, and finds a way to prove the crime to Chancellor Hemme,  I think it's going to be a lot simpler - Ambrose will find a way to prove that Kvothe made a gram, using runes that are off limits to a Re'lar.  Remember, the stories say that Kvothe was kicked out of the University for "stealing secret magics."   Cedar is fine for kindling, but burns up too fast to use as a good source of heat - you need a *lot* of it, volume wise, to get the same heat as from a smaller volume of other woods.   Redwood actually burns really well, if quickly.  Whenever I can snag some leftovers from a construction project, or have some left over from a project of my own, I burn it.   Sounds like a crazy person who might have taken a geology class once at a community college ... or just seen a National Geographic show on earthquakes.  Definitely doesn't sound like someone with any kind of degree.   This is completely and utterly wrong about pine.  It's perfectly fine to use as your sole source of firewood (a lot of people where I live, including myself, do so).  The sap content doesn't really matter when seasoned, and I have no idea what "burns messy" is supposed to mean - it doesn't really generate more ash or creosote than oak or almond.    And 'Shitting Dick Nipples' off the list of things I didn't think existed on the Internet.  Really?  That's been around forever in Internet years.   Oh, it was worse than that for the Soviets.  At this time, the U.S. had about 220 ICBMs, the Soviets ... 4, 2 of which were experimental.  As well, the U.S. had 9 SSBNs in service, with the rather capable Polaris 1A SLBM (range of 1000 miles), while the Soviets had a haphazard scattering of converted subs with short ranged missiles that had to be launched from the surface.  That, and all the IRBMs that the U.S. had stationed in NATO countries very close to the Soviet border, whereas the Soviets just had whatever they'd installed in Cuba.    The only nukes likely to get through to the U.S. would've been the ones launched from Cuba, and those probably only would've been used if they were in the process of being bombed.    and that such an event would lead to nuclear Armageddon.  Given the disparity in nuclear arsenals at the time, it would've only *really* been Armageddon for the Soviets.  It just would've really sucked for the U.S., especially the East Coast.   Or making Caesar Dressing.   God, I loved those.  I remember the one with Descent on it.  For someone with no money living in a rural area ... this was incredible.   I want people to start posting pictures of the ugly side of Hawaii, just to reassure me it's not all a bunch of absurd beauty.   Shouldn't that pants shitting draft-dodger be dead or in jail by now?  You know, by his own words?  Oh, right, forgot he's just a pants-shitting coward.   What does it warn you?  Not to climb so damned high?   Guess your secret identity as Clark Kent has just been blown.   Definitely a water hazard.   Please ... you can't trust the odometer on that thing.  4 mill, tops.   Can confirm.  http://imgur.com/qerJkOw     I don't have proof, but I know he has eaten about 100lbs of fries, left over hamburger piece, etc.  Say goodbye to his pancreas.  And, sooner than you'd like, him.    that ability to win is the sina qua non of democratic politics.  "We should elect him because he's good at winning elections" is a pretty damned stupid argument.   he may have renamed himself in such a way as to split off the fae portion of himself into a new creature.  "The Lightning Tree" doesn't support this, if you haven't read it - [Spoiler](/s "It's written from Bast's perspective, and he definitely existed before he met Kvothe.")   I can actually see how some of them might not be - Hemme, Brandeur, Lorren, Herma, and to a lesser extent Arwyl wouldn't need to be full arcanists to run their departments.    They could've attended the University when they were younger, learning certain basic principles, then went out into the world and attained great stature and fame in their respective fields, then be brought back by the University to be Masters teaching in those fields.  Naming, Artificing, Sympathy, and Chemistyr/Alchemy would of course require a full arcanist's level of talent and knowledge.    But Archiving, Rhetoric   Logic, Mathematics, Linguistics, and perhaps Medicine ... these are things where the rest of the Four Corners might offer just as much opportunity for learning and accomplishment as the University.  Someone like Chronicler could potentially be brought back as Master Archivist after another twenty years of gaining repute, for example.    I think our bitterness about the 2000 Western Conference Finals might be one of the few things we agree on.   If there's one thing Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, Red States and Blue States, pro-Choice and pro-Life, hawks, neocons, peacenicks, dirty fucking hippies and chickenhawk warmongers can come together, join hands, sing Kumabya,  and agree on, it's that the Kings got seriously fucked in Game Six.  Hell, I'm still pissed about how Doug Christie's face managed to foul Kobe Bryant's elbow a couple years later.  How the shit?     Of the records, the best is Scott Walker's, who won 3 elections in 4 years  Maybe you should evaluate him on his accomplishments in office, not on his ability to win elections.      Walsh might soon be replaced by Bochy or Posey though  That's some serious recency bias.   The quick and easy way to tell the difference is that the Burkes don't have a RAM launcher.   Tracers are a form of incendiary round - it's just not their specific purpose.   Carl's Jr. and Hardee's comes to mind.   Tracers can.   Because they were using machine guns, there would've been tracers (which are incindiary) mixed in with the ball cartridges.   How do you not understand basic math?  Just ... how?  If the other countries have our tax rates but their workers make a lot less, the corporation pays less to the workers!  Less = not as much.  That's like 2+2 =4, but you're insisting that 2+2 = Elephant.   So ... if there was no nuclear deal, the Iranians *wouldn't* be buying these weapons?  Is that what Israel is claiming?  Because that makes absolutely no sense.   No ... no, it can't.  If Country A and Country B both have 10% payroll and 35% corporate taxes, but Country B has a median income that's significantly lower than A's, corporations in A save money by outsourcing to B.  Period.  You don't understand math, at all.   ... you're just not very bright, are you? If another country has the same payroll and corporate tax rates as we do, but the workers only get paid 1/10th as much ... guess what happens?   I don't think you know how percentages work.  Or payroll.  Or economics.  Or causality.   That's the thing that would break MULTIVAC.   That doesn't even make sense.  Corporates don't offshore because of employee payroll taxes, they do it because they can get the same productivity for 10% of the labor costs.  A slight drop in their payroll taxes (other countries have taxes too, you know) is hardly a big motive.   "Because I want to be President."  Pretty sure that's about it.     Let's be honest false flag attacks are bread and butter of the political left.  And I love the way you provide so very many examples.    MSNBC gave fucking Al Sharpton his own show.  They also gave right-winger and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough his own show, which continues today.    Our tax structure didn't send manufacturing overseas.  Our tax structure doesn't send manufacturing overseas, cheap labor does.   Probably the sort of sanctions that the Iranians are desperate to get lifted right now, given the effect on their economy.    Let's be honest false flag attacks are bread and butter of the political left.  Except ... they aren't.  They're extremely rare.  There's no real equivalent of James O'Keefe or backwards-B girl on the left.   You people are making me jealous - my old B2150 has got a lot of hours on it, but I can't afford anything newer.  Also, those swing arms make it a bitch to switch from an augur to anything else.    Bast's understanding (perception?) of Ctaeh is clearly based on legends and stories  Which is probably very, very deliberate on someone's part.  I wouldn't be surprised if Fae children are raised with these stories to keep them from seeking out the Cthaeh.  It probably really can see almost everything, which makes it dangerous to talk to - so, you'd want to discourage that, by really amping up what it's capable of.  The Sithe probably know that the Cthaeh doesn't actually know the future, but the fact that it knows everything in the present is bad enough.     This is literally the lowest geographical area the United States has.  Well, there is that absurdly high-res dot-map, where each dot represents something like 1,000 people.   This sentence is a lie.    should his life be ruined as well.  Yes.  The answer you're looking for is "yes."   Goddamn that's an awesome picture.  The Tomcat just looks brutal.   Kvothe is already famous in-retelling at the end of TWMF, and it's pretty obvious he sees Skarpi again after that.  As well, I just can't imagine he doesn't track down Abenthy once he's out of the University - it would be a logical step.   For the first question, that goddamned fucking "I'm a lonely boy" song.  I don't even know what it's called, just that the whining singer repeats that over and over.  Heard it at the store the other day, made me want to punch babies in the face.   Things look pretty cool from up there.  Enjoy the view, if you have a window seat.  If you don't ... I don't know.  Just don't whimper and cry, it bothers the rest of us.   Sure, if the vacuum suddenly stabilized.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum  Have fun sleeping knowing that all of existence might end instantaneously.   Hand grenades and .357 Magnum, fully loaded.  They have to give me what I want, right?   If I knew, I wouldn't fucking be drunk, alone, and redditing.   Because we're anonymous, and there's no real-life consequences to our assholery.   ... well, usually.  We don't make very good detectives.   You seriously think he's the only one?   Holy fuck, like we could possibly get any more virgin in here.   That's all it took?  Man, appropriate username.   Oaks get cut down and turned into furniture.    This is my "fuck I'm dumb" moment/  So at least you'll have a good response for that inevitable /r/AskReddit thread.    Skarpi and Kvothe after he became famous  Abenthy and Kvothe after he became famous ("look at what you have unleashed on the world")  We're almost certainly going to see both of these after Kvothe gets expelled.   Sour cream and a lot of Tobasco sauce - makes for a really great dip for chips.   Hey, look everyone, we found that one guy!   Bukowski was an effete urban poet who was rated 4-F by the draft-board.  Hemmingway was a hard-bitten fighter who worked with his hands, and got those hands dirty, and would beat the ever living hell out of Bukowski.   Cleaned shit off the top of a toilet lid.  Seriously, they couldn't even bother to lift the lid.  Anyone who's worked at a place with a public bathroom has no doubt encountered this.  	112
 Uni Timetable.   http://imgur.com/mWpp3JJ   I once saw a guy busking with a theremin. If you wanted a go he charged like $2. You should do that. He made over $100 an hour.    It scared me how many people have loaded guns close to them. I'm in Australia and I've literally never seen anyone other than a cop with a gun. Y'all are weird.    Anything where people sing and are judged.    Anyone in advertising.   Source: I'm in advertising.    What she said. Quit bitching and ask someone out.    On the off chance I make that magic post that earns me gold. *hint*   Creole and Americana food is getting huge in Brisbane. Its tasty. Not too foreign from what we're used to.    Should I bang my boss? He's cute and asked me out before we started working together. I was dating someone then, I'm single now and the chemistry is ridiculous.    I SHOT THE LAST BOURBON IN THE WORLD?!   Hello fellow Aussie.    Yeah I'm a girl. But the saying is "that guy". We all know that guy.    I'm a girl, dickhead. Also Australian.    Yesterday I failed to make three baskets in a row. Turned around to my friends, said "I suck at this." and threw the ball behind me.    Through the hoop, nothin' but net. I strut everywhere for the rest of the day.    Came here to say this.   One day my brother told me very seriously that Stephen Fry had died, knowing how much I love him. I was in tears and Googling how it happened when he realized that the joke had fallen flat.   	15
 This is one of my favorite episodes. Everything Marshal does at the party is amazing   Well Robin still seems to hang out with Barney when he's teaching Randy how to live. I doubt Lily ever really hangs out with Barney and Marshal is usually with Lily  I do feel that Ted would be more mad with Robin though, not just shrugging it off   This honestly sounds worse than anything the kids would be doing   Used to work at a McWalmart. Would not recommend    Maybe the flag glasses are deceiving    The Seattle native in me has to say that there is much more things that are "worthwhile" to do in Seattle than those, not that those aren't fun either   Lost it by the gas station by Stephenson.  It's a gray vans wallet. I posted on CL too but if anyone finds it I'll give them a reward.  Thanks   Go Cougs   This has one of my favorite quotes from Barney  "Was the Blair Witch easy to deal with or did she haggle over the closing cost"   I've had some life changing epiphanies in there   And you're an anti-dentite!   ITT: Wegmans   My guess is oxidized piss   That *is* a tasty burger   http://imgur.com/CjgwRnk   I love how they attempt to get back into formation while also fleeing for their lives    ehh they were probably gonna die anyways   It is fun, by senior year though it all starts to sound the same. If you're a freshman though go and enjoy it!   Why does everyone hate this episode so much? I think it's far from the worst  the part that always bothers me is Lily's terrible gun handling skills   Lately it seems the "cool" thing to do is like the ending regardless of original opinions of it   I loved the finale and have never heard the whole dead theory, then again I'm 22 so wasn't really aware when the show was airing. I really like this explanation though   Well there goes the next 48 hours of my life   That chicken is oddly proportioned   Good, I get paid in potato   It amazes me how many people here (in WA) think that just because its legal doesn't mean employers won't test for it and turn people down   S2 E10, James wears that same tie.    This is what the infinite staircase felt like we^just^need^the^music   the opposite of fine   Suitjamas I believe   Do I get a vote? Skank lane! Skank lane!   This makes me sad too because I think he's a great actor. he just got caught up in Pirates far too long   People would always dare others to do this and I'm like 'I'd do this anyways'    HIMYM and 30 Rock I thought both had great hooks from the start         If you've never read the book this is a great one to read, even if you don't like reading. This whole operation was pretty crazy and the book tells it from a lot of perspectives, including some stories of Somalians   My dad is a pilot for Alaska so him trying to hurt their business because he was late makes me mad   My dad is a pilot for Alaska so him trying to hurt their business because he was late makes me mad   Two weeks ago you were asking me if you had to grow up   UP all night playing poker   I was thinkin Pikes Peak   They also serve free craft beer and wine   Taqueria Chaparrito in downtown is the best mexican food   I made my username after Lord helix   Further proves people upvoting aren't people in the comment section   How bout all the cows that had to live and die to feed the aforementioned people   May need some Windex   If i had my phone in my right pocket and wallet in left pocket that sounds really uncomfortable. Is it better than  I'm picturing it?   Figure out how you study best. I came in Freshman year thinking it would be enough to look over the study guide a couple times and be solid. Did NOT work out. You'll score a lot higher if you know how to study well  Also study a little bit every day instead of cramming, if you do this you'll have all the time in the world to go out and have fun   The funniest slaps are when they're not anticipated IMO. After Slapsgiving they all? have an episode solely based around it   I think it's hard to say given that it was only season 1 and their plans for how the show would go were a bit different then. It is an interesting point though since he seemed pretty fixated on something that would not bode well for Ted and Victoria's relationship   There's that episode in S9 where they say you can have that one "you can't ask me why" request. But in Season 2 Marshal asks Lily a favor when she returns to NY but she can't ask why   Star Wars Battlefront. I've probably spent a couple hundred hours on Bespin Platforms alone   Whenever I chew gum it's as if I've completely forgotten how chewing works   I think most trending subreddits are from askreddit threads. It's always funny to see a post there and then the next day the subreddit its trending    I'd say he's one of the very few people who actually pull off autotuning, I love 808s   I mostly agree with this. I'd also just say that any good music today isn't the catchy type of song that you would hear being sung in a bar      He didn't have a coke   My OChem professor used the chalkboard. OChem 2 used powerpoint and I hated it   Let's not forget John Belushi either. The Breakfast of Champions skit is hilarious and probably not even close to his funniest performance   I agree that they rushed their relationship a lot. they dated for like 5 episodes? It didn't really help that the next episode was The Playbook, where Barney actually uses their breakup to his advantage. I didn't really like this episode either though it was painful watching Barney and Robin being total jerks to each other   I'd say one reason is because a large portion of both guys and girls here work out consistantly   Ahhhh.... ohhhh....   Holy fuck. The wing actually scraped the top of it. I can't imagine how loud and terrifying that must have been   Constantly rubbing my fingers together. I just can't stop for some reason   I thought it was to make them haters look back at themselves   Anyone know how big the sample is? This is awesome btw   I'm predicting 1 mil views by tomorrow and a special on some news channel   incandescent    Supposedly the soft serve ice cream at mcdonalds is the healthiest thing on the menu   Tim's Jalepeno chips are perfect   Wyoming. I think they ranch there?    I guess we're bday buds   The entirety of E. WA is 1.3 mil though so King Country alone has more than the whole other side of the state. This isn't an argument for money but more for voting and the fact that E vs. W has different needs   Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!"   I just hated her reason for wanting to save the Arcadian. She grew up in it? I get the sentimentality but the fact that the snake infested building could be replaced with something way better that affects everybody would've been much greater.  Yes I know the lion stone headwork is iconic!!   This and the time it takes to gather the courage to go ask. I used to sit the for 15 minutes debating whether to go talk to them or not. Now it's like 2 beers and a couple minutes      3 months ago was a good time for this repost   Fine I'll take on that role tonight   Cheap tricks?! Not one of these is a cheap trick. Except for "The Cheap Trick. " I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick. And even that one involves expensive hair extensions!   I laugh everytime at this. To me this is truly clever humor   You're right I had it on best   This is the top comment, though.   Black, purple, and teal were the official colors of the 90s. Just go look at the sweaters in thrift stores   4th grade powerpoints were allll about these. Of course putting a picture in the clear text was the best   That's what really confused me. They end up breaking up and instead of going to Barney who she claimed to have feelings for just goes back to Ted   I mean it's hard not to feel that way. We can only really take Ted's word that he loved the mother but we never really see it. I mean yes for a few episodes but not compared to the years we've seen of Robin   I used to always think Barney, but over the years I've changed my mind to Marshal. His speeches, singing, he's an actually good person but will still do stupid/funny things. He's an all around character   2 gen chem labs in a week *shudders*   If you do decide to do that I'd advise not taking another class along with it that'd be too much   "Who the hell is that guy?"  "That's Shin-Ya, he's sortof been auditing the class"   How bout Modern Marvels? Also great. Or when they actually played Rome and WWII documentaries all the time   [X wing though](http://www.target.com/p/star-wars-men-s-sweatshirt/-/A-16505188?lnk=Rec|pdp|viewed_viewed|pdpv1)    Not sure what the hate on Stephenson is about. I had lots of fun there. There's tons of people so you will find someone that has similar interests, it's no more than a 10 min walk anywhere, it's got tutoring in the building if you want that, and if you want to party you'll have no trouble finding one   I always thought that according to Marshal's he didn't wait nearly enough time to go out with Barney after Lily left him   I thought this episode was good too, the classic himym retelling of the same story. Also, there are just faaar worse ones than this all throughout season 9   Was the name of the dorm Stephenson..?   Beanie girl is looking longingly into his eyes   I almost forgot about the Balloon Robin thing. almost...   Not only that but any microbe on the babies skin the mom probably already has antibodies specific for it   Freshman year we actually managed to throw a decent party in someone's corner room (bigger than most dorms). All of a sudden an RA came in and there was alcohol everywhere. One dude there decided to go into the bathroom and punch the paper towel dispenser so hard he ended up busting up his hands and the police were called. Then this girl ended up puking on the floor of the corner room and the RA had her escorted to the hospital. It was basically chaos for a bit. I managed to walk out and despite them getting our student IDs down only the person who punched the dispenser got in trouble.    Mini putt. I've been playing it for like 10 years now never gets boring   That picture does not look to scale at all unless that fountain is going to be huge   I'd say the porn one was realistic in an edgy sorta way. The cliff one and bday one were a bit funny. Everything else made no sense   I've only really seen him in 30 rock and I love him in it. He does sound a bit crazy in real life but I can deal with it   Loan words?   I don't know what that is but sounds awesome      Probably because he sounds like a 14 year old   I couldn't even finish that. When she says "how can you sing about this with little kids listening to it. Don't you have kids?" Like Fuck it's up to the parents to not let their kids listen to that, he doesn't want little kids listening to his music it's not his audience  	110
 I guess i'm the only one that actually uses and likes airdrop.      [Douchebag gallantly bursts through blaring his garbage music.](http://youtu.be/BrUhRa_QBHI?t=5m32s)   I'd actually think about keeping the processor and just going with a 780. No single card solution past  780 should bottleneck the 8320.    The last one should be wing dings.   Funny how this guy is trying to scam walmart. iPad mini ( non-retina edition) retails for 299.99. This guy has an iPad mini retina box, but iPad mini with the retina displays retail for 399.99. If you look at the front of the box, if the iPad mini has iOS 7 icons it is a retina version. If it has iOS 6 icons, it is the regular iPad mini. What a low down scum.

 I don't even want to go near it. Every time I'm around the stuff I start to feel sick. It's sort of like the feeling you get when you know you've done something wrong. I can't explain it.   thank you. I'll keep you posted if I can keep my wits about me.   thank you Linkoban. Every comment like this brings me back to reality. If even an hour goes by now without hearing from someone, I start to lose my grip. I'm learning things that don't seem right and I need to get out of here now. Please don't go.   I can't say thank you enough. Each of you here makes me feel like maybe I can leave if I keep going. I replied to your thoughts above. If you have more suggestions, let me know. Please please don't leave.   I'm so glad you're here. I replied to your comment above. Thank you so much for the kind words. I really needed it, staying strong on my own is scary. Please stay.  	5
 Fuck him. You don't get to commit crimes and think an apology after the fact squares everything.   Her wrath will be fully unleashed on Reddit now.   What if he was big and black and could play football really well? That's a jackpot.   Joe Flacco elite as fuck.   Yeah, this seems like another case of Reddit upvoting a long post because they think long = good.  Not saying I could do better, or that OP did a shitty job.  It reads very well.  It's just the wrong character.   It's like he didn't even give a shit about dry hair.      Yahoo has him 2b eligible I think.   Sorry, Bender   If you were really smart, you would do both for that maximum IQ karma.   Texas, Our Texas! all hail the mighty State!   Seriously man.  I'm looking at my one month shit and have to physically fight the urge to shave this mangled mess.   I want to see what happens when the car breaks to a stop.   Specifically women and children!   What a scrub.   Didn't Modano also start out in a similar fashion with like 50 goals in his rookie year.  The he got Hitchcocked.   The differences between the two are astounding  /r/firstworldanarchists    Yup.  Throw in Dana's boner material Sheldon Adleson into that mix too.   He worked on conditioning!   Oh shit!  It's over, son.   If anyone is taking bets, I'll put money down on both of them on something.   Time to make that money.   I honestly didn't even notice.  I'm mentally vomiting now.   This is theft. A good manager would not let this shit fly. But then again, there are so few good managers in retail anymore. People are too afraid to offend idiots for fear of lawsuits or whatever.   Conservative estimate: there are at least 1 billion spiders in there.   yeah, Dana wishes he looked like that   Killing off Mr. Ecko was the last straw for me.   So why did they vanish. I'm not gonna watch, so dont worry about spoilers.   I stopped watching after the first episode. So they brought in another guy?   Yep. They do this to give their face false definition of a jawline as well.   http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2zyv37/guy_burning_quran_in_support_of_the_girl_who_was/  Dammit, forgot how to properly cross post.  This is where the discussion is happening.      Seriously, this seems really dickish.    I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic.   Damn. That list of 1 time main event fighters is a who's who of former title contenders who disappeared into obscurity.   Are there lots of fighters like this?  The ones that seem to think that simply being in the game longer means that they are better than the newcomers by some huge margin?   post these in an imgur album and cross post to larger subs like /r/pics    i guess it only sucks for mobile users   Fuck iminus in the ass   This is the epitome of my game   With 30% more salary, i could buy soooooo many used panties   3, 4, 1, 2   http://imgur.com/gallery/uj0QN7L   Dirk will never hit any threshold   Don't worry, I upvoted your effort.   This is gonna be tomorrow's top /r/TIL post            Only if there is a just god   Ah yes, the old "going limp" strategy.   That right there is the biggest problem.  Too many people being 'triggered' by actual discussion of real issues that need to be fucking discussed.               Besides /r/news, what sub can this be posted to?   Cronyism on reddit.  What a riot.  After all the years of users being butthurt about GW's administration engaging in such actions.      ha   wrong song bruh      Thank you for yur brave honesty.  It couldn't have been easy.   all any of us want to see, really   I was under the impression that any sub that has 'porn' in the sub name is not actually pornographic.   Who do we blame for shitty removals?   It's ok, he has a black friend   Every decent dynasty league will have him on someone's roster.  Unless your league is shallow.  Hell, in one of my leagues, if a veteran is on the last year of a contract, his secondary receivers get picked up.   Holy shit, this would suck major donkey balls.  I've been to Skaagway, Alaska a few times, and I thought that was a tiny hell hole.  Literally one main street that goes for three or four blocks.  A few blocks for residents, and one block for shops that cater to the cruise ships.  Town population with all the seasonal employees during may, june, july, and august is around 800.  That drops to half that in the offseason.  Which always makes me wonder:  what do the people who stay during the winter actually do, since tourism is the economic driving force?   /r/shitpost    dat map of Texas,   Hahahaha. I was just kidding bro! Jeez, it was just a prank, lol haha. Can't you take a joke, haha lol? You need to lighten up bro.   Too bad Ronda's soul weighs 135   That's assault and battery. Oh yeah, not to mention the theft.   It's been true for a while now.  I haven't worked in a retail store for about 15 years, but I used to work at Kohl's, Target, and Academy Sports.  At all three locations we were trained for this as an "unexpected occurrence."  But when three different companies trained their employees to handle the same situation, it is hardly unexpected anymore.   Obviously it's going to get deleted from here, too.  Keep reposting, people.   *[ERECTION INTENSIFIES]*   [for the confused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemrKM4_JMo)   Holy shit, someone used they're and their in the same sentence correctly.   At this point in the retail game, it's expected.   Here I thought he was referring to some kind of extremely small bra size or something.   Roy pls stop   It seems that I fucked up the joke.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv_wnY-MSRE   Bob Saget is not gay. The grass is not green.  The sky is not blue.  Bob Saget is not gay.  The pope is not catholic.  Water is not wet.  Bob Saget is not gay.  edit to fix the damn joke   *[REACHING AROUND INTENSIFIES]*   could you share your next parlay?   As far as the draft stuff goes, in my best league, we keep track if all extra stuff in a Google docs that everyone can access, but only the commish can alter. Off season trades, draft pick trades, farm teams (for baseball), and other stuff.   Just be flexible, but dont allow yourself to be walked over. I had a baseball commish that was hell bent on having a defensive stat, so he started the league with an 'errors' category. After years of complaining from the other 11 owners, hr unilaterally changed it to another defensive category. The other owners wanted to eliminate the category, but he wouldn't even consider having a vote. Six owners ended up leaving the league after almost a decade in.  On the other extreme, I had a commish who would just implement whatever rules were suggested by two particular owners. We ended up with ppr, points per rushing attempt, points per passes completed, extra points for yac yards, and 8 defensive starting positions.  Both if these types of commissioners suck the enjoyment out of the game    Find that scene and post it r/videos   This right here is the best answer.  Your safety should be your family's priority.  If they are more concerned with community image than your safety, then fuck them.   I remember people calling for Aldo/Pettis when Showtime first won the belt.  Incredibly disrespectful to Aldo, who has had the strap for years.  Let a champion at least fucking dominate their own division before calling for superfights.  Even then, don't do it.   This was way more dominant.  Barao lasted into the 4th, and at least fought back.   el mayonnaise    If this was really wall street, no they wouldn't   Not even that   LOL at the HBO shills giving it to Bradley   Shopped   Plus, didn't those dutch training camps use to go full retard during practice at Golden Glory? Or whatever that camp was called? The same one that ruined Manhuef's chin I think.   Why are people holding 60fps as some hot shit?  When I play CSS, I routinely get 200fps+.  Is that something different?    Edit:  Thanks for all the clarification guys   Total noob question: how do I create an ai only match?   He's flipping off op because this isn't a confession   Does anyone have that picture of these guys coming out of a high end shop with full bags with some distorted version of "Master of Puppets" lyrics?   typo.  I meant to say 985 miles per hour.   Typical OP.  Not posting an easy link to porn for us.  For shame.   Seriously.  That's fucking Randy Johnson.  That ball must have been going at least 885 miles per hour.  Conservative estimate.   shuck it Trebek!   Oh Long Johnson!   I seriously don't remember the faux intellectual bit.  So I looked his ass up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn)  Foghorn Leghorn[3] is depicted as a large, white adult Leghorn rooster with a stereotypically Southern accent, a "good ol' boy" speaking style, and a penchant for mischief  I read through the entire bio.  Nothing about being an idiot.   I don't remember Leghorn using the absolute wrong words.   Error:  bug has re-emerged, this time stronger   You have no idea what he's talking about because he's trying to use big words and getting them wrong.  Apprehending =/= comprehending.   Also, you used the word "apprehending."  That makes absolutely no sense.  Did you mean "comprehending?"   Deb's angry swear word rants became the saving grace of that show's last four seasons.   DUN-DUN   OMG guise this is so insane!  So not only is this poor wolf neutered, but now has a vagina?   I created www.reddit.com/r/TILunfiltered/ but I know nothing of how modding and managing a sub works.  If anyone has any interest, you can take over and build it up.  I'm just sick and tired of legit TIL posts getting knocked off the front page.      Can someone start a clone sub of TIL called /r/didyouknow or something like that with less bullshit?   Seriously.  The only way it could be more ironic is if he was injured from an opponent who held on too long.   just a little bit   MMA training camps   No worries.  I set aside a small budget for entertainment, and my sports betting falls under that category, so I don't over spend.  If I lose a big bet or series of bets, that's just my entertainment budget finished, and nothing more.  Since it's my first time trying live betting in MMA, I'm gonna go small, with $10 bets.     Interesting theory.  I've never done live betting, but I'll try it tomorrow night during the UFC event and see what happens.      WHAT DID HE SAY?!?!?!   Everything T-Mobile has been doing makes me want to join their network.  Except for the fact that their network sucks outside of big cities.  FUCK!   Oscar please!   Time to change the Sidebar?   Totally serious   I would honestly be shocked if Weidman was clean.  Not taking anything away from his accomplishments; I just highly doubt people coming from wrestling backgrounds who cut shit tons of weight.   This is a good thing.  Hopefully all the shit that's been clogging Reddit's arteries will flow over to tumblr.  They can be number 1 all they want with their shitposts and trigger warnings   Also, this isn't a fucking confession   dummy, he said un-ionized.  Can you tell who doesn't have their PhD guys?   What happens when you've got Red Bull?   Having an opinion is not a fucking confession.   Kind of over rated, OP.  I expected better.  You can totally tell that you didn't even put your heart into the brush strokes.   much like /r/funny, this sub has become a breeding ground for /r/shitpost   almost KenM levels, but not quite.   High price =  high quality, right?   Link, bruh   This is why you people(ex-Muslims) are few in numbers  The reason why we are so few in number is because those of us not public with our apostasy fear for our lives from bible thumping (quran thumping) muslims who genuinely believe we should die for our own personal choice.  Funny how there was no choice given to most of us when we were assigned the religion at birth.    I come from an Indian background, but I've seen this mentality prevalent in almost all religious families around the world, where they are so concerned with what people think of them from the outside, that they don't care to fix their families from the inside.   I haven't been doing it consistently.  But 20 years ago, I started leading and I had no choice, since I was a minor.  As I grew older, and my balls got bigger, I started refusing.  First passive aggressively by taking night classes in college that directly conflicted with taraweeh schedules.  Then, as I got a job later on, I would just tell people I didn't feel like it.  If people really pressured me into it, and it would seem like there might be some blowback to  my parents in terms of ostracizing, then I'll begrudgingly do it.  But I've garnered a reputation as kind of a smart ass that talks back and correct everybody's bullshit pseudo science opinions on Quranic miracles, so now they only come to me when they're desperate.   Of course it has awesome food.  Every big city in America is gonna attract international cuisine.  The thing is, does DC have anything that is strictly DC?  Or does it kind of fall into Baltimore as far as food influence goes?   To be fair though, I've heard that Geno's is way overrated any ways, and to get a real cheese steak, you have to go elsewhere, not so popular.   That's fucking purple.   I don't know.  Does /u/gallowboob shamelessly repost and pass things off as his own?  I never thought he was a reposter, just a mass poster.   There are fucking billboards about the rape problem.  Holy fucking shit.   Oh my god, that is almost as insanity wolf as OP's brilliant post.   Yeah but you can totally tell, right?   Although really, once is enough   Haha.  I've been leading taraweeh for almost 20 years.   Aquamarine   Seriously.  I thought it was generally agreed upon that the staredown with fighters and fans was incredibly douchey.   Or maybe the coal deletes some of their karma.   What about my 1991 egg shaped Toyota Previa?   Yeah, these "accidentally in the wrong thread" posts are so painfully obvious attempts at shitty karma.   Bovada pisses me off so much with their incredibly late money lines.  I've stopped using them in favor of other sites like betonline or betus   Humble brags belong on /r/tifu    The Epitome of "Manny being Manny"   I want to play a game.   WHAT?   An AMA on a Friday night?  Are you pimping a product that you don't want to sell?   What?  No.  	163
 That's a quote. I read it years ago but who said it alludes me.      It's a great university and its definitely worth your time if you can get in. Good luck.   I know this is late but I'd say before they turn 10. Just take them down and both parents talk to them just explain to them. They will likely understand but it depends on the situation.  If the kids birth parents died then that should be explained to them and say that you love them very much and then co.fort them for a while. When they grow up they'd be grateful that you raised them.  If, however, the kids parents abandoned them explain why they did it if it's known. Like they were very poor and couldn't raise you. If it was something like they never wanted kids then you could tell a white lie.     1) ok if it doesn't bother you fine  2) this ha  become a reason in many recent divorces. I'm not saying they're all down to porn but you start expecting a new women every time which makes sex with the same woman boring and repetitive.  3). Ok that's fine  4). Learn how to use grammar and then we'll talk.  5). Thank you  6). Ok that's fine with me I respect your opinion I just don't like the idea of watching others have sex right even if it's considered the norm and also prostitution is wrong in my eyes but if your ok with it I won't judge.   You can't. It only works once it might look like your pressing it but  it's someone else   Porn doesn't show real sex. It shows a guy and a girl fucking for money. Not pleasure or love.   It teaches people to expect someone different people every time.  It makes any women that don't have pornstar bodies look "disgusting"  It makes you think all women like hard-core sex like anal or gangbangs. While some might most don't.  It has almost no benefits but plenty of issues.   Not to mention that it's basically just filmed prostitution.   Is that were south park creators got the idea of a gay fish?   It's a sort of social experiment. Everyone only gets one push and we aren't to let it reach zero. If we wait till it was at one then pushed it once back to sixty it could last over a year but people have pressed it so much it to be done in a month.   Depending on how things go in May we could have one in five years. A lot of people who said no have now said they wished they had said yes. If we don't get it within the next decade there's no telling how long it could be if ever.   I like, like you. I'm weird.   Ha, ha Obama's my home-dog. No but in all seriousness I hate having to be part of the UK   I like you.   But you don't know that it's easier, I'm not circumcised and I find it very easy to clean it takes literally less than a minute.   The university is amazing. It's a bit expensive but it's defined Italy worth it and st Andrews is a great place.   Sounds pretty good, how many seasons are there?   Sounds interesting I might watch it and see what I think :)   What's it about? I don't think I've heard of it.   Let's talk about why we love our favourite shows and try and get other to watch them too.   Who are your favourite characters?  Why do you like them so much?  What is the main story about?      I don't see the point in the button can someone explain it please?   Ha, ha he's an ass.   Ha, ha oh sorry :D   That's sad. It really is a reminder of how there are people who suffer from war that have nothing to do with it.   And America should recognise the mistakes they made in WWII. I do know that Japan did some awful, awful stuff during the war (I'm not Japanese) Some of it was, indescribably disgusting but that was almost a century ago. We shouldn't let the past go but we should remember, learn an  move on to our futures with a little more insight.   What was your favourite serious? Mines was the original one, with ti and Matt etc   I love the clarinet, it has a great sound. If you know how to play it still you shouldn't let it slip away. Buy one and just play when you have time then you won't lose your talent.   I want a woman who is funny, kind and caring. She wants kids and is also pretty social. I hope she gets along with my family. As far as looks go it's not a huge deal but I like long brown hair, Brown eyes. Race and skin colour etc isn't an issue. I'd like her to keep herself clean. I mean most people do but when people don't wash it's just disgusting. Weight I prefer skinny but I don't mean like girls on tv skinny that's just wrong I mean a normal real life weight that's healthy not an eating disorder.   You should come to Scotland I've seen women like that.   I used to love Digimon, I actually researched the entire series last year :)   My friend, let's call him Bob, stayed one time. He always said he had night terrors. I always thought he was joking since he's pretty funny and always laughed when he spoke about it. Anyway he stayed and after he fell asleep he woke up but his eyes were shut and he was crawling around my room screaming then he tried to crawl downstairs. I didn't want him to get hurt but I also didn't want to wake him because it can be dangerous so I tried guiding him back to my room before he just kind of collapsed back in to sleep. It was only about two years ago.    Ok here's what to do:  1. Set aside time, a lot of time over the next two weeks  2. Get past papers, either from school or online  3. Make a time table to follow.  4. Start by trying a past paper. Study for a while (a few days) but make sure when your studying you take regular breaks and don't get to worked up. Then after studying try the past paper again and see what score you got compared to the first time. Let's you know if/that you are improving and where you need to work one.   I love their songs. I don't really hear of them here but I found out about them through the theme song for the big bang theory about eight years ago an  I've loved them since.   I like saying random stuff which just confuses people before they laugh because what I said was so random or over the top that they can't hold it in but I'm not a hilariously funny person, however, I do get quite a few laughs.   Ha, ha /u/SketchyJJ berta lovejoy is hilarious!   I personally play the piano, keyboard and drums. I enjoy playing lots of songs on each but here is my list:  Piano - I enjoy playing the caprices of paganini.  Keyboard - a whole new world from Aladdin.  Drums - mostly rock songs from the 80's but I don't have a favourite.    Ha, ha by mentioning it, like everyone else has, we can expect it in half a century.      Boom. They were dead    Gets remastered. Then...   I've heard it happy but I like the sad version. I like the bagpipes but even as a Scotsman I don't hear them too often, normally only on special occasions.    Hey so jefe, Scottish guy here. The bagpipes are Scottish you were right and some of us did want to be independent. He'll I hate having the English anywhere near me. There were videos of our votes being rigged and still they wouldn't do a recount. I fucking hate those bastards, please do some reading before assuming we just turned it down because every person I know wants independence!   Ha, ha I just saw this and felt drawn to it since I'm scottish. Yeah amazing Grace sounds beautiful in a sad way.   Book:   Harry potter and the chamber of secrets when Harry and the others are in the wrong place at the wrong time  Gone (my favourite book series):  In book 5 when Diana gives birth to gaia and she becomes a killing machine so fast.  Hunger Games catching fire when katniss fails to show her love to peeta to snow. I prefer the book series to the movie but the movies were pretty good.    Movie: Finding Nemo   When marlin drops the mask.  Game: Telltales the walking dead. ***SPOILERS***  When, in season 1, Lee gets bit. I have played a lot of games, I mean a lot and these are the only two that have made me cry.  Also in season two when Rebecca dies and she tries to eat her baby and then the Russian gang attack and we don't know untill episode five who lived and who died!!  Tv series: Buffy the vampire slayer season 1 finale  When Buffy died for like two minutes and then she had an amazing sequence where she was walking with a smile on her face to the theme song before killing the master.  The walking dead show: ***SPOILERS***  Basically every episode but to be specific season 3 episode 4: killer within. Lorri goes into Labour right when a bunch of walkers try and attack the group and then she later dies :)   Don't worry about it I'm 16 and I've never drank alcohol. I've never been high either but that's cause, not to judge you but, I'm against drugs. Of course alcohol is a drug of sorts but back to your question. Anyway if you really want to try being drunk don't get pressured into it and don't hide it from your mum and dad. In December my family had a kind of party, my mum has lots of brothers and sisters so there were a ton of us. She said to me:  "(Insert my name here) if you want to have a couple of beers tonight don't get embarrassed or ask anyone else to buy you one. Come to me and I'll get you them".   I never did it but I liked that I was aloud. She said to me soon after if I want to drink I can have some friends over, not  a party or anything (I really don't enjoy parties so that's fine) but just you and your friends (she said their names but I have around 4 close friends here outside my twin. I have others but they're the ones I always talk to.  I went off subject there, sorry, anyway my point was if you want to drink try not to worry about it to much. I suggest you say to your parents or whoever you live with, let's pretends it's your mum:  Hi mum, is it ok if (just say a couple, three at most, of people's names) come over tonight and have a couple of beers?,  She might say no at first but just explain to her that it's better if you have a drink at home where she knows what's going on rather than walking around the streets drunk, that should make her come around.  I've worried to that if I drink I'll say something I regret but I guess I'll try it when I'm ready but since you are ready, good luck.  Also I know I said  it but don't be pressured into it.   Wow! That was beautiful. I never expected anything like that. I really have to applaud you. The ending was sad but with a re-read there were hints and the fact that it seemed so *real* is a great bonus. If I never  knew that you had just written that you could put it in a history book and throw a name or two on it and I'd certainly believe it was from the time.   Ha, ha I love south park!! :D   He was hired   Good luck man, I'm doing this for myself, my future and religion. Everyone here's pretty supportive good luck.   Because they felt   A smaller bear   ***RULES***   * You can only write 3 words  * After you comment you must wait for at least five more comments before you go again  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  **Edit 1** I'm going out for a little while an  I'm excited to read this when I get back.

I'm just kidding I'm having a good laugh just now, thank you all.   Wrecked.   I watched wreck it Ralph.   Ha, ha thank you? I guess. I love writing but every now and then I enjoy doing little joke stories like this and I couldn't help myself but I do like the idea of Ronald and the burger king.   Just incase you misunderstood I'm setting this during the Irish potatoe famine.   Ha, ha sorry about that. What do you think was wrong with my version? Was it all the farting, oh or the ending?   There once was a land that housed a man,  The man was a king, a burger king.  This man was loved by all,  Which would lead to his eventual downfall...   Our tale begins in the land of resturantante in the year of 1397AD. The land was happy and the king was beloved by all. One day King Burgerton the sixth was at chess with his beautiful wife sal-ad when his young, promising jester Ronald of house McDonald strolled through the door with a grin on his face and a twinkle in his eyes.  "Ah, young Ronald" said the king  "My Lord" he replied with a slight hint of laughter in his voice "m'lady"   "Might I ask what's so funny young Ronald?" Ask the king  "Why yes, you may" then out of nowhere young Ronald leaped from where he stood and farted on lady sa-lads face, a little bit of crap came out too.  Ronald held his side with laughter  "Aaaaaugh, aaaaaauuuuuuuuugggggghh!!!" Screamed the queen  "Ronald!! My queen are you ok?" asked the king  "I shall never be clean again!!" She stood from her seat and ran to the window before jumping to her death.  Soon after the king became a ruthless and unjust man. He banned all cola and wouldn't allow any extra sauce!! He tried to kill young Ronald himself but the lad escaped.  Ronald went on to form his own kingdom of monopolyow. Through time it grew, they struggled at first attacks from dragons were a regular occurrence but before Ronalds 300th birthday his kingdom was striving. King budgeting heard of this kingdom and he wondered how a young, immature jester had accomplished such a feat. Straight away he declared war against the kingdom.   The war was long and unforgiving. Winters dragged on and summers seemed to span a lifetime. Yet the war continued. Eventually young Ronald came up with a cunning plan. He had a wicked sorceress temporarily disguise him as the king from the distant land of pizzerianton, Lord hut. He arrived and king burgerton greeted him happily before Ronald, still disguised farted on his face and chopped of his head.    The end.   Ha, ha I'm sorry ;) (but seriously I'm sorry)   Ha, ha don't worry when I said it was rare I meant very rare like very, very rare. Don't worry you won't be using your mouth as a butt anytime soon :)   Yes, it's very rare. When you swallow food it goes through the process of peristalsis which is basically (the very short version) going in one side and comming out the other. This rare disorder waits till your food reaches the end of the process and basically turns around fixing EVERYTHING back up. It will likely never happen to you but if it does it will only happen once.    Ha, ha I was going to say this has been posted a million times. My username is XboxG4mer because I love xbox!! :)   And reverse peristalsis is just shitting from your mouth :)   Nice :)    Great question! I would make it... a diamond, I think since they are very difficult to break and I would likely hide it in a desert or a Forrest. I would kill my father (I'd rather not say why).         I love flying. It's great to look out of the window and see the ground hundreds of feet beneath you.  I lov  taking off, landing and everything about it. You don't get any special feeling but I reccomend you try it one day.   Sorry but what is this.   It would vary. Before nofap at some points I would do it a few times a day or just once  or twice a week.   I'm not in anyway saying that she represents the entire culture but they are very heavily oppressed but know no other way of life so simply accept it.   That was an interesting read, I'm not from the US so I never knew that they never taught that over there.    Ha, ha you're happy because you can be but you're unhappy because you shouldn't be able to be :D   I have spoken with a north Korean woman, she said they have almost no freedom and that's the way they were brought up so they don't understand the concept of freedom, therefore they can't value it. They are taught that the authorities are in charge, what they say goes. No one would dare speak out against it or rebel in anyway because they have no way of doing so and no one would ever speak of such things.    I understand that completely. I love having my views challenged, cause like you said it strengthens them or opens you up to new ideas. Again, like you, I love science. Especially biology and chemistry but for whatever reason people don't always like science and religion being paired but I've  never had any trouble in that department, well at least not anything serious.    What do you mean the freedom is going away? I'm from Scotland and I understand why you would care about freedom since its something virtually everyone values, at least those that have it do. I can't imagine people in north Korea valuing their "freedom" very much.   Good luck man that's rough but at least you're not going to binge or mope over it. Failure doesn't have to be bad as long as we learn from it.      [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/313q43/for_a_very_very_short_period_of_time_each_and/)   Repost! I wrote this yesterday!! :(   Not really, that's when we were conceived not born and we track the days from birth. I guess you're right in a sense.      Yeah we all know this is a repost.      No, I feel like it would drive me mad trying to prevent it or worrying about how close it is or isn't. I'd rather just leave it the way it is.   Ha, ha oh my god I have to make another variation of this and stick it in every bathroom I know of!   April fools!   So those who help keep reddit going can't use it?      So, Cinderella, do you deny the charges of murder of Sir Prince Charming in the 1st degree set against you here today' asked Far, far aways Totalitarian ruler the queen of hearts, who was foreseeing the case...   I know it's April fools and all but I wouldn't wear that even if  you paid me!! :D   'So, Cinderella, do you deny the charges of murder of Sir Prince Charming in the 1st degree set against you here today' asked Far, far aways Totalitarian ruler the queen of hearts, who was foreseeing the case...   Wow! I never thought about that before.   Damn!!   Damn it! The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan!   Oh my god you actually did this!! Yay!! What do you think the general reaction will be to your new movie, especially after the success of the original?   Ok here goes:  Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a boy. A boy just like any other, except for one small difference. He was an egg. His name was humpty. Humpty lived with his mother and father, both loved their son very much, however, his parents were human. This made humpty feel very self conscious and confused since he was the only egg in the neighbourhood that people wouldn't eat, of course this was a positive in his books. He didn't want to be boiled, mashed or scrambled.  One day humpty came home from school and when he walked into his house he saw something that made his eyes yolk. His mother, snow white, was lying on the floor with blood oozing, slowly, from the back of her head. Behind her stood Doc, an enraged, heroine addicted dwarf. He stared straight at humpty, there could be no witnesses! Doc threw himself towards humpty who narrowly dodged doc and his incoming hammer, the same hammer that had just beaten his mother.  Humpty ran from his home and into the deep dark forrest. Doc was still following him, he threw the hammer straight into humpty's back. Yolk began pouring from humpty's bumhole.   ***6 months later***   'Do you Doc, dwarf of house white, understand the accusations put forth against you by Prince, Wilfred charmingDumpty the third and his son Humpty Dumpty?' Asked the queen of hearts who was judging the murder trial which had unfolded after snow whites death.  'I do and I deny each and everyone of them. I would never murder snow white! She was my friend, and sometimes more if you know what I mean' he winked this last sentence which enraged Prince charming who soon tried to attack his wife's killer  'Order! Order I say!!' Yelled the queen. After things settled down the queen continued.  'Doc, can you explain the giant crack on this poor eggs anus?' She asked while she held back a laugh.  'I, eh... are you serious?' He replied  'Yes, quite serious'  'I don't anything about said crack'  'Doc, by denying the charges put forth against you, you are proving not only that you are terrible at lying but that you...' doc sniggered  'Excuse me' said the queen 'might I ask what you find so funny?'  'Yes, ha, ha' he said grabbing his sides 'you said but, ha, ha!!'  'Fuck this' she said agitated 'doc, you have pissed me offer you silly little junky, we have indisputable proof that you murdered snow white, by denying it you have angered me. Off with his head!!'  'Shit' said Doc as he was carried away.  Humpty and Prince charming walked out of the court house victorious.  'How do you feel knowing justice has been served?' Asked Cinderella of Fairy news 5  'I feel supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious' said both of them at the same time.      Sorry I never included more characters but that was fun.        True but his name is Harvey dent   Lara's doppelganger from tomb raider underworld. She was made to be a villain and had no power over what she did, she was eventually freed by Lara though and managed to kill natla so she kind of redeemed herself.   I can't drive either, take a bus or train. I'm from Scotland and the buses and trains are a pretty good quality but I hear that's pretty bad in the US.   To be honest I'm not a love expert, I'm kind of a nerdy guy but just ask her. I know it's easier said than done but force yourself to do it.   Great! Please, whatever you do ask her in person. Don't do it through text, it makes you look scared.   Just try hanging out with her first.      Ok, see I was worried that if she said no then her friends would find out and I'd be made fun of. Just do it. I wanted to for so long, it took me months but one day I woke up and said:  "Today's the day! I'm going to do it"  Just force yourself but no matter what don't do it in front of people and don't put pressure on her. If you do it in front of people she could get embarassed and say no.  Just say:  Hey [insert name of girl here] Do you want to hang out later?   Or even just ask her to the movies.   When you two are alone ask her. If she says yes don't brag about it, be happy obviously but don't ruin it by telling everyone straight away, wait till you're both ready. If she says no just ask her not to tell anyone.    I'd say don't force it. My old girlfriend and I were friends for years and one day I noticed how much I actually liked her. I was to shy to ask her out but eventually I made myself and she said yes. Ha, ha I remember after she went home I jumped around for ages screaming   "yeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss"   Anyway don't go out with a girl just to have a girlfriend, make sure you like her in that sense.   Computer programming?! Great! It's a growing industry, there are only going to be more and more jobs in that department. Follow it, if you think you can do it. Make sure you do enjoy it though, you don't want to be miserable doing something you hate.   In school what is your favourite class, what do you look forward to.   Well I don't have a gf right now because I moved a while back so me and my, at the time girlfriend had to split up.   To stop playing games I found something that would motivate me. History. I want to be a history teacher and I would rather have a nice future than a lifetime of games.   Just find that thing that motivates you to stop.    Ha, ha the day after I could barely keep my eyes open :D I do want to go places in life though and playing games won't get me there, studying will, so even though it was hard I'm happy to do this but during the summer holidays I'm going to play again :)    I would occasionally (during holidays or weekends) do 24 hour game sessions with friends. Now I'm happy with just a few hours because I know it's better in the long run.   Now I'll play for maybe an hour or two on Saturdays and Sundays but I used to play for a minimum of six per day.   I still play my xboxes but only for short periods of time, not like my old hours a day.   Oh, I hate CoD.   I'm doing 5 subjects next year and they're what I'm going to study. An hour and a half of each subject per day means around 7 and a half hours a day. With a break or two of course.   Oh me too I'm a much bigger DC fan than Marvel   I haven't quite finished it yet but when I submit it I'll come back here and tell you :)   Who?   I built agrabah from Aladdin. I made my INterior look like the palace and I even built the cave of wonders. Inside it is a big platforming challenge, at the end you can save genie and get some treasure. I built the marketplace and even Aladdins "home". Remember his place where he looks at the palace.      You have to want to. What do you want to be. I used to just lay around playing xbox, I always wanted to be a doctor but I stopped and asked myself what do I really want out of life? I decided that I wanted to be a history teacher since I love the subject and for other reasons. Any way now I study way more, I used to study for a while each night now I'm going to study for six hours a day for the next 3 weeks. Set a goal and work towards it.  	119
 Did you really think the NSA wasn't doing that?         Because it was all a dog and pony show anyways.   They knew there was no real scandal   Its well documented that Snowden et al aren't really being honest and clear with who has the documents and who has which documents and how many there are.  And they've been really cavalier with how they've managed all that data.    what details do you want? They said this came from the PM's cabinet     https://twitter.com/MichaelKelleyBI/status/610096093955784705  https://twitter.com/MichaelKelleyBI/status/610102108344426497  https://twitter.com/MichaelKelleyBI/status/610102386095472640  Its not clear snowden is being honest about who has what files.    Do you know what FIVE EYES is?   Please tell me you're at least qualified to participate in this conversation   What world do you live in where stolen state secrets don't get people killed?   Greenwald doesn't know as much as he claims to know. Snowden had to teach him how to even use PGP...but now he's some sort of security expert.   Come on now.    Theres no tanks rolling down the street, therefore the USA faces no threats.  See how stupid that sounds?    Its funny when you consider the EU spends effectively NOTHING on defense yet tries to wave their tax base around and proclaim how superior their civil society (read: government subsidy) is while the USA does all the heavy lifting.    Its funny that the Iranian news source is reporting this.    I think historically, they've shot more USA planes down than we've show down of theirs   Huh? How are they the idiots?   we have no way of knowing if these journalists are telling the truth either.  Do you not understand this?  AND GREENWALD ET ALL REVEALED EFFORTS ON INTERNATIONAL SPYING                  Prove that snowden used this type of encryption    its not pointless when you live in a country on top...now is it.  You really don't understand what a lesser nation sees that you don't, do you?   they claim that sourcing someone in the UK PM cabinet isn't good enough   What world do you live in where everything is peaceful and there are no threats and on-going fights for geopolitical leverage?   What world do you live in where theres no threats?    Wikileaks is moving the goalposts.  The files are cracked and the info is gone. Why won't they just stop the charade?  This has nothing to do with Snowden...the intel is out. They keep wanting to make it about him.    this article has nothing to do with spying on americans   They burned for an hour...and planes traveling cruising speed hit them   Unless a jetliner traveling 400mph hits it, this thread is stupid   I'm not blindly patriotic. I've criticized this government more than you'll ever known...but what I'm not is naive about how many other nations would leap at the chance to use our own information against us.     international spying on civilian communications is out of order. If the Russian government was caught sniffing all US citizens youporn browsing habits it's be a violation of US sovereignty.  Yeah. So?   We promote the ideas we want and shun those we don't want.  Theres no such thing as hypocrisy on the world stage     Now, you're just a naive blowhard          The way the NSA does encryption? Yeah, it's unbreakable.  You're talking like you think snowden did this very thing.      Please, tell us more about these security standards you use that all foreign governments can crack with no effort.     Snowden did not take any files with him to Russia. As a teacher of Chinese counterintelligence, he knows how to keep his data safe. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians stole his data, nor did they "break the encryption", this entire story is utter nonsense and transparently so to anybody with a modicum of crypto experience.  Thats a nice cover-up to avoid the fact that they really had no tight clamp on the data that they claimed to   So Greenwald says "my files are safe"...and it turns out they're not.  So where does this leave us?    Did the asparagus make Putin taste bitter this time?     I really don't get Reddit sometimes. Failures are known, successes are not.   PRECISELY!!! Why the hell would they advertise a victory?!?   Because it was a TERRIBLE metaphor and you've overplayed your hand.    I don't advocate dometic wiretapping.   I advocate international spying.    Portugal also has no geopolitical influence around the world.    You haven't shown the extent of your knowledge and frankly, it doesn't matter. You don't work for the NSA and its very telling that so many people claim to be security experts until snowden showed the world how many backdoors there were into all of these "secure" communications.  So yeah, keep flaunting your credentials like your'e the next Thomas Drake or William Binney.   You're neither. You haven't worked on those frontlines patching up the shores of the US's infrastructure. You're probably some low-level employee at Yahoo...but i'm really not interested at learning what you claim to know cause you got a BSE somewhere.    So you're just against any sort of power, right?   **Because i've already admitted domestic spying is a legitimate debate...foreign intelligence is NOT up for debate.**    Call me a hypocrite, but I don't have any problem with the CIA infiltrating the highest ranks of every other country and using that intel to improve the welfare of the United States.  You know why?  Because everyone else does it.  And why should we lose out on that leverage and legitimacy while everyone else does?  Do you want to turn us into...portugal?    No. We're not  You tried to pretend that Poland has border disputes, therefore Americans can't care about their borders.  its not my problem you don't have two bodies of water on both sides of you.     Red herring. He's said all countries spying is bad. Repeatedly.  Too bad. He's never revealed a single Russian intelligence effort. Or chinese. Or Japanese. Or African. Or south american.  I support my country using ANY asset to gain leverage over others.  Theres a reason I don't live in Mexico.    The principles of THIS COUNTRY do NOT extend to everyone outside of this country.   Period  Stop pretending every human is an american citizen.    Its so insulting to see people not even be capable of weighing different sources of information at the same time  If snowden says it, its law.   Its so weird to me   Do you know anything about the Chinese or Soviet or Pakistani  nuclear programs?   You all are so naive at this point   NSA was fine when it does international spying  Domestic spying is one thing.    You're waving the "programmer" card?  I'm a med student.   Does that disqualify me from talking about anything? Cause last I checked, you weren't exactly James Bond either.  So lets get focused again.  Why do you support Chinese spying?   Spying doesn't work that way.  The world isn't flat and its not fair.     **He could have leaked just the domestic stuff, then.**   People do NOT understand this.    Whats evil?  Because I don't consider spying on non-Americans evil.  I fully support it.  I'll wait until Snowden says the Chinese doing it is bad. Because he won't.    I bet you believe everything coming out of Putin's mouth though.    I have no problem discussing domestic intelligence.  The problem is that Snowden turned the gun on his own people...and for that, I have no empathy for whatever happens to him.    Because:  1. Snowden didn't have to reveal foreign intel. THAT is treasonous.  2. There are mechanisms in place to do it 3. he chose to just go rambo and he went off the reservation.   You're talking a big game but won't acknowledge how Poland has basically come hat-in-hand asking the US to reinforce their low-land in case Putin decides to go for a drive across the border.    Snowden doesn't realize the Russians and Chinese don't care about him.    Yeah. You're playing the game where your fingers are in your ears.    Its not speculation. Read the article in the Sunday times.  A member of the UK PM cabinet said the Russians and Chinese intel leaders HAVE the files.    Whats funny to me is that for every prevented attack, you're probably in that predictable band-wagon calling it "entrapment" or "false flags" or something else that just can't wait to steal the credit of legitimate intelligence efforts.   And mind you, I'm a heavy contributor to /r/conspiracy...but the world is more complicated than just thinking the opposite of everything you read is therefore the truth.  Its lazy. You're lazy.    Or...honest?   You seem to think the world is just full of daises and theres no importance in geopolitical intelligence     I fully support the NSA/CIA knowing if any Non-American so much as brushes their teeth for 20 seconds.   Domestically, we can argue changes...but internationally? I want the CIA to have access to any resources they can imagine.    I didn't think there were chances RSA was cracked...until it was revealed.  Nothing phases me anymore.  Snowden got reckless and now the US is at risk. He can't claim to just be a passive participant in this anymore.    But you won't DARE touch what Snowden did to internationall efforts  Whats funny about all of these leakers is that they live with (and I say this as a non-white guy) something that looks like "Western white guilt" of sorts where they're only concerned with how bad the USA is...they'll NEVER say a WORD about Russian spies or Chinese spies in American higher education   Whistle-blowers use official channels. They don't just reveal anything they want then say "SURPRISE! IM A WHISTLE BLOWER!"...especially when you're a government agent with top secret clearance.   He crossed the line when he didn't stick to domestic intel.    I don't feel the need to EVER let up on the gas.   This is the Great Game.   Catch up.   Wow. Sounds like YOU know what snowden had.  Tell us more. What'd he eat for dinner?     No, it isn't clear. In fact, it's buried in so many strata of lies and bullshit, that I'm surprised anyone alive still trusts our government to tell us the truth.  Why are you so goddamn dense?  Yes. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO GET AT US!  Do you not acknowledge this?    The world isn't peaches and cream and candy.  Its rough and everyone is fighting for ANY leverage possible. Stop thinking this world is safe and everyone is a good actor.    Flying-Bagel-Monster, forbid I have my own nuanced opinions as a 1st generation american about how geopolitics works as a citizen and what it takes to maintain the edge internationally.  Go apply for your passport, use it, and get back to me.    I don't agree because you're not offering any immediate practical solutions instead of holding out for ambiguous, non-specific pie in the sky bullshit.   This sounds like a great fiction story...but this doesn't help us RIGHT NOW.  So no, keep that "border-less world" crap to yourself. Its not even relevant...and its insulting you could be that naive to even try to use that as a talking point.    Just show me something other than the anonymous word of a few British spooks. That's about as unreliable a source can get.   2 hours ago you didn't even know this information...and now you're asking for more  Oh really? What do you want? ANOTHER leaker?   Stop moving the goalposts.  This is the closest you'll ever get to this confirmation. Snowden burned everyone living in the west over an ideological hang-up he has about the reality of geopolitics.    Snowden just betrayed every American citizen because he didn't know where to drawn the line.  He took that risk and now, he's failed.     Did you know that the 4th amendment constitutional protection against mass surveillance afforded to Americans... is not unique to Americans?  Thats too bad. Because I'm not really concerned how non-Americans think about intelligence.   All human beings are entitled to this right, and to protection from the law against anyone who might violate it. And yes, they are worrying about it, all those human beings who don't live in the US.   Like hell they are.   Each country has their own interests. All of these hifalutin poetic ramblings offer no important tangible things to discuss. Practically, this is useless. I want the USA to maintain EVERY edge necessary to stay ahead of the pack in reconnaissance and leverage economically and geopolitically...and even militarily.   There are borders for a reason and until you understand this, you'll never learn what allegiance means.    The hegemony works in our favor. Not theirs.   Remember who makes the rules.    I post good links. You should try.    I don't work for the government...but I damn well understand that geopolitics extends beyond the end of the couch in many of the basements that the narrow-sighted AnCaps  ideologues that predominate Reddit.      its in the Sunday Times   ***Reminder to Reddit:***  When you inevitably read something like: no evidence from the leaks of anyone being harmed   DO NOT BELIEVE IT. They would NEVER admit to there being a direct link.   Any intel that gets leaked, gets people killed.   Period.      which is irrelevant to the question "should we be doing this?" and also the question "is this the right thing to do?"  I don't care if its the right thing to do or how messed up you think it is.  I WANT my government to know whats going on around the world. Domestically, we can start talking about "rights" but I don't value or even think about the rights of non-domestic citizens because they should worry about their own issues.       I don't care about foreign governments.  Do you not understand this?  They don't care about you. if you live in the US or Europe these people DO NOT value your "rights" or privacy. They never did.  Domestic spying is one thing...foreign intel leverage is another.  Snowden crossed the line when he did that.   I support the west and western ideals.    Yes. Because only the US has geopolitical aims and only the USA ever does anything bad.  When you deal with classified information and governments NOTORIOUS for stealing intel, then for some reason its hard for you to believe that they'd take stolen top-secret information  You're ridiculous.  Seems you don't understand how geopolitics works.    Thats the same as giving them the files.  Do you not understand this?   Two different conversations.  And frankly, a lot of Reddit doesn't understand how geopolitics works or how power is maintained, gained, or transferred.  its not neat and its not pretty.    ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS REVEAL DOMESTIC SPYING.  BUT NOOOOO...HE WANTED TO GO OFF THE GODDAMN RESERVATION.  THIS. IS. TREASON.    I do NOT care about surveilling foreign governments or interests.  Snowden crossed the line revealing foreign surveillance.    There was no breach until he leaked every bit of foreign intel effort    He's too famous to outright kill.   Being "anti-government" doesn't mean you're inherently right about something. I know you're looking for easy upvotes won't come that easily. Try harder.   Why should I believe Snowden didn't give the chinese or rusians anything?   All of his leaks were anti-american.    He won't say anything. They have his stuff.    i'd be SUPER pissed if he did that to me   Wont be for another decade               well put   they're up 2 MILLION downloads from last month  Good god Rogan   This is hilarious      Eh.         ITT people don't understand that Roger Ailes is the real bad-guy here   I fear for the welfare of any minority student she may have.  What a toxic human   He's not entirely wrong...   just got renewed for season 3 http://t.co/KuDhPE95Jx   Yep. And it sends the message to the populace that "something is being done" about the situation when they're all in on it.  Look at how Germany responded to the Snowden leaks. They gave enough of a show to make it seem like they cared but they really didn't.    Why is it so foreign to you to consider that a group of religious people CAN in theory impose restrictions on their own behavior and societal organization?  A democracy does not mean what you think it does.    *slow clap*      You.   You get it.      What?   That assist is amazing   On land? or out at sea?   I don't even know why anyone would argue this anymore  I mean, whats the difference from a private party at someone's house and this event?  In what world do people live in where those with money, power, or both not collectively gallivant around each other?   anyone that believes in freedom should resist these tyrants  Huh?   You're a professional athlete...why is that unusual?    They will...gotta focus more on shoes though instead of apparel    Why would I *ever* accept what Natural News has to say?   Is this for any other boroughs?      He's preachy and a bit of a blowhard       A fundamental aspect of a democracy is having the right to protest, the right to organize freely, the right to vote, a relatively free press...  False  Thats an AMERICAN democracy  You're biased and you don't even know it            Love the War Nerd   They could have banned /r/coontown though   Not necessarily.  But Iran definitely has bomb components. Ask A.Q. Khan   Because its Boston   I don't know...I can't imagine Israel not sharing SOME of that info with the US         Democracy TECHNICALLY could result in the saudi arabia that exists.  I don't know why people confuse democracy with liberalism          listen to the kids threatening to kill the officer  So, you're lying now, huh?   They weren't tresspassing         Trololol   This video just proves the cops point.    Eh...guy wasn't really complying.   Are we going to ignore this guy fighting back?   i bet you have 50,000 unread emails      How's middle school?   No. Watch the video. All the girls were leaving and he was cursing at them and they told him not to get so angry and as they were walking away, he pointed her out and then you saw everything unfold      Can you explain shortly?   She was walking away when he snapped.    Thermite!   you're trying to rationalize the irrational  Just accept that what Robertson said makes sense if you are religious         Not really it seems. I mean, if you're really religious, theres nothing wrong with that line of thinking...                  It wasn't a private pool party.    This is unreal   Good thing your computer opens those links for you.    We can judge them when they overreact     If they were atheists... They wouldn't have that many children and could properly take care of the ones they have so that this never would have happened.  This is why people hate atheists.   I understand your point, its not exactly even true to a degree to make such a blanket statement   They would literally remove all impetus I have for using third-party apps if they made it easier to input events into the calendar.  Apps like Fantastical do a MARVELOUS job with this and I don't see whats so complicated about going ahead and doing it in house. Is such a thing patented?   If you're not sure what I mean, look here: https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone   This isn't hate speech.    They are just trying their best to keep the situation under control while officer hot head is going around acting berserk.   It only takes one.  And he's the ranking officer    Because they are kids, they should be allowed to bite, kick, scream, insult, steal, trespass, murder, etc without any retaliation or self defense. Because they are just kids. They get a free pass on everything. Yep, nothing illogical about that.  Thats not what happened  Its not as if people don't listen after repeated warnings to step back, get on the ground, etc. Nope, she wasn't given multiple chances to respect authority at all. He just drove up and immediately started throwing her on the ground. She totally wasn't resisting arrest at all, no sir.   She was walking away when the cop went and grabbed her      Theres exactly no chance less. Pedophilia is what it is. Religiosity just tends to have a different effect on the outcome   She didn't.

 Thanks :)    :'(   You are right, that is why I am not doing so. I fully agree that I am too inexperienced, and I do not plan to do so anytime soon. That is why I am asking here, to be able to find out how to find this information.  Nevertheless, thanks for your answer: short and to the point.   I don't expect venture capitalists. I'm talking about friends and family. The only reason I would want increased capital is to allow me more opportunities. Any other questions that may help you understand?   Could someone please explain why Indonesia's GDP is so cyclical (yearly)? Its GDP rises the first 3 quartets, before falling in the fourth.   Is this because of commodity experts? However, its largest commodity, coal, is merely 10% and not cyclical. Palm oil, 7.3% of exports, is not either.   I guess I should have added a TLDR:  I invest. I want other people to give me money. Their capital will track my portfolio (eg. my value +10%, their money invested rises +10%). They become minority owners of my portfolio, owning 'shares' of my portfolio/vehicle. They can sell the 'shares' to me or other 'partners' and earn/lose the difference. They have voting rights to the investment decision using their 'shares'. They sign document agreeing to all of this AND that they understand they may lose all money.  Is this legal? Will I have problems?   Thanks for the fast response! Where would I be able to find the french laws? If that is asking too much, where did you find the US laws?   Hey r/Investing! I hope this post matches the high quality that this amazing subreddit provides to all. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short. I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds), living in France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the 'investment vehicle' to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this).   That is awesome! Would you mind showing me your website, kickstarter, or plan? Honestly, I would like to help you if I can, specifically in accounting (not that there is much point for it, but I would want to build balance sheets, PnLs and cash flow forecasts).   Thanks for the response! That is something I used to do in Poland (which got me in trouble but yolo ca$h money bling bling). Now that I live in Paris, and are in high school, we can leave the campus and all stores are available to us. :(  If you have other ideas, please tell me!   So how does this apply to 'les Pays Bas'?    http://hope4grantcounty.org/wp-content/themes/hope4grantcounty/images/there-is-hope.svg  Would you be nice enough to tell me a bit about the atmosphere in Spain right now? Where are you from, what job do you work in, what do people think about the parties? Economy? Euro/EU? I would love to hear a inside perspective that isn't from the news. If you do not want to, by all means don't. I'm just very curious!   I would love doing that, but its impossible living in the middle of Paris. I was thinking maybe bringing newspapers or even breakfast (croissant, etc.) to neighbors (and later grow) every morning. What do you think?    Excluding school, etc. I am not able to pay taxes, which puts me in a difficult position (by declaring taxes myself my family will lose a lot of its 'pro-natalist' benefits). Secondly, I did not localize a problem that I could solve living in Paris, which would allow me to open a business. Costs here are very high too, which would mean that I would need a large price to cover them. But please, if you have any ideas or guidance, I would love to here it. What do YOU do? Tell me your story!   I am investing through my father's account as I learn and ease myself into the world of investing, which limits my risk of losing too much money. Therefore, I do not have the privilege of exploring my broker's capabilities (however, this will certainly something I will now try to ahcieve). Nevertheless, could you please tell me a bit more about investing in bonds. Thanks    1) Governments of major economies, nothing too hard 2) From what I understood, purchasing bonds in the primary market requires high capital (thousands of euros), which I do not own being only 17. If I am wrong (as I often am), please enlighten me.  Thanks for the answer by the way, I appreciate it greatly.   Just don't vote for Podemos and you should be fine in the long term :) Hang on tight!   +1 for "depending on what part of France you're in, some have more grass then others"  Thanks for the guidance, being so young I guess it is what I need most. I have trouble finding resources to work out the myriad of taxes and regulations imposed here, and I am not sure what to do. If only there were entrepreneur subreddits for each country (or at least an EU wide one)...  I would love if I could help you with accounting. I would love to help create and evaluate balance sheets, PnLs, cashflow forecasts, if you're (or anyone else) is interested.   Makes sense. I may be wrong, but maybe having 50%+ as one colour would allow you the possibility.   Are you investing through your fathers account or on your own?   Too young, only 17. Living in France does not help either :(   Im sorry if I may be wrong, but isn't the Netherlands, Les Pays Bas, plural, and therefore neither?   The green area, "0-9%" should be further subdivided. The natural rate of unemployment is commonly around 4-5%. 9% unemployment is not good by any means, so why is it in the same range with 3% unemployment?   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VF5yjPly2Ew/maxresdefault.jpg  PS. I agree with you.   Hey r/investing!  Im having trouble understanding how to buy bonds (I am only interested in government ones) in secondary markets. I understand what face value, coupon, yield, etc. mean and how they are calculated and what they represent; but I fail to understand how to buy them and how the secondary bond market system works.  I would be very grateful if anyone helps :) Besides, bonds are the other side of the coin in investment, and yet, bond investment is so underrepresented here. I am sure an answer here would help at least a couple of you out there.  Thanks for the help, and wish you all the best for your portfolios! :)  	25
 OP please provide a link to that post. Thanks! :-)      Best bet would be to search the KC area. I know some people who were a part of that group, but they never mentioned anything happening in Lawrence.   The United Way of Douglas County provides information about volunteer opportunities in the Lawrence area:  www.volunteerdouglascounty.org   There's nothing in the wallet? Seems kind of pointless to post about an empty wallet.      I work at an elementary school and knowing this worries me. During the first week of December, over half of the students in a kindergarten class were sick with the flu and the numbers grew throughout the school.          Have you tried Elevate Massage at 14th and Mass? Their deep tissue and hot stone massages are amazing.    Factory farms are clearly bad, but what if you raise your own animals as a source of survival? Would that still be deemed bad? I understand that you're pro-vegan, but that is not a style of living everyone is willing to fulfill, or can for varying reasons.    There are monthly game nights at Conroy's Pub. You are bound to find people who love anime.   So it's a reddit form of geocaching? o_O    If you want to skip the long lines, order online. You can go straight to the registers and pick up your order.          I finished reading it and the entire story  was structured like that.   Isn't that the sole purpose of confession bear? I'm confessing something that I WILL NOT share with the student. He's only in 3rd grade and still has a lot to learn. But it is sad to see just how much.    3rd grade  Thanks for your kind words, asshole      They may be experiencing stress due to the weather. Cold and dreary weather can cause stress and/or depression in humans. Dogs and cats may very easily experience the same emotions, especially if they are accustomed to going outside.   Winter is coming. Are those in need receiving adequate assistance? If not, why? Lawrencians tend to work for the needs of others, but are we/they living up to that expectation?    First time back home in over two years. Spent the day shopping with my mom and ran in to a girl from high school. She smiled and looked excited to see me. I said hi and kept on walking. Felt like a complete bitch afterward, but I didn't feel like talking to someone who treated me like shit in high school.    If you were the only one he let hold, how do you expect for the cat to react once you leave home? Adopting him is a must, but it would definitely come as a shock to the cat once you left.    Check out the temp agency ExpressPros located on Iowa. They can hire you to start working - a lot of different locations in Lawrence - the very next day.    No. I worked with students from K-5 and focused most of my attention on students who needed extra help with their assignments. Before leaving class, several students ran up to me and said 'Bye Miss X' and gave me a hug. It was a great first day.             Kids of this generation are still stuck with the idea 'my vote does not matter'.   *Hopefully* they will see just how wrong they were and vote in two years.    [Audra](http://www.audraesque.com/) is an amazing photographer!      Did you use a macro lens?      An up close picture:  http://www.imgur.com/SlVDf7M.jpeg      KU not Lawrence. People don't know what you mean by Lawrence.     Obvious given the day, but still a warning of what to expect.       I sing and try not to cry.   That is another thing I like about South Park, they incorporate classic hits that a lot of people from this generation have probably never heard (I am a child of the 80's). Same goes for Family Guy.   I cry every time I watch "You're Getting Old".   It is great to see that someone is taking the time to break down and understand the social issues portrayed in each episode. I do that for most episodes and my boyfriend thinks I am crazy. Try it sometime, you may be surprised of what you can learn, and further understand, just by watching the show.   The Simpsons did something like this during their first few seasons. I have yet to figure out why they stopped. Either way, I lost interest in the show.  edit: Spelling      Skipper or Barbie? Or do you swing for Ken?         Nope. I started writing chapter two with the first pencil but it made my finger hurt...cheap plastic grip. So I changed to the second pencil.   It is really easy to make and tastes great!

Went to a health museum in 3rd grade. Started feeling sick while there and was sent home with a 100+ temperature after returning to the school. We had a morning teacher and an afternoon teacher, so I was sent home after the morning portion of class.   Edit: words   Easier for people with poor eyesight and those who cannot see through the peephole (i.e. short people).   I am short and would love to have one on my front door. It would make me feel so much safer, considering where I live.  Edit: words   Thank you! :-)   Use of passive voice....  I was born to - meant to - do art therapy.    I like being optimistic.    Working with children and adolescents through art therapy.    I have spent the past year applying for jobs throughout the area and this is the first time I finally received a call for an interview. *Hopefully* it pays off.   edit: words      Did you bring back any buffalo milk mozzarella? Such a delicacy and it is impossible to find in the US.    We rarely ate dinner together, unless it involved the downstairs TV and my brothers and I sitting in front of it eating.   We weren't and still aren't a close family.   You should candy it.

Peppercorns:  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pepper   It tasted great after I added some salt and pepper, and yes, it did. Easy to make and so much better than buying from the store.      I highly doubt either would work. Using a juicing machine squeezes the juice from the vegetable/fruit and discards the remaining pulp into a separate container.

My Mom: only sluts wear tampons.   When I told her I bought some for when we were in Key West for vacation - great timing...- she nearly flipped shit.   What does that have to do with this post? o_O   I agree, but not when you are dealing with Republicans who see everything other than what they believe to be un-American and downright foolish.  They tend to dismiss the possibility of progressive ideas.    The problem with online forums is the fact you can never quite be certain which are valid opinions, and which are just trolls.   Tolerance cannot always be accepted when dealing with trolls.     I could careless what he/she said, but felt obligated in putting them on the spot due to their comment.   People like you bore and disgust me. You're the one who should go away.          Nickelodeon, Disney, and Fox were my best friends growing up. Here's a short list of favorite shows.  Animaniacs  Goof Troop  Rugrats  As Told By Ginger  Bobby's World  Ducktales  Welcome to Pooh Corner  Edit: Included a few more shows.    Back in 3rd grade - early 90's - we would watch an episode of Wishbone and The Magic School Bus every week. Great times...      Alive but barely breathing.  I've come to the conclusion you'll have a 1 in 10 chance of finding something worth reading or watching each day. But even then, the stories often suck and include nothing but gossip like reporting.      Yeah, it is a lot of information to take in at once. Most of their lists are 20-30, not 100.   Smoke some weed, sit back, and enjoy the video.      I twitch when a sight or idea scares me. Thanks for the multiple switches. Only thing worse would be if you added a clown to the picture.

There are also several temp agencies along Iowa St.  Hope that helps....   Why the fuck did more people upvote this and downvote the link I posted an hour before this one? :-( I deleted the post after seeing the love and support of this one.  Oh well. Can't wait to see the episode.   P.S. I look forward to downvotes of this comment. Peace, Love, and Skittles.    Jupvote for the jupvote.  F*cking love VSauce.         I couldn't think up a creative title, but the video is definitely worth watching.      I have used this vet since moving to Lawrence nearly a decade ago.  Even though there are a wide range of veterinarians in the Lawrence area, CPAH is the only location in town that grooms cats.   I agree with /u/SmirkingRevenge that they are somewhat pricey, but it is well worth the few extra bucks. I have never been dissatisfied and they have a very knowledgeable staff. Unlike vets I have gone to in the past, they will actually explain everything to you and let you know the best options for your pet, instead of trying to sell you things your pet does not need.      The cats are Maru and Hana and their owner posts videos of them every week on his YouTube channel - mugumogu.

Thank you so much and I hope it is an experience worth remembering.    Thank you!   I was not sure if I should write it with just my approach, or to include my brothers in finding out. I will go ahead and make everything singular. I am more concerned about my own finding out, not my brothers.   Should I remove that sentence from the first paragraph and leave it as is, without adding more information - my name and finding out? I'll definitely continue with the 'wanting to meet you' at the end of the letter. Also requesting a reply is a better way to approach the subject.  Going too far in-depth with the 23andMe is too much? He's in his early-to-late 70s and I am uncertain whether or not he's that tech savvy, and would have any idea what I was referring to.

It's an hour away and receiving some special care. It has been a week and I feel empty. Our separation has had a devastating impact on my life.  Nah, I'm rather well. Frustrated of the fact I procrastinated on buying a case, but that's what I get. The only downside is the fact I can't text my best-friend. Emailing will work for now, but texting is a lot easier...plus sending pictures is way easier than using my DSLR, uploading the pictures, and sending.   I spend less time reading Digg posts and whatever I come across on reddit. Plus I've spent a lot of my time reading about my favorite subject - art therapy. All in all, the separation was for the better. Everything might change once I have it back.   	107
 At least you don't fly to places to fire people.   Watch Up in the Air   I enlisted into the Navy just for this reason. Haven't left yet tho, but I hope they didn't lie about the traveling.   I probably wont though right:/ what are we like 12 million square miles of area? I'm happy with just seeing a new place at least once a year.  Favorite place I've visited so far was Puerto Rico. I really want to visit the Pacific Northwest and Spain. So, where have you guys gone/where do you want to go?  Is anyone not really into it? I have a couple friends who think that their hometown is perfectly large enough to be explored during their whole lifetime. I dont really understand this type of thinking tho.   You have a ron Swanson username lol, way more over the top. I thought Titus was the right amount of "character" for how the show felt .   Why don't you wait to see of his job works out before doing anything?   Second time we did it she wasn't on her period and it was definitely better, but honestly the first time didn't feel gross for me. All I could think of was how I was getting laid.    She had her period and I didn't care, waited 19 years, didn't want to wait any more. It was a good time, probably didn't blow her mind, but it was good for both of us.  Overall the relationship was a huge waste of time though.   Lol saw this episode today   It will also make you feel hungry    He has a book coming out and the kinlde edition of thunderstruck has been on sale for only $1.99 last couple weeks. Also, isn't the NYT lost mostly bullshit?   Former pizza guy, glad you Re getting tipped well. The worst is when a wealthy person doesn't tip. Just doesn't make sense.   Not fantasy at all, but Stoner by John Williams is about a farm boy who goes to university and falls in love with academia. Its set in the early 1900's in the American south/mid west.    Shit, when you say English. Do you mean England English? If so, forget what I posted.   Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, about a recent wall street trend.   Devil in the white city by Erik Larson, amazing book about the 1893 Chicago world fair, its construction and the serial killer living in the city at the same time. I just finished it a week ago and I find myself thinking about the time in which the story takes place a whole lot.   The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, not too heavy on narrative, sometimes it feels like an info dump, but a very well written and extremely well researched book on Al qaeda and the cia/fbi on the road to 9/11.    On episode six and this show is hilarious. I thought the trailer was horrible, but the show is so much better than expected. Its a mix of 30 Rock and Arrested Development.   Did aspergers exist before the internet?   Its a comedy show   Tell those girls you know what you just posted, trust me   I'm half way through Storm Front and not really enjoying it. Thank you for saving me some time.   Most Vonnegut   I've read three of his novels and enjoyed them all, but Michael Chabons "Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" seems very intimidating to me. Its about 600 pages and it won a Pulitzer. I feel like I'm going to judge it harder than I did his other books. What if my expectations are too high? What if Chabons style doesn't work past the 400 page novel?   Most important book series ever. Strong in popularity when for the first time ever books had to compete with the internet and video games. An entire generation of readers would have been lost if it weren't for harry potter.   Harry Potter 1, made me want to read Harry Potter 2, that led to 3, and eventually until 7. When I finished the series I said, what now? Now, all the other books. Any book. I just need more stories. Thank you Rowling!   The Sun Also Rises. Its more about the beautiful people in 1920's Europe though. Ots also a masterpiece.   Yes yes to The Stand and 11/22/63. The Stand specifically has a lot of character growth   That's not your fault though. Dont get pushed into something you don't want.    Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon. A pot head college professor gets to know a student,  and a lot of other stuff happens.   I read AG riddles first book from that trilogy and I skimmed the last 200 hundred pages (the whole second half). Honestly, I dont think it was a well written book, and this one you're reading isn't probably that great either. Just read a summary online of what happens at the end and move on to a better book   I have the same fears for myself. I dread that first week more than the whole commitment.   Tina Fey Bossypants  Adam Copeland "on Edge" (wrestling autobiography)   Besides the ratings system being a total joke, there are other ways to watch.   Lol is that a question mark   I saw the movie and it made me sad. Does the book add anything?   Lucky, I still have over 80 left   Really need to watch this one   How did you think those would be succesful   No you need a recruiter to make you appointments and prescreen you.   I'm reading Persepolis right now. Deals more with Islamic revolution than straight Cold War.   Great Lakes. I was lazy. But I ended typing it up anyways lol   Thanks for the ama!   How often do you get people completely backing out of shipping? Young 18 year olds suck at knowing what they want in life so I would be surprised if you said not many.   That $7,500 figure is that the cost of getting them to GL?    Haha, not really. Just a socially awkward depper   That makes sense. I'm socially awkward so I don't really speak to anyone in the meetings lol...     I ship on 5/12!   Have you ever been to r/raisedbynarcissists?  I thought my mom was one of a kind, but then I went to that subreddit and found that a lot of parents can be like that.   How long till you ship?   My mom cried in anger/sadness the second I called her and told her I swore in. She's more accepting now, but that initial reaction was horrible.   What's the point of DEP meetings? I've gone to four already and they all felt like a waste of time. Is it just another weeding out process?   The Stand, but I guess I'm confusing writing style for content.   There has to be a book like this. Right now a commercial for some vacation hot spot came on television, sandy beaches, drinks, and plenty women. So in my head I instantly went to that place I always go to: What if I took a vacation, and something went horribly wrong?   Is there any good novel in which a vacation goes horribly wrong? Murder, disaster, tragedy anything.  Thanks   For the physics or the entertainment? Cause it was entertaining   I wasn't even mad. I just told myself mad dog was a twin   Oh ok, makes sense.   With that degree you'd be dumb to Enlist. Why don't you try officer   I dont know much about that job, but from your post I can tell that you want to work on air planes. Question is, where do you want to work on airplanes? Navy has aircraft carriers and multiple Naval Air Stations. Air Force has only land bases.   I've read that sometimes new sailors have to do watch after the PIR. Is that true?   How was the medical screen during p days ?   What did you do after graduation, did you visit Chicago?   Yes, and I had to write some quick mini essays on what happened and why it will never happen again. Also had to speak with a head of recruiting over the phone explaining everything again so that he would aproove the waivers    Is it a misdemeanor or a citation?   Because I got in with misdemeanors..   Did you see any DQ's?   I know certain rates get different medical exams, so I'm just wondering about the regular rates, not seal/nuke/aircrew.  Is it just the same as MEPS?   I just remembered him as Brad Pitt   Who the fuck is Gerry   I love it so much, I think people dislike the non-linear storytelling, but I think its great that it did something different than other comic book films.   Kingsman really surprised here. They did start putting out better commercials recently, because the first trailer was straight up Cody Banks.      Thank you. I will start squatting.   	62
    I found a reference to this in this Popular Mechanics story - http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a15134/how-bb-8-star-wars-droid-works/         He's saying commentators should avoid hyperbole because cricket isn't that important.        	7

 I think a prison architect stream would be the best way to replay the game.Not an everyday thing just maybe once or twice a week would be really nice and a good break in the usual content   I really like alot of the songs in the Eurotruck simulator stream playlist is there a way to access the playlist ? I went on to spotify but couldn't find the playlist when I searched "Sips".If anyone has a link or instructions on how to get to the playlist that would be great even a screenshot or shots of all the songs Thank you in advance @_@    All the Harry Potter books   No matter how good someone is or how well trained the winner of the war usually goes to who is motivated more we saw it in the jungles of Vietnam and now we may potentially see it in the desserts of Iraq  	4
 I disagree with that assertion. Once an officer draws his firearm, there are few if any options other than shooting and killing his target. They're equipped with tasers, pepper spray, batons, and other options.    You explicitly claimed to have taken it. I don't know why anyone would believe you after you blatantly and needlessly lied like that. This photo was posted in this sub twelve hours before your post.    Thanks for the info.   He wasn't being unruly. He was sitting down holding a camera with both hands. They definitely could have done more to communicate and reason with the guy. You can say it was justified all you want, but if that old man (as cantankerous and obnoxious as he is) were to have been shot and killed, or anyone else in that room had been shot and killed, all of this would have been a moot issue. Those guards are there to protect everyone in that room and they undoubtedly failed.    Thanks. I apologize for my hateful remarks too.   You didn't specify the person was mentally ill. You're moving the goalposts here dude.   This is how that situation works. You either give him the benefit of the doubt and treat him like a human being, or you find out about his mental health issues when he's already on ice. I understand that officer safety is important, but the people you encounter each day are just that, people. I've argued with officers on here that felt that the shooting of James Boyd was completely justified. It's easy for me to get worked up when I think I'm talking to someone with no respect for human life.     Was he OP? When "you took this picture"? I understand reposting, but was it really necessary to claim that you're the one who actually took the photo and fabricate some bullshit story about it?   **OP is a big fat phony!!**   Yes, the internet must ensure that never goes away.    The deleted comment below was the one in which OP claimed that he took this photo.   **OP is a big fat phony!!**   **OP is a big fat phony!!**   There's not a snowball's chance in hell. If anything, this frothy mixture is a walking talking advertisement for the Democratic party.    Source? Everything I've read said he wasn't arrested or charged.   Regardless, that security guard fucked everything up here. He didn't announce himself or his intentions. He went right for the camera that was strapped to the man's neck. Obviously anything related to the neck is going to trigger a fight or flight response as well as involuntary reactions. There's not a single excuse for the guard's lack of communication. He went directly to physical violence. He had no justification to put his hands on that man or his property. That guy is an unprofessional hack. Police officers (and apparently ex police officers) are violent thugs. When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.    Clearing rooms and using a firearm as a compliance device are two different things.    I wasn't talking about this video. I was talking about the aforementioned scenario.   If someone was an actual threat and unwilling to listen to reason, and I had backup, a taser, and pepper spray. I would start with the taser. Two adult men in reasonable shape with multiple "less lethal" options should be able to disable and restrain a suspect. If not, then keep him at bay until more help can arrive. There's also [this] (http://www.slashgear.com/police-test-less-lethal-bullet-alternative-17369435/) and other stuff like it. There's no reason to go straight for lethal weaponry when dealing with unarmed American citizens.    I cry afoul because often times the police are lying when they say a subject tried to grab their gun or otherwise.   He did break the law. An actual cop cannot take your camera. This guy is a private security guard. The fact that he broke the law was illustrated by the fact that old man wasn't arrested or even detained.    It's not the printing presses that should fund the basic income. If you'd read a bit about the topic, you'll find that it's perfectly viable through progressive taxation. It's going to be necessary too, because soon enough no one will be able to afford any of the products that capital produces.    I dunno, that piece of shit was trying to steal his camera, and it looked like the old man got a few good licks in. I know I'd rather not get my face beat in by a geriatric.    Thank you for your simple explanation as to how you'd justify killing a mentally ill person. You're a fucking coward.   Edit: Make sure you take a screen shot of this comment to show all of your buddies.    You're in /r/basicincome, so you should be able to guess what my solutions would be.   Your solutions just shore up the wealth of the already wealthy. They wouldn't do anything to help the working classes.    That doesn't have the slightest chance of being passed. If the GOP keeps up with this level of rhetoric, they may find it impossible to pass any legislation for the foreseeable future.    And they use assjacks like Rick Santorum to drug you into a coma.    Well, I think the distinction that it's not paint or some other permanent medium is relevant.    That's fucked up. Put up some flour pasted posters in that decaying shithole of a town and they treat you like you've defaced the Taj Mahal.    You don't have my respect and I doubt you'll be earning any here by insulting other veterans. Where would grunts be without the tactical and technical assistance of others? You're a jackass and a insult to every uniform you wear.   I'm not trying to intimidate you. I'm not like you. I'm not driven by the basest instincts and drives.   I'm pointing out the giant holes in your logic. You're talking about being back into corners? Answer my question piggy.   This is why you are not supposed to pull a firearm unless you fully intend to use it to kill; where do you go from there, hot shot? You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs. You shoot an unarmed person because you chose to over escalate the situation.    You're talking about killing your way out of corner you created for yourself. There's no honor in needlessly killing unarmed people.    Yup. It's called the constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered by the protections enumerated in the constitution.   Edit: forgot a few key words.    Man, fuck you. Every veteran has earned the respect of the uniform they wore and the service they provided to their country. You're a fucking scumbag.   You're already getting combat veterans here arguing with you. I'd quit while I was ahead if I were you.   Edit: Also why don't you answer the question in my other comment? Where do you go from there, officer pigshit?    Yes during the initial invasion you guys were obviously on the offensive. But afterward things changed right? And like you said, that was war.   It seems after taking another look at your comment we're really on the same side.    No. Taxes are not too high. American effective tax rates aren't any higher than most other places. And instead of creating treaties and agreements that make things easier for these guys, we should be creating international agreements to reign in tax havens and hold these companies accountable. Apple is doing that because, as of yet, there haven't been any meaningful repercussions for doing so. It's time we started making these assholes pay for the things they do.    My thoughts exactly. Doesn't Shepard Fairy just do posters? Is an internationally acclaimed artist putting up posters in their post apocalyptic city really an appropriate use of police resources?    I am a veteran. I did not see combat but I was trained to use a firearm. How dare you insult my service or the service of anyone else simply because we had different specialties. Fuck you pig.   The combat veterans I know have explained that they had very strict rules of engagement. Nothing like the bullshit the police get away with here. I'm sure within a few hours some other veterans will add to this.    Oh, C'mon man. Of course an officer has the same right as anyone else to defend himself. If someone actually attacks an officer or tries to tear something out of their hands that obviously warrants the use of force. Use of force  equal to beating the shit out of someone   That rarely happens. Usually the officer is the aggressor. There are countless videos on here of cops trying to steal people's cameras and assaulting them. Cops purposefully engage a person in a way that elicits an involuntary response. Like putting their hands on and pushing people in the chest or neck. Grabbing a person's extremities and bending them in a way that forces your body to react.   Don't give me this bullshit that people aren't being fair to cops. The asshole in the video blatantly walked over to the elderly gentleman and grabbed his camera which was around his neck. What did he expect to happen when he broke the law, violated this man's person, and tried to steal his property?                Yes, it's a development. Granted it's a depressing development that doesn't progress the prosecution of these killers, but it's definitely a development. You are an idiot. You shouldn't talk to people about things or post comments on the internet about topics that you're not willing to read about. When you do this, you waste everyone's time, including your own.    Computers aren't responsible for wage stagnation.   Fly away executive pay and income inequality are the result of the regression of our tax system. We removed the disincentives for insane levels of executive pay when we pulled back the top marginal tax rates. Our tax system is effectively regressive at this point. Executives can command unlimited levels of pay and neither they nor their employers face any tax penalties. So naturally that's where all of the new revenue is going to go. This has also resulted in wage stagnation so it's no coincidence that wage stagnation began in the late seventies/early eighties when the top marginal tax rates were effectively neutered.    Again did you read the fucking article?   It's a development because a group of activists tried using an obscure state law to circumvent the regular grand jury process to bring charges against the officers. This story is about how that process failed and their affidavit was dismissed even though the initial judgement was that there was probable cause to bring multiple charges. Now it's up to the DA to bring charges and it doesn't look good.   Read the article you fucking putz.    That's just pure incompetence. I don't know if they're using this bullshit to sell papers or just distract the public from real news like the TPP, but they should be ashamed of themselves.    I'm more curious about whether the other user is full of shit.    He's eager to kill.    Where did you find this because a different user posted the exact same picture and claims that he took it.   Edit: yeah, turns out that the other user was full of shit.    Oh, I know he is. Pretty pathetic if you ask me.   Edit: We did it. Op backed out of his initial claim that he took the photo.    What you're saying isn't wrong, but it doesn't explain the wage stagnation of the last 30+ years.    You have a valid point. I really doubt this is actually his photo anyway.    Maybe a ruling with a settlement that actually hurts the system will be cause for change. $5 million isn't shit for the bureaucrats in NYC.    It doesn't look good does it? I dunno, I'll give OP at least an hour before I make a decision.    This is why you are not supposed to pull a firearm unless you fully intend to use it to kill; where do you go from there, hot shot? You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs. You shoot an unarmed person because you chose to over escalate the situation.    You're confused because those of us in the military and the general public are trained to treat firearms with respect and to only use them for their intended purpose which is to kill people and animals.   We don't get the "gun as a deadly compliance device" training.    That's not true.    Is this actually your photo?   https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3d2l8a/lafayette_indiana_cop_parks_in_handicap_spot/  This was posted 12 hours before your post.    How is anything that I said disrespectful? Did you read the article?    Right, the ruling class aren't properly compensating their employees because of the gold standard. Der.    I imagine a swab is all that's necessary. They're trying to establish origin.    You understand that it's a movie right?    This is a new development in an old case. Do you ever read the article?    Well, they certainly weren't condemning it* either. There's at least one law enforcement rapist story posted here daily. Quite a few of the victims are children.   So you really just guessed?    There are no accidents involving firearms and trained professionals. Weapons don't fire themselves.    That's $51k to $66k with next pay grade being $61k to $79k. Let's not forget housing allowance, COLA, medical and dental coverage, an amazing retirement package, incredible job security, and a bunch of other benefits. It's not like they're the most under paid people in the world.    Right, and they don't deserve to be individually doxxed.    I would delete this comment if I were you. Just a heads up, this is grounds for a shadowban.    Oh, he must be one of those "bad apples" I'm always hearing about.    Okay too many commas. It's not worthy of all of hate you're giving it.    Maybe he shouldn't have attempted to steal the man's camera.    [Yes, it did happen.] (http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/nypd-sergeant-throws-semen-on-his-crush.html)    Yeah no shit. Wouldn't it makes sense to compare Bates to Gein and not the other way around?   Edit: Why am I being downvoted? Bates is a **fictional character** based loosely upon Gein the **real person**.   Yet another Southerner here. I grew up with the Dukes of Hazzard. To me, it says good 'ol boys who never meant no harm. Yeah, it's the Rebel flag, but that's the point. It's rebellion. IMO, it would be extremely appropriate if someone used it in a protest against the NSA.   Jesus Christ, did he read any of the arguments against it?    That's a book, not a peer reviewed study.   Edit: added a comma.    Oh c'mon, man. That quote can from an AARP blog post that provided no sources and no statistics. Those people choosing to be with different types of partners doesn't mean they went from gay to straight.   The second link was to a study on sexual plasticity. I wasn't asking for proof of sexual plasticity. I was asking for a source on your claim:  There are a non-trivial amount of cases of gay people becoming "straight"   Well we certainly shouldn't be publicly funding a program that largely confuses kids and fails to meet its main goal.    This needs publicity and awareness. People need to be reminded about what they get by voting Republican.    There are a non-trivial amount of cases of gay people becoming "straight"  Source?      I was talking about the next smart ass comment.   They lost the war. Sorry for being so ~~brunt~~ blunt and I do accept the downvotes.  +117  It's because "they lost", and not because they weren't heroes, but instead murderous brutes.    It doesn't matter where you are sugar, it's your bedtime. Goodnight.    I'm in a predominantly red state, Missouri, and I'm not opposed to Medicaid expansion or subsidies, but I can confirm that is a very common view point. It's odd too, because from what I gather it seems to be largely motivated by misinformation and outright lies. Most people don't actually understand how Medicaid expansion or subsidies work.    "And I do accept ze downvotes for mein Fatherland, mein Reich and mein Fhrer!"   So the wealthy don't pay into and then receive social security when they retire? No, everyone gets social security. It's not like wealthy people have ever been known to turn down extra money.    I'm not a lawyer. I'm a taxpayer and a voter. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I'm simply stating my opinion. You're obviously as firm in your convictions as I am.    And what do you know, yours began with and has been sustained solely on personal attacks. Now run along to bed. You don't want your mom to take away your internet privileges.    How clever. Go to sleep. It's past your bedtime.    If you looked at my initial comment you would see that I said percentage. Keep in mind when all is said and done the Romneys are left with more than $11 million to live on whereas the median income family is out more than a fifth of their living expenses (that's right, not just their incomes). They've contributed a fifth of their living expenses (that's food taken out of mouths, medicine and doctors visits that have to be skipped, necessities like a new roof or a new transmission that they'll somehow make do without) and you and Romney call them lazy and moochers.   You are a simple child. You have no business discussing these things. Go to bed kiddo.   Edit: your numbers are wrong. The total tax on the median family $10k. Which means that the Romneys pay 213 times that of the median family, which would make sense considering that they take home 282 times the income.     I'm done with you. You make claims and haven't provided a single source. To my sources you simply say "that didn't exist" or "that doesn't happen". Sure you can simulate the experience of winning an argument by never actually providing one. You're willfully ignorant and dangerously dense. Furthering this discussion is a waste of my time. Good night.    You dismissed my example and then provided one that you're certain needs to die. You're saying an innocent dead man isn't relevant because *you know* this other one is guilty. My argument is that there's no way to know. As I pointed out before, everyone *knew* that Willingham was guilty.    So you're saying that it's okay if the Willinghams die as long as we get to kill the Roofs?   No, they pay [around 20%](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) give or take, and I just posted a pretty clear explanation as to how a family earning the median American income can end up paying more than that.    Hehe. Thesaurus. Good one.    You obviously don't understand how sales taxes work.  Lets take the Romneys. I just read that he paid 14.1% on his income of $13.7 million. That's $1,931,700 in taxes leaving them with $11,768,300. Now how much do you think the Romneys need to live? Let's be generous and say they **spend** $2,000,000. Sales taxes are usually between 8% and 12% so let's just go with an even ten percent. That would be around $200,000 putting their total tax at $2,131,700. Or 15.5% their annual income.   Let's do this with a median income family. The link I sent you puts their effective tax rate at 12.7% of $50,000 or $6,350 leaving them with $43,650. Now, a family of three or four will most likely spend every cent on living expenses just to survive. So assuming they spend all $43,650, $4,365 is going to go to sales taxes. Leaving them with $39,285 making their total tax rate around 21.5%.   See how it works when you present an actual argument instead of dismissing and insulting people with no supporting evidence?    Because you're a bootlicking apologist and your only concern is defending the police and obfuscating the topic at hand.    That's why I said this has nothing to do with the gold standard.    **The tactics of racial profiling,**  Not at all nice, but not equivalent to genocide.   We're not talking about genocide. That was clarified more than once. Try to focus, will ya.    **warrantless searches,**   Cops generally aren't allowed to do this.   It's called stop and frisk, and it happens in most major cities.    **civil forfeiture,**   What's wrong with civil courts?  You should read about the practice of [civil forfeiture. ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) It has little to do with civil courts or justice. It's state sponsored theft.    **military tactics**   What are "military tactics?" That term means nothing unless you define it.   Using military uniforms, weapons, and equipment on civilian populations. Storming private residences before dawn. Etc   **secret police**   I wouldn't call US police "secret" given their habit of dressing in clearly noticeable vehicles and running around in marked cars.   US drug task forces are most definitely secret police. They dress as civilians and drive unmarked vehicles. They're allowed to break all sorts of laws in their pursuit of suspects and convictions. For someone who really wats to argue about this topic you sure are ignorant.    **criminal informants,**   Who's going to know what criminals are up to? Think very carefully. I know it's hard, but I think you can answer this question.  Criminal informants are [people and often children] (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/03/the-throwaways) with substance abuse or other problems who are extorted into doing police work at their own peril and expense.    **black site interrogations**   American police don't do this.   [This is getting really old, man] (http://www.rawstory.com/2015/03/chicago-police-commander-who-ran-homan-square-black-site-quits-amid-new-lawsuit-threat/) You're aware that you can do your own research, right? Your ignorance is your own responsibility.    **warrantless surveillance**   So what?   Really? You're perfectly fine with this? Do you not understand how historically, this sort of thing does not end well.    **no-knock raids**   So what?   [This is on example of what these lead to.] (http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/) If the evidence being sought can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes then theres no excuse for using a swat team and violating the rights of a suspect. If they're looking for a person they can get a warrant and surveil the premises until they locate them, or you know, "do their fucking jobs".    **summary executions**   US police don't do this.   US police kill at least one person every eight hours. Plenty of them have been summary executions. [James Boyd] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U), [Tamir Rice] (https://youtu.be/mSCftESyKyU) are a couple of examples.    **character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens,**   Or either of these things for that matter.   During the Baltimore protests the police fabricated and disseminated falsehoods about Freddie Gray and other Baltimorians. Every time there is a police shooting the first thing the police do is release the victims criminal history regardless of how irrelevant or unsubstantiated it may be. In absence of any character damning information, they go after the victims friends, family, and associates.    **It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened.**   A lot of people in Germany didn't like Jews.   Oh that's true. But there's much more to it and there's is a lot to compare to the US. In case you haven't noticed, we have a few problems with racial tensions and race relations in this country. Most of the people who are targeted as an excuse for the increasing militarization of the police are racial and ethnic minorities. We also have a lot of economic problems that can be used to antagonize racial issues. If you can't see some similarities here, then you should find a different past time because you don't get history at all.    **Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history.**   Except they weren't. You don't need a complex bureaucracy like the Nazis had to commit genocide. As the Rwandans were nice enough to show us, all you really need are tools and men. Every nation on earth has that.   Rwandans aren't Germans. Germany needed the complex bureaucracy, hence it's construction and maintenance. You're working from the assumption that the nazis were able to seize power solely on a general hatred for Jewish people. That's simply not true. Of course it was a factor, but Germany had gone through decades of economic turmoil and were fertile ground for fascism to take hold. Hitler promised economic recovery which he delivered via unsustainable militarization. The German people were spiteful from losing WWI and felt that they were being treated unfairly by the rest of Europe. They used this as justification for their invasion of Poland. The Jewish people weren't their only scapegoats. The Reich demonized and euthanized the disabled, Roma people, communists, and literally anyone else they deemed undesirable. Yes the Jewish Holocaust was the very pinnacle of their evil, but it's shortsighted to ignore all of their other crimes.      Way to be objective pal. Go ahead and look up [effective tax rates.] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) You'll see that there isn't a big difference from the bottom rung and the top rung. Then you have to consider sales taxes. When a family only has an income of $50k (median American income), everything they earn is spent. When you account for sales taxes on lower income families you might as well just add that sales tax straight to their effective tax rate. When you do that you'll see that the poor often pay more than the rich.    You and I obviously aren't having the same conversation. Propaganda is only one of the number police tactics and  crimes that I mentioned.   The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups.  History isn't just about memorizing facts and figures. It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened. Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history. Ignoring those factors is to ignore the fundamental basis of their crimes.    One could argue that [righteousness is a theistic concept.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteousness)   [This guy was a case where every authority figure involved was absolutely sure of his guilt.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham) He's dead now, and things don't seem so clear cut.    Ahh.    I would hardly call that the black market, especially considering that you're allowed to buy a reasonable amount for personal use.    The same could be said about cannabis users today. A gargantuan black market that is present in literally every community, nation wide.    Actually that's untrue. The rich barely pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes and in many cases they pay less.    What?    I haven't been downvoting you, but I may now.   "You people"? That's always a big hit.   I'm not sure how an atheist can be "righteous".  Or that righteousness is even relevant.   We could look at being fiscally conservative and how the death penalty and its required appeal system is simply inefficient and expensive costing tens of millions of dollars per death row inmate.   We can look being effective and compare the murder rates of states that have capital punishment vs states that do not and conclude* that the threat of the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for capital crime. We can also acknowledge that life without parole is far worse than a death sentence as it offers no quick and easy conclusion for the condemned.   We can look at being just and acknowledge that as many as 4% of the inmates sitting on death row were wrongly convicted. What percentage or number of innocents killed in the name of political and judicial expediency would be acceptable to you? And if those people were your loved ones or even you yourself?   The only "rational" argument for the death penalty would be revenge, retribution, vengeance, wrath, whatever you wanna call it. But I wouldn't call it rational. It's emotional and zealous. It's about instant and total gratification not thoughtful deliberation. Not what we want or need out of criminal justice system.    Now? Did it ever stop being murder? Or maybe just in your mind?   Regardless of what you think, I'd prefer the state not murder people in my name or with my tax dollars.    No worries.    Well, yeah they disarmed the jews. No argument there. They also relieved those innocent people of their personal possessions, wealth and property, and ultimately their lives.   Not much gun control is occurring in the US. There is however a push toward the militarization of the police, a complete disregard for constitutional protections, and a general attitude that the police in general and individual officers can do no wrong.    Not because he was nervous, because he murdered a child.    Nope. Guns were banned in the 20's, but gun regulations were relaxed in 1928, five years before the rise of the Reich. [Then in 1938 gun regulations were relaxed even further.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany)    You forgot "stop needlessly violating rights and endangering lives".    Yes this, except for D.A.R.E. which is a complete waste of time and money, and as some studies have suggested, can actually increase the rate of teen drug abuse.    If the amount of evidence in question is so small that it can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes, then there's no rational argument for using a swat team to preserve the scene through brute force. Knock on the door and see what you get. There's no need to violate anyone's constitutional rights or endanger anyone's life.   By the way, a drug dealing operation is by definition "a business".  What makes you so sure that all employers would be so willing to show up to court like you say? What makes you so certain that they too wouldn't be eager to destroy incriminating evidence?   Why aren't the police even sending out letters to these employers? Obviously when someone works hard for hourly wages and tips and the theft of these funds constitutes a crime with an obvious victim. Why aren't the authorities zealously prosecuting these crimes?    Double comment.    And that's what this article was about. A different judge ruled that it's up to the DA to bring charges. So I'm here arguing that the system of justice should be allowed to continue through with charges. Really at this point it looks like simple biased obstruction to those of us who want to see these killers face trial.    No, that was a question? Don't have an answer?    Again, the numbers are so disproportionate that a division by 5 isn't going to do much. Like the article stated, US police have killed as many people in the last 24 days as the British have in the last 24 years.   If you took the number that the British have killed in the last 24 years and multiplied it by five, it would be 275 over 24 years. What does that change? American police have killed more than 600 this year alone. The total number dead in the 24 years in question would be closer to 20,000 as a conservative estimate. So then you're looking at 275 (corrected for population) vs 20,000. See what I'm saying. Population correction doesn't make things look much better. Or you can go the other route and divide the US down to 4,000 (conservative estimate /5 over 24 years) for 55 vs 4,000. Still looks really really bad.   Edit: US police kill people at a rate 72 times that of British police (corrected for population size) or 363 times without correction.    Maybe Hitler wasn't such a monster, he just lost who writes history, besides it was ww2.   Right, fact. /s Makes perfect sense.      I already read what you have to say. You think these officers were justified and shouldn't face charges.  Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.  Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.  This judge disagrees with you.    Why aren't the police performing raids on employers responsible for wage theft and other labor violations?    I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. First because these two spineless turds executed that boy, and now again because of apologists like you who would defend their crimes. Go to PnS. They'll let you sit in the middle of the circle jerk.    And that attitude is ridiculously stupid and shortsighted. It's important to recognize* all of the causes and conditions that created an environment in which they could commit such atrocities. And trust me, there are plenty of historians and otherwise who take into account the entirety of their crimes. If you want to be willfully ignorant, that's fine. Just don't expect others to accept that as a valid argument for anything.    Again, you should learn about this topic before rendering an opinion. The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups. Yes, the nazis committed genocide, but that wasn't the total extent of their crimes.   Edit: added two.    Right. It's naive to consider the whole picture rather than rushing to judgement as a result of bloodthirsty vengeance. If you had anything useful to add here you should have done that instead of posting a vague insult without any supporting information or theory.    Right. /s   None of what you just said makes any sense, let alone could any of it be considered a valid argument for or against anything. Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad.    You should read about the actions and systems of the Third Reich beginning with their rise to power in 1933. Of course the holocaust was the peak of their depravity, but their motives and tactics from the beginning weren't as far from those employed by US police forces as you might think.    Hold on, now. Being kind to animals doesn't necessarily make a person fair or humane. Hitler was a vegetarian and an animal advocate who enacted animal cruelty laws.   Yes, what he did here was absolutely commendable, but this guy could still be a total shithead.   Edit: added paragraph break.    I'm assuming that you meant to type "basic Christian doctrine"? And yes, it's fucked up reasoning that can be used to rationalize literally anything and everything.    Or the ever-applicable explanation that it was all "god's will". Which means that god does exist, but he's a heartless monster that cares no more for innocents than he cares for murderers.    Yuck! Same here. Those people are terrible. Though, it's scary to honestly think about how many people actually believe shit like that.    Is that usually a valid argument in the case of hit and run accidents? "Your honor, the other vehicle was completely destroyed. There was no reason to believe that the driver survived. My client saw no benefit in stopping to call emergency authorities." Or does this excuse only work for law enforcement?    You're missing the point. The purpose of a trial is to determine guilt. You cannot determine guilt without a trial. It's not up to the prosecutor to decide, it's up to the jury. You're using cyclic reasoning to argue against a trial. There is probable cause and compelling video evidence. Let a jury decide. If the killers were anyone other than law enforcement, this wouldn't even be a discussion.    Again, a judge has already established that they do. Why are you so hellbent on shielding these sacks from a fair trial? There's video evidence. A judge has ruled that there's probable cause for charges. Let a fucking jury decide.    I'm pretty sure that a decent prosecutor could make a damn good argument that this is a case of sexual assault.    You're actually defending this scumbag for fleeing the scene of a fatal accident, because his victim was already dead? Are there no limits to the depths that you police apologists will sink?    Trolls gotta troll.    Tell it to the jury. All you're doing is arguing for obstructing the judicial process.    This has nothing to do with the gold standard.    Facts aren't even a tool of the right. How could they possibly claim any sort of domain over them? The reason OP was showing you the door is that you obviously don't care about the facts.    I agree. I couldn't resist the chance to punch a hole in that argument, though. Thanks for the opportunity.    There is video evidence of these crimes. Let a fucking jury decide.    Per capita does little to affect the numbers on this topic. Undeniably, police in the US kill people at a much higher rate. Population size has nothing to do with it.    Thanks.    I imagine that some of the funding is coming from industry players who have a long term interest in seeing such programs installed elsewhere and expanded as much as possible.    This is terrifying. I live in a poor area of town and I've never been in trouble with the law. I've never been a violent person wnd I have an infant child. I know for a fact that the house I rent has been raided multiple times before I moved in here. I wonder if such a system would mark my residence as a "red threat" even though it's a rental property?    All that work, but no nothing to note an edit. Tsk, tsk.    This is the problem, a judge has already established that there is probable cause to bring charges and prosecute. This shouldn't be prosecuted or not at the discretion of a biased partisan. The prosecutor obviously has a conflict of interests that the police officers involved and their departments are closely associated with the office of the DA and their prosecutors. There needs to be an independent prosecutor that has no connections with the criminal justice system, who charges and tries cases of police misconduct. As long as normal prosecutors continue to fulfill this duty, we can never expect justice in these cases.    I do. Probable cause is what's necessary for charges and a trial. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is what's necessary for a conviction.   You've been arguing that there isn't a legal basis for charges in the first place. That's an outright lie. There's probable cause for all of those charges. One of the main reasons we can't expect a conviction, is because people like you would prefer there be no trial to begin with.    And there's no bias here. I haven't stated any preference to charges, just an opinion that there are no charges that I forsee sticking in this case.   That's funny because Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide, and dereliction of duty. But what would he know? He's only a judge. You're not biased at all are you?   	142
 They are an opinion site, not a news site.    Everyone says that, but they are usually people who disagree with its politics.    The characters are fictional anyway, why do they "have" to stick to that?    Downvote and move along, then. /r/politics mods hate Alternet.    So what, we went to Iraq and let their government live?    I was going to watch, but then I saw /u/dicklordmcfaggotson's comment, and everyone knows he's always right.

[You could not be more wrong.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html)   In Urban areas, racial diversity is normal, so it is a lot less common. That doesn't mean it never happens, but you'll have more people jumping to your defense.    The military doesn't realize that serving in a country's military is a big part of Sikh culture, and that the soldier will be extremely professional.    Even if he was a Muslim it wouldn't be okay.        Muslims are allowed to eat meat from Christians and Jews.

Rich teams that were relegated were buying the licenses of promoted teams so they could stay up.    Ok feud with CM Punk that had Punk creepily singing happy birthday to Rey's adorable daughter.    He should've gotten a retirement match or sendoff, though.    Where did Styles go?     Mysterio vs. Fenix and Mysterio vs. Drago    Mysterio vs. Johnny Mundo (Morrison)! A match we never got in WWE (at least not that I remember) that would be amazing.    You think Gaddis is better? Maybe defensively, but I don't think you remember the Williams from a couple of years ago.    Well, we'll see if RBNY can win any playoff competition anytime soon.    Wow, good that he's doing that again! When healthy, he really helps the offense and is one of the top RBs in the league.    What are those, comment flairs for ants? They should be like, five times bigger.    Who made the cross? Well aimed.    Except when the CCL rolls around (at least until an MLS team wins it).    For those of you who don't get it, he's talking about the Brooklyn Italians.   Not according to the UN and most of international community.    How much time do you have? Zack Ryder. Christian. Cesaro. Big E. Kofi Kingston. Titus O'Neill. Tyson Kidd. Sin Cara. Every diva who can wrestle and act convincingly.    Uh oh, that sounds like union talk! Better get the scabs!    Username is great here.       I agree completely. It's why I don't have an MLS team yet. I've never lived anywhere with one, and don't identify with the team closest to my hometown (in MD, close to Baltimore, but the closest MLS team is Philly).         There are like eight teams in London though! And Fulham has a reputation for signing Americans, and now has an American owner.   Grammar is usually worse when people type from their phones. I have to know correct grammar for my job. I don't correct people, but when you try to call people out for it (even if it is sarcastic), I HAD to do it.

Who is yersel and why should I be thinking for him?   Salaam my Arab brother! Christian? Atheist? Jewish?   "You Winchesters are idjits!"   Whoever was downvoting this earlier is stupid. That's how you respond to "takbir," for one, so it's not unexpected. Second, every Muslim says Allahu Akbar, not just extremists.    But then you'd be rooting for financial groups, mate.      OP is whining.    Yeah, I think he slipped in that joke.    It's been there for eight hours. It's also on /r/videos.   Hence why he said "worse-kept secret."

Why can't Muslims be rogue idiots with mental problems? Are they always part of a greater movement?    In America and England, those are areas of crime, not "Shariah zones" or some BS.    Biden's son Beau served overseas, even though he was Attorney General of Delaware at the time.    Neither was a hate crime? Yeah, ok. Who says atheists can't be right wing, anyway? We don't know (**EDIT: changed from now) about his political views.   And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations.   We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism. As Chris Christie put it, "I'm tired of dealing with the crazies."    American Muslims have a rational fear of right wing bigotry and terrorism, like what we just saw in Chapel Hill and Houston. A fear of Muslims and Islam is irrational.       You just made some Cosmos official's day.      Yes, I think that's how it works.      DC's is, or so I've heard.

He's with Uruguay now.    As long as it isn't pay to play. Kids with rich parents in the suburbs won't benefit from this as much as talented kids from the other side of the tracks who can't afford the expensive club teams.

You should use "In Latvia no potato, only pain."   He sounds like a keeper.   I don't know. Is Bork sensitive about his girl pop love?   Bork seems to be into a lot of girl pop for some reason.    BORK CAME IN LIKE WREAKING BALLLLLLLLL   In the preseason so far, Edu is playing D-Mid, with the Portuguese-Canadian guy on loan and Ethan White holding down the CB spots.    **Submission Statement**  The Detroit man who was fortunate enough to get donations after his story of walking 20 miles a day to work went viral now has a host of problems to deal with, as he appears to be wealthy in his impoverished neighborhood and now wears a metaphorical target on  his back.       I'm not even a fan of Indy Eleven and I want it.       Yeah, I read about it in that article by Brian Sciaretta the other week. Sure, the Armenian league isn't all that great, but if Ibarra can get called up, Romero should too. Mexico also has to be noticing his play at this point as media attention increases.    Cesar Romero is running away with the Armenian league golden boot. He needs to get called up too.    It was good news for Americans, who make up a majority of this subreddit. It also was the catalyst for the creation of MLS.    When the '94 World Cup was announced?    So, anybody want an older Rapids jersey. It's 2XL and has been sitting in my closet for a while. I bought it from Ross and it still has the tags. I've been too lazy to post to /r/kitswap (I'll do it eventually). Does anyone here want to save me the trouble?    He's a Twellman-Holden hybrid.    That's what supporters of Bashar say too.    You were hoping he had relations with a corpse?    Woo woo woo, you know it!      And that's why you're an NYC fan.    It's a play on grassroots. Grassroots means an effort that began organically, from the ground up. Astroturf is fake grass, so astroturfing is a fake version of grassroots.     I'm referring to the previous "reform" candidate Mohammed bin Hammam, who has since been banned from FIFA.       Government propaganda can be hazardous to one's mental health.    What about that Mecca-Madinah railway?    Only in that it is one year afterward...   Why are all the reform candidates members of Arab royal families?    Autocorrect has ruined me.   I always thought a good gimmick would for someone to buy into his philosophy, start Bo-lieving and then suddenly win their matches with Bo's help. Someone like Zack Ryder would be perfect. He could wear a white suit, have a combed haircut and start spouting off how terrible he was before he met Bo and started bolieving. They could do that victory lap holding each other's arms high.   **EDIT:** Suit not suite. He can't wear a nice hotel room. It's also spelled "bo-lieve."   thatsthejoke.jpg      It's sad that you only see those two options. Tunisia seems to be doing well.    [Reverse Racism lol](http://youtu.be/SoG4pNWUVZw)   OK, Jerry.

I have issues with leaders who aren't accountable.    You have Arab immigrants too, don't forget them!   In your case, probably Israels.    He's an unelected king with near-absolute control. I think that's why he's being denigrated.        On a related note, what happened to Conor Doyle? He got minutes a couple of seasons ago but rode the pine last year.    entire political party bigoted is very much a personal attack  I fail to see the logic in this.      He's a mod for /r/PalsbaraInAction, so JIDF probably isn't far off. **EDIT**:Just checked, he isn't and I got him confused with another user. Still posts too much though.    Then hummus is biddah, because the clearly the chickpeas are taken from the plant, mashed, and deliciously flavored...   /r/im14andthisisfunny      They certainly are, but I'm not less of an American for disagreeing with them.    How much of it is him and not being egged on by the producers?     If you don't like democracy, YOU can be the one to GTFO.   Thankfully, there's a first amendment that protects people regardless of their political opinions.    /u/sematrix is a bit prejudiced against Jews and Judaism. He posts ok stuff, but discredits those of us who criticize Israel because we are opposed to injustice, not because we don't like Jews or Judaism.    I like the post, but I don't like semantics or the poster...oh right, sematrix.    I think they're setting up a face Orton - heel Rollins matchup at Wrestlemania, hence the Orton bashing.    I'll give you Putin and their laws, but supporting Russia and Russian culture does not make someone a heel, it just makes them proud of their country. Making someone pledge allegiance to another country against their will is a heel move.             Are we sure if this is satire or not?   Oh, I wasn't referring to 2003. Back then, Syria was internally ok, relatively speaking.    You forgot Bahrain, which brutally crushed its own Arab Spring (all but dead unless you live in Tunisia) uprising.    Plenty of Syria refugees are in Jordan as well.    Replace the mentions of trolling in the article with harassment, and it's still a good article.    Yeah, I noticed that too, hence my comment.   /u/Ingens_Testibus's post or mine?    Something tells me there is hair on your neck and a fedora on your head.    Emegharad! DP!

It was temporary, and I'm back. Terrorism is wrong, everybody, even when it's to advance the game of soccer.    Still cringeworthy sometimes. "They wants me to be a good R-Truth!"   Should've given him Paul Heyman as a mouthpiece.   He forgot all of the Germericans.    The more money we come across the more problems we see...   YOU MUST BE NEW HERE.    Squeeze your nose for a few seconds and then let go. You'll instantly smell the inside of your nose. I'm serious, try it. Usually it's something you recently ate.    If terrorists attacked an MLS game it would instantly become the most popular sport in America.    Ok, I just had an evil thought and should probably take a break from Reddit for a while.    You sons of a silly person!   And what is your team, unflaired one?    He's a returning MLS player, though, so aside from the USMNT he still goes through allocation.    I guess everyone's ditching the existing USL Pro teams and making their own? Seems like the Kickers and others are chopped liver.    Turmeric, red pepper, and a beaten egg. It tastes very good.    He was there when he was called up, and in all honesty he's not likely to be sticking around.      Nobody with national team caps should sign with an NASL team, at least not for a while. Freddy is better than that.    You're getting Freddy Adu and you will like it!    As noted earlier, it would take a DP spot to do that.    Crazy, isn't it? I never believed the rumors, as I don't even think he looks that old.    I would think so. Although, so many teams would pass on him that it may render the process irrelevant.    Freddy Adu?    You can't forget tipping the fedora.    Also, look at working at the sports department of a mid-sized or small newspaper. Resume building can help out when another media outlet has a soccer reporter opening. Sure, you'll have to cover other stuff, but you'll get experience.    You do realize having him last until the final four IS booking him differently, right? Careers can be made out of nowhere with a good rumble showing.    I'm a journalist, but not a sports journalist. That being said, freelance and look for a job at the same time. If anything, you'll be building up credibility to help you find a soccer journalism job.   In the meantime, do a ton of online searching. MLSSoccer.com, journalismjobs.com and even just plain Google will work.       You're right and shouldn't be downvoted. There's never been a foreign face WWE champion and I think that's why.    Yeah, you're being the bigger man here.    He had better options in the fall, with Werder Bremen and apparently some  Eredivisie teams interested. Heck, if he stayed with Utrecht, he'd be playing with Rubin right now, which would be a sick combination.   	199
 I guess part of it has to do with not just speed, but cost.  As sequencing becomes both faster and cheaper, not only would a researcher or a doctor sequence the genomes of more patients (for example), they would also use sequencing to look at gene expression, sequence the genome of tumors over time to look at mutations causing new drug resistance, sequence various types of samples to look at microbial populations in the digestive tract or elsewhere.   In addition to what /u/skgoa said, both types of information transmittal that you described occur in the nervous system.  The action potential fired by a neuron is stereotyped, always the same, but some sensory neurons do represent the magnitude of a stimulus (such as pressure) by increasing their frequency of firing, as you describe in your question. If I'm remembering my basic neuroscience correctly, in many cases this happens on a log scale--e.g. a stimulus 10x stronger would induce 2x increase in firing rate.  In addition, dedicated neurons and neuronal circuits detect specific types of stimuli.  Light pressure would be detected by pressure sensory neurons in the skin; heavy pressure might also activate pain neurons, and the resulting subjective experience would be painful pressure.

I wonder what species they are comparing gray squirrels to?  Other squirrels, or other rodents?  It is neat that the squirrels change learning tactics quickly, but I wonder whether this is actually cognitive flexibility that contributes to their invasive success, or a trait that many rodents share.   Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA, Dr. Heng!  My understanding is that there are many different risk factors that predispose women to preterm labor and delivery, and you mention in your discussion that this heterogeneity may have contributed to small gene expression fold changes in your study.  Would it be feasible to identify several biomarkers that are more reliable for different sub-populations of patients?  In a clinical context where a rapid diagnosis is important, what kind of labwork (qPCR?) does one use to examine biomarker expression, and is there a practical limit to the number of genes that could be tested?  Thank you again!   When someone says "but I want X": " Want must be your master!" From The Enchanted Castle, by E. Nesbit.  A very bad habit, since no one recognizes it and therefore it probably sounds weird or rude.   Thanks for taking the time to answer!  Unfortunately, this is not quite what I was looking for.  I'm aware of the chemical complexity of odors, but for this activity I'd like to relate the subjective properties of  floral scents to the type of pollinator that each plant is adapted to attract (e.g. flowers that are pollinated by bees often have scents that a human would identify as moderate, floral and pleasant, while some fly-pollinated flowers have pungent, foul odors.)   I've read a little bit about an ecology of cognition theory that suggests species with bigger brains and/or greater plasticity of behavior (~intelligence) tend to be more successful when adapting to urban environments.  Does that fit with your knowledge of the species that dominate in more urbanized areas?  Have your cameras captured any interesting instances of learned behavior (eg, crows using traffic patterns at intersections to crack and retrieve nuts.)  Edit: is the fennec still at the zoo?  I saw it a few years ago and it was the highlight of my summer!   I am designing an outreach activity related to pollinators and pollination, and would like to include a comparison of the odors of different flowers.  For logistical reasons I'd like to include a sunflower description, but haven't really smelled sunflowers too often . . . or at all?  I realize scents are tricky to describe except by relating to other scents, but any input at all would be great.  Google isn't helpful, and I'm not confident that a sunflower perfume is an accurate representation.  I wonder if this is hard to answer because they have a mild scent and are often too tall to get "personal" with?   This is great research.  I know just a tiny bit about biomarker research in cancer.  Why the choice to look on the level of protein, rather than mRNA?  Are these results easier to transfer to a clinical setting?

 I have never seen that happen before. Ever.  That said, yes, I agree: unless the story has to do with digital stalking, then one should use a real name.   I'm sorry about your lost history. That really sucks.  At the bottom of posts, there's a set of links. If you click **save**, you'll, well, save a link to that story. It'll appear under the "Saved" tab on your user page. Maybe try that when you like a story? At least there's no risk of it being erased.   That's actually adorable. I mean it.    It's bound to happen.  And the people were **bound** when it was happening, too. ;D   I will neither confirm nor deny this statement...   I'm sure some stories are real---all the more reason to act like everything is real and offer your help.  (Unless they're asking for tips on where to hide the body...)   Alternate universes are actually OK now, as long as the story comes back into the 'real' world, so to speak.  Could also just be that the mods weren't made aware.  I also recently learned that stories with 5 or more reports *automatically* get removed, sans-mod intervention. That may or may not have happened to the story you're defending. I don't know: I'm not a mod. All I know is that these guys do great work, and the OOC needs more cheer in it.    Because we all love that author, great. Then another similar story but actually -- more realistic -- gets taken out.  It's not about whether the author is popular or not. I've had a couple stories removed by the mods, even though I've had plenty of popular ones. It's really not a question of favoritism: it's a question of man-(or lady)-power.  (There was a sticky about a month ago requesting applications to join the mod team, by the way.)  I understand that you're frustrated, but you're coming off as combative, whether or not that's your intention. People will be much more willing to discuss the issue if it's a chill and toned-down conversation.    The mods don't get paid for all the work they put into this sub. It's a labor of love, and no one loves NoSleep more than its mods.  Hating on the mods for enforcing the rules is like turning on a volunteer firefighter for taking care of your neighbor's home before yours because it's not as structurally-sound or something. They do what they can. There are thousands of stories posted every day. The mods have jobs and/or kids. Just because some stories get caught and others don't doesn't mean it's OK to disobey the rules. For every drunk driver pulled over by the police, hundreds go by unnoticed. Does that mean driving drunk is OK? Nope...but there are only so many police officers around to catch them.   Hello my fellow Canadork! :D   The trick is to use PEANUTS, not pistachios. :)   1.

If you don't like the comments, then don't read the comments.   It was supposed to be just an ordinary Tuesday, but then I realized yesterday was Fridaydun dun duuuuun.   Did you know that you go blind for an average of 40 minutes a day? Im not talking about when you close your eyes to sleep or when you blink. It happens for a millisecond whenever your eyeballs move: your brain stops registering visual data to prevent you from seeing the world as a blurry mess. It happens so quickly that its impossible for you to perceive the lapse, just like when you look at a frame-by-frame animation. Everything seems like one fluid image, but the truth is, youre seeing snapshots. They call it *saccadic masking*. Your eyes capture data, but your mind discards portions of it for a more stable viewing experience. The fact of the matter is that your brain lies to you on a regular basis, and only shows you what it wants you to see. If your brain can ignore what your eyes see, then you have to ask yourself what else it might be keeping from you. I found out the horrifying truth when I went in for my laser eye surgery.  Ive had to wear glasses since I was in grade school, back when calling someone four-eyes was the cool thing to do. I got teased a lot, especially after my lenses got so thick that my eyes seemed huge to anyone looking. Now, most kids could get away with only wearing their glasses when their parents were around. They'd remove them as soon as the authority figures were out of sight, so they wouldn't get teased. I couldn't, because I was drastically near-sighted, and *needed* my glasses to function. It wasnt until my later years in high school that I started wearing contact lenses. I was a little squeamish at first, because shoving ones finger in ones eye isnt exactly a pleasant experience. That said, it was better than constantly having to adjust and clean my glasses. I used to go through a bottle of spray per week. In the winter, it was practically impossible to walk around outside, what with the fog build-up. Contact lenses made everything better.  For a while, the lenses were enough, and I enjoyed the freedom they offered me. I cant tell you how depressed I was the day my optometrist told me that Id undoubtedly need to get glasses within the next two years to keep up with my degenerative myopia. They didnt make contact lenses strong enough for me. This was around the time that laser eye surgery was starting to take off, but it was so expensive that I didnt even consider getting it done. Before long, I was wearing a combination of glasses and contact lenses just so I could function.  Years passed, and laser eye surgery became more popular, effective, and less expensive. I graduated college, got a full-time job at the government, and eventually earned insurance coverage. My annual eye exam being weeks away, I decided to take a look at my insurance plan. I knew I was going to need a new pair of glasses, since things were getting blurry again, so I wanted to know how much Id have to spend out of pocket. Lo and behold, I spotted a clause stating 70% of laser eye surgery fees were covered. I was floored, and immediately set up an appointment at a local clinic. One thing led to another, and I got booked for surgery.  The set-up for the procedure itself terrified me beyond words. I was in a dark room, strapped down to a chair while an ominous machine hung over my head, quietly humming as though heralding my doom. My eyelids were forced open using medical tape, as though I were in a dystopian sci-fi mind-control chamber. Im not going to lie: a big part of me wanted to run away screamingbut then, Id have to pay the 50$ cancellation fee, and that just wasnt happening.  The eye surgeon squeezed a few numbing droplets into my eyes. The prickling sensation made me want to blink away the liquid, but the tape kept my eyelids in place despite my efforts. Whoever decided the procedure needed to be done while conscious must have had quite the sadistic streak. I felt my throat tightening as a scalpel approached my right eye. The surgeons hand had just the slightest tremor, and I could picture him turning my eye into a shish kabob. I wanted to run and scream and crawl back into my mothers womb. *No more glasses, no more glasses, no more glasses* I repeated to myself, hoping the mantra would give me enough courage to see things through. My instincts were telling me to close my eyes and look away, yet it was physically impossible to do so. I had to watch as the sharp knife carefully touched the surface of my eyeball. The surgeon sliced a flap of my cornea and delicately folded it over. As he did so, half of my field of vision went dark. The first eye was bad enough, but the procedure was all the more terrifying when the surgeon started on my left eye, because I knew what was coming. The pain wasnt nearly as bad as the anxiety building in me as the scalpel neared me once again. Another quick cut, and I was effectively blind.  At first, all I could see was darkness and morphing grey shapes like when you close your eyes. But then, a small red dot emerged in the distance. The surgeon said it was the laser, and told me to focus on it. I locked my warped gaze onto the light, but when something appeared in my peripheral vision, I found it hard to keep from straying. I shouldnt have been able to see anything but that red light, yet a shape swirled around just out of sight. When I mentioned it to the surgeon, he dismissed it as my brain playing tricks on me. While the laser did its thing, I continued to see an outline in the corner of the room. It couldnt have been the surgeon, since he was busy operating the laser. Once the procedure was done, I was told to keep my eyes closed for the rest of the day, and sent home to recover.  The next day, I woke up and saw the world in a completely new light. It was like upgrading from a black and white tv to a high-end HD flatscreen. For the first time in my life, I could see clearly with my own two eyes. I could see the tiny rocks on the ceiling, the grain on my wooden cabinet, the pores on my skin, the sagging old man hovering in the corner, the flowers in the hall, the- *HOLY SHIT!* There was an old man hovering in the corner of my room. He bobbed up and down, looking at me absent-mindedly and grinning in a creepily perverse manner. His flat yellow fork-like teeth protruded from his mouth as his three beady eyes looked me over, sparkling like demonic stars in the sky. I knew that Id seen him before. Part of me knew that Id been seeing him my entire life. My brain pretended he wasnt there, but my eyes saw him nonetheless.  As I backed out of the room, the monstrous man clapped his bony hands together in amusement, following me into the hall. The memory of a reoccurring childhood nightmare came flooding into my mind: I was in the woods, running away from the three-eyed man. Whenever he was about to catch me, Id always make it out of the forest just in time to escape, only to find the ground cave beneath me give, sending me falling down a ravine. Id wake up screaming for my parents, who comforted me and told me it was just a bad dream. Yet there I was, face to face with my own personal boogieman. Though in my memories, he was always frowning, the cruel smile plastered on his face made me realize that he knew I could see him now. He knew he could chase me, just like in my nightmares.  I ran. I ran out of my home and into the street, still in my pyjamas. The sunlight stung my sensitive eyes, but the pain was nothing compared to the fear I felt. I didnt even have time to take in the undoubtedly gorgeous view, because something else caught my eye.  They were everywhere. Boogiemen, monsters, ghostswhat ever you want to call them. Your brain wants to protect you from the truth, but the visual data is stored in your mind. The images come out when you sleep, because thats when your brain loses control and can no longer restrain the memories. Sometimes, when the conditions are *just* right, people can catch passing glimpses of them, like a glitch in a videogame. In reality, theyre always around. You cant run from them. Believe me, Ive tried. If you see them, act as though you cant. They enjoy the chase. Dont give them the satisfaction. Your rational brain will lie to you, but your instincts wont. Trust your gut: if you feel like youre being watched, its because you are.  It took the three-eyed man less than two days to catch me. In that time, I saw more nightmarish creatures than you could possibly imagine. I saw headless men, horrid hags, elongated people, and most frightening of all, creatures that looked identical to my loved ones. They stood motionless a few meters away from me, heads down as they continuously whispered my name. I saw the world for what it was, and it terrified me. In a way, what the three-eyed man did when he caught me was almost a relief. At least Ill never have to look at those horrific creatures again. And, hey, I'll never need glasses or contact lenses ever again.   Thank you for this, Gravy!   Please hold me? : (   This is freakier than Ocarina of Time's Forest Temple theme---and that's saying A LOT.   I'd say just jump right in. If it doesn't work out, try to figure out why so you can learn from your mistakes. If it works out, then rejoice!  I'd also recommend giving a listen to a few episodes of The NoSleep Podcast before you start. The soothing and creepy music/narration combo will put you in the mood.     It's better than anything I could ever do, that's for sure. If I were the narrator, you'd be hearing "Uuhhh"s "Ummmm"s, and a ton of stuttering all over the place. Guess I never got the public speaking gene.  Or the math gene.  *Sobs, quietly rocking in the corner.* A-at least I can write. W-who cares if I can't figure out tips without using a calculator.   I enjoyed it. Good voice, good volume, good pacing.  It does seem like the last couple of lines were glued too closely together and overlap, but that might be for effect.  Either way, keep with it. Narrations are wonderful, and there can never be too many of them out there!   And free wifi!   Let's make a list for authors who can't make it on the other lists.   Who else manages that page, by the way? It said to contact the poster to get in, but I PMed a few months ago and nothing. Should I just ask any 'ol mod?   I tolerate him despite his faults.   Rodriguez is just the BEST advertising guru ever!   If you're going to talk about yourself in the third person, do it with style.   I.e. "Please support the wonderful man-beast who authored this piece of work, for he is as magnificent as the final rays of sunlight on the last day of summer."  I look forward to reading it, good sir.  (P.S. Never listen to Manen's advice. Though he is a specimen of untold greatness and boundless wisdom, he is also somewhat detached from normality.)   Please, support the Author by leaving an honest review. Thanks!  So, you're posting this on behalf of the writer, or you're the writer and talking in the third person..? I'm not trying to be nit-picky, I'm just genuinely wondering. Either way, I have a 3-hour plane ride to take this week, so I'll download it and give it a read.   A long day of driving turned into an even longer night. This time, my parents weren't stopping for anything more than a few quick pit stops. They alternated between sleeping and driving, leaving us to entertain ourselves in the back seat. They barely even acknowledged us anymore. The night stretched out for what felt like an eternity. I was feeling homesick, which was an odd sensation for someone who had never really had a "home" to begin with.   It must have been around 5 in the morning when I woke up and peeked between the front seats. From the windshield, I could see the sunrise in the distance. Dad was snoring in the passenger seat and mom was driving. She looked exhausted, barely clinging to consciousness. Her head kept dipping and jerking back up every so often, causing the car to swerve lightly.   The sound of radio static filled the air, causing the hairs at the back of my neck to lift like a porcupine's spikes. I turned my gaze to the window on my right: it was like watching snow on the TV. My head quickly snapped to the left, only to find the same blurred image had replaced the world around me. I could see the outlines of Miguel's mask slowly meld together from the white and black pixels covering the window closest to me. The white pixels glued together to form his face, and the black pixels congregated into his uneven dark eyes. I swallowed hard as a sensation of fear turned my body into ice. No one could protect me now. Not my mom, not my dad, not my sister, and *probably* not Mr. Scuzzypants, my sister's stuffed animal.  Miguel's hand stretched out from the window and reached towards me.   I never downvote a story. If it breaks the rules, I'll report it. If it doesn't appeal to me, then I say nothing and move on.  I'll upvote a story only if I really enjoyed it. Good writing, interesting plot, no mention of pool floaties, and a general sense that the writer actually...y'know, cared.   That's called a interrogangbang. I'm coining it.   This is going to be awesome!   Ooooh. That looks lovely!   I don't get this. You're coming to NoSleep, a sub for stories (and, therefore, a sub for reading), but don't want to read longer stories? That's like going to a fast food place and then complaining about the lack of healthy food options.  Whether you read two 1 500-word stories or one 3 000-word story, you're going to be reading the same amount of words.  If it's because you have a short bus ride and don't want to stop mid-story, then maybe stick to /r/shortscarystories/ (275 words or less per story) while you're riding, and NoSleep once you get home and have more time?   I think that was a good call. Thank you and the other mods for reconsidering your stance on this.   I've had so many weird things happen to me, ranging from slightly bizarre to flat-out seeing a person in my house (who I thought was a burglar) when there was no one there. The *strangest* thing; however, happened one winter when I was in high school.   I'd gone skating with my friend that evening and we were walking back to my place. There was this little path behind an outdoor mall near my place that brought you into the residential area. You basically had the parking lot, a fence, and then the path with a few trees on the left and a forest on the right.   As we were walking, I commented on how unusually black the sky looked (because I use to say weird but accurate things like that all the time...I was a little weird back then). Suddenly, WHOOOOOOOOSH! The strongest freaking gust of wind out of NOWHERE. I mean, it wasn't even windy that night. It dislodged the biggest icicle I've ever seen in my life from one of the trees about 100 meters ahead of us. People get seriously injured by ice falling off the sides of buildings in my city, so believe me when I say that ice can be pretty freaking dangerous. That thing could have turned us into ice-kabobs.   The shard came flying straight towards my friend and I. She screamed and grabbed me tightly, hiding her face against my arm. My reaction was just to stare at it. It all happened so quickly, so it's not like it would have been possible to dodge the thing as it made a beeline towards us. Then, when it got within about 1 meter (roughly 3.5 feet) from us. I swear it DEFLECTED. It was like it hit something and turned suddenly 90 degrees to the right, jabbing into the snow next to us instead.   I spent the rest of the year thinking I had magic shield powers or something. Hahaha, I had a bit of an over-active imagination back then. Still, to this day, I have absolutely no idea how the ARROW OF DEATH changed course so drastically. My best guess is that an opposing gust of wind shot it away, but I don't remember feeling the wind change direction, and that's lucky as heck, considering the thing was just about ready to impale my sorry ass. Really, half a second later, and I was going to have a huge icicle through the chest.   Alternate dimensions are in? YESSSSSS!!! I had a story that was walking a very narrow line and wasn't sure it'd be acceptable. Maybe I can write it now.  Overall, I think these are some great changes. From a writer's point of view, the 1000 word minimum is fine. From a reader's point of view, I'm not crazy about it. I've read some wonderful fairly short stories on NoSleep that were too big for Super Short Scary Stories. Now, they're going to be lost to the world.  ...but we're getting alternate dimensions, so...HUZZAH!   'The' is the best team name EVER.   Team 1 - **Team Grumpy Murder Sharks**  Title - **For most of my childhood, my family was on the run, and I didn't even know it**  Between 1989 and 1998, my family moved over twenty times. About twice a year, wed get completely uprooted and have to start our lives over in a new city. My sister and I thought nothing of it, since we were army brats and relocating had become second nature to us. Every morning, our parents would change into their military uniforms, drop us off at school, and drive away in our rusty old clunker of a car. What my sister and I didn't know was that our parents had gotten discharged in 1991. We weren't moving because they were being reassigned: we were running.  It was summer of 1998, and wed been living in the same dingy apartment for seven months. My parents were getting a little stir-crazy waiting for their new assignments. This was the first time wed stayed in one place for so long, and I started believing wed finally found a permanent home. Maybe Id be able to make friends and actually keep them for once. Though the mood at home was tense, what with my parents constantly whispering between themselves, my social life was booming. I was being invited to birthday parties, went to sleepovers, and even signed up for an upcoming school trip. Things could not have been any better, until the night I went to the park alone.  That evening, my parents were entertaining an old woman with a floral shawl covering her head. They didn't even notice me sneaking out the door. I made my way down the apartment complex, crossed the street, and walked into the park. On an old chain swing stood a man who seemed normal from the neck-down: he wore a bright blue scarf, a black t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and running shoes. Things got a little weird from the neck-up: he had on a white mask that almost seemed to glow in the dimming twilight. His dirty blond hair fell over the solid curved edge lining his forehead. The mask was smooth and plain. The only details on it were the small holes where his nose should have been, a large black void for a right eye, and a smaller hole for a left eye.   Prepare to be Grumpy Murder Sharked!   TEAM 1 FOREVEEEEER!  According to my beautiful team name generator, we are henceforth known as: **Team Grumpy Murder Sharks**.   I think there's a difference between "Hun" and "Hon", and both are valid. Different regions spell and pronounce it differently.  When I see someone use "Hun" in a story, it's often because the characters are southern.   Wonderful idea. The manonator is all in!   I-I want to shove my face against his belly and hug him forever. ;_;   As a completely impartial third-party who has nothing to do with this ebook whatsoever and definitely isn't one of the writers featured in it, I must say, The Nightmare Collective cured my chronic case of 'sleep'. I used to waste a good 7 hours a night on 'sleep', and that was a damn shame. After reading this horror story compilation, 'sleep' isn't a problem any more.  If any of you are plagued with the same ailment, I would highly recommend picking this up. If not, then I would *still* recommend picking it up, because:  1. It's currently free.  2. It'll give you something to do while you're enjoying conciousness at its fullest.  3. I heard a rumor that the writers will perform a sexy belly dance routine for you personally if you show them proof that you own a copy.   *Edited for formatting.   Yup, that Kaylee was definitely housewife/mommy material. I can only imagine what she did to the girls she didn't like in school.   I woke up this morning to the sound of giggling coming from the living room.  "Crap." I grumbled.  "Mmm..?" groaned Clara.  "We forgot to set the alarm." I said, looking at the bag of Easter chocolates in the corner. We still needed to set up the egg hunt.  Clara rolled over and mumbled, "We'll tell the kids the Easter bunny got held up. Busy racing a turtle or something."  Someone had to do damage control, and I could tell Clara wasn't going to get out of bed any time soon. I tried going in for a kiss, but when I saw dried saliva crusted around Clara's mouth, I changed my mind. Besides, she was already snoring by the time my face reached hers. Sighing, I left my cozy blanket, and reached for yesterday's jeans, which were lying unceremoniously in a pile of dirty clothes next to my bed. As I stuck my legs clumsily through the openings, I noticed the clock: 3.16 a.m. My kids were NEVER up that early, even on Easter.  I turned to my wife. "Babe, you're the best," I said, in a mock-feminine voice, "thanks for taking care of it, you sexy thing."  Okay, I might have been a *little* irked at her.  As I was about to exit the room, I heard a sound outside my door. At first, I thought it was David's padded Cookie Monster slippers, but the taps were followed by a clicking sound not unlike that of a dogs nails hitting the linoleum floor. I hoped the kids hadn't let the neighbors flee-infested mutt inside again. I'd deduct half their Easter chocolate if that was the case. I knelt down, and peered under the door to try and confirm my suspicions without letting the dog in. Flees in the bedroom? No thanks. What I saw made me do a double-take, which resulted in my slapping my cheek against the floor. It was no dog, that's for sure. The animal had elongated black feet half covered in black patchy fur, half in blistering dark skin. On the edge of its bony toes were long claws clicking against the ground.  "What the fuck is that..?" I said.  My words carried through the paper-thin walls and startled the creature. It hopped out of sight, and I could hear it tap tap tapping all the way down the hall. Meanwhile, the turbo-engine snores continued behind me, unperturbed. I sat on my rump in stunned silence, wondering what kind of mangy animal had found its way into my home, and *how* it had managed to do so in the first place. Judging by the size of its feet, it couldn't have made it through the cats door, unless it was a raccoon: those jerks could get in anywhere. I was trying to come up with a plan of attack when I heard the kids giggling again. A pang of panic zapped through me like one of those prank handshake buzzers. The kids weren't safely tucked away in their beds: they were out there with god knows what filthy beast had snuck inside. I grabbed the bat my wife kept on her side of the bed, and dashed out of my room.  A warm and wet substance was waiting for me on the other side of the door, which I only noticed after stepping in it. Cringing, I looked down, hoping it wasn't another fur ball. The floor was covered in a thick brownish liquid, and my first thought was *blood*. I could see it leading all the way down the hallway. Either it belonged to the creature, or one of my kids was bleeding profusely. Both options terrified me, especially since wounded creatures tend to be more violent. I prayed David and Becky were all right. Side-stepping the streaky liquid, I ran towards the living room.  "Becky? David? Are you okay?" I shouted in an alarmed tone, as I rounded the corner.  It took me a few moments to take in the scene, and I did so in multiple stages. First, I ignored the creature entirely, scanning the kids for any injuries. Next, I tried to figure out if they were in any immediate danger. Say, about to get mauled by a rabid mountain lion or something. Finally, I searched for the animal I had spied from under my bedroom door. The kids seemed fine and happy, nothing was actively moving towards them, and the creature wasoh god. David was sitting on the horrid thing.  The monster loosely resembled a hare, but it was far from an adorable woodland creature. Since it was seated, it was hard to gauge its exact size, but if I were to put a number to it, I'd say it was about 4 and a half feet tall. It emitted a strange and powerful odor, like chocolate laced with vinegar. The scent was so strong it made my eyes water. Its body was grotesquely lean, like a starving animal in the middle of winter. Its fur was patchy, rigid, and looked to be covered in melted chocolate. The substance dripped off at the ends of its twisted whiskers, and seemed to perpetually ooze out of its mouth. Its two buck teeth were rotten and chipped. Its ears looked mangled and were gnarled off at the ends. Its eyes were the worst, though. You know those creepy sugar eyes on Easter chocolates animals? That's exactly what they looked like. Soulless, unblinking, cartoonish eyes.  David was sitting on this thing's lap. He had a big grin on his face, petting along its dishevelled, gooey fur. His fingers made the sound of a slug racing down a slip-and-slide.  "Look daddy! The Easter bunny's here!" said David.  Becky reached a hand to pet the thing's decrepit form, "He's so soft!" she chirped.  Something told me they weren't seeing the grotesque figure for what it truly was. I knew my kids: the sight of a cartoon monster could give them nightmares for weeks. There was no way they'd be so calm if they realized what they were playing with.  "Becky, Davidcome here" I told them as calmly as I could.  "But daddy, were playing with the Easter bunny!" answered my daughter.  I held my hands out to my children, trying my best not to let my growing panic show. I didn't know what the beast would do if it sensed danger, and I didn't want to freak my kids out. The rabbits head turned towards me, but it was impossible to tell what those unfocused eyes were looking at exactly. It wrapped its short arms around my boy in a tight hug. I knew what it was thinking: it had no intention of returning my boy. My fingers tightened around my bat.  "Becky Mathilda Carter, come here this instant." I ordered, my voice stern this time.  My daughter complied, but gave me a bit of a pout. I didn't care: I needed to get her to safety, even if that meant looking like the bad guy. The rabbit hissed in response.  "Go to your room. Don't open the door unless it's me or your mom, okay?" I said.  "But, dad" she protested.  "Becky. NOW." I barked.  Head held down, Becky dragged herself down the hall. I waited while my heart thrashed wildly in my chest, until I heard her bedroom door shut. For a split second, I felt relieved, but then the fear came flooding back when I returned my attention to the Easter bunny. He was still hissing, chocolate syrup slowly drizzling along the top of my son's head.  "David, sportcan you come here?" I asked, hoping he'd be able to squeeze out of the creatures bony arms.  I took a step towards them, and the creature reacted by growling loudly and gripping my son tighter. David started crying. I stopped in my tracks, unsure of what to do. It was a stand-off.  "D-daddy. You're scaring the Easter bunny. He won't give us any candy if you scare him!" pleaded my son, as he continued to be pelted with more and more chocolate.  "Thats not the Easter bunnycome here and we'll talk about it, okay?" I requested, spreading my arms out to my child, "Daddy will give you more candy than Halloween and Easter combined, okay?"  David smiled, and tried to get off the rabbit. The creature went absolutely wild, thrashing its head about in every direction while hissing and growling non-stop. Its thick brown saliva came flooding out of its mouth quicker than before, rapidly enveloping my son. I had to do something, but footsteps behind me caught my attention.  "Daddyis the Easter bunny sick?" asked my daughter, tears in her eyes.  I think she was seeing the same thing I was.  I didn't have time to scold Becky for coming back. In the moment it took for me to turn towards her, the creature managed to full encase my son in a thick veil of melted chocolate. I could hear him gurgling and gagging, as it quickly hardened around him.  "Let go of my kid, you son of a bitch!" I screamed, running towards the creature.  My whole being cried out for an unrestrained act of violence. No one messes with my kids and gets away with it, after all. I reared the baseball bat back, and ran forward to swing at the creature.  As I approached the monster, something strange happened to me. In an instant, all the anger seemed to evaporate from my soul. The sounds of my son gurgling, the creature hissing, and my daughter crying all disappeared. I could hear the chirps of Spring birds and what sounded like a pleasant stream in the distances. In front of me stood a large, soft white bunny with a basket full of eggs. I felt calm and at peace. If it wasn't for the fantastic force of physics known as inertia, I might have fallen victim to the illusion. As luck would have it; however, my action was already being executed, and my swing successfully followed-through, striking the creature square across the head. An unearthly crackle echoed in the living room. My stomach twisted with worry. Hopefully I hadn't hit my son by accident. The next thing I knew, the bunny and its devilish counterpart were gone. In its place was a tall, hollow, and headless chocolate bunny.  David was still encased in a cocoon of chocolate, but I quickly freed him while my daughter sobbed nearby. Thankfully, he was okay. I held him in my arms as though cradling a baby, feeling overwhelmingly grateful that both my children had survived.  Once we had all calmed down, I started cleaning up the mess. In the corner of my living room, I found a pile of crushed chocolate, which I knew was the rabbits head. The thing that really got to me were its eyes. You know how I said they were solid sugar? As much as they crept me out when they were attached to him, they managed to completely horrify me when I found them lying amidst the rubble. I wasn't looking at fake candy eyes anymore: I was looking at appalling, stomach-turning, biologically-accurate round eyeballs, just like the ones in a high school science class.  Now, I can't say for sure whether what I saw was the "real" Easter bunny, or some sort of demon masquerading as him. Either way, I don't think Ill ever eat Easter chocolate againnot now that I know what it's made of.   Well, you see...when a man and his sock *really* love each other...   3   *Hyurk hyurk.

If you have trouble with grammar and spelling, put your story in Word and use spell check. It won't catch everything, but it should get a few of the obvious mistakes, like using lowercase 'i' instead of 'I'. Just make sure you pay close attention, because sometimes spell check can do some weeeird stuff. I.e. changing occupying to copying. It did that to me last week.   YOU FOOLED ME!

Maybemaybe Suspense IS the Butler!?!   I know. : ( I miss him, too. Do you need a hug? Let's stand united in these difficult times. The Butler would have wanted us to be strong.   I, for one, recommend getting yourself a teddy bear by the name of Fuzzy Wuzzy, and holding onto him while you watch said movies.  Just make sure it's not a haunted teddy bear. Otherwise, that totally defeats the purpose.   First and foremost, I would like to formally apologize to the families of Rene Jackson, Brandon O'Neil, and Adrien Carter. I did not know them well, but they seemed like very smart young individuals with bright futures ahead of them. What happened was entirely my fault, and I would do anything for the opportunity to go back and make things right. The word "sorry" doesn't even begin to describe how I feel. The guilt is tearing me apart, but I will endure it for the short time I have left in this world. I hope you will find it in your hearts to forgive me, though I will not blame you if you spit on my grave for the rest of your days.  I work as a medical examiner in a county hospital, mostly handling autopsies of John and Jane Does that come in at night. Since I work the late shift, it's not uncommon for me to spend hours alone in the morgue. It can get a little lonely and boring at times. Fortunately, I work at a teaching hospital, where we regularly welcome bright-eyed residents ready to take the medical world by storm. They expect to be hazed by their attending doctors and nurses, but not by someone outside of their inner-circle, which is exactly why they get sent my way. The attendings watch and hide as I scare the unsuspecting doctors-to-be. We typically have a good laugh about it afterwards. No harm done. Last week; however, something went terribly wrong.  I was about to start an examination when Doctor Chang phoned to let me know three new residents were coming my way. He typically gave more notice, but I could manage something despite not having my usual prep time. Three eager residents showed up before I even hung up the phone. They told me Doctor Chang had sent them to retrieve a ring for a grieving widow: a classic excuse to justify a trip to the hospital morgue. I rested one hand against John Doe 901-8A's chest, and waved the trio over with the other. Using the gloved hand that had touched the corpse moments prior, I introduced myself and offered them a handshake. I could see them cringe, but they were too polite to refuse. I stalled Miss Jackson, Mr. O'Neil, and Mr. Carter with chit-chat while their attending doctors got into position. Once I could see the tops of their heads peeking from the hallway, I knew it was time to get the show on the road.  I promised I'd retrieve the missing ring as soon as I finished with John Doe 901-8A's autopsy. Waiting for the students to consider their options, I assembled my tools. I knew one of them was going to offer to help: young doctors are notorious for taking advantage of any opportunity to get their hands dirty and to show off. It was Miss Jackson who did as expected, and proposed they assist me. I played dumb, pretended that I was surprised and very relieved to get their help, and motioned towards the box of latex gloves on the counter. In order to keep the students from getting suspicious, I began with simple and normal requests: handing me my scalpel, removing the corpse's shoes and socks, and filling out part of a mandatory autopsy form. All the while, I performed a Y incision on the mans chest to get to his organs. The fun part happened once I felt the students were sufficiently comfortable with my authority. I was going to convince them theyd be hearing a dead mans final breath.  At first, everything went off as it normally would: I explained that I was going to remove oxygen from John Doe's lungs by pressing on them, and if they listened carefully, they could hear it as it made its way up his throat and out his mouth. I didn't put any pressure on them to do so, mind you. It had to be voluntary: I'm not a monster, after all. To my great delight, they all enthusiastically agreed to listen to the biological phenomenon. Now, normally I had enough time to set up an air nozzle near the corpses head, which I would use to send out a gust of air towards the intended victims. It usually startled the living daylights out of them. This time; however, I didn't have the luxury of properly setting up the prank, so I decided Id go with a cheap "BOO!" jump scare instead. The result would likely be the same.   "Come closer.", I requested, pointing to my patients face.  Once the students were in position, I asked Mr. O'Neil to open John Doe's mouth. He hesitantly placed his hands on the wrinkly old man's face, pulling his lower jaw down to reveal a nasty set of rotten black teeth. Mr. Carter gagged at the sight, but the other two kept their cool. I must say, I was impressed by how well they kept their composure throughout the examination. Stifling a laugh, I reached a hand inside the corpse's chest in preparation. The smell emanating from John Does mouth was far from pleasant, but it was nothing I wasn't used to. Now, we were all in place: the residents were crouched down with their faces inches from the mans, and mine was about a foot farther away.  "Okay, listen carefully.", I said calmly, squeezing the exposed lung.  A heavy puff of air unexpectedly escaped the man's blueish lips. It was foggy, like a winters breath. The four of us gasped in shock, inadvertently inhaling the fumes. I could feel the sickeningly moist and cold air fingering its way down my throat and into my lungs, leaving the taste of rotten eggs on my tongue. Wiping my mouth, I retracted and gagged in disgust. The attending doctors laughed and clapped behind the glass separator. They had no idea our little prank had gone awry. The freaked-out students looked nauseous, coughing repeatedly as they turned towards the hallway full of doctors. When they realized they'd been hazed, they calmed down. Not wanting to lose face in front of my colleagues, I regained my composure, forced a chuckle, and claimed Id used dry ice to manage the effect.   The doctors and students never suspected a thing, but I knew the truth: wed stolen a dead mans final breath. I nervously finished the autopsy, the disgusting taste lingering in my mouth. Aside from the puff of cold air that had escaped the man's lips, there was nothing out of the ordinary with my patient, yet there was something about him that put me on edge. Unfortunately, my childish actions had already sealed our fates, and things were about to take a drastic turn for the worst.  ***  My alarm went off, waking me for the first time in years and leaving me in a momentary daze. Usually, I was up a dozen minutes ahead of time. I sat in bed, running a hand over my sore neck. My throat ached, as though I was coming down with the flu, yet the rest of my body was perfectly fine. Although I had brushed my teeth thoroughly several times since the incident in the morgue, I could still make out the aftertaste of rot in the back of my mouth. The subtle flavor was enough to convince me to use the god-awful mouthwash I'd purchased a few months ago. The powerful, alcohol-imbued liquid stung my mouth, but succeeded in diminishing the unpleasant taste.  I drove to work, picking up a cup of coffee along the way. The unpleasant egg-like taste made drinking it almost unbearable, but I needed the caffeine to wake me up. As the rest of the world prepared for a pleasant evening at home, I had mountains of paperwork and several autopsies to look forward to. The beauty of working the night shift was that I rarely got interrupted when I needed to focus. When I arrived at the morgue, my fellow medical examiner gave me a helpful status update, and left me to my own devices. There was a body waiting for examination in cooling unit 5. According to my colleagues' notes, an invasive autopsy would not be necessary.  I opened the cooler, slid the body out, placed it on a gurney, and brought it under a bright neon light for proper examination. There was an annoying hissing noise in the room, so I turned on the radio, and took a seat on a rolling stool in front of my patient. When you see one corpse, you've seen them all. It's hard to be shocked by what lies inside the body bag. That said, when I saw her frozen and pale face, I felt a slight twinge in my chest. You never expect to see someone you know come across your table. Yet, there she was, the young lady I'd pranked the night before. Her skin had taken on a blue sheen. Bruising around her neck revealed that she'd suffocated. The markings were not indicative of human hands, so I checked her file for an explanation. Apparently, Miss Rene Jackson's scarf had gotten stuck in a rotating door. A group of good Samaritans tried to help, but as they pulled the door, the scarf tightened around her neck. By the time they got the poor woman free, she was gone.  It doesn't matter how long you work in the business, the loss of a life always leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. No, not like the taste of rotten eggs from a homeless man's final breath: a metaphorical bad taste. I certainly felt bad for the young lady, but at that moment, I had no idea her death was my fault. It just seemed like an unfortunate accident. When I slipped her back into her cooling unit for pick-up by the funeral home, I made a conscious effort to erase her from my thoughts, and moved to the next corpse on the list.  Later, as I was filing paperwork, the radio started playing god-awful pop music, so I turned it off to keep my ears from melting. My throat was still quite sore, and no amount of water could moisten the walls of my oesophagus. I was just about to leave and get something to eat when I heard the faint hissing coming from the cooling units. I hoped none of the compressors were going on the fritz again. Last time one of them burnt out, we were forced to pair up bodies in the remaining units. It made me uncomfortable to do so, since it could be seen as a lack of respect for the dead, but the alternative was to let them warm up and rot. If I were a family member, I would much prefer seeing my loved one well-preserved rather than decomposed, even if that meant they were spooning another body for a few hours. I made my way to the cooling units, focusing on the rhythmic sound. It was coming from unit 5. It sounded like a repeated cycle of compression and decompression. I opened the pod, touched a hand to the wall, and confirmed that it was still cold. As long as the refrigeration was still working, I saw no reason to make a fuss. I left a note for maintenance to check it out and took a much overdue lunch break.  The combination of a sore throat and the bad taste in my mouth made it hard for me to eat, so I threw out my lunch after a few bites, and spent the rest of my time off wandering the corridors. Once I returned to the office, I was pleasantly surprised that my note to maintenance was gone, and that the noise had stopped. Maintenance rarely acted so quickly, unless it was an emergency.  It wasn't long before my shift was over, and I was relieved of my duties. By then, the sun was rising and the sky was as pink as the small intestine of a freshly-cut corpse. On my way home, I stopped by the pharmacy to buy cough drops in the hopes that the vile-tasting things would ease my aching throat. I did not even hesitate to pop three in my mouth at once, swallowing the numbing mixture of medicine and saliva for some short-lived relief. When I arrived at my modest town house, I placed my phone on the kitchen counter, and took a seat in the living room to watch TV. My phone began buzzing, but nothing was getting me off that couch. The buzzing persisted for quite some time, but my ability to ignore it was boundless. Very few people knew my number, so it had to be work. There was no way in hell I was answering while off-duty. Before long, I was comfortably nestled under my blanket and ready to doze off.   When I awoke, I practically had to gasp to get air into my lungs. My airway felt tight and constricted. I immediately threw a handful of cough drops into my mouth to ease the pain and try to reduce inflammation. I rushed to the shower, enjoying the soothing steamy air for longer than normal, while I waited for the pain to subside. Choosing whether or not to call in sick was particularly difficult: my throat was the only thing causing me grief, and I was almost out of sick days, since Id used most nursing a chronic case of "the Mondays". Not wanting to waste a sick day on actually being ill, I ultimately decided to go to work. On my way out, I checked my messages, and saw that my coworker had discovered one of the cooling unit doors wide open. The units were old, so I wasn't particularly surprised to hear that a latch had malfunctioned.  When I arrived for the shift change, my colleague droned on and on about how the city funeral home had not yet picked up the day's shipment of bodies. I promised Id take care of things. After my coworker left, I took a look at the list of acquisitions. There was a new body waiting for me in cooling unit 8. As I pulled it out, I was confronted with the second fatality of my doing. It was Brandon ONeil, though I barely recognized him. For one familiar face to appear on my table was odd. For a second acquaintance to make it there? It was unheard of. A chill ran down my spine, and I couldnt help wondering what was going on. I had to get to the bottom of itand fast.  ***  Brandon ONeil, the med student I had met barely two days ago, lay swollen on the coroner table. His face was puffy and barely recognizable. In fact, I only knew who it was thanks to his medical chart. He was the second casualty in what ended up to be a tragedy entirely of my doing. I examined him thoroughly for any sign of foul-play, suspecting the third med student, Mr. Adrien Carter, was trying to get rid of the competition. There had to be a reason his fellow students had died barely a day apart.  Despite my best efforts to find clues, Mr. O'Neil's autopsy revealed nothing suspicious. The young man died of anaphylactic shock, an allergic reaction that caused his airway to constrict. I found several pieces of ground-up peanuts lodged in his swollen throat. According to his file, he'd been eating at a Thai restaurant and had failed to notice the nuts in his stir fry. Unfortunate? Yes. Preventable? Absolutely. Suspicious? Definitely not. I swallowed hard, the taste of sweaty socks and sulfur still at the forefront of my mouth.   Following procedure, I completed Mr. ONeils autopsy, placed the young man back in his cooling unit, and set up to write my report. A familiar sound caught my attention as I sat down to focus. The cooling units were hissing again. This time, I could hear not one, but two distinct sources. What were the odds that two compressors were malfunctioning at the same time? My investigation ended before it even began, when my office phone started ringing. Startled by the sound, I nearly fell off my chair. It was Ted from the funeral home, apologizing about failing to pick-up last night's shipment. The funeral home was backed up and wouldn't be able to come by for another 36 hours. It was certainly not ideal, but it happened from time to time, and I was confident we had enough functioning cooling units to make due.  I went back to work, trying my hardest to ignore the pain in my throat and the sound of the cooling units compressing and decompressing incessantly. Without realizing it, I found myself breathing along to the same tempo. As the sound began to slow, so too did the speed of my breathing. I'm not sure what would have happened, had Doctor Chang not appeared at that moment. I suspect that, had the sound stopped entirely, I might have forgotten to breathe. Thankfully, it didn't come to that, and Chang broke me out of my trance by storming into my office.  A smile on my face, I greeted doctor Chang courteously. He and I had a sort of childish camaraderie, wherein we frequently pulled pranks both together and against one another. His gloom-ridden features told me that his visit was not going to be a pleasant one. He was, as one would expect, quite distraught about the deaths of his two residents. In lieu of comforting him---something I was not particularly adept at, I answered his questions regarding his students, and shared my findings with him. Since the autopsies had revealed nothing suspicious, there wasnt much to tell. Doctor Chang, in turn, confided in me something quite disturbing: the third medical student, Mr. Carter, had not shown up for his shift. Intending to lighten the mood, I assured Doctor Chang that his student was not among the corpses in my morgue. Little did I know, he soon would be.  After Doctor Chang left, I went back to work, updating my dossiers. As I took a stroll towards the filing cabinet near the cooling units, I began hearing that noise again. I immediately called maintenance, claiming there was an emergency. They arrived promptly and performed a thorough inspection. When they approached me, waiting outside in the hallway, they warned me that cooling units 5 and 8 had been opened. They theorized that Id heard the sound of air escaping the capsules. I; however, was certain Id closed the doors properly this time. I began feeling quite nervous as the men left the room. Almost as soon as they were out of sight, the sounds started again. I ran to the cooling units, and pushed against their doors: they were sealed shut. The sounds, I realized, were like that of someone breathing. Were Rene and Brandons bodies somehow breathing inside of the vacuum-sealed chambers? The hairs on the back of my neck and arms rose, and I took a step back. From the corner of my eyes, I saw cooling unit 5s door slowly swing open.  "SON OF A BITCH!!!", I screamed, my voice strong despite the stinging pain in my throat.  Though I tried to convince myself it was all just my imagination, triggered by misplaced guilt from the deaths of people I knew, I am not afraid to admit that I ran out of the morgue with my tail between my legs. I did not speak to a soul, bolting straight for the washroom to splash cold water onto my face. Who on earth would be dumb enough to believe me anyway? Corpses dont breathe, and they certainly cant open doors. I took a deep breath, but as the air reached the back of my mouth, I felt a severely unpleasant sensation. Pulling my cheeks away, I looked into my mouth, and nearly screamed: my molars had turned black and rotten, my throat resembled a warning label on a pack of cigarettes, and my tongue was almost grey. The nauseating scent of decomposition trickled out of my mouth and into my nose, making my eyes water. Maybe what I heard from the bodies was my imagination, but the physical changes in me were quite real.  On my way back to the morgue, I picked up a few heavy-duty locks from the janitors closet. It was just for my own peace of mind. Using the locks, I secured the cooling units. If nothing else, the doors wouldnt accidentally open anymore.  Every single inhale and exhale brought with it a searing pain, as well as a strong sulfuric taste. I was getting really sick of the horrid flavor. In the cold and deserted morgue, I paced back and forth, trying to snuff out every horrible theory coming to the forefront of my mind. Was it cancer? Had I been poisoned? Was I going insane? I was so lost in my thoughts that I failed to notice the new corpse waiting for me on the operating table, until a movement caught my eye. I saw its chest rise. It was subtle, but I was sure of it. Was Doctor Chang playing a cruel joke? No, I hadnt told anyone about my fears: how could he have known? I approached the body hesitantly. As my heart throbbed desperately against the walls of my chest, I pulled back the white sheet that was draped over his body.  There, on my table, lay Adrien Carter, the last of the med students. My legs felt weak as I watched his corpse in disbelief. One death? Unfortunate. Two deaths? Suspicious. THREE deaths? There was no way to rationalize how three medical residents had perished, all within the span of a few days. My trembling fingers took hold of Mr. Carters chart, and my eyes darted through it, reading only the keywords: depression, stress, suicide, hanging. His family thought he'd done himself in because med school had proven to be too stressful. It wasn't unusual for residents to get a little depressed, and I could almost buy the story, if not for one crucial detail: the look on Adrien's face. His eyes and muscles were twisted in absolute terror. It wasn't the look of pain and regret you sometimes see when people hang themselves. It wasn't the peaceful acceptance of one's fate. No, it was a look of primal fear that I had never seen on anyone before. An emotion so raw that I could practically feel it by proxy. It sent chills down my spine, and I had to throw a sheet over his face to be able to continue my work, though I wish I hadn't.  The sheet moved. I screamed, but my throat was so tight that the sound could barely make it through.  Quickly, without even completing the autopsy, I rolled Adrien's body into one of the cooling units, and locked him in there. I could hear all three of them breathing from the other side. They were breathing a dead man's final breath. A breath we had stolen. It was all my fault. I had done this to them. I had killed each and every one of those young medical students, all for a cheap laugh. Their blood was on my hands. I had cursed them. I had cursed myself. They continued breathing, even as I ran out of the room. I could hear the echoes of their deep exhales as I frantically ran to my car and drove home, breaking the speed limit. What did it matter if I was arrested? I was going to die soon, anyways.  So here I am, writing this to you. Consider this a mea culpa, if you will. Though not directly by my hands, I caused the deaths of three young medical students, and have cursed myself to the same fate. I'm afraid I'm not long for this world: I can feel a lump in my throat now. My autopsy will probably reveal a tumor of some sort. I could keep quiet, I could preserve my legacybut for my own peace of mind, I couldnt leave without revealing the truth. I am sorry. To the loving families of Rene Jackson, Brandon O'Neil, and Adrien Carter: I am so terribly, terribly sorry.   Magnetic fields, man. They can really mess you up. I watched a documentary once where they put his helmet on a dude. It imitated magnetic fields. The guy started having that creepy crawly feeling you get when you're alone but feel someone there with you. Crazy stuff!   I had a ton of weird stuff happen to me in a house I used to live in. I once GENUINELY believed a burglar broke in, only to investigate and find the house empty. The place was creepy from the get-go, what with the previous tenants having left overnight without telling anyone, and the poems of suicide written in crayon in what ended up being my room. I mean, this sounds like some kind of horror movie BS, but I'm being dead serious. I'd see figures sometimes, too. And I don't mean small apparitions caught in the corner of my vision. I mean full-blown figures, while I was 100% concious, and that I could follow into other rooms before they disappeared.   It wasn't even that old of a house. Maybe 35-45 years old when we rented it.   My theory was either a brain tumor, or some kind of electromagnetic field seriously messing with my head, 'cause my parents and sister never saw anything. My friends; however, said they could 'feel' things---even before I ever mentioned weird stuff going down.   I'm in!  Someone stole my MS Office and they're going to pay. You have my Word.   Try to find a street artist and ask them to draw your caricature. That way, you'll know how other people see you. If it looks like youwell, it'll disprove my theory. No harm trying.   That's pretty chilling.  Perhaps when you passed, your soul got transferred to someone else? Someone who was brain dead? Maybe you see yourself in your reflection only because that's what you want to see, but you actually look like someone else.  	77

 [40.99](http://www.gamesquest.co.uk/new-releases/scoville-board-game)  This site usually gives reliable info: http://boardgameprices.co.uk/   **Terra Mystica**  Before TM I've played a few gateway games that I found slightly interesting - Catan, Carcassonne, Hanabi etc. But in those games you forget most of what you did the next day. TM is the first game where I find the whole game replaying in my head after I go home, regretting over bad decisions, feeling smug about good choices made, discussing strategies with friends, yearning to try new factions, and eventually became the game I purchased.   **Age of Empires III** - merchants, captains, soldiers, monks  **Manhattan Project** - workers, scientists, engineers  **Belfort** - Dwarves, Elves  **Lancaster** - workers with different skill levels, you are essentially bidding worker placement spots with workers  **The Ancient World** - workers with different skill levels. You can share a worker placement spot if you meet certain criteria (e.g. skill lvl workers already there)  **Viticulture** - each player has a special worker that can give you bonuses/use blocked spaces.   Nice! I was actually thinking of just buying cubes to replace the chips and be able to carry the game in a deck box..   Yes we did.  I was the first player to get 2 tuna boats while everyone else had one.  I also had other buildings that gave me income when 12-13 were rolled.    New to me -   **XCOM** Decent real-time coop. Probably becomes better when everyone is familiar with the cards and aliens and can make decisions much quicker.  **Captains of Industry** The highlight of the week. Really interactive economic game! Players produce and set prices of resources and the market interactions follow closely microeconomic theories. Will definitely play again.  **Belfort** - Decent blend of worker placement and area control. It could get more vicious than other typical euros.  **Legendary: Aliens deck building game** - another alien themed coop. I like the sense of escalation and you really do need to help each other out in this game.  **Machi Koro w/ The Harbour Expansion** - the expansion is new to me. I think it makes the game too long for what it is. The Tuna Boat strategy is very strong, and I got two turns where I scored $30+ coins. Not sure if I want to play again.  Games I've played before:  **Shadowrun: Crossfire**, **Stone Age**, **Trajan**, **Terra Mystica**   When learning new games with an indefinite end, I usually ask the person who's teaching "how many rounds does the game usually last?"  It helps for planning a strategy.  For games like Tzolkin, you just have to assume that other people will screw you over whenever they can, so always be prepared for a shortened round.   Awesome! It's interesting to see that it drops off slower than the overall 100.   Great chart!  Do you mind doing one for strategy games only? Thanks! http://boardgamegeek.com/strategygames/browse/boardgame?sort=rank rankobjecttype=family rankobjectid=5497   That was me on the what did you play this week thread.  More details around the game:  New map, scoring for borders.  Final results for bidding- Shapeshifters 17, Nomads 12, Acolytes 4, Aurens 0  End game score:  Shapershifters 128, Aurens 125, Nomads 119, Acolytes 110   Carcassonne: Each cycle begins with a drafting of tiles. With N players, each player draws N tiles from the bag, keep 1, pass the rest along, repeat until the final tile. You should now have N tiles in your hand, This allows for N rounds of actions with the normal rules (without drawing a tile at the end of round). Repeat cycles until all tiles run out.   The paper is thin, like a normal card, so it could get bent easily. I know the tableau doesn't play a significant part in the game (the cards do), but a similar thickness to that of the Imperial Settlers tableau would be much better.   [Link to expansion rules](http://zmangames.com/rulebooks/Terra_Mystica_Fire_ _Ice.pdf) Last page - new game options - factions for auction.  At the beginning of the game, draw 5 races out of the bag (the expansion comes with faction tokens). Start a round robin auction using victory points. Winner gets to choose which race he/she wants and also the starting position. Repeat until all races have been chosen. The person who chooses last will always pay 0.  This way, there is still an incentive for people to play weak races as you probably won't need to pay for using it. Obviously the bidding only works when all players are experienced and are able to estimate the point differences for each faction after initial setup.   Since the board for placing rooms to be built have all the details, don't bother taking out the rooms from the box until someone decide to build a room. Then the player will find the tile from the box, and put a token of some sort on the board for placing rooms to indicate it has been built.   Great week for me.  Games new to me:  **The Ancient World** x2: Lovely tableau building Euro about expanding your empire and fighting titans. Player interaction mainly through active blocking and card drafting. Only issue with it is the poorly manufactured tableau and I had no idea why they had to put dice rolling into it.  **Chicago Express** - Fast paced game about buying shares and running train companies. Loved the semi-cooperative element in it. Not sure about replayability as there is no variability in setup.  **Fauna** - great family game. Love it when everyone gets it wrong.  Games that I played before:  **Terra Mystica** w/Fire and Ice. Played the Shapeshifters by bidding it with 17 points at the beginning. Won by 3 points. The bidding mechanism does make the game a lot tighter.  **Panamax** x 2 - Still my top game of 2014. Looking forward to playing with an entire table of experienced players. Rules explanation is so tiring..  **Greed** - A filler that I don't mind playing.  **Orleans** - Tried the monk strategy and won. I should be able to get a few more plays out of this before it gets repetitive.  **Tzolkin** x 2 - Some day I will win at this.  **Shadowrun: Crossfire** x 4 - Bought my first ability. Hoping to play at least twice a week to save up karma for some better abilities!   Interesting perspective on interactions and replayability!   I just played Chicago Express today - it was roughly an hour though, are you referring to another game?   I have only been boardgaming for a year, and am curious about what long time gamers think about the boardgaming world over the past years/decades.  Has your favourite (or top-3) games changed many times?  Have you tried so many games that most new games feel "sort of like X, with the mechanic of Y and Z"?  What are the most noticeable changes in the boardgaming world? Do you like what you're seeing?    Thanks!  	17

You need a money backer to get supplies. 2) Find a good location to do business. 3) 50.

 REKT   How in the fuck do you get your GoPro back?   This ^^^^^^^^    I've found myself in awkward conversations before and wanted Reddit's advice on how to politely walk away without seeming abrubt or rude.   You've uncovered an ancient oreo!   Don't have enough upvotes to give!   You hit the nail on the head. It's the Seahawks fan who still have the price tags on their jerseys. There are a lot of them out there and they don't know how to be proper fans, so they resort to being internet trolls. Not a good look!   Welcome to the club my friend!  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ufakyzk.jpg)   He's blocked me on 3 different Twitter accounts. He is the ultimate hack. He flings mud against the wall and sees what will stick. If you question him or disagree with him on Twitter he will block you. You can't be a total fear mongerer and then be a big pansy when people call you out on your shit...   I came here to say just that, glad you have the top comment!    Love it, my Berner thinks he's a lapdog too and he's 105 pounds. Bernese mountain dogs are the best dogs on the planet!   Because living   Is OP Rob Gronkowski?   Foxy   RIP Oscar, Giants fans all over are sending positive thoughts to your family in this tough time.   Cute pup!   Awesome picture my friend!   Beautiful San Francisco?   Ya but as we saw last week, the Rams seem to run out of steam in the second half. I personally hope that this is the beginning of a long unraveling for the Seahawks.   My buddy ran into them at Best Buy tonight. They must have been going on quite the shopping spree!   There was a runner on first and the ball got by AJ. Since the runner would advance on the passed ball, he flopped on Ishikawi's backswing lightly grazing him so that the runner couldn't advance.

The Sticky Bandit strikes again!   My dog ate one of my fiance's socks and had to have 4 feet of his intestines removed. He has a bit of a sensitive stomach now, but he doesn't eat socks anymore.    I have a Bernese Mountain dog and he is the most gentle dog on the planet. He thinks he is a lap dog, despite being 105 pounds. Also, he is so sweet and gentle with children and other dogs. He is simply the best!   Epic photobomb!   What is your dog's name? My bernese loves to dig holes too. He gets so dirty though haha.   That's incredible! I would love for Cooper to live to 14. I walk him frequently and shower him with love. He is simply the best!   They have a high likelihood of cancer and joint problems. Mine is 5 and healthy as can be. I hope he lives forever, that would be ideal!   My berner loves to snuggle! He always cries until you give him some form of physical contact. Big old dogs that are extremely gentle and loving.   My cheeks sweat when I eat green apples. It's pretty weird and I've never heard of that happening to anyone else.   Berners are the cutest puppies. I have a 5 year old Berner and I always melt when I look back at pictures of him as a puppy.   "Omar don't scare."   Replying so I can listen to this later   Did nobody else get the reference?

 Hangover breakfast for me means the meal I can finally make myself make at 2pm or later. Or that random food I don't remember ordering. The chips from the tacos I apparently ordered and devoured last night count.   Peasant food is usually the best food.   In the TATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!!!!!!!!   Burninating the country side!      This is fascinating! I do something like the last one, but I just hold it between my first two fingers with the yarn behind it, but my tension has always been fine.  OP, I have been feeling the same, so maybe trying one of these other techniques could help. My yarn holding wrist is the one that hurts the most. All I can say from my experience is to take breaks often and make sure you sleep with your wrists straight. If you want, I can contact a former friend with horrible wrists due to 12 years of violin for anything else that may help. PM me.   From what I've seen/heard from the one family member who eventually succumbed to it, the worst part is knowing that you're slowly losing yourself.  He was my great uncle (I think that's what you call it, my grandma's brother) and I didn't spend much time with him. But I remember one really powerful event. The whole family went out to dinner, and five minutes after ordering, he turned to my 10-year-old self and told me he couldn't remember what he'd ordered. He almost started crying.  By the end, he was wishing for death because he had been gone for years. The whole family felt the same way.   Yup, that's what we called them. Egg in the hole or egg in the basket makes more sense, but what can you say?    I moved into my first apartment last August and will be living here till August 2016, and I generally agree with this list.  I only have a couple nonstick pans and a few pots. I've dropped hints that a nice, big cast iron Dutch oven is all I want for my birthday, and I'm getting myself a decent thermometer at the same time.  As a college kid, I will say my (totally unnecessary) panini press/griddle is amazing because I can make a quesadilla or grilled cheese without having to fumble around for a spatula; as a baker, last year's birthday present (a super legit KitchenAid stand mixer) is my favorite.  That being said, I'm lucky to have a 1-person apartment with 4 separate rooms. I'm scared for when I have to move and live in a tiny little box.   Without the monsters, that's what my family has always called them.   Haven't had a proper kouign amann since I went to Britanny. From what I remember, they are even more caramely and just melt in your mouth, no chewing required.  I've yet to find a recipe that truly lives up to the ones made by old ladies in the middle of nowhere who have been doing nothing else for 30 years. But these look good, and now I think I may have to redouble my efforts.   Catfish (and Tilapia and other bottom feeders) taste like what they eat. Personally, I find it tastes more like mud than anything else.  Tuna and swordfish, however, do taste "fishy" to me. A properly prepared ahi tuna steak is expensive because it tastes like heaven.   And was charismatic enough and a good enough orator that he convinced so many others that he was, too.   Some probability thing. I know I should have been able to figure it out by myself, but my brain isn't wired for finite. Calc, however, made sense when I took it.   I once tried to get help with a finite problem and got the answer "yellow is a color." I just don't speak the language, I think.   Natalie Portman and Tina Fey. But I identify as bi, so there's that.   It's important to find one that you like. It takes a while, and I'm personally trying to find just that, after mine had to leave, but a good therapist can mean the word.  The same goes for meds. Maybe you don't even need them, but when you find the right one, the right dosage, the right combination, you'll know, and it will help. I'm lucky in that the one I was given in the hospital after my suicide attempt only took a couple dosage changes to be perfect for me (and it isn't one that is commonly used, from what I've heard, and was only given to me to make me gain weight, which has become a problem now, almost 2 years later), but once I found the perfect dosage, it has been good. I won't deny that I still want to cut sometimes, but I've been able to bounce back from bad news faster than I would have.  I'm sorry if this post isn't helpful, but don't just write off therapy or meds because they haven't worked in the past. If you find one or both that works for you, it can be an enormous help.   He was also just an awful person to begin with, and only sold when I had a boyfriend. He still propositioned me.   Maaaaaaybe something like five pounds. I have standards.      The only guy I've ever used who eyeballed always packed fat for the girls and short for the dudes, but then expected the girls to sleep with him.  I only bought from him once. Sorry dude, not gonna sleep with you for an extra .2.   Fleece lined tights or leggings and wool leggings are my favorite thing. Last winter, when I had to go out with the -30F wind chill, and even other, less cold days, I was known to wear two pairs of each under my bigger velvet pants. They're warm, but still thin enough to layer like that, if need be.   Used Red Heart Super Saver in Frosty Green and Coffee. It is throw sized, and I would have made it bigger if I didn't have three other throws to make by Christmas.      A pillow to prop up my feet. It technically isn't quite don't yet, but considering my knees and back have been killing me lately and I've been propping my feet up on an empty two-liter to relieve the pain, I bet this will be the best thing ever.   I make one similar (I don't really have a pattern), but it's more like a cowl. Chain a fairly long starting chain, like collar bone to eyes, then dc in rows til it just fits around your neck. It's really nice when it gets cold, because you can double it, or pull it up so it covers your ears and face.  Simple, fast, but not too exciting. It does end up looking like a ribbed knit.   Scary! I've been on it for a little over a year, and probably have to stop because I can't stop gaining weight. Its so convenient, but health problems are no joke.   Dat geothermal energy.      I would watch the fuck out of Garak, Elim Garak. He's also one of my favorites, and leading up to him letting those Bajorans go.... mmmmm.    DS9 reminds me more of Babylon 5. Space Station, unexpected war, developed interpersonal relationships.   I can only ever drink iced coffee, even in January. I hate burning my tongue.  I only go to Starbucks a couple times a year, and usually drink my coffee black, so I felt my yearly PS Frap was just a cup full of sugar. And I know the frap adds extra sugar (I think), but it took me nearly three hors to finish.   Thanks! I was planning on stopping by the post office after class today, so I'll see if it will fit.   I mean, it was originally a heart medication. The side effects were just pleasant.   Dr. Pepper ham is my favorite.   I get that. I have 3.5 blankets to finish by Xmas, so I feel bad for every hour outside of class that I'm not working on them. At least my mom and dad have said they're ok with getting them a month or two after Xmas, but I also have 4 or 5 to get done by graduation in May, 3 for early my graduation in December, and I don't even want to know how many by next May. I guess I'm lucky that a lot of my friends are planning on taking a 5th year at college, like me, but still. Since I hope to spend several years in Africa after graduation, I need to finish all these blankets while I can still ship domestically. I'm already realizing the financial pain of shipping a blanket from Indiana to Washington State. I don't want to ship any others.   Wine is the best. And a good bottle of Gewurstraminer is never more than 2 minutes and $10 from me, except on Sundays, because Indiana is still in the dark ages.   Sometimes you want to go dancing (that's the only reason I ever go out), but making something with warm snuggles to keep you company is usually much nicer than dealing with loud music and too many people.   Oh no! I get that sometimes, so a break is good. Ice it if you need, and try to train yourself to sleep with them straight. It took me a couple months, but my wrists have felt so much better since I did. Really, my former friend who played the violin for 12 years taught me the best stretches.   AND she was a Mensa member. Bascially, she had pretty much everything going for her.   Oh I know. She's a personal hero for me. I wrote and essay on her way back in the 8th grade. Did you know she wasn't allowed in the Navy's medical team because she was too tall? She was a huge badass.  EDIT: at least I think it was the medical team. It was something to do with the Navy.   That's pretty much what a rolling pin is. I mean, I used an empty wine bottle for a long time.   Like others have said, bread, cakes, and pastries. I will say I am biased, because I consider myself more of a baker than a cook, but it's very impressive when you pull a batch of croissants from scratch out of the oven when hosting a dinner party.  On top of that, risotto is something that seems impressive but is actually really easy. It's also one of my favorite comfort foods, especially in the winter, since you need to be over the stove for a while.   I'm embarking on a Julie and Julia type thing after I get Mastering the Art of French Cooking for my birthday in a little over a month.  Julia Child was considered a master for a reason. While a lot of the recipes require a lot of work, she is incredibly detailed in her books, and mastering those techniques makes it SO much easier to whip up something with what you've got.   Baking is also important. And on that note, learning to make puff pastry from scratch is good. Not necessary, but I find it fun, and it's really impressive.   "I'LL FUCKIN BURST YE" will forever be one of my favorite insults.   Amazing. The BART goes pretty much everywhere, and the different bus services will take you anywhere else.  But this is from the perspective of someone who lives in an area with no trains, buses that are usually so late that they end up on time a couple times a day, and an incredibly walkable/bike accessible downtown.      Such troublemakers.   Looks just like mine and apparently acts the same, too, haha.   It's just how I've always done it. I actually only just recently learned there was any other way.   That makes sense. When I do go out, I spend most of the time at one that is low key mot of the time, although at night it's so full of rowdy college kids. There's a drink there that is officially called "Adios Mother Fucker," although I just call it "that scary blue thing I will never order." Give me a vodka cranberry if I'm feeling rowdier than usual, or just a nice cider, thank you very much.   I winged these, but I've got a basic pattern.  Ch4, sl st into first ch.  Hdc 8 into hole made by small loop, increase as normal for 2 rounds (2hdc in every st for first, 2 in every other for second) 2 rounds hdc in toe color, change color, 12 rounds hdc. Change color, ch 1, hdc in next 16 st, ch 1, repeat for 3 more rows. Sl st rectangle together, tie off. Make 1 round hdc in heel/toe color, Change color. 9 rounds to make the ankle part.  The key to socks is making them smaller than you think you need. That will keep them from being too bulky. All together, this project took me just under 8 hours. Used some Red Heart Super Saver and an F (3.75) hook, and made sure to work it a litoe tighter than normal.  EDIT:  this pattern is for me, and I wear a size 6.5 shoe. Basically, you continue the rounds until you hit your ankle, then make the heel rectangle until it takes a little stretching to make it cover the rest of the bottom of your foot. The, you can make the rest go as long as you want. The key is to keep trying the first one on at each step, to see how it fits, write down what you do, and do the exact same thing for he second, unless one foot is significantly larger than the other.      Since turning 21 (my 22nd is in a month or so), I've realized that bars are fun maybe once a month. I'll still have a bottle of wine, but $10 for a night is better than $20-$50.   I've been watching DS9, and decided to take a little break from making my sister's Christmas Afghan to make socks.   Definitely still drinking, but having a bottle of wine while watching what you want on Netflix is better than going to your usual bar and trying to dance to songs you don't recognize because you haven't listened to pop radio in 10 years. Sometimes you still want to go dancing, but perfecting socks is more exciting than spending more by than $20 and still feeling awkward after 3 gin and tonics.   I'm pretty evenly split between introvert and extrovert. I feel a lot better when I hang out with people, but I also have what I call "no pants days," which all of my friends understand. And sometimes you get super excited when you finally master an object.   Haha, I took a break from my huge Afghan to make socks because it's starting to get a little chilly here in southern Indiana. And I have Star Trek going at all times. DS9 right now, I think I'll be going back to Voyager (my favorite) once this one is done.   I wish I had the roomie I had sophomore year, when we both still lived in the dorms, because I love her and I got her crocheting quite a bit, but living alone has its benefits, as well.   I still like to go out, but to shows at friends'  houses. Bars are nice maybe once a month, but I always end up spending too much money when I go, money that I could spend on yarn.   You choose to stay in on a Friday night and perfect your sock pattern, rather than go out with your friends.  Any other experiences like this?  EDIT: this is speaking from the point of view as a college senior.   Climb the mountain of conflict. You'll sound like a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.   I had to restrain myself from going into a whole long thing citing Hobbes and Rousseau on human nature, but I'll summarize with this: humans are always fighting for resources, but form societies so they don't have to.  But I agree, it's safest to assume that everyone you meet is an asshole, and let them show you that they aren't.  Sorry, social contract theory is my shit, and I dork out to it even more when tipsy. Gin makes me a nerd.   I don't even want to know how many I'd have if my landlord hadn't capped it at two.   I had nightmares about my babies getting hurt, or running away, or any other bad thing when I spent 5 whole days on the other side of the country back in May, even though they were staying with family. I felt a little ridiculous, but I made a two page list of things for them, from "Bill gets 1 cup of food every day while Kate gets 3/4 cup," to "Bill likes to be called the big mister and Kate likes to be called baby."   Like I said above, nutmeg is the make or break for brioche for me. A tiny bit in a curry dish is also good, it just deepens the flavor in a strange way.   Same with nutmeg. I put a "pinch" in my brioche and couldn't imagine it any other way.   Going off the south side comment, 2nd street turns into a highway around the WalMart, and I believe that highway goes to Crane (but don't quote me on that). Once you get past the Kroghetto/hospital area, it's very residential, with fewer students, so if you'd prefer to be away from the craziness, but still close to the bars, I'd suggest looking there. Serendipity, The Root Cellar, The Back Door, and Player's Pub are all 10 or so minutes walking from the hospital, and Brother's, The Vid, and The Bluebird are also fairly close. Sport's is around there, too, but idk if that would be a good fit (I've never been, simply because I've only ever head it touted as "a great place to bang drunk chicks in the bathroom").   Chrome gave me something called snap.do. And something else makes it keep coming back, so I have to remove it at least once a month.  As for other things, I'm not the best with computers, so I just bring my laptop to my dad every time something weird happens.   Know someone who broke her thumb hitting the wall after a 50 freestyle race. And I've sprained an ankle doing a flip turn too quick.   I used to be ridiculously allergic (to the point where I'd get hives anywhere a cat would lick me), but I spent a year spending almost every day with a friend who had one, and now I only get a reaction if I get cat hair directly on my eyes. I live with two, but I know a lot of allergies won't go away so easily (ask me about metal, spermicide, or aerosol products).   I made a New Year's resolution to make blankets for my family for Xmas and friends for graduation. The graduation present imq shipping soon won't be washed, because the recipient is planning on getting a cat anyway, but my dad and sister are super allergic, so I'll be washing theirs a few times before the gifting.    It's just extra sad because the recipient is really allergic.   Haha, I'm just trying to finish a bunch of afghans for my family for Xmas, but he keep deciding to lie on top of my work, or his sister decides to chew through my yarn. The things you deal with as a cat owner.   If you can make it, PM me and maybe we can meet up. I'm going with my best friend, and at least I plan to  e in line by 5, haha.   My nails are getting the TARDIS blue treatment. It's free tomorrow night, and the tickets are first come first serve, starting when the doors open at 6. There's a showing of The Intruders at 7, DW live pre-show at 8, and the new season at 8:15.   Bloomington. I say small because it's pretty small when you factor out the 40k students. If you're near, go line up at the BusChum before 6pm.      I'm so lucky, there's a special screening in my town tomorrow! Why they chose small college town, Indiana, I will never know, but I'm soooooooo pumped. Edit: and by them, I mean BBC America decided to post about it on Facebook.   Like I said, I feel terrible for the kid (whose name is Jager, by the way), but have very little sympathy go the mother. Maybe mow heartless, but I honestly hope the whole thing straightened her up.   Cute things make English too difficult. Kitten don't "explore," they "splore." They don't get "excited," they get "escited."   Yep, mine and the food is in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. Otherwise my ginger boy would chew through the bag and eat everything.   I had a Facebook friend who didn't stop drinking when she was pregnant. She ended up giving birth to twin boys three months early, one of them died almost immediately, and then she posted multiple times a day with a gofundme page asking for help keeping the other one alive.  I ended up defriending her because I believe you have to lie in the bed you made, but I feel so bad for the kid. I actually don't know if he made it, but I hope he did and that his mother learned from the tragedy.   Does this mean I'm doing myself harm if I heat up my nonstick pan while I'm slicing bacon and then putting it on? I never add extra oil when I cook bacon, but I turn on the stove, put bread in the toaster, and cut the bacon into halves or thirds before I use the pan. It probably doesn't take more than two minutes to do all that, but now I'm worried.   This sounds amazing, especially because I have a serious aversion to mayo. Will be trying this out soon.   Let's hope we all get boyfriends like that. The guy I'm seeing is just amazed when he comes over and sees something ivew made.   This is a big reason why I always ball my yarn. It adds some work at the beginning, but I don't have to deal with tangles and yarn vomit halfway through an afghan.   Thank you! I think that's only a little more than a hour from me!   Oh goodness me, I'm not even sure. Probably 9 or 10. I'm turning 22 in October, and it has been my go-to destressing activity for forever. I know I learned to knit when I was 8 and basic embroidery stitches before I can remember (great part about having a mother with a degree in fashion design and construction), but crochet has always been my favorite.   If you're more comfortable with PMing me the reply, I understand, but where in Indiana is she based? I'd love to get some local(ish) yarn, and I've been thinking about dying my own, too. I'm in Bloomington.   I usually put liner only in the outer third or so of my lower waterline. I feel that it opens up my eyes, and I just don't feel finished without a little something there. A nice dark brown (not black!) Works really well.   Yay, another reason Indiana sucks really hard!   Cheap canadian whiskey + canada dry is a favorite of mine. Super canadian drink, we call it.   I can't do flavored vodka after downing a fifth worth of caramel appletinis. And a really bad time I had once with schnapps.   You wouldn't return your child because you didn't feel like taking care of it. An animal is just the same.   My little lady came to me as a foster. She was a barn cat, and was 12-weeks old when she first came into my life. I'm so happy I decided to adopt her, because my former roomie (who initially brought into the apartment) didn't ever take her to the vet, fed her straight tuna from a can, and hardly spent any time with her. A month or two after she came to live with me, I decided to adopt her, took her to the vet, and found out she had had worms the entire time. Luckily she has been healthy ever since (it's been about a year), and loves the ginger friend I got for her.   My parents' cat love to take lap rides on my grandmother's wheelchair. Now that she's back up to a walker, he just tries to trip her with head buts.   You've done it. After being abused, falling for the wrong guy, and never thinking I could love again, you've turned me around. I'm not in love with you yet, but you make me feel like I could be. And more importantly, I feel like maybe you could actually love me back, which is such a strange feeling for me. You understood when I needed a couple days to cry after finding out I'd been stabbed in the back by someone who used to be like a sister to me, and you're okay with the fact that sometimes I just need to talk about the abuse that guy put me through.  Thank you. I more than really really like you. And I needed someone to provide to me that I could feel this way again.   I like to put a little on one side of any simple deli style sandwich. I really like it on roast beef and swiss.   Occasionally, but that method has worked pretty well for me. Only time it hasn't is with this one rimmel lipstick whose color can only be described as "baby prostitute."   And now I need to watch it for the fourth time this week. That's ok, cuz it will give me time for my base color to dry before embarking on a striping tape adventure.    My target never has testers, but it's easy to hold the lipstick closeish to your face and teeth and look in one of the mirrors. I'll do a sigle swatch of a textured polish in store, but that's it.   I hated Chicago style for so long, because they didn't even tell us that there were citation styles outside of MLA in high school. Now I prefer it, and nothing pisses me off more than when a professor doesn't specify a style, but marks you down for not using MLA.   Seconding baba ganouj! I usually hate things that are blended like that, and used to hate eggplant, but that turned me around.   Bathroom is les toilettes, plural masculine, I believe. The throne itself is masculine, but the phrase "faire la toilette" means to get ready (brush you teeth, shower, makeup, whatever), and that is feminine.   Besides Fleur, who also married in, sadly, no, unless you wanna get into the epilogue. Luckily my ginger is a boy, so there were many more names to choose from. Ended up with Bill.   I didn't even consider getting serious with the guy I've been seeing until he got approval from the cats.   I'm of the opinion that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, but I'm a nerd like that.  	109

                                                                                  Vote for you whom you want to win the primary. It's not really important that the winner of the primary win by one extra vote, but it is important that we select the best candidate.  That's my opinion, anyway.   Keep your eye on Maine. They're voting to institute it statewide next year. It's also already in place in more than a few places around the country, and in those places negative campaigning has fallen dramatically.  I think we'll get it, eventually, especially as more people become aware of it.                                                            Better unbelievably late than never.  Kinda.                                                      It's like, pick an unkillable hero that deals almost no damage already, guy!                                                Updated my previous comment after calling to verify my own registration status.                           It's the number of people who have donated to his campaign so far. He's gotten 400,000 donations from 250,000 different people, with an average of about $33 per donation (totally to $15 million).  To put that into perspective, Hillary has gotten donations from about 50,000 people so far (for this cycle), and at the same time in the 2008 cycle, Obama (who as we all know defeated Hillary) had donations from about 180,000 people.  TL;DR - Bernie has about 5 times more support from the 99% than Hillary, and he's even significantly outperforming Obama's 2008 campaign (with every day people). Hillary has the billionaires locked up, but Bernie's campaign runs on more than money.   I think most states require you to be registered with a party to vote in that party's primary. So as a registered republican, you could vote for Bernie in the general election if he gets the democratic nomination, but unless your state has open primaries, you couldn't vote for him in the democratic primary. You'd need to register as a democrat, first.  UPDATE: I just called my county board of elections, and for my state at least, it sounds like you declare your party affiliation by voting in that party's primary (which is what I think you were suggesting). So you just show up and ask for a party's ticket, and then you become registered with that party by voting in their primary. I'd still verify for your county/state. Sorry for any confusion.   Glad to hear it! He really does seem to be uniting people, all across the political spectrum.  If you don't mind me asking, are you planning on registering as a democrat to vote for him in the primary?   Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, but he isn't campaigning in Florida yet. He wasn't at that event. That was just 80 people getting together to talk Bernie and what they could do to help his campaign.    Probably because you're confusing a local, volunteer organized gathering with an official campaign event.      How about the endorsement of 250,000 Americans? Is that important enough for you?                                                                                                               It shows growing support for an underdog candidate that people used to think had no chance of winning.   Could you elaborate on this?                                             It's referring to Iowa:  it was the largest for any single candidate in the 2016 presidential election cycle **here** so far.                                                                                                                  /r/gogopgo                                   	200

 The company I work for uses Windows  98.   Yeah. A lot of my friends are in college too, and they are always complaining. It's like a slap in the face to me when they complain knowing they're living my dream.   Reading this has caused great anger throughout myself. I absolutely hate this sort of thing. If I paid for a service of faster delivery then damn it if this shit happens! Fuck you! It's basically, don't charge me for fresh ice cold Coca-Cola and give it to me warn and flat. You paid for hasty delivery, he could have at least pretended to give a damn.   I hate people that live in this apartment community. These people park behind vehicles blocking them in just to talk to some other asshole. If you aren't going anywhere, fucking park in one of the many empty spots.I'm either trying to leave or park near my building. FUCKING MOVE! Last night I attempted to leave and noticed someone not only parked their piece of shit car behind my car, they also cut it OFF and went inside their apartment! WTF is this BULLSHIT?! Some other jackass was parked across from that car facing it, basically doing the same thing. Blocking another car in. The difference was the second jackass was still in his vehicle. Parking lots are NOT social places! Fucking park in a designated spot!   It's impossible for me to agree with you more.   I have read enough crap on Reddit in general about people bitching about college. I'm tired of it. I wish I could go to college. Due to my financial situation, I can't afford college and federal aid won't pay for it because the formula doesn't take certain things into consideration. I have rent, a cell phone, a car note, utilities, car insurance, gas, and groceries.   For those who might make the "cell phones are luxury" argument read ahead. Ten years ago, I would agree they were indeed a luxury. With the cost of cell service being lower than home phone service it's smarter to have cell service. Also, if I'm out and about and a potential employer calls, 9 times out of ten they skip on to the next applicant. I have to be easily reachable.  Before anyone mentions public transportation as a cheaper alternative to owning a vehicle. The area I live doesn't have public transportation. There aren't any city busses. No taxi service. Nothing. Also, the police are hardasses when it comes to walking anywhere without a sidewalk. There are very few sidewalks. Bike lanes don't exist here. Basically, the only option is to drive or never leave home unless you have a friend that'll taxi for you. All my friends live two+ hours away.  Back to the original rant.  People bitch and whine about going to college. These people don't realise the opportunity they have. These people don't realize how many people can't be in college that want to.  I'd love to go to college. I don't give a damn about mid terms and exams. I was born into a poor family which meant working hard to get a job that barely gets me by. I have to break my back to half way make ends meet. I'd love to have the opportunity to have a career in a field of my choosing and make more money working. Stop fucking whining about such a great opportunity. Fuck you and your ungrateful ass. Fuck F.A.F.S.A. for being so restricted and telling me that my family should help out financially. I'm fucking applying because my family CAN'T afford to help out. Why the fuck would I apply for F.A.F.S.A. if I could afford college? I hate that college is so damn expensive but is needed to get a decent paying wage.  That's all I have to say about that.   People.   I used to ride my bike all the time. I would ride down hill and stop my bike by placing the soles of my shoes flat on the spokes of front tire. Well one time, I did that and flipped forward over my bike. As a natural reaction, I extended my arms forward directly in front of my face. Both shoulders were sprained. That not only hurt but it was also pathetic and embarrassing trying to explain that to the doctor. Edit: words.   I play a drinking game called "Last". Anyone playing must be standing. Everyone gets two shot glasses of liquor (preferably the same stuff for everyone). Everyone shoots the liquor at the same time and refills. Then repeat. Keep repeating until someone falls or quits. Then all the remaining participants add a third shot and continue repeating. For every quitter, add an extra shot per remaining person. The last player left only wins if he/she can drink the final round. I win every time.  For example: if the game starts with 6 people and each has 2 shots. One player quits = 3 shots(per player)/5 players. Another loser  = 4 shots (per player)/4 players. Next 5 shots per player with 3 players. Then 6 shots each for 2 players. When one of the two quits, the other is the potential winner. So the potential winner has to then consume 7 shots to be declared the winner.  This game gets its name for two reasons.  1. When people drink with me, it's the last game they wanna play. 2. You must drink the last round to be the winner.  Tl;dr: This game is for high tolerance drinkers.   A scientist uses a chemical he created along with subliminal messages to program citizens of a small town for mind control.   The first time I caught my parents doing the deed, I didn't realize that's what I caught them doing. I actually thought they were moving furniture. They were in the family computer room with the door shut and I heard them grunting and making noises. I knew nothing of sex and actually believed they were moving furniture. A couple years passed and I realised what had occurred.   I had the same issue... I was like "What's Final Fantasy have anyth... oh wait nevermind."   My problem is I'm a guy. Though I do cook quite well. I don't as much confuse myself with her as I confuse my right hand for Monica...   This reminds me of the time I went into a beginner's class for cooking. I went with a friend and he was actually a beginner. I am a professional chef with my own restaurant. Well, at first I impressed the teacher until my friend caught on and was doing better than me. It infuriated me. I wanted validation from the random stranger/teacher. My stupid friend got all the attention. My restaurant had gotten a bad review in the local newspaper. I brought this up and the teacher mentioned she loves my restaurant so I finally got my validation.  Edit: I just remembered that wasn't me, it was Monica on an episode of Friends.   I met my wife through her advertisement on craigslist.   If I have something to wake up for then I just don't go back to sleep. It's called being responsible for your obligations. Grow up and learn that life isn't meant to be wasted on sleep. Unless you're younger than 5 years old, you should have enough sense to know you can't just ignore life and go back to sleep. If you can't handle whatever it is you're waking up for, then you don't need/want it bad enough. I work 60+ hours a week and go to school 10 hours a week. I have a house to maintain and food that doesn't cook itself. I get about 4-5 hours of sleep per night sometimes less. I know to have a house to maintain and food to cook, I have to work as much as I do. If I want these things without having to work as much, I have to complete my education to have the higher paying position. If I'm late for work or school, I risk those things. I wake up and stay awake. I'm aware this won't be a popular post and not just for grammatical reasons. I'm simply expressing my thoughts as a response to the original question.  TL;DR: ranting about sleep.   This almost sounds like something I'd heard. Take a small towel and roll it up really tight with a condom inside but make sure the condom doesn't get twisted. Then, stretch the condom over the edges and go at it.   Just don't go with beer cans in a bath. Especially if it's because you can't handle the recent death of someone close to you. Then you'll try and offer one to someone who comes to check on you and you'll have to sip off multiple beers until you find one that isn't just bath water. You might then decide to have your brother fill the toilet with ice and fresh beers.   I would agree with you before they went with the natural cut fries.   That too   Will Ferrell sucks. He's an ass.   1. Breaking Bad 2. Scrubs 3. Ground Floor 4. Supernatural 5. The Big Bang Theory Edit: Changed number 4.   I have friends who are married to one another. They go by the names James and Jennifer. They would be the vacuuming competition types.   Cleveland, MS. There's just absolutely nothing to do here. You can stop through for gas, we've got that going for us 2.98/gallon. If you're going south, keep going until you reach Ridgeland.   "We're going to stay with my mother for a few weeks."   I'd support a draft in this situation. Hell, I'd be the first in line for voluntary draft if there were one.   Aaron Paul. He'd shoot someone then go back to meth and throw a non stop party to distract himself from it.   He isn't even good at being him. I hate him.   For those who want more Dr. Cox, watch ground floor. Though John C. McGinley isn't playing as Dr Cox, his character has a lot of the same traits. He even makes a few Scrubs like references.   Same here. That was a very emotional show.   When my dad and mom divorced and he met the woman who became my step mom, we all lived together (minus biological mom). I'll call step mom Charlene. Charlene worked from home and her employer paid for the internet connection. They also provided the 2 computers for the house. They had all the internet history monitored. They'd have screenshots of the history. She would get in lots of trouble if there was inappropriate content (porn) on the pcs. I was 17 so naturally I was a fiend. Since no tricks worked (incognito didn't work either) I would get playboys. I had a stash for them and all was good. Charlene always snooped around my room when I was at work. She found my stash and she and my dad had a talk with me. This pissed me off because I had urges and I wasn't risking her job, I had the decency to hide the mags and I wasn't getting any chicks pregnant. My playboys were harmless. I'm human dammit!   Grandmas and weed... oh the memories. I remember growing up and going to grandma's trailer on the Mississippi gulf coast. We would go there as a family from New Orleans one or two weekends a month and stay the whole weekend. Her trailer had a very unique smell. I could never pinpoint it. All the adults would go to her room for a couple hours at a time. My siblings and I would hang out in the living room being kids and I would lay on the floor wondering what that wonderfully unique smell was. Fast forward to when I was 13 or 14 smoking weed for the first time and I got a big whiff and suddenly, I was at grandma's trailer. That smell brought me back instantly. Good times.   OP's name kinda gives this whole post new meaning   Promise to give it away.   I want to be used by a woman. Just for her to do everything (no backdoor usage). Like sit on my face while I eat her out. Get me close to coming then just stop. There's more details but I'll leave some for the imagination. I would also like the opposite. To dominate a woman and be very rough. These details are even more secretive.   My face doesn't get red. Though I think the equivalent of that for me occurs after about three fifths of Jameson.   Irish/ Italian/ German/ Norwegian and a few other nationalities reside in my blood line. I can out drink all of my friends and love potatoes/I love to eat pasta and I'm loud/ I also love to eat brat wurst and sauerkraut along with other German foods/ I'm tall with blonde hair and can grow a mean beard   He can even stand on a chair and check on all his patients at once.   He might get paged to work because he was on call. Then he'd be sent home for smelling like beer at work.   If a potential employer hands you a consent for release of background info and it doesn't say "criminal" background or anything similar, and you have criminal charges against you they won't find that stuff. A standard background check only looks for recent addresses and places of employment to verify what you put in the application. Most companies don't actually call previous employers anymore. If the form does ask about criminal charges and you have a pending charge, it either won't show up or they have to ignore it if it does because it's not a confirmed charge. The previous information is only good in certain areas.   If he's black and bald while dating a Latina nurse and they have a mutual nerdy white friend, he'll (the surgeon) somehow have plenty of free time for tomfoolery and steak night. He doesn't even have to carry a clip board all the time.   Just ask the guy that can get things for a rock hammer and a poster of a beautiful woman. Get in good with the guards by helping with tax tips and get in with the warden. Slowly but surely use the rock hammer to tunnel out while also setting up a fake identity associated with a bank account that all the warden's money goes to. Then fix up an old boat in Mexico.   Hell. It's not the least bit embarrassing. The fact that it was so simple and cheap along with it being something I could do by myself makes it a point of pride. I've had to replace the transmission on a previous vehicle for it to only last about 6 more months. That was a ridiculously expensive repair. I appreciate cheap simple repairs.   When someone complains that they work harder than anyone else when in reality they only want to acknowledge their own work. You might be doing the same amount of work or more but this type of person actually believes he/she is doing more and/or harder work.  Also, those who are ungrateful towards everyone.   I beat a dude's ass back in elementary for that shit.   This is me when I'm drunk.   You must know my wife and her family.   1. "I'm not even supposed to be here today!" - Clerks 2. " It's my life.

"Dude, I think I just filled the cup." - Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back   I took the front left tire off and looked at the brake caliper. There's supposed to be two bolts holding it to the rotor. The bottom one was missing which caused the thing to jamb up.  A little back story: A couple weeks back I had to replace the battery. On this make and model the battery is accessed from behind the wheel well. I had to remove the splash guard to get to it. Well the previous owner must've really fucked up the little plastic bolts that hold it together because I had to break some of them off too remove the splash guard. When I finished putting in the new battery, the splash guard couldn't be completely re-attached. About a week after that I had to replace the front brake pads. I did so and went about my business. Afterward, as I would ride around I'd hear this thumping sound and was worried but my wife suggested it was just the loose splash guard and bumper so I accepted that in hopes she was right. Then I ran into the problem I typed in my question above and was truly worried obviously. Well apparently I didn't tighten the bottom bolt mentioned earlier. So with running into the bigger issue I was able to fix both problems with one solution. I learned the thumping was the loose bolt allowed to much movement for the caliper which caused the thumping noise. When the bolt finally came out whenever/wherever it did caused the brake to jamb. I hope if anyone is unfortunate to have this problem, that they find this solution.   I took the front left tire off and looked at the brake caliper.

 Yeah, we just brought on a whole bunch more people. We should get through the updates much more quickly.      You could try [Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/). It's got quite a bit of tweaking, and has all the mods you mentioned. Plus, it's got a whole bunch of progression instituted and whatnot.   Well, due to how progression works in Phoenix Reborn, ProjectE isn't accessible 'till late game, and can't be automated until even later. So, at the beginning of the game, I had a huge farm in order to supply me with plenty of toast. I had several machines that I used in various stages, and most of them are still back at the original base where power gen is. I only transferred the frequently used ones to the new dimension.  And I figured that I might as well make it compact, once I started making the void dimension. From there it was pretty simple.   http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2229562-rftools-dimension-builder-teleportation-powerful   Yes, it's amazing. I've looked at the Shield System as well, and it's a great low processing power cost alternative to MFFS. Plus, it's really easy to build the shield as well.   That's either Apple Core or Spice of Life. It indicates the amount of time left in that Hunger Point. I believe you can disable it in the configs.      Don't worry, you're not a bad person. It's my fault for making the code a little to obvious :P   Heh, I'll make sure to fix that.   \o/   Running Red, Wanderlust, and Tolkiencraft II.   If you look through this AMA, you'll see that even slowpoke himself agreed that Ultimate, although generally looked upon as well balanced, actually had quite a few balance issues, mainly via cross-mod compatibility.  I find the tools much more of a upside than a downside - without them, something like Running Red or Crash Landing would never have been possible. And bloat, well, I think FTB is trying to avoid that now. You saw how Monster turned out. FTB is now trying to make well balanced and enjoyable packs, between Mage Quest, the soon to be released inFlux, and Resurrection, we have very many specific packs. Sure, there is a lot of them. But it's not like Monster or the Adventure Update - everything isn't being crammed into one. Each pack caters to specific audiences. No single pack is too large, and no single pack is too big to be considered to have content bloat.   The tools are helping pack creators fulfill there vision for the packs. Without them, I would never have been able to tell a story, Jaded wouldn't have been able to build the paradise in the sky, Eyamaz wouldn't have been able to create hell on Earth, Iskandar wouldn't have been able to create a faraway planet, Orator would never have been able to bring to life the works of JRR Tolkien, parcel would never have been able to make compressed cookies, Elec would never have been able to create the skylands, Lumaceon would never have been able to make a Crafting Paradise, and Yulife would never have been able to reload our Wanderlust. These tools are what give are packs life. They're what make our packs unique and not just another kitchen sink pack, which is all we had before this. We're not creating bloat - we're creating something new. Something unique.  I'm sure we'd all be glad to play the same packs, over and over again, just for a different version of mods, or a different version of Minecraft. But I find it more enjoyable to play something new. To be cast into a world without water, or one filled with evil creatures, or in a station, with disks of the world in my hand, or in a medieval landscape, or in a home in the sky. None of this would have been possible without these tools. None of the small tweakings that go into making each pack work. We can make our packs better, and take our time to give you good content, or, would you prefer it if we gave you a kitchen sink pack with cross-mod compatibility issues? Sure, one may take time. But each time we take our time, we create something new. Whether it's a mainstream pack built around Gregtech and memories of the past, or a jarring landing on a distant planet, we're reinventing modpacks.  Noone's trying to replace Ultimate. Ultimate has been done. We're trying to create something new. If you want Ultimate, it's still there for you to play it. We making things that haven't been made before. Just look at the Third Party Modpacks section on the FTB Forums. Would you prefer that each pack is another kitchen-sink pack with different mods, or would you prefer to see stuff in there like Crash Landing, ME^3, Wanderlust, Tolkiencraft, Running Red, PhoenixCraft, Blast Off!, Infinitech, FluxGalaxy, ImpactFlux, Clouds of Darkness, and the Dark Trilogy? These tools have given us the power to create packs like this. No one pack has content bloat- they all have their own visions and tweaks and quests that make up what each pack is. We don't throw mods together and change IDs anymore, like we did with Ultimate. We take those mods and change them, make them fit in the world in which we are creating. We can do so much more than we used to, thanks to these tools. Would you call that a caveat, or a bonus? I'd call it a bonus.   The reason it takes more time than it used to is because there are so many more tools available to pack creators. It's not so much throwing mods together and fixing ID Conflicts anymore - now we have the ability to change recipes, create quests, change ore gen, biomes, and so much more. So yeah, it takes more time than it used to, but as well, there's so much more being put into it.   Not certain why, but it's in the changelog for the latest build: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/59968-special-mobs/files/2216952   All you need to do to fix this is update Special Mobs.   Well, try the second. It's nothing like the first.      For the world generators, EBXL was only included because of the ability to enable and disable the biomes and villages in those biomes. I'm trying to avoid adding any mods that add content like that, just things that can be used as bases for packs.   Alright, I added those.   Probably the original for ultimate. The panes are arranged in the same format http://i.imgur.com/50Q0IgS.jpg   Because it takes a while to make these things.         What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?   It's technically not made for multiplayer, but in the recent updates, I've been trying to add more support for it.  I've made quests repeatable so those on non-hardcore worlds and servers can reclaim their effects after death, and I've also added a multiplayer only object that allows for others to revive you. Possibly more in the future.  Anyway, I would be interested to see if there are any servers as well.  	26
 didnt think of that.. but no.. [It was released today.](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/thepeanutsmovie/#share) (and yeah yall can watch here)  maybe they want it at certain places so they can count viewers.. idk.. still seems dumb.    Why don't we see mammals where there are 100 females to 1 male?  there are some gator pops, that might be heading this way due to the way temps select their sex.. too high and they are mostly female and their are worries that due to global warming, the pops will die out because the cooler temps needed to make males will no longer be available.    and placebos?  never had a coincidence happen either.  its not that simple and no i dont think the victims are bigger liars than the perps.  you do know a lot of faith healers, have people PRETEND to be sick and disabled. FRIENDS OF THEIRS IN FRAUD. Others see the supposed healing from a 'man of god' and are fooled. That is FRAUD and yeah it helps if the people watching are ignorant of science but that doesnt make them morons.      and google does the site search.. used them instead of reddits for ages.  just do reddit.com  search query in google for a site search.. no longer need to tell google to do a site search anymore either         and..... its gone.  WTF would fox remove an advertisement for fox on copyright grounds.     fraud aside that wasnt the question.  there have been trans that deny they were ever a man to get laid.  quit pretending that doesnt happen.  oh wait you didnt? well the articles title isnt about that.  the articles title on if we should still recognize her as black.. if we recognize a trans.. EVEN TRANS WHO LIE AND SAY THEY WERE ALWAYS A GIRL.  **I agree with you on fraud and she has no right to fight historical opression as an insider, just wish you could have actually debated the question asked and not the one you seemed to want to debate.**  the question is, should she been seen as black, just like trans who lie about ever being a boy.  Lets put it this way, ignore her, what if bruce said he wanted to be seen as a black woman. Thats what i find is an interesting question.. not the bullshit about fraud and deceit that we all agree was fraud and deceit. But that point seems impossible to debate with the current situation because it all twists back into her actions which has nothing to do with the question.     eh..  we are first on other lists.  different people use different methodologies and even the article displays 2 of them.. but yes the US is not #1 in either measure displayed in the article.   depends on how you define it.. it isnt easy to measure as you can imagine.  on  [household final consumption expenditure per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_household_final_consumption_expenditure_per_capita)  which is the most used figures.  Also mind you those are two different scales.. the one you are quoting is resources and things like emissions, as the article states. the one the title is quoting is land area.  see UAE is #1 when it comes to how much land would each person need if they consumed as much as UAE.  but Kuiwait is #1 when it comes to total consumption, which includes co2 emissions.. as the article states.   the US  is 4.1 on one scale.. the same one with the title.  and  3.9 on the scale you are comparing.  you do beat UAE in one but not the one the title is talking about, but the second measure at the second half of the article.     apparently misc is the only place that will allow this discussion.       yeah it kinda broke the fantasy for me a bit. people are dying left and right... to friends. the entire place is at war. Jamie at least is portrayed at having a little bit of brains.  i dont mind the death, as much as how it was done. its almost like they didnt finish their "homework' and just quickly wrote the scene right before it was filmed. i would have been happier with a tiny blow dart as shes rowing away.. trained monkeys or something else.    I am glad he at least has a helmet in case he needs it.    That one was a bit overly obvious, i thought, for the show. And for no one to be suspicious. Everyone thought it was her that sent the necklace threat. She has the poison troop. She doesnt even want to drink with the lannisters.. And suddenly she has to give her a massive and firm kiss to the lips? and in the world of deceit they live in... idk if a crazy person who seems like they hate me and sent a threat that they might have me killed.. suddenly kisses me.. i'd be a bit wary.   and they are about to get sued and lose, after spending millions to defend a losing suit.  yes both sides do it.. and i would like to see a study about how much we spend on these stupid laws that are nothing more than an expensive ass tax payers ad for the asshole who passed them. I am quite sure he was told by intelligent advisors that this law would not survive a scotus challenge but was probably also told that this would be good for him politically, both passing the law and when the law is challenged and he can scream about activists courts.  like my state is pouring money in the gay marriage fight, despite half the US lost that same fight before us.  Jindal knew he was lying through his teeth about the purpose.  Jindal also knows it is totally unconstitutional.     what about multiple accounts from same IP?  do any of yall use phones?    in this the document would be similar to the classified version of U.S. intelligence about Iraq and its purported weapons of mass destruction. Before Congress voted to give George W. Bush authority to invade Iraq in 2002, no more than six senators and a handful of House members bothered to look at a 92-page assessment of the alleged weapons kept in two vaults on Capitol Hill  something we know not because its public information because someone leaked it to the Washington Post in 2004.  well that assessment was also missing dissenting data.  and it would be better to actually point out that this is how it has been since the 70s for every single solitary trade agreement. not sure why nearly the entire media pretends this is new. Not saying dont get outraged. Its outrageous. but the fact it is a secret from the people.. is the same as the last trade agreement. And the only reason why Obama needs a vote for fast track, is because that authority only recently expired.(and yes i know fast track has more to do with congress.).  This is outrageous, but it isnt new or that modern of a phenom, especially when it comes to trade.    how much you earn per day if i can ask.   well i also liked how they defended themselves by saying barbara can have a green lawn too  Im a conservative, so this is strange, but I defend Barbra Streisands right to have a green lawn, said Yuhas  "we arent total dicks, i mean we dont mind if rich liberals have green lawns too"    combofix doesnt do 8.1 :(  /r/TronScript  is a decent script for cleaning systems.    The margins arent that razor thin all the time. In my experience, walmart dictates to you what they are going to pay. They are very difficult to deal with and if you dont like it they wont carry your product. You generally HAVE to sell cheaper to walmart than you would to local smaller competition.   so a sub mostly about the past.  sigh.   there has been a lacking of content in recent years.    they might have a case then. and i meant to post that to the post above this one.. oh wul.    u can use reddit code, [you just got to say you are](http://www.redditblog.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html)  All reddit code is licensed under the Common Public Attribution License, which is basically the Mozilla license with a handful of changes. Specifically, the CPAL stipulates that when running reddit's code publicly, any changes to the code must be made available publicly and the site must make clear that it is running reddit code.    The 21-year-old man, who has not been identified, had had his penis amputated three years ago to save his life after suffering gangrene from a botched circumcision.   damn.. he decided for circumcision at 18?      Its generally not accepted at all, and if you see the people pushing the idea, you will find they are the same names that the denialist blogs promote and if you look they dont really have anything but conjecture behind their beliefs.   Like Anastasios Tsonis, says the current 'pause' in land surface temps is similar to one in the 70s, therefore we are entering a 50 year cooling phase.. despite that didnt happen in the 70s.  There is judith curry another famous denier, who simply says long term trends in ocean temps suggest we are heading to an ice age, without really expanding on that.  she also likes to promote the increase in area of sea ice, while totally ignoring the decrease in volume.    now in the 70s when we had the famous newsweek article, actually most scientists at the time still believed in warming despite the media talking to the minority that didnt. But at  this time, most of the minority that didnt, werent denialist. See not only are we putting chems that cause warming, we are also putting up chems that cause cooling. And we werent as sure as now, at how all the pluses and minuses added up. But we still use the science of some of these people, because they gave us great data and research on the chems we are putting up that cool, like soot and SO2      yeah you can brute force, but  but i remember thee 1st part of the password.   sounds like pass might be long.. and while you can bruteforce only the part you dont know, probably easier to jog your memory.. it might take time and coming back to it. Try to remember everything about the day you passworded it.. All kinds of things form light connections to our memories, even a smell can bring it back.  had a file like op, took me a couple weeks to remember the pass, but just one day going through shit on my pc, it just popped in my head again.   well mind you the fast track vote rn is meaningless.. its a package deal with that thing that didnt pass.. .so people were free to vote for this or against, while planning to do the opposite when it is a real vote. This is sorta saying "if we get our way, this shit will pass, see look we will take a fake vote.. see it passed.. now give us our way" which pelosi wants highway funding.   some of fasttrack isnt wholly evil.. the parts that limit debate and time are, but congress shouldnt be allowed to amend.. it should be up or down vote.  They can vote to recommend.. but if you have 20 countries in diplomatic efforts, you cant have 20 legislative bodies, looking over the agreements and sending them back with minor changes that some minor portion of some 10,000 legislators want. Too many cooks and all that. They should be able to read it.. it should be public, they should be able to take all the time in the world to vote on it.. but up or down vote is the only way this shit can work.    I do wonder if their is a son of sam out there being told to mow my lawn so i dont have to. There has to be the helpful insane.. no?   nothing says saint like an ostentatious display of wealth.    i believe their algo takes that into account, when you downvote straight down someones profile.. the votes show up for you but not reddit.   fair enough, your correct, and my comment has been corrected. Thank you.   Well they [appear to be building nukes for the saudis...with the help of china](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Middle_East/article1557090.ece) and this isnt that new, its been going on for a [few years.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24823846)  and this on top of [starting the NK program and helping libya start theirs and iran in their renewed push](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/07/pakistani-generals-helped-sell-nuclear-secrets)  They pretty much are the nuclear black market.  I agree its mainly about keeping the government there, but its more about location than nukes. We might need to reassess the cost benefits of it all.    if you look at things that were eventually released without the redacting, there doesnt seem to always be a lot of sense with redacting. Sometimes they just seem to do it to do it.  Here [is the martin luther king letter where the FBI urged him to kill himself](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/fbis-suicide-letter-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-and-dangers-unchecked-surveillance)  they cut out the worst of them calling him names, and cut out saying he doesnt actually believe in god, but then they say he is evil and urge him to kill himself without redacting.    it would be hard to incorporate the language in the copyright code but something's have become so commonly linked into our history, that it really should automatically be open. It should be limited to things like this and happy birthday song.. but certain things just belong to all of us now.  Though i'm fairly sure you should be able to watch the speech in an educational context as the code stands now.   It might not be as significant as he states, but its a bit much to attack him with a "bullshit". A large part of the reasons people settled here was due to religion. Understanding things like why under god was put in our pledge. A def need a good understanding of religions in general to understand some of the strife around the world. I dont think it is as significant as some think, but he also just said 'basic understanding'  and well our history is replete with people using and abusing the bible, a basic knowledge of the book is most helpful in complete understanding of our history.(I'm an atheist but there is still a difference between use and abuse)   yeha i was going to expand into western versions, like the johnsons, and how people were also named after jobs like the smiths. i'd like to know how the actual transition period went, where we just stopped saying son of john, and just named them all johnson from then on, no matter the fathers actual name.      thanks for the helpful correction. Many are not so helpful. I use the term a lot, and have been misspelling it for decades. LOL    yeah i'm not even sure what he is countering.  'i dont think that will work and would be surprised if it did'  when i show him an example of it working. it could be culturally it wouldnt work here. but the facts are they take scummy people that are just as scummy as our scummy people and make them functioning members of society.  If we cant point to the cause, that is exceptional from america,then its idiotic to not try.   What works for Norway will likely not work here.  why? cause you said it wouldnt? Your comment might have validity if you said "just cause it works for norway doesnt mean it will work here"  but we cant know that unless we test these thigns right? SCIENCE, over EMOTION.  norway is a data point, they have better records than us, we need to get rid of the variables that DOES NOT CAUSE THIS. one fo the variables is their type of prison system.  I'd be surprised if it did.  And you probably shouldnt be involved in the science to see if it does. like it or not our system isnt working well. Their system is working better. Yes it could be culture, it could be a number of things, but only a moron wouldnt want to try it.   edit: [it does work in america.. we just dont do it wide spread, but the prisons that do have better rates than the prisons that dont.](http://static.nicic.gov/Library/023358.pdf)    and you have validated my assumptions. Someone that corrects someone with a snarky dickhead comment, rather than anything of any use is probably a snarky dickhead who can be ignored. And looking at your comment history, i can see you offer pretty much nothing but dickheaddom to reddit. Congrats. You also forgot a comma.  and seriously look at his comment history, full of grammatical errors and you come here to be a dick to me.  Yeah, ok. Why don't you try reading a book about naval warfare and still think a "fleet" of Chinese pirate ships could even tackle a single Warship. I doubt it.  look at this mangel of a  sentence.  I guess you weren't  willing to take the mere seconds required to express their idea intelligently it is reasonable to ignore you  if you are going to be a massive dick about grammar, it helps to not have a comment history like yours, with crap like that. And all you do is attack people. You never offer any helpful corrections. You just scream everyone is ignorant but you while offering zero substance to back that up.       tell me this. You got a mean dog and you want to make him a nice dog, which is better, treating the dog well or beating it? If you can understand that why cant you understand that treating people like scum, might produce scummier people when they get out?  in norway they have a program that has a much lower rate of recidivism than we do, and the place would make you puke. they are nice appartments and all the guards call the prisoners sir. They are treated like respectful members of society and the crazy thing, is it becomes habit and when they get out, they generally are respectful members of society.  they [have the lowest recidivism rate on the planet](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12)  we on the other hand, make it hard for them to ever come back to society, many cant get housing or a job, cant vote or go to college. And then we pretend they are faulty humans when they turn back to crime.  maybe we should dispense with emotions, and look at the science and actually try to do something effective, rather than something that makes us feel good,.   sorry in casual convo, people tend to get casual, if you want me to type this comment up in report form, it will be much cleaner, and grammatically correct. If you have trouble understanding any sentence, please inquire, and I will make it more clear for you.  Have a great day  !!!;,...:?"'  extra punct, so you can put them where you want them   edit:  people who post comments like this shouldnt be such dicks about grammar.  Yeah, ok. Why don't you try reading a book about naval warfare and still think a "fleet" of Chinese pirate ships could even tackle a single Warship. I doubt it.   **douchebag who makes grammar mistakes through out his comment history is only attacking my grammar because he cant debate my point.**   Its a biblical survey done by a christian group that has the goal of putting more religion in society. The poll seems done ok, but the conclusions are going to be a bit wack.  They are trying to show we are a bunch of heathens who forgot our bible and we need it back in the schools.    they didnt have last names persay.. from biblical info would be Noah ben Lamech. Or Noah son of lamech.  its where the bin names come from, like bin laden. Osama bin laden really is translated osama son of laden.   its how last names developed in the region. When you were in small tribes there wasnt really a need.. so you were just such and suchs son or son of such and such. It wasnt til we got larger societies that their was an actual need for last names. And jesus would be jesus ben joseph, which he seems to be referred to in jewish texts   Its a poll from a religious org about the bible and christianity's influence on society, they are going to be a bit non scientific. Real scientists in this area, complain a lot about the sudo religious science, because they are so heavily biased when they do things that they cant look at things objectively.  however this thing reads very political.  like that second quote of yours, its a true false question.. the fact that its below 48% should be concerning to them, because random guessing should product that, it sorta suggests that no one knew. Otherwise the small amount that actually knew would push that bias over 50%  and til yall are the mosiac generation.    yeah, you'd thing that, but after literally millions of surveys, we have a very good idea about the numbers and types of people who wont answer or do fake answers. Turns out the snarkers are a relatively stable percent of humanity.   If france is successful..which it wont be but if it is, someone will just make an 'forgotten links' search engine.   much like the undelete subreddit here.    er  jet fuel cant dank bush.    It isnt, People cant read. Which is quite odd for /r/science.   and there's a low score on the so-called healthy food availability index.  ..among other things  but [if you look, the reason they added the extra qualifiers](http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/24/aje.kwr445.full) is because NO just being 1/4mile or more from a supermarket isnt very meaningful.   Counting supermarkets is logistically more feasible but relies on the potentially incorrect assumption that only supermarkets offer healthy foods and that the availability and quality of foods offered by supermarkets are invariant across neighborhoods (1214). I   and right now the science is young on how to accurately measure all this.     this is /r/science correct? There seems to be an entire slew of people who cant read.   researchers defined food deserts as areas where distance to a supermarket exceeds a quarter-mile; the median household income is at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level; more than 30 percent of households lack a vehicle; **and there's a low score on the so-called healthy food availability index.**  SO NO, just being 1/4 mile from a supermarket doesnt count. The quality of your supermarket matters as well. The fact of 30% lacking vehicles is no big deal to us who bike ride and walk to the grocer but there is a slew of people, who have a high tendency to be impoverished that have a hard time with this, like the elderly.  i dont mean to be overly snarky, but i tend to try to be more exacting when commenting here... reread the article and such, to make sure what i say is supported. It keeps the value of this subreddit high.    they'd get more selling them on ebay   [he was tucking](https://vid.me/yOtY)   Sigh, wish i heard about this a while back.. i just bought two. one for me, and one for a friend.  Mine did the autofire thing before i even charged it the first time.  I sprayed down with electronics cleaner and got it to work again, after a more than thorough cleaning. hope helps some, i guess some juice might have gotten into it. but i really didnt have any real leaks, just the normal light film crap you sometimes get under the atomizer. hope this helps someone.. anyways you can get it at walmart in the auto section for about 5 dollars.   yes I would suspect that people who have a tendency to read articles on healthy diets would also show a similar drop. And i wouldnt expect the reading has much of a medical effect.   whats the story on the istick?    you right to swing your arms ends at the tip of my nose.  and funny, i hear this all the time from you right wingers...... until you force single unwed mothers to post a list of their sexual partners in the paper in order to put her kid up for adoption.. cause jeb bush feels single mothers need public shamming.  yeah your all for privacy until it comes to poor people.. and automatic drug tests to get aid.. but god knows cant fucking drug test the bankers who are also getting welfare.  same people flipped the fuck out over Obamas under $250 anonymous donations, cry free speech over citizens united which allows unlimited anonymous donations, not just tiny 250 dollar chunks.  needless to say your pretty transparent.  and as for public shamming, there is a little lawsuit about what yall did to mann.  Also science is right or wrong, it doesnt give a flying fuck about your uneducated opinion.    its highly unlikely that humanity will die out from agw. And really doesnt help to suggest that. Society will be greatly disrupted and dealing with climate change will be EXPONENTIALLY more expensive than mitigating it. but life will mostly go on.. there will be more conflicts and wars and year mostly poor people dying off. but with the wars and unrest a lot of the wealthy will die from agw causes.   but the world and mankind will go on.    The GOP obviously.  A. only a moron would think the dems intended for federal exchanges to not get subsidies.  B. the supreme court wouldnt hear the case, had the GOP not brought it up. Its not proactive.  c. it would take one line to fix it and the gop wont.. they will insist on repealing the individual mandate. Which is basically repealing Obamacare.  Only a complete dumbass wouldnt blame the GOP on this clusterfuck. Had the GOP not acted, everyone would still get their subsidies. No matter what as the supreme court isnt proactive.  cause - effect  pretty fucking simple.. but i suspect you right wingers will cry  "show us one republican that voted for this mess"  lol  doesnt matter  yall sued to kill subsidies  yall are at fault   yall can blame the dems for aspects of the law people dont like.  the young dont like being forced on insurance. Small businesses hate the 1099 crap.  but if you think you will be able to blame the dems on yall killing the subsidies.. well I got a government closure and ted cruz for you to talk to. The dems didnt get blamed for that horse shit either.    mildly cool you mean, separating all the things that can crash your entire browsing experience into separate processes so only the failing thing crashes rather than the entire browser and all tabs like in the olden days  [here read more on it.](http://www.howtogeek.com/124218/why-does-chrome-have-so-many-open-processes/)  it makes you safer somewhat from exploits as well.     pure vg will be easier than a mix with pg. and if you look at some of the youtube reviews of the istick you will see others agree. Some people just are more sensitive to pg, especially at higher temps. You will see the same complaint as yours all across youtube. I felt the same.. i make my own juice, went to full vg, now i can 25wat no prob.. and often higher,. And i normally prefer a little pg for throat hit, until i started to higher watt and subohm.    cheaper per month, which can be easier on the poor to own.   However, that "cheaper' comes from the html title. ROI when new cars are cheaper than used ones. Which suggests he considered total cost of ownership.  But he doesnt go into it enough to say that directly. And the whole thing is based on a 1 year old used car. Which used to be the sweet spot for ROI. due to the massive drive off loss, which he suggests isnt quite there anymore due to cash for clunkers taking off so many used.  and he also makes the same comment as yours later,  If there's a general rule you can take away, it's a reminder of an old one: The real price of a purchase isn't just what's on the sticker. It's the full amount it's going to cost in actual cash flows over its lifetime.     well this you see a lot at all levels of income. People dont plan for major downturns. I know often they can't. But even when they can, people just tend not to. your resteraunt is doing well, you kinda expect it to always do well.. lose a key chef, or a new interesting place moves in next store and and things slow down, you think it will pass, people are just interested in new but it stays slow and you find yourself in trouble. unfortunately then a lot of people turn to credit and get in real difficulty, it can be fairly cheap until you cant pay.   [when buying new is cheaper than buying used](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703921504576094264156257224) (wsj)  Edmunds.com, the auto-shopping website, now maintains an intriguing list of cars, SUVs and trucks where you could end up paying less per month for a brand-new model than if you bought a typical one-year-old used oneassuming you are buying the vehicle with a loan.  not only reliable but sometimes cheaper as well.     it also costs a bit more to be poor.   from transportation, to groceries, to laundry and financial services and credit.. and extremely expensive on time due to the same things above.  Having to ride the bus to do your laundry with its multiple stops, indirect routes and probably your stop leaves you walking still.. and then, having to sit there with your clothes.  I am not questioning your anecdote, i have known the same sorts myself, without a doubt it is one aspect of poverty. Just adding that poverty isnt the same as non poverty living.  and what some people might see as bad with money, isnt always. like shopping at the over priced convenience store because you cant make it to the grocery store.     I agree with a lot of points.  Hear are some of my own. To many people seem to think freedom of speech means i have to listen to it or that it comes without condemnation. you are free to hate, and we are free to condemn you for it. Not that he meant it like that but when he said the thing about silencing people is denying your own right to hear.... well pretty sure the silencers, dont want to hear it anyways.. thats kinda the point.  his example on the guy denying the holocaust, i have no problem with people who deny all kinds of things. I dont think it should be banned. i'd rather know who they are. but in the same breath and to change to a less loaded subject, I dont think the time cube, or expanding earth theory should be taught in school.   its not silencing them to say they havent earned that soap box.    I can agree and actually see some of myself in the article.  but one thing rubs at me a bit.. and though he had an awakening...  mainly because it seemed to me that liberals were exaggerating the case for global warming as a kind of secular Millenarianisman environmental apocalypse requiring drastic government action to save us from doomsday through countless regulations that would handcuff the economy and restrain capitalism, which I hold to be the greatest enemy of poverty.   they never seem to explain why.. liberals want to do this. others might disagree with the regulations and things liberals want to do and have done.. and as a liberal i can say the same about conservatives, but neither has a goal of destroying the economy.  I always hear vague things about "control" and yes the government is infamous for passing and doing things that control us, but a carbon tax... equates to total control over society and the destruction of capitalism cause we feel like it?  (and on a side note, its kinda unfair that liberals get labeled the ones who want to regulate society, when conservatives want to regulate what you can put in your own body, who you can marry.. what poor people can eat.. talk about gun control? there is a town near me where YOU HAVE TO OWN A GUN.. its the law.. thats conservative government control.)  ugh.. ok dont want to get too political but it happens. he is right, there is also confirmation bias, and we all do it some. I try to stop myself but it happens. being a skeptic does help as we are more used to our 'feelings' being wrong.. time/space/sitting to close to the tv, the earth is spinning and yet we dont fly off... etc   it is cepr and this is based on good research but i do have a couple problems, or things that need more clarification. First it shows productivity in restaurants and grocery stores has been flat or down. Not exactly the bastions of automation.. and many people havent taken to self checkout yet.  also with the extreme amount of people needed assistance these days, you would expect that eating out, and buying hundreds of dollars in groceries is down. self checkouts or not.   and our obesity growth actually stopped the past few years and went down for young kids, which would lead to a productivity stagnation in their examples.  also i wonder if they count the shift to online purchases, there are many grocery items people get from amazon now, in automated subscription services, this would lead to a decline in groccery productivity. If they dont count the non grocery stores online. Like I dont buy razor blades ever at the grocer anymore. Or batteries or a slew of items you get totally ripped off on if you buy there.  also the big problem with robots, is on the horizon, its easy to shift manual labor jobs or even force them to get skills to take skilled jobs, the problem is when robots start taking skilled jobs.  last the robots are taking some jobs. It might not be 'effecting' income disparity according to cepr. but capitalism has this supply and demand thing.. if there are far more jobs than applicants, the wages go up. Its econ 101, so if amazon wasnt putting so many robots in their warehouses, there would be more jobs needing fulfilling. now there can be other reasons why the data, comes out flat like it does.. or not showing a steady trend. Like as wages dont keep up with inflation, the rising productivity of robots isnt shown because of the declining buying power of the people. Or perhaps we are birthing people fast enough to make up with the declining jobs.  despite how it sounds, I dont totally discount what they say, i just would like an AMA with the dude who wrote it, because i have serious questions about his conclusions.      goat in the water    There is a physics prof vaper on youtube, that makes her own mods and crap. Shes pretty cool, she charges outside. i believe in an explosive safe container.   the quote is interesting considering it predates the changes to the pledge.    with how much the right praised putin in attacks against obama, i thought he was going to be their presidential nominee.  Be wary of those who refuse any and all attempts at diplomacy. That believe all disputes must be fought with blood. that only increasingly hostile rhetoric will bring peace.. just like it does in bar fights.    or do the opposite and post to /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces    How about we blame both congress and the executive(obama AND bush), since they are the ones who are supposed to have oversight over the admin and they passed many of the laws that the admins have been using for this power. And if they dont have the proper means to do PROPER oversight of the executive then that is a matter of discussion and a good time for it being election season.   I'm not sure why congress should be absolved when they keep passing these horseshit vague ass laws.. like the freedom act which isnt much different than the shit we had before.   look in autoruns.  also process explorer can help, you can pause the processes relaunching it. its not in tron but i have often used in infections to pause processes that protect each other by restarting when one or the other is killed. but its part of the sysnternals ms suite that autoruns came in.    thanks, i didnt know the details that well, that is quite interesting.   Dunno about the UK. But in America, health codes and insurance. Someone might get sick and sue.  you dunno about america either.  If you go to a food bank, 90% of the food is unsold food from local groceries.  A LARGE PORTION IS PAST THE SELL BY DATE.  But we have been doing this for decades.  you get a fuck ton of stale bread and donuts, a fuck ton of lettuce and onions. and a fuck ton of cans of cream corn but that comes from people throwing that in the big cardboard box. whichs seems to be the only reason why they buy it. You get normal expired package food as well but a fuck ton of bread.   I dont think there are many legal issues for the stores.. and some tax write offs. but see they arent serving food, they are giving you prepackaged food. The food banks will warn people because so much of the food is after sale date(but there is leeway in the dates) to not eat it if it seems bad.  but yeah without the stores giving away the unsold food, many families ON FOOD STAMPS would go hungry. Food banks fill in the blanks for food stamps as well as help out families that just have a really bad month and we wouldnt survive without grocery stories. (used and volunteered at one for a long time)    All but one of the these facilities is owned by for-profit entities, and by far the largest number of hospitals  20  are in Florida  figures, [their own governor ran a company that was convicted of the largest medicaid fraud in us history. They stole billions.](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/mar/03/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-rick-scott-oversaw-largest-medicare-fra/)  of course the CEO had no clue, his corp was bilking the government for billions.  wanna be a criminal? get rich first.     I thought this was common knowledge.  happened to me 20 years ago, the price between insured care and uninsured was exponential.  I was told that the insurance companies make deals where i couldnt.    well whats funny is the deniers demanded they be adjusted. you know heat islands and other problems.  then we do and they scream "LOOK YOU CHANGED THE DATA'  and remember the richard muller BEST study was to prove the data was bad. Instead it proved the opposite to muller.  It doesnt matter if you take adjusted data or not, the changes arent great enough to change the plot lines from showing mans influence.  it doesnt matter if you just take rural areas that havent changed in decades.. they all come out with graphs that are in great agreement with each other.  there is a reason why denialists have to argue from blogs and youtube videos.    considering the rain they are getting now.. we can actually calculate that god is about 4 light years away.. well thats if prayers travel at the speed of light.   /s    happened to my neighbor a couple years ago.. really sucked, she had 3 dogs and was pretty good with trash.. he got in anyways. These are some of the worst ways for a pet to die, leads to a lot of self blame.   of course only works with a perfectly spherical cow in a vacuum.  :P    18650 lithium-ion batteries  totally blows away AA rechargables. I have never been happy with headsets and flash lights using normal AA rechargeable batts.. they just never last or produce a lot of power.  18650s are awesome. Last long time, plenty of power.. survives lots of recharges.   I do the happy dance when i dont get invited to those things.... maybe i shouldnt do it in front of them though.   It was made very clear that anything that could be considered as marketing to children will have severe repercussions to the industry as a whole.   I'd like to see the science behind the idea of "marketing to children".  It seems to me that at the most common ages to pick up habits like smoking(which for many it was to look older), could actually increase its appeal.  from my experience, at puberty ages, there can be a blowback against "childish things".. and "i'm too old for that"...and the same people will return to the nostalgia of those childish things when they get a bit older but between 16-23 or so, they avoid em. they have this need to be seen as an adult. and it feels good to bypass your age range, like to be able to see an r rated movie under 18. Everyone is how old to i look, wanting to look older.. they like to talk about their age as "nearly...the next age up" where the older you get the opposite sets in.  So I really wonder, since most start smoking in puberty i wonder how much cartoon advertising actually effected them.. positively to buy things. I'd rather be a marlboro man than a stupid cartoon camel.(i dont mind regulations so much, as long as they are based on science and not emotions, a lot of things we feel are true..like time/space... time feels shared and it just isnt.) There is a possibility that teens could see cigs/vaping as a definition of being an adult. Especially when you  force advertising to abandon anything that could be perceived as childish.. the exact same thing kids in puberty are doing as well.    sorry but it does. AGW is as much chemistry as it is physics.  From how we tell how much co2 comes from man.  to the long chain molecule break down of oils  to the various other chems we put in the sky and how they work.   to calculating past sun spots.. we look at CHEMICAL changes here on earth.  and sorry but someone with the crappiest science degree on the planet, is going to no more about science and how science works and the scientific method, and stats, and how stats work, and how experimenting works, and how peer review works, over someone who graduated in theology. or most other non science degrees.  yeah it doesnt matter as he probably hasnt done any work in the field of AGW and his degree is limited, but I think he can actually read technical papers and understand them and in that case, it isnt irrelavent at all.     sorry but someone with a science degree.. any science degree is going to understand the scientific method, and that the entire science of global warming didnt come from al gore.  Chemistry.. tell me my friend, the ozone layer,  does it effect AGW? what is destroying the ozone layer? what kind of process do we call that?  Also CO2 is one of the culprits of climate change. Why? Who might know things like the spectrum absorption properties of carbon? Who might operate a gas chromatograph.  no I doubt that hsi chemistry degree from 60 years ago, has anything to do with global warming...  but you do know the SCIENCE of global warming started with swedish chemist [Svante Arrhenius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius)  so sorry dude.  1. he is a scientists.  2. chemistry is vital in climate science.  3. all scientists are going to understand how science works and that it isnt a dart game that we all just vote on at the end of the year.       I was once in an arcade, friend of mine about 8 feet away tossed me a quarter, i missed, and it flew right into the slot of the game i was trying to play. Sorry no picts   yeah but the good news, the multi billionaire koch brothers who put a full page ad calling for the food stamp cuts while simultaneously lobbying for more benefits under the farming bill, can take home a little more this year. I was really starting to worry about them after not getting their keystone pipeline.  /s    Thats what encouraged this posting. Seems like he comes out all the time now.. and its worse because he's wrong. I bet like me you thought the game had updated and added a new factory, only to find out he is a lying bastard.    perktv live/ perk swipe the best.. non passive.  pop quiz the best passive.    a warning for what?  can we see a copy?  sorry to demand proof but there is a lot of BS constantly in the beermoney networks. people used to say you would get banned from bing if you cashed out from the same ip as you searched. In the nfo here, it said to not just watch app trailers or you might get banned. both total horseshit. So can i see the warning about perk pop quiz when you were totally within the terms of the TOS? (unless they changed it.. yes you can have 5 phones and run passively.. it would take 3 lines of code to prevent it)   can we see a copy of the email for ban reasons?  i find it more than hard to believe they would ban people for using their app within the terms of the TOS. Passively, so fucking what.. if they didnt want to allow people to do just that, all they need is a next button between questions.  crap even perktv they have "are you still watching".. nah if they wanted to stop passive behavior they could, there is zero reason to just ban people to do it. Crap have an 'are you still playing" every few hours.  So I am highly skeptical at these claims.      cant they set a flag after you have upgraded factories that yes you know that you can upgrade them. and whats bad is all my factories are nano.. but my population is right at 150k.. so when it goes up or down, that dude comes out and says i can upgrade when i cant.  and yes I know I am low on simoleons and yes i know i can upgrade residences to earn more.   the left wing side of religion tends to be more accepting. They often(though not necessarily in this popes case) think you are still going to hell, its just not their business in stopping you. the right is the opposite, which is why athiests tend to be worst than muslims to them.   waiting til asked is fine.. the point to the ID is the 1099 law, that once they pay you over 600, they have to send you a 1099 and one to the irs. for taxes.     yeah i have a trickle charger for the car i was going to see what it could do in full sun with cell charging.   every year   or like hedge fund managers who make an insane amount of money, simply hedging and taking percentages of others. They arent adding very much value to society even for those they work for, compared to compensation and they tend to pay the same tax rate as someone making 80k a year.. and sometimes less.  paulson who bet against the housing market right at teh crash, made 5 billion dollars, the most of anyone for 2008, he paid 15 percent on that.. where most ceos pay higher percent making less than 1/10 he did.    your point about him not spending money, somehow making the dollar more valuable simply isnt true. We dont just minus him off the m2 data.    at least a warning. Most large parking lots, especially healthcare areas.. like his ticket was from, where its kinda critical for people to get in in a hurry and less critical for them to get out in a hurry, they tend to have 'head in parking only'.  I wouldnt be surprised if that is common for all healthcare areas and not just here.   btw christians are chopping peoples parts off in africa, its just not as wildly reported. But Uganda, CAR, congo and other nations where people are often chopped up for being muslim or gay.   the opencandy sucks.  anime? eh, i'm going to have to disagree. I dont care how it dresses, just how it does the job. And sorry but in the past 35 years of computing, i have seen all kinds of retarded names and retarded designs..IDC as long as it gets the job done.     NOPE AND NOPE and dont listen to the guy about flagging..   using their software as intended will not get your banned.  I dont care how mania you are about it.  there is no scrutiny if you are following the rules.. dont care how big the redeams, or how fast, as long as it is possible under the rules.  Make sure they have your ID for tax reasons otherwise one day a reward will hang and wait for you to do just that.  ALLL THAT BEING SAID... its a good rule of thumb for all beermoney to cash out as quickly as possible.  Due to bannings, and project failures.. or hacks. But with that being said, i always cash out at 50 on perk wallet.    You phones cost about  25 cents a year each.

Think enigma.. why didnt we just tell the germans 'hey we cracked your code" and hope they move to a different form of communication.  i do think the other asset on the ground is plausable though unlikely, it would be a major gift, if they happened to post a picture at the same time.  i think it more likely the fact that this is a rare occurrence made the info not very valuable. And making the enemy look incompetent, is more valuable. Someone wanting to join the big battle against america, might think twice that isis is their answer.   sarcasm.. yeah poe says you need a /s and he didnt include a /s    making the enemy look like idiots can be more valuable.. and there probably hasnt been a rash of these, nor a rash to look forward to, so protecting this info isnt such a big deal. It would be different if every time they set up base they all took selfies. we wouldnt hear about that.   ALL religions have formed arround fictional chars.  unless you got a god in your pocket you can share with the crowd.  the point was the teacher... the prophet.. was real. or claimed to have been.. not someone in some far off heaven.  I still agree with you, that you dont need any reality to get people to follow.. NONE ZIP.. but the claim, isnt about the gods its about the teacher.(though it gets conflated with christanity as the teacher is a god)     i beggining to think we are arguing different points..(and I am in your camp but i think i figured what they are saying)   formed around and from him  I'm guessing they are saying jesus didnt have to be real.. because paul invented the religion.  not that it wasnt based on jesus and his teachings.  however I dont think that matters, since OP, was claiming "jesus is claimed to be real because people wont follow non existent teachers"(though muhammad tried just that.. it just didnt work out too well for him).. to me it doesnt matter if paul invented him or not.. paul is saying HE WAS A REAL PERSON.   with respect to OPs comment, not sure how people could form a religion that comes from jesus if he was imaginary. I mean jesus couldnt imagine himself into reality. meaning if it started with jesus... over paul well then of course jesus would be a real person. he started the religion. Since it DID start with paul, jesus still can be real or imagined.. but paul claimed he was real. So not sure what they are going on about, even if its not on the same ideas that we are going on about.      but the christ in christianity...., lets put it this way, whose teachings did paul promote?    No politician does anything 'for the good of the people.'  most, i would agree with you, but when you say NO.. then you are just in bullshit land. DO you think politicians arent people? Believe it or not some do do things for the people. Sorry dude but it is true. Yeah I am a pessimist too..and yeah corps have too much power, but you are going overboard.   This could be as simple Dems jumping off the teleco/cable train onto the tech train... but my guess is that it is probably worse than that.  dont be shy, expand.. what is YOUR GUESS.  and did you miss the two dems on the FCC split with weever and this was passed because the 2 republicans voted with weever. 3-2 AGAINST THE DEMS.  So please expand on how this is the dems jumping off teleco/cable and onto tech. when the dems opposed this and how this is "probably worse"   No politician does anything 'for the good of the people.'  yeah quoted twice, Strom thurmond(r) and I am very much a dem, actually personally helped me out after i got ran over by a drunk driver he got zero publicity. I saved over 80k but yeah. NO POLITICIAN EVER DID ANYTHING FOR ANYONE EVER FOR ANY ALTRUISTIC REASONS.  sorry dude they are shit, but they arent satan.     no thats the opposite of what dude is doing.  I'm not here to suck Obamas dick, but nor am I hear to burn him at the stake for being worse than dick chenney. Its not complex.    depends on the phone.. not all do that.   atm the opposite is more true, however wheeler has made it easier for competition to enter areas, so hopefully this will change.   actually yes, thanks obama, for appointing wheeler who turned out to not be satan and actually is doing great things for all of us. including this. See Mywifefoundmymain     yeah i had similar experiences.  I emailed them once to get an idea of their user base for a debate here, and they sent me a trouble shooting form letter.  I sent another letter making fun, and got another unrelated form letter.  our CS might even be automated.    well he had someone else in the car as well, so i would say no.. sounds like they are talking to someone else on the phone maybe.. but then say something assertively, followed by something else frantically. .. I'm guessing they got distracted by something.   not surprising with nations actually starting to talk about prosecuting deniers that know what the fuck they are doing.  we went after tobacco ceos under the rico act for constantly and knowingly lying about their own research findings into nicotine and addiction and cancer.

I will say this, this subreddit and well all of /r/beermoney  has a long history of inventing reasons people got banned. I dont doubt there have been mistake and unfair bans and perhaps this is the cause of some of the crockery but there has definately been some crockery. heck they used to say you would get banned if you only watched funny commercials or only teh app trailers.  I seriously dont think they will ban people for using their apps, any way you can use their apps, without using other programs, and going beyond device limits. Meaning click what ever button, watch what ever video.. as long as you arent cheating through automation, or more devices, it would not only be retarded for them to care, it would be hard to design an accurate system, of banning people relaly cheating versus kids losing their phones behind theri beds while playing perk pop quiz and crap.  they arent going to ban you for using theri apps,   5 phones per app, give them your id, no automation, no commercial skipping, upgrade when upgrades come(not an iron rule but a good one to follow) and you should be good.   yeah they are. And really its kinda a fact of life in business like this. Their CS on our side of the wall is going to suck balls. What do they care when such a small percentage of people they pay to.. have a problem.. they dont. CS on the advertisers side, is going to be stellar.  They will be able to ask about anything, dealing with ads.. sizes, codecs.. do they know how to convert into a form perk does like.. etc.. they are the perk income side.. our side is going to get a cursory glance and a form letter reply.

And I agree on phones being where the advertising is at.. just not that perk is more desirable or viable than tv, magazines.. etc.. yet..  of course I dont know what they charge and obviously they ARE GROWING.(that fact doesnt discount my previous comments, lots of pay to watch ad things grew in the late 90s, early 2000s only to die not long later)      wireless g maxes at 54 and drops off quick..   your probably not going to see much difference from changing the wifi wavelength.. 2ghz.. yeah it can hold more data but real world says not a lot of speed difference.   5ghz doesnt play well with 2gz  wifi can be seen as an art form to get it all done well and playing well.  I suggest you repost to /r/techsupport  for better help than /r/perktv   You dont need all that bandwidth and can save money by lowering it.  if you want to max out phones bandwidth.. which you DONT NEED as people have said.. you can get a rj45 adaptor that plugs into your phones OTG port.. and you can plug the phone WIRED into your router.. then phone will get as much speed as pc.    he is definitely [less terrifying than the last one](http://www.beverlycatholic.com/wordpress112614/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pope.jpg)      Not that their has to be a 'reason'(as oppose to cause) but do hair ears help the older individual at all? Its quite annoying that we lose hair were we want it and then it just starts coming out your nose and ears.. cant we transplant nose and ear cells to the top of my head to get some crazy fast growing hair?  I just havent found a good use decorative or not for my ear hair.    I think some of that anthropogenic stuff is more than damaging to science. By far most of the quantum crockery out there has to deal with that unfortunate term. "observe" when interact with is much better. And i bet most who understand the term, first heard it like everyone else, especially if they found out about it young. That the universe 'changed' simply because human eyes were looking at it.... or a gods. Like I have heard, things only happen on other planets cause god's eyes sees things and quantum theory says reality doesnt exist without eyes to see. And people with the most elementary knowledge of it all.. might at least know that unusual claims about "observation" in science and so the crock story sounds truish.  you change from observation to interacts with anything and suddenly the crocks dont have it so easy. they will still be there but science wont be helping them, just due to unfortunate terminology. (and evolution reporting is way worse, you'd think every species had yearly meetings to decide how to evolve and with a lot of thought, the giant stink plant decided to smell like bad meat to attract flies which it knew liked the smell of bad meat.. and the plant doesnt even have a sense of smell.. or a brain.. but it decided)  i know we are human and its natural to anthropomorphize and sometimes good to help people understand things, but often it can be more than misleading.   hmm maybe it is only after a few articles, like many. It def comes up and grays out the text.. try 3 articles i bet thats all it is.   it is gallup who did the survey.. and sorry its just as scientific as every poll out there. We have a good understanding of the people who wont take surveys.   And you know this is the same bullshit certain elements of the population use to refute all polls, despite they are well proven scientifically.   Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, nonresponse, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status (cellphone only/landline only/both, and cellphone mostly). Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population.  see thats why you see that crap at the end. they also have quotas for region and select based on the persons whose birthday was last in the house so they dont always get the most common phone users.  sorry dude, yeah i dont like it either, but that poll is accurate. And pray tell how else would you like us to judge? just ask you?      small newspapers are a good bet.  here is South carolina's [the state.](http://www.thestate.com/news/local/military/article22708890.html)  pretty sure you have to del 3 elements.. i already got my filter perm set. but this is exactly what is described.. both the pop up and the annoying gray crap.     it shouldnt, there is actually an option in ublock to leave the spot where the ad was, but by default that isnt enabled. By default it should work just like adblock just with more options in the options.  and less overhead.  ever go to a page and you cant scroll for a few seconds? thats normally abp blocking ads.. this is mainly what ublock fixes.     for the 'you got to have an id to get cold medicine crowd', you'd think this would sell. But at last i suspect the same people will say making them have insurance is pure evil and against the second amendment when it says "A well REGULATED Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."   red herring, no where in the article do they claim insurance caused teh decline of accidents by itself.  and they tend to listen to neither, which is when government steps in and  tell them to add things like seat belts.. which people prefer not to wear, but the seat laws have actually saved us all money because there is a socialized cost to accidents.  at any rate, while I totally agree, insurance is not the sole cause for the decline in accidents while our roads have gotten busier and busier.. but do you contend that it doesnt help?     why wouldnt this be allowed? its not an exploit? I dont think we have to check every app we download.. just things like frep.   42% of us citizens believe in a purely creationist view.   it gets worse.  only [19% believe in scientific evolution.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx)  partially because they get elected to office and scream evolution is just a theory and people see these high level people who dont believe and think thats just fine and dandy.  (yeah 50% believe in evolution, which a majority of those believing in god guided evolution, which is like saying you belive the mouse found the cheese but god gave him directions through the maze.. ie science doesnt actually exist..it doesnt work if you have an outside element that can violate the laws of the universe at will)   It also doesnt include their fav.. fines and fees. That also go up way faster than inflation.. and often disguises the true increase in costs. When I went to college one year not only did all the fines and fees go up and we added a new few.. but they shortened the max time on meter parking to make sure we all got more tickets.    not so many R's up there.  Have to wonder why rand always wears one.  Yeah yeah yeah money, elections.. but bernie doesnt wear the D.. so why does rand wear the R?    I think you know when the title says climate change it means AGW.  and I am sure they do as well when polled.   you see a very similar comment in /r/climateskeptics who get tired of being called deniers.. "we believe in climate change, just that man has nothing to do with it".. and they are just trying to befuddle the debate.  and looking at your comments on cap and trade and gore, makes me more than wary about your comment. and while I dont want this comment to branch off into politics, you do know we successfully cap and traded so2 and that al gore didnt invent it and wasnt the driving force behind pushing the idea.     yeah but this isnt baylor, this is the [college of faith, which isnt even a school, its a church.](http://www.sbnation.com/longform/2015/2/18/8039515/college-of-faith-profile).. the ONLY POINT, is to inject religion into sports. Thats their point of existing.. is to evangelicalism in sports. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.. while i would totally agree and defend you 99% of the time, this isnt one of those times.   because you didnt learn.  What baffles me is you want us to say you learned biology when you didnt.   so what if you outperformed.. and you are still conflating the idea that your education had something to do with that and not your status.  The point is your friends who all out performed people at public school.. probably would have out performed them getting a proper education AT a public school.  the fact yall harp on this idea, without looking at what the science says is the cause, shows yall need more science education.  its the same shit that right wingers do when they look at crime reports for minorities. Yeah the science is true, problem is yalls interpretation.  Which proves you need more work in science.  and op said science diploma, not hs diploma and yeah it doesnt exist, but yeah if a college asked, it should be stated that you did NOT in fact learn the basics of biology. I dont care how bad that makes you feel. you didnt learn it. You fail. You dont get an A. Self esteem be damned. you didnt learn the subject. PERIOD.     so you should get a diploma with zero knowledge of math, as long as you major in phys ed in college.  sorry your still wrong./  Besides a HS diploma from a christian school is actually probably a lot better than one from a shit inner city school where they just push students through.  and proving it time and time again, with yalls fake shit science.  here is some fake shit science right back at you.  I went to a private school.. as long as your parents paid, you got a B. Parents donated, you got an A.. I transferred to one of those POS 'inner city" schools and found out I actually had to do my homework and earn my grade. Does my one experience say anything about the true state of education? No? Nore does your horse shit unsupported science that wants to pretend the reasons why private schools do better has something to do with them and not other common factors.. like income   we have a basic skills test that if you fail, you dont graduate.  it doesnt matter if you PASSED every biology test. If you fail the final you dont graduate.  and yeah that includes specifics.  and colleges double check that shit when you apply. and will force you to relearn science if you dont know science.    he didnt say HS diploma  and we mainly dont need to pass evolution basic skills test due to the rabid right wingers.  because evolution is basic to  a fuck ton of science, not just evolution.    first he didnt say HS diploma.. he said SCIENCE.  second you are wrong.  if you were taught, fucked up math all your life. 1 +2 = 4.. we should just pass you and say you knew math cause it wasnt your fault? We dont give out diplomas just to make you feel good. its supposed to represent what you know.  and its not a huge bad thing, you just should have to take HS science again in college. MUCH LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE BAD AT MATH HAVE TO TAKE HS MATH IN COLLEGE ALL THE FUCKING TIME.  as for the bullshit about intelligence, this is one of the reasons YOU NEED A REFRESHER ON SCIENCE. See you are ignoring all the other variables that also tend to come with home schooling. Like ECONOMIC STATUS. yeah kids that can eat well can study well. And kids whose parents can afford them things like chemistry sets, encyclopedias and nice computers, well they tend to do better as well. Your problem is your taking a single stat, and putting a cause to it, which is NOT SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED AT ALL.  and even if you do "come out more intelligent".. it doesnt fucking matter. If you dont know math, you dont know math, we shouldnt say YOU DO.. and if you dont know science you dont know science, we shouldnt say you do. I DONT GIVE A FUCK HOW KNOWLEDGEABLE you are in other areas.  **YOU FAIL AT SCIENCE, YOU SHOULD HAVE TO RETAKE REMEDIAL SCIENCE.**  it has nothing to do with being mean.. it doesnt matter it wasnt your fault. SORRY But thats the facts. Saying you know a subject or dont, has fucking shit to do with being mean to you.     thanks and quality post.  reminds about code, gives  answer and shows the link   we just gutted our mental health funding.. got to pay for those losing gay marriage and abortion lawsuits.    yeah part of the reduction is husband sending car back home after he gets to work.. but i think it will be much much higher. There will be less influence to take that first plunge, and so less influence to be addicted to owning your own vehicle. And without a driver, you gain privacy.. you can talk about the dirty crap your friends are into without worry.. you can listen to your own music as loud as you want. People love to buy kids cars for college, it makes you feel good, and that your child doesnt have to depend.. and wont be stuck.. BUT I WOULD FEEL SAFER with the robot cars. My kid wont drunk drive.. he will be safe. Why buy him a car? I'm getting him an uber robot cab card...  no maintenance, no insurance and you can get the car you need when you need, or pickup truck or suv, or w/e  lowes,and walmart will deliver, amazon will be dropping toilet paper off by drones.   and in major cities your going to see a 5 minute max cab time with robot cars... its not going to be a couple times a day.. its going to be when you want it... it will be there. Heck and it will be smart and start to just come before you even call it. It knows you like to go out on fridays at 8.. so it will have a car close at 8.      idk, its odd, maybe credit card reform, its harder for under 21 to get one and they def want one.. maybe they just more used to problems with the under 21. There was a lot of this at myrtle.    thats actually what his 'fleet' looks like. If you notice at teh start there are at least 2 of those vans with the exact same shitty spray paint job... i'm guessing the creepy dangerous ice cream van was the look he was going for. or looking at his route they might have been going for the "please dont rob the ice cream dude, look at how broke we are" look.     they are starving the beast in the states as well.  my town cut mosquito control and cut funding to mental health right when they are struggling as it is. but we sure can always find money to throw at losing social problems.   Look i support the dudes that defend us.. and that get shot at so I dont have to. I even support the dudes that go to our wars of aggression, its not their fault.. but i have a huge problem with making them into special saints.  why is this soldier better than a 20 year old who works soup kitchens? I'm not thinking he would get a state wide appology  it shouldnt matter if you are rich or poor, a soldier or a hood rat. It is dangerous concept to think some people in society should be risen above the rules for everyone else. And yeah that includes me..    that said, if we feel our kids are old enough to go to war, there really isnt anything they arent old enough to do.        it looks like they banned at least one dude for staying on 2.3  well he might have rolled back. He claimed the only other  suspicious app was a perk point tracker. Just an FYI for those who try to nickle and dime theri way to higher income.   me i changed my passes.  you can also disable auto updates in he playstore.   to keep working   I prefer [brain games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRo8TytvIDw)  Its actually based on science and not ideology.     yeah thats the problem with bullshit, the well is infinite. You see the same in creationism, where as soon as you prove how one thing evolved, they simply shift the bar. not attacking you because they is the first thought that most should have on this debunking.   It does 'work', based on slight involuntary movements.. it can feel creepy, and people swear by it. to prove they are wrong blindfold the people playing. suddenly teh 'spirits' cant see.   and people say stopping one drop from a tub is meaningless.. 1 since drop isnt even an oz, and a tub is 50 gallons or more. Stopping a single drop is completely useless and meaningless.. right? drop after drop can over flow a tub, stopping drop after drop can prevent this.  Let me guess you dont believe in it anyways. Right? or you do believe man is the cause but man cant do anything about it. Am I correct? or pray tell, what is yoru solutions besides drill baby drill? all we hear from right wingers is what is the wrong ideas, and the only ideas they offer of theri own, is increasing the us of carbon and cutting taxes for the richest of us. Thats it. nothing ever else but complaints.    and beeno for cows will be invented.   what a crap article.  You can guess the coming spin from Team Hillary: U.S. military exports have been booming under Obama for years, and not just to Clinton Foundation donors. Theres an Obama arms bazaar going on, said one arms-control expert back in 2011. The next year, Obama set a record for weapons shipments to the Middle East. The year after that, after Hillary had left State, he relaxed military export controls further by shifting some of States duties to approve weapons deals over to the Commerce Department, which could be more flexible in approving sales to nations with dubious human-rights records. After adjusting for inflation, wrote arms-control wonk William Hartung last month, the volume of major deals concluded by the Obama administration in its first five years exceeds the amount approved by the Bush administration in its full eight years in office by nearly $30 billion.    'you can hear hilary now, muttering the truth about how this has gone on before and after her"  well yeah.. thats what I would do when someone makes a  horse shit accusation  also there is a bit of trouble discussing teh volume of arms sales .. when talking in DOLLARS, 10 years after another comparison. Unless those dollars are adjusted for inflation, its a horse shit comparison.. just like "larges budget ever'  thats shits going to happen, in a country with an ever growing economy, and growing population.  anyways horse shit article.  plenty to dislike about hilary, still the entire right wing field is like hilary on steroids... but you have to wonder why the right love to live in bullshit land, rather than find legitimate problems.    they are a well dedicated and very loud army and far more organized than the GOP.. which i know is hard to believe but it is true. They are just a much smaller group. but part of you downvote problem is reddit started off as a libertarian homeland before the /r/politics "shifted left"(no where but the US would /r/politics be considered left but hey thats where most of us are, so i accept the claim)  but yeah we both will be downvoted to hell.. even my comments pointing out that the email problem isnt a hilary problem but a government one.. Or my comment showing that 60% of dems voted against the patriot act. you would think that private loving libertarians would acknowledge and praise that.. and maybe do what i do and then point out why you dont like their policies like i do with libertarians but no they just downvote and deny.    I like his stance on privacy and war.... which are both liberal ideals(sorry just look at voting history)  but he always wears an R?  Its dems alll over hte country legalizing, fighting the GOP the whole way. it is dems who dont want boots on the ground, fighting the gop the whole way.. AND IT WAS DEMS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE PATRIOT ACT.. AND AGAINST OBAMAS REQUEST TO RENEW IT.. and fighting the gop the entire way  and yet this guy wears an R on his sleave  its almost like he doesnt care about all those things he runs on.  its almost like his main cares are low taxes and low regulation which are the forte of the GOP.  but he always runs on pot, anti war, and anti spying WHICH IS THE LIBERAL ARM OF LIBERTARIANS.    actually the MAJORITY of dems voted against extending the patriot act UNDER OBAMA.  how [can yall love privacy and not know that 60% of dems voted against renewing it under Obama and it only passed because 60% of right wingers voted for it.]9http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/376)  infact you seem to believe the OPPOSITE OF REALITY.    really? really? and this guy got this main upvotes? disappointed in this sub. One it shows how hyper libertarian biased yall are, despite there is a dem fighting for privacy rights.  Nothing hilary did was unusual or against the law.  the federal records act was never properly updated for modern times.  The people in government are ALLOWED to use theri own servers.  the people in government only have to back up government business.  THE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT WITH THE EMAIL ARE THE SOLE ARBITRATORS ON WHAT IS GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.  it is why the irs was missing emails, [but is is also why bush and chenney, who ran their email through RNC headquarters was also missing his emails.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy)  and why bill clinton and gore were missing emails.  it has to do with a fucked up law.. and absolutely nothing at all to do with hilary or left or right.   Seriously drop the hyper bias your ruining the point to this subreddit. Want to be political go to /r/libertarian /r/conservatives /r/progressives or /r/politics    keep that shit out of here or fuck this place  now notice.. i pointed out from BOTH SIDES.  And[ if you want a clue about the real problem.. read this](http://www.zdnet.com/article/irs-scandal-ludicrous-claims-about-missing-government-emails-been-there-done-that/)  because only knowing the REAL PROBLEM.. can you effect change.. pretending the problem is with one single indivual who if they dont get in gov then the problem isnt there.. is just plain ignorant and yall upvoted the fuck out of ignorance.  yeah the place is fucked but the law is what needs changing.    **YOU NEED TO KNOW REALITY TO CHANGE IT AND THE REALITY IS IT IS THE LAW, NOT HILARY.**  but I am quite sure the ignos will downvote this bipartisan proof that this is a fact. And show how totally worthless this subreddit is, if it is just going to be a campaign headquarters for rand and ignore all the other people who arent rand who are also fighting for privacy.      [BoOOoOoo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/f3/5c/65f35c1d022f81091b532a7a181cc97e.jpg)   my crappy zingers which i have been using for a longer period.. dont have any burn. Dont know why the moto-s do, but they are also refurbs so they might be pretty old.  and it is a great idea to run these phones dimmed and with as little else running... I had been but when i upgraded to loli i didnt put them dim again.    these were the befrugals.. got them for only  $5 and with referals, I was basically paid to keep the phones. They are nice as hell. Never crash on quiz, very skippy.. but of course the burn problem.    well on the 2 of mine that have it reboots do nothing.  1 that is really bad, i left off for days. it gets a bit warmer than the rest.. dont know if that could make the burn in last longer. But nope that didnt work for me. And if you look at the links in my other comments you will see that doesnt work for a lot of people.. hence the apps.  but thats for the advice, turning it off and on again.. its almost like the first rule of IT.  :P      Tried a few burn in apps. Burn fix seems good as you can take a picture of what burned you and invert it and use that as part of the fix..  but easier seems to be to invert the colors in android settings and just running the app that burned you.   also, turning down brightness and contrast will help the burn.. and battery life.    nope they do.  there are plenty of screen burn fix apps.  i can see the panda and a list of answers to the quiz and the spinning circle.  [other people claim the same as me](http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoG/comments/2d3b7q/motog_screen_burn/).. and other people claim the same as you.  but nope this is pretty strong burn.  and the fact is, no matter what anyone says, AMOLED does burn.. [here is a video of screen burn on an AMOLED.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h98u1DzuS8)   and [here is a picture of the burn in.. i got rid of the panda mostly using an inverted panda.. going to invert the question list and spinning donut to get rid of the rest.](http://i.imgur.com/xSSY9OG.jpg)  so this is proof positive that what people hear about amoled, is full of shit. It is MUCH HARDER TO BURN but the fucker does burn :P   and [more on AMOLED burn in.. seems to be the samsung version is causing th most issues.](http://www.recovery-android.com/screen-burn-in-of-your-android-smartphone-fixed.html)     I guess you know you perk too much when you can see the panda on dark scenes in movies and apps. My moto gs starting to develop burn from the perk quiz.      they had to the gap was too big when they took out the two women.         not easily.. I mean you could set up different account for each.. or run one at a time.  or use network monitors and monitor the video gets.  you coudl set them all to say funny videos.. as simultaneously as possible and then monitor bandwidth.. after an hour you should be able to tell which ones are a bit slower.  but basically your asking someone to build a system which hasnt been built yet.. so there are no options just ideas that havent been realized yet.   	199
 The newest form of currency in the [drug game](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1cpfkr/)   While doing a line of coke   Ditto for NYC subways as well      I have a hard time believing this type of drug would sell well in NY, especially in Meatpacking.  Most people out here love blow, molly, drugs that cost $. Krokodil is poor man's shit, gives you a dirty high.     I'm a minority, been called every name in the book.  Do I give a fuck?  No.  Should you either?  No.  I can't tell you what to do, but if this sort of stuff gets to you then you need to toughen up.  Sorry to put it this way, but your living in "their" neighborhood.  Most of us are temporary residents of NYC, after 5-10 years we leave.  These guys are lifers, they're not going anywhere, so get used to this shit.     If he comes back in the post season, we're lucky.  Other wise, I wouldn't expect much   Look I get it, drivers can be ruthless.  I drive everyday in this city and try not to block the box, but when you need to move out of on coming traffic there's not much you can do.  The car in front can move as much as possible, but the Times Sq area is a cluster.  Unless you have driven that area, its almost impossible not to break laws.      Cheers, I've used that one as well as firstrowsports, but wanted the HD viewing this go around   I live on the East Coast and don't have cable/satellite, but I saw that League Pass is offered thru Apple TV.

Brooklyn kitchen offers awesome classes such as doughnut making, pizza and pasta, and legit Japanese    We need an identity whether on D, or the run game. Tonight it comes out   What's happening with our O line?  It's as if they took a step back this year.   There needs to be more accountability    Captain chekdown   The flip side is most of the people that come to NYC only stay for a few years, maybe 10 tops.  Although there is a constant rotation of in/ out, the native folks get the short end.    I told this to someone earlier, although I may claim NY as my home, home is really the people that have roots here.  Those folks likely won't be leaving this city, and it's not by choice.  This realization made me become way more tolerant of this city and of the people.  .     This past week, there's been 2 Alex Smith threads.  I wish the mods could regulate this more, it's ridiculous to even mention him this season.     Looks like some good yay being passed around   B/C there's a bunch of Alex Smith fanboys that are dying to talk shit   Sushi of Gari is pretty good   Wonder if this is also the Super Bowl hangover   It's useless, so many Smith fanboys trolling.     shady transactions go down nightly in this city, i really doubt there's a website to bust out people    Remember it's a whole season, and my gut tells me there is a whole arsenal of the "O" coming.  We're only on Chapter 1.     It's not even like that.  You got a QB out there (Kap) bustin his tail and one of top threads I see is a request for Alex Smith's wins.  That's classless.  Why not put a countdown, for Aldon Smith for single season sack record?  A player that's actually on our team.    The fact that thread got upvoted is ridiculous.  This summer alone I saw 4 Smith threads, which shows fans aren't over it still.  In fact, 1 Redditor even made the claim, "Alex Smith is still one of us"   I question the Smith fans. Straight UP.     This might not be the best comparison, but this reminds of how Miami used to play New England when the Pats were at their best.  Miami just played them physical and had their # a bunch of times.  I see a similar trend with the Rams as well.  Both the Rams and Hawks will always be a challenge to us.     This is a 49ers sub reddit.  If you really feel that it's necessary to put up a ex teammates win column, go make your own sub reddit.  It's classless IMO.    I asked this b.c something similar happened to my friend in CA.

Bad on them for not realizing the type of clientele they were serving.     Just curious, what charges are you going to be pressing other than to cover the paint job?   Are you going to a actual HTC?  If not, you need to go asap.  Don't bother with the local hospitals with matters like this   So a couple years back I talked to this guy who used to frequent Ibiza alot.  He said in Europe, people roll but never to the point of being on the floor and needing to be taken care of.  He noticed how in America, the young ravers would go overboard with their consumption.

Buttermilk ranch is crackalicious also   One of the best and most legit Carnitas posts on here.  Kudos   Donner Party part deux   This coming Aug, my family has decided to do a Yosemite trip.  My 2 biggest concerns is my 4 y.o nephew, and mom who can walk but not much (1-2 hours tops)  That being said, can people recommend reasonable hikes and places to check out without it being too strenuous.  Also, what are some good hotels within a 45 min drive outside of Yosemite?  It seems as though most are inside (all booked) our they're super far like 1 hr 30 min (Oakhurst, Coarsegold). Is there something in between?     Try mixing this with a splash of sesame oil, bunch of green onions, and soy sauce till paste gets to a sauce consistency.  Great for grilling chicken, lettuce wraps, etc   The wife is Japanese, this couldn't have been more spot on.  My personal fav is the time she tried spelling guacamole.  Came out Wakamole   Serious Eats [agrees](http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2013/07/where-to-eat-best-chinese-food-new-york-nyc.html?ref=pop_serious_eats_new_york)   Hotel management.  You learn everything from culinary to hospitality, and with so many hotels opening these days, there's a huge demand for it.     USA   As much as I appreciate his strength, at the end of the day it's a dance.  Too many bboys these days are all about the powermoves and have lost the basic footwork.  I might be biased because I'm Japanese, but I dig this [guy]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSpsvX829EI).     Beans and rice, basic salad and add cilantro   Klay IMO hasn't deserved the automatic green light, and at times he"ll shoot us into or out of a game.  I'm sure this summer he's working his arsenal or new shots.  But in the meantime,  coming off the bench would give him the confidence   But there could still be a sign+trade with Iggy and Bogut.  I have a feeling our F.O is up to something big   Damn is Barnes all but gone?     Barnes post game on the low block looked eerily familiar to Kobe's.  And yes, I would be pissed if we lose Barnes to LA and Kobe takes him under his wing and grooms him to be a superstar      wonder if this is the same [guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded v=ffDPTKn7HiY#at=58)    NSFW   Well put, but easier said than done.  Especially when you grow up around hood life and do gangster shit, your associates are still bad influences.     I came across this [list](http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=107 pid=33 gid=000076)   My friend David teaches Kung fu at Columbus park.  7 Am weekdays, 8 am weekends.  Go towards the back of the park across from the police station.  Its pay what you can.  I'll prob start going back now that its warm.  Inbox me for more details.  He's a awesome teacher   did you really post your IQ???  hey i know, lets have a spelling contest!  better yet, lets see who can type faster.  jeesus you must be Internet Tough Guy of the year.  now go back to your mom's basement.  we'll be waiting for your next fuckin pathetic response.  dying to hear what you got to say    he's a dumbshit, anyone that tries to flex their IQ and claim they made money of their "football IQ" is a fucking moron.  your response was well written, better than how I would've put it.     you ever try soaking the corn in water before grilling?  read somewhere it gets the corn even juicier   Couldn't agree more.  There are sushi restaurants that have lost clientele because the chef has left.  It's because the chef had a following, and they were consistent in taste, service, etc.    So a quick story to share.  Hanging out in the e. village, and a buddy of mine had to go to BofA to withdraw cash.  This was on a weekday early afternoon.    Ahead in line were a couple of young grungy looking kids, no big deal.  They leave, and we're up next.  Both kids leave their ATM receipt behind.  Curious me goes and picks up their receipt to peak.  Low and behold both kids savings account was over 400K.  Now I'm not generalizing that all young cats in NY are trust fund kids, but that day confirmed just the ridiculous amount of wealth that people in NY are running around with.     Why the fuck are you this board?  Are you a fan?  See it's fans like yourself that post messages above that display zero knowledge of the game.  The fact you're hung up on him thinking he lost us the game shows your a newbie.  GTFO   There was a cyclist in Britain that almost qualified [Alex Dowsett](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/olympics/4356058/Alex-Dowsett-has-beaten-a-bleeding-condition-to-compete-for-Olympic-cycling-slot.html)     Thanks guys I'll let you know what I come up with.  Might try to be Rasputtin!   Hey guys+gals, the California camp is coming up next week and I'm desperately in need of a costume idea.  The theme we are incorporating this year is Hereo's.  It can be whatever you'd like it to be, but I was hoping to incorporate some kind of hemophilia twist to it.  Any ideas, suggestions?     Like to see this guy's opinion on what he thinks are the best bars   He's a defensive genius.  Took the hornets and made them a solid defensive team, made the cavs a lot more respectable.  No coincidence the warriors D got way better te last 2 years    Next time add some Guiness instead of water.  The bitterness takes the edge of the saltiness, and the alcohol makes the corn beef super tender   My dad sometimes will take some strips and will char it over the stove for a few seconds.  Also, some bars will serve with Kewpie Japanese Mayo as a dipping sauce.     Blue Owl also has great live jazz on Sundays, as well as awesome hip hop on Thurs.     Start smoking pot      La Quinta INN Hotel, in Ktown.  You get a great view of the Empire State, big patio and good priced drinks.  Plus you can get smashed and bomb on some Korean BBQ after.    Instead of forking over 20.00 for the Empire, go to La Quita in on West 32nd St Koreatown.  Awesome rooftop bar that sits directly next to the Empire State so you can see pretty well.     Upon landing in Oakland, you get welcomed with a nice fat joint.  And then the plane would do a side show on the run way   It's a double edged sword with Lee.  In all his years, whenever he's forced to play center, he doesn't do well match up wise and #'s wise.  However, stick a center next to him and he flourishes.  Less pressure off him to perform, plays decent weakside D, and gobbles tons of boards due to the Center boxing out.  I still think you keep him next year, but wouldn't be surprised if we trade mid way next year, especially if we're not doing good as a team   yeah it's a weird japanese veggie thing.  my aunt does the same every morning with a salad of some sort.     I can go with porridge and fish, but natto has always been too hardcore for me.     this team reminds me of how OKC grew up right before our eyes.  they built a team thru a solid draft as well, and had a few tough years in the playoffs before fully blossoming   Each time I open these "meals from around the world" it's been totally inaccurate.  Japanese do not eat tofu regularly for breakfast.     Oh lemme clarify, an Alex Smith homer.  Are you a fan of this team?  Because the way you criticize Kaep and Harbs, why the fuck are you on this message board?  Stick by team thick and thin..But wait, a newbie such as yourself, you wouldn't know that.    You display zero knowledge of the game, and it's obvious you can't get enough of Alex's dick.  Wait till week 3 next year when Alexis will be getting booed off the field.  I'll be waiting to hear your excuse then.  "Oh it's because the Chiefs have no O line, he has no weapons"  GTFO kid   So in other words, you know more than Harbaugh.  Yeah chew on that   Ball don't lie.  Don't be so quick to jump at #'s, they don't mean shit, especially in a game that counts i.e Championship Game (down by 2 TD's) or going into New England and outgunning Tom Brady.    The fact your still hung up on thinking Kap lost the game shows your pretty blinded and homer.     There was a similar story I read a year ago about a chinese guy that kept his dead gf in his apt well after she passed.  He even blogged about it I believe and posted pics.  Her pic was way more disturbing   its shiso leaf, one of the most underrated herbs imo.  if it's available in your area, highly recommend   It's called HDR Camera, you can find it in the play store.     thanks...there's actually a pretty cool HD camera app for samsung galaxy that works remarkably well   it's what he wanted as his going away party.  i told him he didn't have to, but its his way of saying goodbte   eesh i wish!  pretty tough to find thesedays   if they are anything like air burgers, i can relate.  they suck as well   this is why comments above irk me on this subreddit.  people are dogging the inari pic simply because of a tiny condiment which wasn't even squeezed onto the piece.    folks are so quick to dismiss/disect anything that they don't feel is legit, when in fact the chef was born n raised in japan and made everything from scratch.     yeah he's a minimalist, lets the ingredients do the talking   NYC, but both chef and I are from Japan   im not following your drift. source:japanese as well   Good queston.  He trained a little in Japan, then while going to art school in Philly he worked at a few different joints.  But then his art really took off and stopped cooking.    The last 3 years in NYC whenever he had free time we would get together and have these massive feasts.  His art work is just as amazing, and it shows whenever he makes food.  Inserting shameless plug [here](http://tadashimoriyama.com/) for his work   No worries, after 3 shots of whiskey, it dawned on me that aerial view was the way to go.     You are spot on about a quality rice cooker.  My wife and I dropped 300.00 on a bad ass rice cooker in Japan.  Granted this thing has tons of functions, (induction heating, slow cooker, porridge, etc) but it was shocking to see how crazy in price these things get.    On the hother hand, my mother in law is old school and uses a pressure cooker.  Her rice always is perfectly cooked.     Store bought unagi, you can find it at the asian market.  Forewarning that there is a major Unagi shortage happening around the world, and the price has skyrocketed.  This past winter in Japan, I paid close to 40 bucks for a unagi bento.  Granted it was wild, and delicious, but still bank   Sadly this will be one of my final meals from him, since he's moving cross country.     I'll start from the top row, left to right.    Unagi (bbq eal), Inari (fried tofu pouches) stuffed with Shrimp  Cucumber roll stuffed with salmon, shrimp, salmon roe  Avocado Roll, Octopus nigiri, California Roll, Squid Nigiri  Cucumber Roll   One thing I've learned in my years browsing reddit.."never stick your dick in crazy"      It's soba noodles, pretty un typical for Japanese.  The rolls however are legit.  Sorry that's all the shots we had   Sashimi in the pic= Salmon, Yellowfin Tuna, Hamachi, Tuna tartare with green scallion    Veggies= Shiso leaf, avocado, cucumber  	113
 First time since the dust bowl   That's what I've been doing. I tried to use TurboTax this year and it felt like I was doing it wrong the whole time so, I sent my forms over to a CPA      Same face I still make buying condoms   Never said he wasn't an asshole, it's just nice to see them still contributing after the fact.       Good to know. I was being indecisive over the omega and pstriot rda's. If you have a chance, grab a nimbus, drill it out and replace the screws. The well isn't super deep but it seems to work really well with a .65ohm dual coil setup for clpud chasing   Yeah, you can totally just adjust it or call it a loss of $8. But, if you remeber, lemme know how they turn out   How are the omega and patriot clones? I have a nemesis with a nimbus clone that I widened the air holes that works great. Got em both from slowtech.   So. Amazing.   Epic. Just epic.   Hashtag bloodmoney?    Wasn't sure which way you were going but the triple R works pretty well, I think.  	13
 Icon Pack?    And launcher preferably. Also, are the quotes part of the wallpaper?   Good point!  I will try this,  thanks!   Thanks so much :) I'll try to bring my laptop but no guarantees.   I just finished day 2 of insanity (yes, I'm a newbie) but I've run into a problem. I'm travelling this weekend and I definitely won't be able to do insanity. Would it be acceptable if I just did some cardio (treadmill, elliptical) at a gym for the 2 days, or is this going to affect my progress.  Thanks!   Shots.   I use reddit now :)   I might be of some help   I'm in! I have samples of my voice on YouTube.com/tanyacovers   Definitely, it worked for me weeks after.  	9
 Am I the only one that notices Voat's logo is a Goat?   Do you even know anything about him?      Everyone here is going to talk about the seasons/weather, so I will just say get ready for traffic.  You said Lowell, which is a former mill town north west of Boston.  There's a University there and a couple community colleges holding the city together IMHO.  Not much of a nightlife unless you call banging down bud lights with your bros until 2 in the morning a nightlife.  Sure there are concerts and whatnot like any city.  I guess you just have to move here and check out the scene.  But be prepared for poverty, drug use (especially heroin), a lot of crime.   That's what they are looking into.  Obviously she lied to just about everybody, she got so used to lying, she thought it was true   Some 'merricun would shoot em         I've read it but thanks   Adam Kokesh lol   um no   4Th Reich.   You should read "Lennon" the biography of John Lennon.  He couldn't read music either.  But he wrote some of the most important rock tunes of the history of music.  His first instrument was the 5 string banjo.  A lot of people don't know that.  His mom played one.  He always wanted a guitar, but both his mom and his Aunt forbade him from becoming a musician because of his loser dad (a professional cruise ship musician).     Really?  When I clicked on it, my antivirus software said it was a phishing page      At least take the time to vote him the fuck out of office!   Yan Yan.                   don't click the link.  it's phishbait   Satan did it. The earth is only 6,000 years old Noah was real.  He was 600 years old when he built the ark. The Rapture is coming soon.   for the record, so is this subreddit.   Voat rhymes with Stoat and tastes like Goat   He had a really interesting life story also.  I think I read that he was shipwrecked and the only one who could swim.  He made it to shore alive with his flute!!   I call it chutzpah   It's slow, but it works.  Every time.    You've probably heard about one of our great musical historians, Chief O'Neil of Chicago.  Right?  He was an incredible dude.  Seriously.  He couldn't read music, but he remembered melodies by "rehearsing" them over and over in his head like you or I "rehearse" addresses or telephone numbers.  He would follow people around on street cars in the city, listen to the tunes they were singing or humming and go back to his office where a colleague who could write music wrote them down.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_O'Neill         hum the song, find the note using your finger on the fretboard and work from there.  that's how I do it, that's how most people do it.  a lot of composers use that method on the piano also   It'll be great for their meeting next year         http://dinnerinthesky.com/      Just got off kakao with my sister-in-law.  She was at Samsung hospital for an ear operation.  She said the hospital is dead, like a morgue.  Nobody coming and going...like one of those end of the world zombie movies or something   How can you play mandolin if you don't know chords or the notes of a melody?  Serious question.   fear theater...runs our military industry   The are great.  "Soft" like flat-wounds, loud, brilliant sounding, but well balanced.                Every time I go into the Korean market, I see racks and racks of cassette tapes, cds and dvds behind the counter, obviously bootlegs of tv shows and movies.  Obviously illegal   Curt Mangan strings are the best, and yes, his mandola strings are awesome         So what is the delay now?  Why haven't these 28 pages been released yet?   great a shaky night-time video this is the 21st century...wtf   bbut jet fuel melts steel beams!   This is from last year.  why does it say 6/12/15?      Duckface   Mexian?  Asican?   Their names are pretty funny though   My wife likes to read "romance novels" in Korean.  I usually ignore them, but one day she left one open and for kicks I ran it through Google translate.  All I can say is wow.  There was pretty much no romance involved.      aka Penelope Lopez, is not asian         I'll never forget my first interaction with a homosexual man in Korea.  He said that there are no gays in Korea.  I asked him what he was.  He said "I'm very friendly"   spider legs            Theater.  Oh well, they had to do something                     No idea.  Can't find anything in reverse image search   Is that the fat dude everybody hates?   I think Rogue is fine for a starter mando.  You can "upgrade" to an Eastman once you've saved a bit more   That was a fat hand   CP   Looks like a laundry rack   That's awesome   the former diggers who became redditors are fleeing to voat.  frankly, I'm glad to see them go.  Maybe once they are gone, reddit will return to its former glory.   Seriously voat is bad.  You can't vote on voat   PAO comes from the chinese name Bao  Last name origins   meanings:  Chinese: there are three different surnames that are Romanized in pinyin as Bao. Other Romanizations include Bau, Pao, and Pau. Chinese:  this character also means abalone, but the name comes from an old place name. The area of Bao was granted to a chief counselor of the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (722481 bc). His son took the place name as his surname and was called Bao Shuya. Bao Shuya was famous for his lofty moral character and was skilled at delegating authority, eventually becoming the first Chief King of the Spring and Autumn period.  Chinese:  this Chinese character means to wrap or package. The name is derived from the name of Shen Baoxu. Shen Baoxu was a senior official who lived 2500 years ago in the state of Chu. When the state of Chu was attacked by the state of Wu, Shen Baoxu went to the State of Qin to beg for aid. There, he reportedly cried for seven days and nights until the duke of Qin was moved to help rescue the state of Chu.  Chinese:  this character means (violently) sudden. It comes from the name of Bao Xingong, a duke during the Yin dynasty (14011122 bc).   I don't like voat because you can't downvote until you have 100 comment karma   Hubski is down.  Must be getting slammed with requests.   I lived in China for six months (Shenyang's Korea Town) during the height of the SARS fear.  Same thing: everyone wore masks.  Actually they wear them now for the pollution      Well, I am an MD here in the states.   Does this constitute harassment?  If so, you're helping further the case for banning our subreddit   Second it   ha ha ok   My wife's family is in Seoul.  She talks with her sisters every day over KaKao.  She said there's a lot of worry.               OP you need to read about [Infrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound)   upboated for skinny jeans and boobs   nope doesn't work in my area (Amherst, MA)                  wow you posted this 4 times.  I've reported you   That he lies, that he spreads disinformation which just clouds the waters.  He has an opportunity to tell the truth, to be something we can trust (which I need.  We need), but instead, he had decided to lie and that just made me disappointed for a couple of years, now I'm pissed off about it.  I even had a phone conversation with him once about his lies.     You won't get much more out of Fulford.     What is his real name?  IS it Gordon Duff or Robert Foote?                  It's happening on its own.  The Baby Boomers (my generation) are largely responsible for the old way of thinking.  Once we are gone (18,000 of us a year until 2020), these old paradigms will be relegated to traditional religious customs.  But Generation Z is largely non-religious (40% according to a recent Pew study), further rendering this influence negligible.    There's a city in China called Kunming, where all of the social/gender roles are reversed.     I believe it was inevitable that this happened.  First we needed online 24/7 with all the social anonymity it offers (nobody can see you're a girl or a boy when you comment or share)  Then we needed a couple generations to grow up with that permanent access  Young women of this generation (post 1995) have learned that what they say and do online is as good or as valid as anybody else.  It's probably the first generation that is completely empowered to be whatever they want to be without the judgement usually associated with sex/gender.  I think it's a good thing and I'm eager to watch and learn      And those aren't females...they are males.  LOL   no it's not at all like that.  Dungeons are 5 - 10 minute vignettes  by the way, if I were your mother, I'd wash your mouth out with soap.  Do you talk to your grandparents that way?     If you've forgotten already, WOW is a game, not a profession or a skill.  Many people find playing games relaxing.  You don't have to be good or bad.  You just play.   I have no idea how to join a raid.      I've been playing WOW since 2007.  I've never been on a raid so I don't know what it is   I have 18 level 100s on 3 servers.  None of them have epics, gems or enchants   A lot of people play WOW for fun or relaxation.  I'm one of them.   I'm not interested in that tomfoolery.           downvoted?  this one rocked on Facebook   How do you know a guy is Korean?   I hate it when someone makes a comment about my gear.     I disagree with you.  Dungeons is all I do these days.   WHO is telling us it's closer to 27%, but that's still too high      I love InfoLiars.com so much      Assuming your Collings has F holes, you can't hear it as well because of how the sound is projected from the holes.  A round hole instrument will always sound louder because of the way the sound projects.     I've been playing mandolin since 1970.  I think toneguards are like copper bracelets were in the 1980s...a nice story, but without merit.  If your instrument is not sounding well, consider a set up from a real luthier.  A new (solid) bridge, a neck adjustment, different strings, fret work, a new tailpiece...all of these will have more of a demonstrable result than a piece of metal that clips onto your instrument.  FWIW a good set up is a requirement whether you play a cheap chinese instrument or a handmade luthier built one   If Bruce Jenner is a woman, those are men      Not indicated for anyone with low iron/anemia   I have 12 red dots so far   This is the body that comes with those tits  https://imgur.com/a/Nv2oT   They mean deaths      Reminds me of Veterans Today's Gordon "40% is Lies" Duff      I'm at the Er.

Not interested.            /u/faketitsarestupidlooking   If it's related, then every other transaction that occurred prior to 9/11 and after 9/11 is also related   But not the JFK assassination   I was born in Boston in 1952 so yeah.  I've seen everything.  My wife and I owned a house in East Orleans during the 1980s and 90s.    yep.  and all the ones preceding it.  I wasn't born on 9/11 douchebag   This is 2 years old, from a 2013 article: http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/60129   The reason superstition is not talked about in the main stream scientific community is that it is not tested in a lab setting.  For the most part.  And a lot of it can be tested.  But nobody is willing to.  Sam Harris talked about this for a time in a Joe Rogan conversation.  See if I can find the link.

THis kind of trading goes on all of the time.  I think it's unrelated to 9/11   Got an english version of this app?  I'd use it   Unfortunately, Chiemi, is not her real name.  	194

Pussies don't like dicks, because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes: assholes who just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is: they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate  and it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes, pussies can be so full of shit that they become assholes themselves... because pussies are an inch and half away from assholes.    this movie blows   Your low karma from this post speaks volumes. This comic and this thread is masturbatory bullshit...and I'm not excluding myself.    It's a fucking comic book cliche. Get over yourself.    She should make a porn before she goes.    "Against the Day" by Pynchon. A book that deals with every possible human condition in every possible way.    Another suicide attempt stopped by a superhero bit.

 5K shouldn't be a problem. It usually only starts being a concern around the two-hour mark.   Maybe you're running too fast during the running parts? It's way too easy to just charge out there, because dangit I'm *running* and that means going fast. (There are involuntary physiological aspects as well.) You should be able to easily carry on a conversation while you're running. The rule I learned is, if you can't talk you're too fast, if you can sing you're not fast enough.   The best way to transition to barefoot-style running (whether literally barefoot or in minimalist shoes) is to learn the new motion bit by bit, and the best way to do that is [Hundred-Ups.](http://hundredup.com/) I do a set of these before every workout, even if it's not running, and it's helped tremendously. It will help your form even if you don't go the minimalist-shoe route.   Not sure what to say except, go to a different shop. If your options are limited, look online (I think Runner's World is a good site) for "tips on choosing a running shoe" articles. Those are generally helpful.  You might see a debate over stability vs. minimalist shoes, but try not to get caught up in it just yet. Go with something similar to what you've been using before; you want to change gradually if at all.   We don't know whether his initial reaction was "I still care about you but I can't handle the sadness" or "Get the hell out of my sight forever"; I'm guessing, on the evidence, it was closer to the former. It grows out of what their relationship had been like and the circumstances of the cheating, too -- solid marriage, momentary weakness? It happens. And people just handle these things differently.    Regarding Mr. Eisinger's recommendation to cold-call reporters: That's a good idea, and [here's a good post](http://www.theawl.com/2012/05/how-to-get-and-keep-a-mentor) on how to go about it without sounding too needy. I believe most journalists would love to help you out, but the right approach will really smooth things along, so to speak.   I've always felt affinity for the idea that we should spend part of our time learning and part of it teaching. So, yes.  I also think the point of the advice isn't that you can't learn from people who seem like lesser lights, it's that if you notice yourself feeling superior, you need to go find some perspective.   "Religion is the socialization of spiritual experience." The history, rituals, and so forth are part and parcel of this socialization -- they form the mental and social environment in which one practices and expresses one's faith. It's sort of the connective tissue of the community.   Haven't been there much myself, but the Fine Arts library gets good reviews from my friends. Worth checking out.   And this actually constitutes progress.   You always find something in the last place you look.   As /u/chass3 said, north and northwest are your best bets, but everyone else knows it too, so empty spaces are scarce. Also, some neighborhoods have resident-only parking to discourage commuters, so check the signs carefully. Depending on how far away you're coming from, it may be less hassle to park farther away near a bus or shuttle stop and ride in the rest of the way.   It's your day, then!

I'm in grad school (finishing this year) but I've been sending out apps for both teaching jobs and jobs in my previous field for ... a while now. I only really got serious about applying to *lots* of jobs recently.   I think the abyss they fall into is not infinite like a black hole, but you need to send out enough to fill it up so some of them are visible from the top.   I wish I knew. The Great Internet Ovipositor dropped it in front of me via one of those Tumblr gif things.   Hang in there. It seemed to take forever for me.      You're the expert.   Sort of on topic: Roy Blount Jr. once took a course on race car driving to write an article about it. He was easily taller than everyone else there. The instructor pointed out that most race drivers are not very tall and asked why that might be. Blount said, "Tall men don't need fast cars to impress women." The others weren't happy, but no one disagreed.   I love how even though the officer says the truck drove *through* the guard arms, most of the commenters say that "You can't drive around the double crossing guards, so obviously he had driven onto the tracks before they came down, and stopped there."

Austin has two car-sharing services, Zipcar and Car2go, that have annual fees in the $30-40 range and then you pay per trip.

 Thanks for providing the article on peer review, I hadn't seen that one before and it was a good read. I still don't seen a better alternative to the peer-review system, though I think it can be improved. I made a comment about some of my own experiences with peer review and thoughts on an alternative system being trialed here: http://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/30xhcf/payforreview_good_idea_or_bad/  In terms of the article being peer-reviewed, if it's in a peer-reviewed journal it means that each article goes through the peer-review process to be accepted in the journal, so the article in this case was peer-reviewed. The process for that journal, an elsevier one, can be found here: http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/reviewer-guidelines.   1. Scrutinizing studies and taking them at face value is a good thing. The linked media article title "Study Finds Evidence That the MIND Diet May Protect Patients From Developing Alzheimers Disease" and the journal article title "MIND diet associated with reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease". At no point do they say MIND diet score more predictive - where are you getting that from? You say that "articles appear with title discrepancies..." I guess you mean articles in magazines and newspapers. Unfortunately, sensationalization occurs in the media and in some peer-reviewed journals but I don't see much here, the articles say that it MAY help which is all that can be taken from the studies at the moment.  2. Recent reports of wide-scale falsification in reports - that has happened recently (it has happened before and will again, the system is not flawless and scientists are humans that will be tempted by greed and money. The system is somewhat self-correcting, if nobody can repeat your cure or whatever then your study will be the exception and not the rule) with 43 papers to date that may increase. The 43 papers appeared to be from a Chinese ring and there's no suggestion that this paper would be part of that (US based and different publisher (i.e. NOT Biomed Central) to the ones linked to the falsification reports).  3. Echo chamber/positive feedback loop - I see what you mean but this paper builds on previous finding from 2 different labs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20305128 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23670794?dopt=Abstract) and no shared authors between the 3 papers. Repeatable findings (associations/correlations in this case) are part of a step forward and collectively strengthen the associations and increase evidence that it is an avenue to pursue.  4. You trust findings from a wider audience and peer reviewed journals rarely are. (Linking the source would be a major help as I don't quite get the point - I can only assume that you mean that the reviewers are too narrow focused on a certain area. I'd say having an expert in the field to review a paper a good thing, I wouldn't get an electrician and librarian to evaluate my heart health, I'd go to a cardiologist or a group of them who may be less "wide" but would have more relevant knowledge) So what other findings/sources do you use then? Does that mean you have sources you prefer to peer-reviewed articles? Personally, I'd base any health choices from peer-reviewed articles or use such articles to see if any claims have any truth to them. The peer-review system isn't perfect but I don't know of a better system (it can be improved with the publication of more studies showing no effects amongst other things).   5. I interpret this paper as saying that this diet may help decrease or delay the onset of Alzheimers. More detailed questionnaires (geographical location, occupation, socio-economic status, exercise levels etc.) would be needed to eliminate potential confounding factors (e.g. those on the MIND diet may exercise more and once you account for that the diet doesn't have a significant effect). The mechanisitic basis would need to be determined as well (i.e. what part of the diet is beneficial, on the molecular level how does it work etc.). All that takes time, in the meantime I think the **authors** have done a decent job without hyperbole (*media coverage* may be different and they thrive on hyperbole which is unethical and disheartening). The Mediterranean diet has been shown to be **correlated** with increased healthspan (better cardiovascular function I know of perhaps more) so based on current information it seems like it's a good diet to prolong healthspan. Does it mean that it definitely will?, no - it might do nothing. I think the current information should be released to the public to let them decide if they want to follow it or guide their diet choices.  EDIT - balanced out point 2 a bit more.   Can you provide the source/article where it says that the journal is peer reviewed and not the paper? That makes no sense to me, if it's a peer-reviewed journal it means that the papers in the journal are peer-reviewed. I can't see anything to suggest that paper would not be peer-reviewed (happy to be shown wrong, just would be extremely surprising).     Both have elements of truth to what they are saying. Protein synthesis is maximal in the first 3hrs after resistance exercise, is elevated for at least 24hrs post workout and ingesting protein in this time increase protein synthesis further. To say that not ingesting after 30mins means it will all go to waste is not true, you won't get as much of an increase in protein synthesis but you will get some.  Matching daily protein intake will mean that you won't lose muscle mass which occurs if you workout and exclude all protein. However, timing to get maximal synthesis is important.  Travelling right now but this will cover what you were asking: http://www.gssiweb.org/en/Article/sse-107-protein-consumption-and-resistance-exercise-maximizing-anabolic-potential   So both whey and meats contain all the essential amino acids. There are a couple of reasons why whey is better than meat:  1. It is digested faster (no need to break down connective tissue, cell walls etc. to liberate the protein). Exercise accelerates/amplifies protein synthesis but within a time window, so fast absorption is needed.  2. Whey contains a higher proportion of branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Protein synthesis is largely controlled by a protein called mTOR which is activated by exercise and this activation is increased and prolonged potently by leucine. All the other essential amino acids are required for this not just leucine but leucine acts as the signal for the boost in protein synthesis.  These are a couple of reviews on the topic by 2 leaders in the field if you're interested (free access):  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213370/ http://www.gssiweb.org/en/Article/sse-107-protein-consumption-and-resistance-exercise-maximizing-anabolic-potential   I was talking about protein synthesis, which is a key determinant for adaptation to exercise, and if you look at figure 5 is significantly higher with whey protein following exercise than soy or casein.  Why does the similar insulin spike invalidate that?   OK, a lot of people didn't like me saying exercise and eat as well as you can. The exercise and eat well was a general piece of advice not just about recovery for the general public.   Looking at recovery for a one-off diet doesn't mean that it will translate to a long-term benefit.   In this study a high fat diet led to a reduce improvement in exercise following an 8 wk training program compared to a high carb diet. Both improved performance but the carb diet was better than a high fat diet: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1158881/  Does that mean a high-fat diet is always bad? Perhaps not if you're an elite athlete, here endurance trained athletes did not have the same negative effects on energy efficiency as sedentary people in response to a high-fat diet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632846 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106937  Does that mean fat is bad and shouldn't be used, again no. In this study low fat decreases performance http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10682876  In terms of the protein the source of protein is important to maximize protein synthesis, with whey protein being the best due to its high branched chain amino acid (particularly leucine) content and how rapidly it can be digested and taken up into the bloodstream:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961  Does that mean that whey protein work well with the whole population? No, elderly people have lower response to it but including vitamin D3 and additional lecuine can help maintain muscle mass in elderly obese patients on a weight loss program. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646324  Exercise acts as a potent inducer of protein synthesis when eating a meal (i.e. eating will increase protein synthesis, exercise and get a bigger increase which can lead to increases in muscle mass): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23438221  That's a few links there. Are there some contradictory papers, yes there will be and there will be other supporting the claims. The papers I've picked are ones where they have been performed well and are not acute but occur over a period of time. A lot of papers citing high fat diet benefits are from rats (different metabolism, more distinct fiber-types and they are allowed to give more extreme diets) which may not translate to humans.  People like a yes or no, good or bad answer for everything. People respond differently due to genetics, age, disease etc. This means that different diets can have vastly different effects on people. Taking into account the general population eating a balanced diet and exercise will help keep you healthier was the point that I was making. In my opinion people get too caught up in "Oh you need this extreme diet or pill to see a benefit of exercise". Can they help, in some cases but not all. If it works for you great but people thinking they need some diet can put them off exercise when it shouldn't really. If you want to eat fast food go ahead and if you exercise it's better for you. If you want to take anything from this then just exercise!  EDIT: made a mistake in the penultimate sentence and gave a clearer message    This isn't all that surprising, as it's a short-term study (1 pre and post-recovery workout for each diet) focusing on exercise recovery and glycogen recovery. Any high-glycemic carbohydrates will restore glycogen levels quickly following exercise so what form you take them in isn't that important - when you just look at glycogen levels and short-term recovery.   Long-term may be a different story though - the fast food diet may not enable you to maximize adaptations to exercise. Having said that you will still get the some (likely a lot) of the benefits of exercise.   The easy, simple advice is to just exercise and eat as well as you can.  EDIT: I've put a longer reply to the people asking for sources on things. The healthy diet and exercise was a general diet comment but the key is to exercise. People who exercise have less of the bad effects of a 1wk high-fat meal http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632846 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106937  In terms of "as macronutrient content is the same then there shouldn't be a difference". Not necessarily, not all protein is equal with whey protein having the maximal increase on protein synthesis both at rest and following exercise http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961. So 25g whey protein should cause a bigger increase in protein synthesis than 25g protein from a burger. There may be differences in fat type (i.e. saturated vs unsaturated) too.  So new summary, just exercise and if you want take diet into account      Hmm it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. A couple of points about how this might affect the process:  1. The journal aims for a decision within 30 days already. I've submitted to journals with this aim and had to wait up to 10 weeks for the initial decision. Having a guaranteed decision time is great for the submitting authors (assuming it is peer-reviewed correctly etc.)  2. This process will use reviewers employed an external company. Typical peer review is sent to somebody (ideally 3 reviewers) in the field of study who review it free of charge - it's something that at least in academia you are expected to do. The downside of this is that reviewer may be time pressed due to work commitments which results in either a delayed response time or a poor review. I've had a review where only comments on the abstract were made and took 10 weeks to get, the paper was accepted but I wouldn't class that as a peer review (there was one other reviewer who did a marginally better job). It's interesting that scientifc reports says they only guarantee one reviewer for the traditional route, which I think is complete bullshit. There should be 3 reviewers to enable the editor to make an informed decision and get a more representative view. Hopefully they do send it out to 3 reviewers and it's more of a legal thing by guaranteeing one reviewer as sometimes a reviewer can accept a paper but not return it in time.  3. The main concern would be what quality of reviewers this company has. Are they up to date in the field of the study? Is the field their specialty or just given to them as they have some form of biology background and is closely associated with their background?  4. The quality and format of review is a real concern too. *"The review process itself is also streamlined, using an online scorecard instead of the traditional approach of comments, questions, and suggestions".* Does this mean reviewers can't make comments with this system? If so, then how can a study to be improved? A key facet of peer-review is other scientists guiding you on how to improve it. Say I submit a paper and get a 4/10, how does that help me? I need to improve it, OK but how?  5. So do you just get accepted or rejected with his scorecard system? It must be unbelievably rare for a study to be accepted without changes being made. If you are able to re-submit does it go the same reviewers or get banded about to different to reviewers? Again if they can't comment and they want something addressed am I just waiting for blind luck to address their concerns. If you can re-submit is that covered with the fee or do I pay again?  6. The benefits of the reviewers from this company is that they may have the time and pressure to submit a good detailed review (I.e. If there are complaints about the review they may receive less work). If they have more time they may read up on the specifics of the paper which will let them perform a more detailed, nuanced review - again if they just use a scorecard then this benefit is lost. As an academic, if I was to give a rubbish review, as I volunteered to do it, it's likely nothing would be said to me. Perhaps the editor may put an asterisk to my name to not send me a review again (which is what a good editor would do) but I doubt many do this (I know of one who does, other editors seems to have its a luck of the draw thing based on my letter to the editor following the peer review of my abstract).  7. The people reviewing the document shouldn't really care if it's accepted as they get paid regardless, same with the company. Scientific reports will in the vast majority of cases go with the reviewers decision so they shouldn't care if you've paid or not. The journal does need to say how much money they take themselves from this extra fee.  8. It costs $1495 to publish in this journal and an extra $750 for this sped up process, so potentially $2245 in total. I appreciate open access papers and anybody getting to view them. However, I do find the costs with this (not just this journal) concerning. The money could be used on research rather than publishing costs or providing funding to more labs. It'd be interesting to see how much money is given by granting agencies for publication fees.  9. This will put a greater divide between labs with more funding and those that don't. It may help widen the gap as these journals have more press coverage which in turn may help you get more funding.  In short, if the company has good quality reviewers then this may be a good thing if you exclude the cost bias between labs. Scientific reports should make the review process for every paper open to the public and have complete transparency. It'll be interesting to see what the review scorecards are like. As a scientist I would rather they said pay x-amount for a good detailed review not a fast review but perhaps I'm a bit naive...  	9
 Great pics.  I wonder how different the consumer version will be?  It looks really raw at the moment for the general consumer but exciting for the tech minded.   What you said is sensible.

[full article from the guardian ]( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/02/htc-vive-developers-react-to-valve-virtual-reality-headset)                              The funny thing is that they revised the trending subreddits to specifically include the cock-watching subreddit.    It was not on the initial trending subreddits for today. http://www.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/2xng4q/trending_subreddits_for_20150302_rhouseofcards/  Admin know what people want.   My gut reaction would be that image processing could compensate.    Quick search and I see Apple has a patent http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/12/apple-patent-reveals-oculus-rift-like-headset-for-short-sighted-viewers/  You would think that this would be a big selling point.  Maybe that will be a 2nd generation.   It is a teaser trailer.  I think there will be a lot more about it in this week and so we won't be left hanging.     I'm really excited by Vive from HTC.  It looks like it is not just going to be a Steam gaming device but also gear for a whole range of virtual reality content from the likes of Google and movie studios.  The /r/Vive community should be a great place to keep an eye on what is happening.  2015/2016 is going to be all about virtual reality.  Lets hope it takes off and isn't just a bubble like 3dtv.   The first few series of robotwars had  The Gauntlet- an obstacle filled maze as a preliminary round.  Something like that probably help people think about their design.   Not sure it was interesting for prime time TV but would make great extras and web content   http://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/  Revive the vive    Thanks for the feedback.  We were just having a discussion about that in mod mail and expect we can put it right.    We are using a popular template from /r/naut which a lot of small subreddits adapt.  Therefore, it is surprising that they have opted to have such an obscure subscribe button      Not really. I'm just not looking for conflict and trying to be positive.  reddit loves to complain!   /r/steamvr has 33 posts in 1 year.  It isn't a successful community.    /r/vive has 11 posts in hours and twice as many moderators.    I'm quite happy to push a new community around the brand with the help of others and see what happens.  You can decide which subreddits you subscribe to or contribute to.  However, please don't concern troll.   Thanks for the list, I'll add them to the /r/vive sidebar.  Any others?   Collating info and coverage at /r/vive   Anyone who wants to mod please just ask.  I'm just trying to build an inclusive community for everyone or maybe just a collection of links.   Send a mod mail if you can help with the CSS, promotion and content.  Looking for contributors  and so will add anyone at this stage.    Edit.  ok enough mods for now.  Thanks for your interest.  I will add more mods on the basis of community activity and contributions.  Who knows if the current mods will actually buy the product and care about it and this subreddit in the future.   Thanks.

Then the publication later changes it and explains why .  Is that what it is?    Don't forget I repost it with the new title.    http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2xdk9u/comcast_now_says_it_will_not_sue_fcc/  You know for more fake internet points            No. Read the article in its entirety and you can see  they updated it with new information.  This is not about me   reddit is for discussion.  I worry for people that use it as a source of fair and balanced news.   Don't read the article    the global news really doesn't really report FCC and US  net neutrality .  It only reports report stuff like when the US starts wars or their economy tumbles.   stuff on /r/worldnews is sort of a taste.   They have recently updated it if you read the footnote.     This is the same link as the front page post but it has been updated with a new title and new information.      I think that is what the title says too .  I see clickbait is when there is something left out or a question that demands a click .  I avoid that .  This is just overly dramatic for a company reddit likes.            it isn't a requirement   it makes enough noise so that we ignore the reasons for actually hating them   Same question being asked here http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2x9k9s/why_in_the_hell_is_reddit_circlejerking_tom/   /r/WarOnComcast    Thanks for the illustration.  I think is is fair to say that many developing countries risk following American business model in the absence of strong regulation.    However,  I was impressed with many south American countries went the other way on this early on.   It might even happen/has happened given how people feel. No worse than what hacker protest  groups get up to ....and if they pick. the right target they are applauded on here   There have also been calls for killing sprees against comcast employees in this thread which I am sure the mods will remove    Yes.  Also could be one for /r/nottheonion if we were not so use to seeing them on reddit   So tell me which countries specifically  and even better point to the  telecommunication regulation ?  The rest of the world is not a utopia but USA is hellish and must be near the bottom of the pile.   Worth mentioning that the Netherlands was the first European country to have neutrality by law. I don't think any corporations could change that but I do wonder about how much of the horrible corporate culture in America spreads into international operations.   They signed the voluntary code of practice now.       No.  However, the USA seemed for a while the most [corrupt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture ) for a mature economy especially on this issue.   Many other countries had corporations pushing their own voluntary net neutrality code BEFORE the regulators stepped in because corporations fear the regulators elsewhere.  I know I am making sweeping statements.  Hence, I was asking for specific countries that seemed to be at risk of loosing net neutrality or risked following a US decision..   Which countries are you thinking of ?  Only America has a Comcast problem and regulators whose first instinct is to serve corporations.         Hydrogen looks like it is going to win in Japan and so probably Asia too.     Thanks for setting this up and your early enthusiasm.  I'm sure this will be a great community and will grow as the new series becomes more real         it has a password blocking access so is removed   Thursdays historic vote by the Federal Communications Commission to reclassify broadband was not the first but merely the latest step toward regulating speech. The FCC voted to no longer classify broadband as a Title I entity (of the Communications Act) but instead as a Title II entity, like common carriers such as telephone service. The commissions three Democrats approved the change over the dissent of the agencys two Republican commissioners.  Anyone who believes this vote was about preserving a free and open Internet as so-called net neutrality supporters have claimed has not been paying close attention. One only has to revisit statements and actions undertaken by Administration officials in the last several years to understand the end-game.  President Barack Obamas first-term chairman of the FCC was former Harvard Law School classmate, Julius Genachowski. Genachowski directed a multi-pronged effort aimed at increasing government control of news, information, and entertainment.  The FCCs ill-conceived National Broadband Plan, was the first round in moving electronic media (the dominant form of information distribution) from other platforms (e.g. broadcast) to broadband.  The goal, claimed Genachowski, was to make the spectrum occupied by television broadcasters available to other wireless platforms such as cellular telephones. That was merely the excuse. By virtue of the broadband reclassification vote, the regulatory light touch of the Internet, which allowed it flourish in the past couple of decades, was abandoned in favor of the heavy-hand of government regulation.  Perhaps to mollify critics, the agencys Democratic commissioners insist they will exclude Internet service providers from some of the other Title II regulatory burdens placed on telephony.  Does anyone truly believe DC politicians will resist the urge to extract billions of dollars in payments from Internet service providers as they currently do with telephony in order feed the Universal Service Fund? The USF was a reelection windfall for Obama. It was used as a slush fund to hand-out the notoriously nicknamed Obama phones to low-income voters. About 2.2 billion dollars in Obama phones were given away in 2012.  There were other FCC actions that signaled the Democratic majoritys desire to regulate content.  The Future of the Media inquiry fell well-outside the agencys statutory charter. The 468-page report addressed topics in which the agency did not have the expertise to properly evaluate the information it collected including company business models, corporate debt levels, newsroom staffing policies, and print industry operations.  The report contained what could be one of Washington, D.C.s greatest juxtapositions. The executive summarys opening statement was In most ways todays media landscape is more vibrant than ever, offering faster and cheaper distribution networks, fewer barriers to entry, and more ways to consume information. Choice abounds. Apparently, this leads to the conclusion that this better-faster-cheaper-more-abundant media needs government regulation.  Another regulatory agency, the Federal Trade Commission, also unqualified and without statutory authority, launched its own effort to improve journalism. The FTCs Reinvention of Journalism discussed several proposals to reinvent journalism, including some that would drastically alter the media landscape and severely impede a free press.  The staff discussion draft suggests a news licensing arrangement be adopted, perhaps with the governments help and support. That suggestion of licensing news organizations should send shivers down the spine of any First Amendment supporter.  Another proposal was [a] national Fund for Local News [to] be created with money the Federal Communications Commission now collects from or could impose on telecom users, television and radio broadcast licensees, or Internet service providers [emphasis added]. Does anyone still think the FCC wouldnt demand broadband providers pay into the onerous Universal Service Fund in order to fund government-approved new entities?  I could continue ad infinitum with the FTC report but you get the idea.  Meanwhile, allies of the Obama White House and influential advocates of regulated content, such as Free Press, have been completely transparent in their wishes. They call for the government to spend as much as $30 billion annually to fund approved news operations.  Lawrence Strickling, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, is the principal advisor to the president on telecommunications and information policy. As assistant secretary, he proposed the government regulate Internet content. [W]e rely on the Internet for essential social purposes: health, energy, efficiency and education. He added, There [should] be rules or laws created to protect our interests.  In 2009, Cass Sunstein was appointed to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Fourteen years earlier his book Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech revealed his hostility toward the First Amendment. Like Free Press and the FTC, he argued (in a subsequent book) in favor of government subsidised (sic) programming, and that the government might impose must carry rules on the most popular Websites, designed to ensure more exposure to substantive questions, and the government implement a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet requiring some websites to offer opposing viewpoints.  One can easily imagine which websites would receive universal carriage and which would be mandated to carry opposing views.                        http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/18/world/isis-libya/index.html                        Stopping these sneaky moves is important and necessary. But it's like bailing water out of a leaky boat. To plug the leak, reduce the influence of money in politics:                  In other words the merger has nothing to do with lowering prices or providing better and expanded service.  It is all about eliminating competition to the disadvantage of the consumer.  Nothing more, nothing less.

 If you look on the Donors Choose website, the site buys the supplies that the teachers request and ship them directly to the teachers to maintain the integrity of the process. The state government isn't involved at all.      Thank goodness the FCC got behind the DOJ on this one and recommended a hearing on the merger. Comcast realized it wouldn't be able to justify the deal in an FCC hearing and immediately killed the deal.   Victory for consumers and antitrust law!!      It's ridiculous that a GOP mayor with about 13% of the state's population in his city is smart enough to see that this RFRA is wrong, but none of the GOP state legislators are interested one bit in including LGBT protections language. This is just baffling.    I've never heard that combination before, but wow, that just made my day.   Ring shopping is already underway. Hopefully we fulfill your prophecy.   	7
 Thank you for posting this OP! I thought I was the only one who believed all the 'gods' are one being that has been interpreted differently by different cultures. I also agree with the thought of moving to another dimension in energy form. Wasn't it Einstein that said energy cannot be created or destroyed, it only changes form? This has made my day :)   This sounds like it could be SP, but that doesn't explain the weird coincidences you've encountered. I'm starting to think you may be astral projecting, which would explain the boy seeing an 'angel', but not sure about the woman in the hospital. I've never heard of changing how you look during AP but I guess anything's possible. I agree with the sleep study idea. You are basically videoed as you sleep in a bed in a study room (they're quite comfy btw). I've never undergone one, but my mom works with a company that does.  	2
 I need this thing on my counter in the kitchen. Never have to see another ant ever again.   Well great, now I'll never be able to get on an elevator the same way again..   I said to myself,  "Self, you really don't want to look at this." But my finger didn't get the memo.    Sure, I'll pretend I didn't see this 12 hours ago.   Awesome! I actually work at Warriors Path State Park during the summer! I probably know you or know somebody that knows you.   Indeed.   That's awesome..   You're welcome! It's awesome to see the number of people that are from or have passed through our area.    Can confirm.  Fellow graduates from high school get arrested all the time for meth.   	9
 Thank you for this :D   ah yea, but manageable    It's got the curves and it looks so good    i hope my aero knowledge helps me here...   That paint will give give a better picture of real world conditions.   Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.   when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.

Chrome does reduce it by hours.   I've been avoiding Flash on Linux for a long-time now, don't remember it being a severe drain for me...probably coz i stay off video sites   Chrome is massive battery drain http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/10/8381447/chrome-macbook-battery-life   :D good!    latex  not sure, Give it another try ;)   i get constant broken playback with the spinner on 0:00 - 0:25 seconds. After that somehow it mans up and plays :|   Brilliant :D   same reason :D   i agree with this, playback is way smoother on chrome than Firefox by a good margin on Linux and considerably closer with Windows 7   yeah a wait till 2019   do check out Infinality and freetype-freeworld ;)   you should definitely check out Infinality and freetype-freeworld then ;)   Dont know if this will help you, but try switching to OpenDNS or Google DNS.

Any Idea why this happens?   i wish somebody does this for GIMP. It could use some love!   Darth Vader's ride    Is there no other environmental agency other than greenpeace?  Yes there are! And it would be better if we have them than not.   Personally haven't seen anyone else take the fight ,on different issues, to the corporate giants and the Govt itself.     The only deep pockets I saw were of greenpeace. Chipko andolan worked without foreign support. Dont try to show greenpeace as warriors.  Yes i agree, income should be audited and things like this should be transparent; but same should be made mandatory for Political parties, Govt. Income   Expenditure along with finance listing for top organizations in the country.    This is where its one-sided.      They are just a front for vested interest  Legally(Court) they haven't been accused for any mistake so far.     The ones which would like to keep any country energy dependent. If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.  I disagree. Every country is energy dependent be it US, Japan etc. They import resources to make Energy(Oil, Uranium, Coal).     Yes i do agree to the fact that protest against the Nuclear Plant in the south was harsh, i personally support nuclear power, but you can't avoid a Disaster like Fukushima can You?    Radioactive contamination has reached the shores of Canada today.   Chernobyll is still a ghost town, the negative of Nuclear Power is still very dangerous.   The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is in a region of Seismic activity, and i hope it works in perfect condition to benefit us all.    If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.  LOL. Solar power is greener and I don't think anyone will oppose it. But yes it has negative effects too   solar heats the region in which the plant is situated to extremely hot temperatures. Its [frying birds](http://news.discovery.com/tech/alternative-power-sources/worlds-largest-solar-power-plant-scorching-birds-140219.htm) these days. Best way is to locate it in non migratory paths of flying creatures.       Exactly, i can see why you got the down-votes.   Transparency should be at every level from party incomes to MNC giants as well.   I agree Greenpeace has sometimes been aggressive with Environmental Issues, but its not like they killed some big project for the worse.    This seems a one-sided battle to crush your opposition because you can't be better.   Deep pockets try an score a win every where.   And honestly we need a Greenpeace or something of its kind. None of us citizens are so morally bothered to protect our environment or the way its misused by corporate giants in the name of "development"        why dont you save the VM after doing the initial setup?   you'll need this https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin    Donations should always come from people who can afford the one dollar and that dollar won't impact their lives in any way.  Yes! I do wish people who could afford pay for it though.      Also i believe if a game is launched and it has great reviews, people wont be put-off for doing a one-time payment/donation.   I recently bought Limbo because they slashed prices.   What becomes irritating is in-app purchases to unlock some special feature, it does help you but it has a bad impact on the mindset of a user and keeps them from coming back.    The problem with donation is the currency conversion.   Dollars might be good for the west and the people living there, but for us on the East say,    India  1$=63.58 Rs   Japan 1$=119.78 yen   Philippines 1$=44.58 peso    It is quite a considerable amount. In india you'd get 12-13 packs of 5Rs biscuits or 4 Packets of bread(15 Rs.)    Most of the people here in possession of a smart phone are teens and early adults who depend on their parents to provide them with funds, so they tend to avoid buy/donating apps which cost.    Probably once they start earning this trend could change    I do buy games and donate if im in financial capacity though :)     check your add-ons. Follow the trouble shooting instruction on the right side of this page.    If nothing fixes its probably because of low RAM. Yes throwing away the external antivirus/firewall softwares could help in getting more free ram for the browser.   Another thing you could do it browse with some tab limit - like 4-6 tabs        This post Represent!  Thank You _/\_ for working on this   it look STUNNING O_O :D I wish every TV gets this or a way to load this OS    loading fine for me    Please do try using safe mode and browsing for a while and see if that makes a difference.  If its fine then one of your add-ons is the likely problem source.    You could [Refresh](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) your browser. Warning you'll have to reinstall your add-ons.    Create a SEPARATE new profile and see if that works out for you OR back up data and move it to a new profile.   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles     Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.     We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.    Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.    Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.   It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.    EDIT   Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.   Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).   This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.     VP9 is still being worked on, so once that comes playback will be super good   i think bugs are being filed for this, do have a look at bugzilla.   On android they are splitting up Facebook and the messages app as Messenger. Users are required to download both if they want access to Facebook and if they want to message their friends.    Browser side I don't think we'll see a difference whether you use Firefox on android or desktop to browse facebook.com    O_O probably clear cache from Recovery.   Runs smooth on my phone. Use it everyday   it runs fine on my moto g 1 Gig.   It was a different story on my 512MB Ram Mediatek Micromax Canvas. Horrible.

I think it's still a WIP - vp9 support    I hope you are talking about desktop Firefox.   visit www.youtube.com/html5 check that every box is enabled and html5 player is active.   Change quality by clicking the gear icon on the player.   Right click video - stats for nerds to see if its mp4/vp9     flair it solved    go to your firefox folder in terminal and execute the firefox file located there "./filename"   If there's any error you should see there.   Im on Fedora/ubuntu and using Firefox so not a linux or firefox problem. Something related to your set-up.

O_O   Check out the trailer here - https://vimeo.com/ondemand/theraggededge   Is it just me or does Erik Buell sound like Heisenberg. :O      Dont want to switch it off, i hope it helps in telemetry.   I believe it might be reported since its be ongoing for sometime, trying to bug hunt it down.   Flair it 'Solved'! :)   Im getting this quite a lot on Nightly version 40.0a1 (2015-04-29) on Fedora Linux 20 with e10s enabled   "a web page is causing Nightly to run slowly. What would you like to do"   This happens randomly after some continous time of browsing, and every tab I have opened goes white with that spinner loading icon - spinning.   Clicking the 'x' stop button on awesome/address bar does not stop the page loading.   Refreshing other tabs also has no effect.   Firefox keeps showing the loading spinner in content display area.   Killing the Web process, works but this problem comes back rather quickly   Any solution? I've only been using facebook, reddit, bugzilla, Imgur, whatsapp web.   Also many a time, switching inbetween tabs causes the white page and loading spinner to re-appear(This happens often).   Tried the normal trouble-shoots i.e. new profile, refresh browser etc.     awesome :)   check what boxes are checked on youtube.com/html5.  if everything is checked you should get it without troubles.    Also it came first to chrome because it is a Google product, just like YouTube. They went in with full preparation to implement and launch before others hoped onto the train.   yeah thats there, i survive on a 1k unliimited plan   That is expensive! 3k of your salary on internet connectivity is horrendous   Yes it becomes more lossy. They compress it to save on size. Happens on Facebook all the time for any pic above a 100kb   Bsnl had given me the best speed on 3g. It surprised me. Docomo was great for 2g    i finally got it! :D    Boys hate pants  Ya'll need this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungi       You need to install a codec pack.     You'll probably have to download Windows Media Player if its not already installed.   Prey, Next and Micro - Michael Crichton! :D   aw thats bad :/   Ps. - Join the LinuxMasterRace! ;)   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/984694   why don't you try creating a separate new profile and see if the issue persists, without installing any additonal add-ons etc, and browsing as you do.    If things are fine now, the mostly some add-on you have is to blame or you could backup your Firefox data, create a new profile and restore the data    shumway is flash for firefox. Im not sure if its going to help your YouTube viewing.    what you should be doing is possibly get a codec pack installed on your system for "h.264".   The options to enable MSE on the second line lies in about:config. under "mediasource"   It's the sound of hope!    Do u have an external hard drive connected when this happens?    we are here for a deppception    The only other thing I've seen her in is in 21 Jump Street and The Five-Year Engagement  Wasn't she Amy in The social network?     i liked the Ang Lee's hulk over every other hulk(neglect CG improvements) so far. It was beautifully shot and told.    For me its was the helplessness/hopelessness    That moment of truth when you know you're doomed.   Zack Hemsey composed for the trailer - song Mind heist   Candy, Downfall(Mother and Children scene), The Royal Tenenbaums( Eliot smith and Margot), Predestination(Ending _/\_), Road(2013), Senna(2010), Interstellar(When he leaves Murph   Ending), FF7(Ending), Requiem for a Dream, My Own Private Idaho, Running on Empty, Star Wars(All - special mention to 1st part Anakin leaving his Mom), The Warrior(Ending), Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Perfume, The Great Gatsby(Ending _/\_), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, King Kong(Peter Jacksons) .... lots more :) will leave at this   Im not familiar with AMD hybrids, but on Bumblebee(Nvidia) you get to use the GPU with and "optirun" command to force such an action. There could be something like that for AMD.

Top lel    http://wp.me/p1eITv-20 made this a while back, has all the usage basics to give a head start right away    what all enabled for you on youtube.com/html5 ?   I think it's because of adaptive streaming rates, you can go low as 144p. Trying setting YouTube player to 360p for some decent quality    oh, thanks for pointing that out!

 *whoosh*   When they are on sale for around $20 I think they are nice. You can get better for full price though.          Whoa.   [Source](http://www.xvideos.com/video7875911/teen_emily_enagges_in_a_thrilling_sex_with_her_horny_bf_filmed_in_pov)   Can you give measurements of both? Hip, thigh, and leg opening?   They seem pretty solid to me. I don't know how brutal your winters are but I feel like they would hold up for a few winters of light to moderate snow if you treat them well and don't overwear them (let them dry out between wears).    I really like the [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083F3HYA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1) Golden Fox boots. I bought a pair earlier this year and I think they look and feel great for the price.    Please post your wallpaper!   The canvas ones are pretty good for the price. Don't bother with the leather, it looks and feels like plastic. Can't comment on the suede but I have a pair of their suede canvas boats and I really like them.    Sweater looks a tad too big. There shouldn't be any room between the collar and the sweater at the shoulders.    Shirt looks very billowy. Consider slim fits.    I would say it's too short now but because it's not a full body pic it's hard to tell.   They have actual measurements for all of their clothing on the site. Find a shirt that fits you well, measure it, and compare it to Uniqlo's. Actual measurements are the best way to do it!   I have recently gotten into thrifting and frequent a thrift shop that gets a lot of J. Crew OCBDs.   I have heard of the quality difference between J. Crew and J. Crew Factory, with JCF being of substantially lower quality and fit. Obviously if given the option between the two I would go with regular J. Crew; unfortunately to my untrained eye it's hard for me to tell the difference.  I know about the two diamonds under the tag to indicate factory status, however all the J. Crew tags I see either look like [this](http://i742.photobucket.com/albums/xx66/applky/IMG_2930.jpg) or [this](http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af86/oboy_oboy/IMG_0530.jpg). I have never seen diamonds on the tags of any of the J. Crew OCBDs I have seen.   How can I tell the difference just from sight?  I can get the OCBDs at $16.50 to $18.50. Is this a good deal?   Free return shipping right now!   Interesting. Uniqlo's sizing charts peg the slim-fit OCBDs at a full 1 inch smaller in body width than the flannels. I have both on the way in size small so we will see I guess.   *Edit: Just received my Uniqlo flannels. Two of the three flannels I got fit me absolutely beautifully; the third was overly baggy and fit like a drape. All three were in size small so I guess there are variants between the fit. Once my OCBDs come I will compare the fit to the ones that fit me well.    My 511s fit rather tightly around the thighs and perfect around the calves. My 484s fit perfect around the thighs and a little tight around the calves.    Porn.   It's right at the bottom. In bold **Limited time only:**   At first I though you wanted to physically wear chinos over your jeans (like two pants at the same time) and I was really confused.      She is trying so hard to look white, it makes me sad :(   October 13.   There is currently also [free return shipping](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/help/returns.html) on all orders right now (near the bottom of the page). Looks like now's the time to buy!    Probably trying to say something into his ear so he could hear it over the loudness of the club.    Not sure what your definition of sleek is but [here's](http://www.good-stuffs.com/Classic-Rodina-automatic-wrist-watch-OEM-by-Sea-Gull-ST17_p_156.html) a watch that I've been eyeing for a while.    I was browsing the J.Crew sale today and I wanted to get a few final sale chinos, but I don't want to mess up the size. After a little researching I came across [this](http://www.styleforum.net/t/181128/slim-fit-chino-j-crew-urban-vs-bb-milano) forum. If you scroll a little down you can see some charts that are supposedly the real measurements for their chinos; however, they don't seem to be right at all. I have a 35" hip and I usually wear size 29 or 30 but according to this chart even the smallest 28 would fall right off me.   Can anyone who has a pair of J.Crew chinos validate the sizes on this chart?   I guess it is my hip size then? But why would jeans advertise waist length instead of hip length? No one wears jeans up to their waist anymore.    I remember when I was in high school (only a few years ago) I wore size 32 Levi's and those felt a little tight on me. Now size 30 AEO slim fit jeans slip off my waist without a belt.   Has anyone else experienced something similar? I'm pretty sure my waist has only grown in size since high school. My true waist size is 35", if that matters at all   Jeans + boat shoes: yes or no? Cuff or no cuff? With or without long socks?   There are multiple factors that the admissions advisers look at when thinking about admitting a student. GPA and test scores are only a small part of what they consider.   I will say that you have better everything than me when I was in high school and I got in, so I wouldn't worry at all.    Sorry, I'm not really looking for another 270x since my motherboard can't crossfire. Best of luck though!   Hi!  I am selling my Asus R9 270x, used about half a year. This card has never been used for mining, and has only been slightly overclocked. Still in great condition, only a little dusty since I don't have access to compressed air. Comes with everything I got it with, including the original box, molex adapters, crossfire cable, etc. I could play Battlefield 4 on Ultra settings with this! Asking $110 shipped OBO.   I am also considering selling my Gigabyte GTX 770 2GB. I have only used this for about a month, never overclocked. I bought it as a present to myself not realizing that the 900 series would be released so soon, and my return window just passed :( I would like it so I can get some money back for a 970, but I am in no rush to sell it. Make me an offer and I will see if I am willing to part ways with it :) I am looking at somewhere in the realm of $225 shipped.   Pics: http://imgur.com/a/4Az4W  This is my first swap, but I promise I won't scam you!   Thanks for looking!   What kind of headphone stand is that? Looks kind of like a banana stand.   307   I don't understand what you mean by add this code. Put it where exactly? I am at the grouping tab.    Be wary using the like for download on Facebook. It will download a whole lot of Chrome extensions and bloatware if you're not careful.    My SteelSeries Flux In-Ears went through the wash and I need a new pair of IEMs!  **Budget** - ~$100  **Source** - Primarily phone, I have other full sized headphones for desk use.  **Isolation** - Would be appreciated, though with IEMs it's pretty much a given.   **Type** - These need to be IEMs.   **Tonal Balance** - Looking for something more fun? I own a pair of Grado SR325e and I really love how fun they make music sound.   **Past Headphones** - Too many to list. Serious headphones include Grado SR325e, ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DTX 101 iE (though I was very disappointed in the sound of these) and my SteelSeries Flux In-Ears, which were the first IEMs that made me say "wow".   Looking at Havi B3 Pro-1 and Philips Fidelio S1.  Thanks!      Make sure you're clicking directly in the Mouse column and not the Keyboard column. Sounds dumb but I was having trouble getting my Razer Deathadder to button map and this helped.       I have a Cooler Master N200 ([Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119274)) used for only a year in like new condition, no huge scrapes or scratches or anything. Could use a good cleaning, sorry I don't have a hose or I'd do it myself! Name your price and your location to determine shipping price. Will come with two 120mm fans.    You are looking for stuff like Glitchhop. Check out their subreddit! /r/Glitchhop   If you go to the About Chrome page and you're running the Android L Preview, it says the android version number is 4.4.99. Interesting...   Just wait until you get on campus and go to your first class to purchase any books for that class. Then you will know for sure whether or not you really need the textbook instead of spending a lot of money now on a textbook you won't use at all. You won't be at a disadvantage either since you will probably not use the book at all for the first few weeks anyways, giving you a lot of time to get the right book if you really need it.   If you MUST get a book now, the textbook that most algebra and calculus classes use is Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals (Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Calculus-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/1133112285)). The demand is very high for this book so if you buy it now and find out you don't need it you could sell it to some other freshman very easily.   Easiest case is just to wait until you really know what book your class uses and if you really need it or not.    From what I know, you can use the first and second generation touch and type covers on the Pro 3, it just won't cover the screen all the way.   If you're waiting a while before purchase see how much money you have when you want to buy, and how much the Surface Pro 2 goes down in price. I think your decision will be much clearer then.   	47

We don't do meta posts for the same reason we don't do  brony posts - it's not technology-related and we are a technology sub. There are plenty of forums for it, but like it or loathe it, we do need to make calls on submissions. We aim to do so openly and transparently, as reddit expects. You're free to complain, or to call us out if you think we're getting it wrong, can chat with us anytime. If you have suggestions, we'll happily hear them, and consider. This is how we came up with our rules, through subscriber consensus. Laws of the sub for the sub by the sub. Anything we change will also require consultation and approval by the sub.

And I (we) approve of all our mods, and don't hesitate to call each other out if we appear to stray from our mission to serve and deliver. Peace out.   Yeah, we have the same arguments. What do you do when it's about a tech company but really more business-related, but has ended up popular? Damned if we do, damned if we don't delete. We are looking at the rules to see if we can hone them (subject to sub approval obviously). I'm not 'murikano, so I really don't give a fuck about Comcast, but upvotes say pplz do. Now, is it tech relevant? Y'see, mod dilemma..what do current technology subscribers enjoy vs what should technology sub be That is our problem, and if you have an easy solution, share it. we're damned either way, on the left we drown in fluff and Comcast. on the right do we go hardcore tech on the left. As a general sub, we have to remain a broad techology spectrum. We do have filters, we do have flairs you can filter by. We will never please all the people all the time, it's impossible. Feel free to complain, but undersand we're everything tech-related and delivering as streamlined a service as we can for free. if you have any constructive suggestions as to how we could make it better, we'd welcome that and discuss it. All mods (aside from 2 originals who don't do much) are post shitstorm..was drafted in to fix things. We are not evil, don't paint us with a broad outdated brush. Can say, current mod team is decent. And /u/creq will be creq, you want a creq in your life, keeps shit real..    New mods, valid reversals. Our rules were selected by the pplz, voted on and adopted. Some are somewhat vague, which is helpful because it's hard to nail down in one law what can apply to every situation. Should broadly make sense when people read it. But we don't want to preclude valid posts in the technology sphere. Thankfully our readers are extremely helpful in flagging the bad, and frankly I'm proud of the effort of our mod team, coming here each day, cleaning up judiciously, approving, flairing (so you can filter), for nothing more than we like tech. You can yell at us, but I'd prefer you don't. If you have a specific issue, please do.   Maybe you missed the extensive consultation process. And no it wasn't. The reason behind no meta is that this is a technology sub, and there are plenty of subs that grievances, real or imagined, can be aired in. It's not something that belongs in a sub about technology. Not in any way hiding from it, you could also ask us directly, we need feedback, and if valid, after discussion, we may change. We are your friends, not some elite with agendas. We are students, professionals, loners, scriptkiddies, unemployed,wise, annoying..and in my case devilishly attractive on top of all of that. Cut us some slack, or just talk to us.   Well I haven't seen the specific history, so can't comment on that. I will vouch for creq as a decent human being. And appreciate that he was the canary in the coalmine that exposed the [mod corruption](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-censorship-technology-drama-default/) that nearly killed /r/technology, and I guarantee he's fair and balanced (noit in a Fox way, but like what the words mean), but feel free to message me directly anytime with issues if that would be preferable. We do welcome feedback, ultimately we are trying to just deliver a quality tech stream. For little thanks, but I take the masses that aren't complaining as a good sign. Again, feel free to yell at me/us whenever you see us mess up, helps us improve.   So have I..and he really hasn't in excess, and always to keep to rules. We have new mods learning the ropes, mot something you need to get mad about.We're just tech fans trying to deliver tech stuff to you. Getting mad at us..is unwarranted. Talk to us anytime. We understand as well that no matter what we do, someone is going to be pissed off. But generally am happy with us today. Constructive criticism always welcome obv.   Oh..may have misinterpreted..just message the mods, button on the leftbar..we will respond, toute de suite depending on timezone, but modcrew are pretty global now.     That's because subclause of Rule 1 (as chosen, voted upon by all y'all) is no meta posts.    Lol! We have quite the congenial and collaborative mod team these days. Tekkies by profession, infoaddicts by nature..the mod hiring process is exhaustive. New crew just drafted in! You can check all that out too if you like. It's a rather time-consuming and thankless role, but ehh, we care..   Jebus cripes..was unintentional mishap in tweaking, we will always remain open. Feel free to yell at us anytime if we deserve it, fair call. Or, y'know, tell us if something ain't right, we'll look at it, sort it, and appreciate the feedback.

    Yeah, no, not exactly.... Nudity done in protest is sometimes deemed to be protected speech, but it's not always. (Otherwise, every strip club in the country would have full nude dancing "in protest".)  It's a tough case to make, not easy.   Um, no. Your claim that an indecent exposure charge is "easily beaten under a First Amendment defense" is simply not true. Nudity can be protected speech, but it's rare and simply being naked in public isn't enough to be protected. To quote Justice Souter's concurring opinion in 1991's Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, "Nudity itself is not inherently expressive conduct."   Excellent-thanks, /u/rawnoodles10 , /u/TerraOperative , and /u/bobroberts7441 . I'm glad my instincts that it's the power steering causing the vapor weren't far off.   Hi Reddit. I have a '98 Corolla with about 117,000 miles on it or so. Last month, I saw some white vapor coming out of my hood, took it to the local mechanic, and they found nothing wrong. Then it started making a bad sounding noise under the hood, and I mentally prepared to start looking for cheap used cars. Fortunately, I took it to my trusted mechanic (not as local since I moved, but still localish), and they said I was low on power steering fluid. Put some in, noise went away, great!  Except today, I saw white vapor (with a not-so-great smell) under the hood again. I noticed it after I had to move the wheel back and forth to get out of a terribly-designed parking lot, which makes me thing that maybe the vapor is the power-steering overheating when I move the wheel? Would that make sense, and if so, what are the possible causes? (And if that doesn't make sense, well, er, what are the possible causes?)  Many thanks in advance for whatever advice you have (besides time to start saving up for a used car *rueful look*)!   Yep-I gave it three chances. They didn't show. I use Uber now.   Oh, definitely not. DSHEA was a huge win for the dietary supplement industry.   Agreed, although I'm unsure that drugs need to be redefined. Instead, I'd do away with the dietary supplement category, redistributing supplements to the food or drug categories. Things like ginkgo should be regulated as drugs.   It's not a technicality-your complaint is that these items should have information that inform consumers how to use them as drugs. The simple answer is that if they are intended to be used as drugs, they need to go through the premarket process to become drugs!   Herbal products can make some health claims, but they cannot claim to treat, cure, mitigate, or diagnose diseases or conditions. Any product that makes such a claim, be it herbal or otherwise, is a drug and needs premarket approval from the FDA.  Herbal products can't state a dosage because they cannot claim to treat, cure, mitigate, etc., and those claims are tied to dosages.  It's not that herbal products are being specially targeted-classifying things as drugs, cosmetics, devices, food, and supplements are fundamental aspects of the regulatory structure in the U.S., and products are defined by the claims they make.   This is a question for your lawyer. Generally, you cannot gain good title to stolen property through theft. Restitution is not the same paying for the items you stole. But, theoretically, the amount of restitution you would have to pay could have been lessened by the return of stolen goods (pre-trial, not now).   Respectfully, if you are claiming that DSHEA was passed at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry or that it unfairly limits/restricts/confines dietary supplements, you're mistaken. DSHEA was passed at the behest of the dietary supplement industry itself. It was the biggest legislative victory they could have hoped for-a massive giveaway to the industry.  Dietary supplements are exempt from the premarket approval safety and efficacy requirements of drugs, they are exempt from the premarket approval safety requirements of food, and they can make health claims that foods are not allowed to make.  Dietary supplements are not confined to a status. Food and drug law is entirely reliant upon classification as to what they are, classifications that are largely based on manufacturers' claims. Change the claim, change ingredients as needed, and you can become a drug or food.  After some bad publicity about the ingredients of supplements, some energy drink manufacturers voluntarily chose to reclassify their products from dietary supplement to food. This merely requires ensuring that the ingredients meet the safety requirements of food (generally recognized as safe, etc.) and changes the sort of claims the manufacturers can make about the product.  Note that supplement manufacturers don't want drug status. The whole point of operating in the dietary supplement space is to circumvent the requirements of demonstrating safety, efficacy, and going through the process of becoming an approved drug. If the maker of supplement X were to want to make a drug claim (as in X cures Y), they'd have to file a New Drug Application with the FDA, do clinical trials, there'll be a back and forth with the FDA on efficacy and safety, etc. The supplement sphere avoids all this.   This is the sort of escalation that occurs when judges are soft on perpetrators of picnic basket theft.      I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. If you are assuming that repealing DSHEA to restore the FDA's jurisdiction over dietary supplements would lead to an increase in their cost, I disagree and note that the cost of energy drinks is pretty much the same, whether they are currently classified as foods or as supplements.   Yes-the FTC enforces the relevant law against false and deceptive advertising, but they have limited resources and even then, can only take on a product once it is on the market making false or deceptive claims. Moreover, the FTC generally has to rely on court actions.  The FDA, on the other hand, can deal with unsafe ingredients before they make it to market, and can often get products off of shelves via administrative actions that do not require a lengthy court procedure.   Congress is right that there's a problem, but they should be blaming themselves for it. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 stripped the FDA of most regulatory oversight over dietary supplements. Drugs and food must be shown to be safe to be on the market. Not so for dietary supplements. Drugs must be shown to be effective to be on the market. Not so for dietary supplements.  Take energy drinks as an example. In your average grocery store cooler, you'll find cans of energy drinks that are regulated as food and others that are regulated as dietary supplements, side by side. The average consumer has no idea that most ingredients of the cans that say Nutritional Facts on the label have to be shown to be generally recognized as safe before going on the market, whereas the cans that say Supplement Facts have no assurance of safety.   *coughs*Henrietta Lacks*coughs*   Weird Al puts on amazing live performances. He doesn't take an intermission (although there are 5 minute video clips throughout the show to give him time to switch costumes), and yet he puts on an incredibly high energy show from start to finish.   Thanks. :) And I'm with you on preferring a firmer fish.  I like my fish cooked all the way through-I was hoping sous vide could help me avoid having the outside be just right but the core not being cooked-but only just cooked through.   It wasn't so much a recipe as it was looking at the various charts out there of egg cooking times, picking a time, and putting the eggs, in shell, in the water bath.  I did a 65 egg, which made the yolk spreadable, almost jelly-like (and utterly delicious on brioche!). Left it in the water bath for about an hour.   That sounds tasty-thanks!   How do you all store your Anova when it's not in use? Do I need some sort of case or do I just stick it in a cabinet once its dry?   *nods* Thanks, okcukv.   I got my Anova this morning, and so the first thing I did was make sous vide eggs, which came out beautifully! Tonight, I tried to make salmon, and it came out with the texture of cat food and with what, I am guessing, might be the flavor of cat food too. I'm not sure what I did wrong (maybe everything, I don't know?).  I used frozen sushi-grade salmon from Whole Foods, put it directly in the water bath without thawing it in the fridge, set the water bath for 52C, and left it there for an hour.  Did I go wrong with the frozen salmon? Did I go wrong with the temperature? Did I leave it in there too long (I thought that it was hard to overcook things based on leaving it in the water bath for a sustained period of time?) I know that by putting it in the water bath from the frozen state, I didn't season it or flavor it ahead of time, but that wouldn't affect the texture or the deeply unpleasant flavor.   You don't read as many stories about cab drivers assaulting passengers because it happens too frequently to qualify as national news.   There are plenty of successful lawyers who were not on law journal. Your odds of being a successful lawyer drops significantly, however, if you find yourself before the Honor Board. It's just not worth getting disciplined by your school and potentially have trouble with the character and fitness committee. Do the right thing.

President John Adams and the entire membership of the Senate in 1797 would disagree with Al Bedrosian, given Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli   Welcome to the Dartmouth family! /u/stepintomyd0j0 has good suggestions. My only addition is to note that L.L. Bean has an amazing return policy (AKA they let you return pretty much anything at any time). If you are unused to New England winters, I might suggest getting things from L.L. Bean so that if they turn out to not be warm enough, or a good fit, or otherwise to your liking/comfort, you can return them and get something else.   Yep! I had one 10 years ago back in my time working tech support for a university. An older professor came in with his PowerPC tower and said he had a broken cupholder-I was both horrified and excited to learn the legends were true. :P   Did you even read my comment? I agree that Israel, like any country, does things one might criticize, and that criticizing Israel is not a sign of anti-semitism. If one only criticizes Israel, anti-semitism may become a reasonable inference.  Russia's genocidal policies towards the Chechens eclipsed anything Israel has done towards Palestinians, and yet Roger Waters voiced no criticism of them and indeed, continues to perform in Russia. (Not to mention Russian persecution of homosexuals, current actions towards the Ukraine, the invasion of Georgia, the murder of journalists (such as Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, and Stanislav Markelov), etc.)  China's human rights violations are of such a scale, it is difficult to choose a place to begin. Given that Waters has invoked apartheid in his criticism of Israel, however, perhaps a good starting point is China's discrimination towards it rural workers as part of the hukou system. Many have described the hukou system as apartheid (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm , for example). China's actions towards Tibet could be said to be analogous to apartheid. And yet Waters voices no criticism of China. And Roger Waters performs in China.   Waters has repeatedly played in China and Russia. He played in Venezuela while Hugo Chavez was in power.  Criticizing Israel does not equal being anti-semitic. Criticizing ONLY Israel, however, and one has to wonder.   Ah! That makes sense. I hadn't realized that the Virginia tax rate included local taxes.   How are the taxes not as bad? I'd have to earn a quarter of a million dollars to pay the same tax rate in Maryland that I pay in Virginia?      Please don't down vote me into oblivion for saying thisI have a hard time visualizing math. But I looked at tax rates just the other day, and I was surprised that Virginia state income tax rate seems higher for me than Maryland would be.  Virginia's tax rate (unless I'm doing this wrong), for people earning over $17,000 a year, is 720+5.75% of the excess over $17000. Maryland's tax rate for people earning $3,000-$100,000 per year is $90+4.75% for the excess over $3,000.  To be taxed at the 5.75% Virginia is, I'd have to earn over $250,000 and it would only be 5.75% for the amount in excess over $250,000 (plus $12,700).  Am I missing something? (And again, that's not a rhetorical question, I'm truly wondering if I'm missing something?)  *EDITED to add the word Virginia in the last sentence of first paragraph.   Yay! I hope more schools move to that model.   I don't understand why property law is a required 1L course. All the other core classes cover area of law that one might practice in. Property Law The Class is just scraps of whatever couldn't be turned into its own class, like Wills and Estates, Real Estate, Taxation, etc., and so it encompasses almost nothing practical. A 2 week session covering black letter, common law claims like conversion, stolen property, trespass, etc. would be sufficient!  Property should be replaced by Administrative Law. Like the rest of the 1L core, Admin. is its own area of practice, and it is an area of practice that is a fundamental element of nearly every other area of law. I didn't take Admin. law until I went back for my LL.M., and in retrospect, I really regret not taking it as a 2L. There were so many upper-level courses I took as a 2L and 3L that were heavily admin. law based, and my understanding of them would have been so much better had I been given a fuller understanding of Chevron, Auer, Meade, Skidmore, etc.   It's doable, but only you can say if you're overextending yourself. How much sleep you'll need, how much study time you'll need, etc., those are the big things to consider, and nobody here can answer that for you.  0 debt would be an awesome thing. But it's also important that you get the very best grades you can, network at every law school event that puts you in touch with practitioners, etc. If you're coming into classes exhausted every day, that's not good.   Not to repeat myself, but Scalia's dissent Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center is the biggest bizarre shift in rationales, given the doctrinal importance of Auer and given that Auer was an unanimous decision that Scalia himself authored.  (There have been major logical inconsistencies in terms of Chevron, Meade, and Skidmore [and Auer] as well, but I will be fair and note that that problem doesn't fall just on Scalia's shoulders but on the shoulders of the entire Court.)   (See, for example, Scalia's dissent in Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center, where Scalia blasts the majority opinion in Auer v. Robbins without any acknowledgement that he wrote the darn opinion in Auer himself!)   On the other hand, his administrative law decisions have become increasingly erratic over time. This was not the first time he has, without explanation of how he has evolved on the matter or even why stare decisis shouldn't apply, criticized the natural consequence or the rule of an administrative law decision he authored. It's just the first time he misstated the facts of the case.   No, same price throughout.   Dorms vary greatly at Dartmouth. Some (like East Wheelock) can be spacious, others not so much. But friends and I always felt comfortable. :-)  And housing isn't guaranteed as far as I recall (*sigh* now I feel old-I don't remember these things), but so long as you don't change your D-plan at the last minute, you shouldn't have a problem getting housing. You most certainly are not expected to house offcampus or at a frat. Many do, but it certainly is not required/expected!   As a law student, in the Fall and Spring, I liked studying at the zoo.   Rand Paul gives two examples that he thinks demonstrates why the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished and both completely fail to support his argument. His example of the NYC rubber rooms with teachers NYC is waiting to fire has nothing to do with federal laws or regulations and everything to do with the structures NY and NYC established. That example is all on the State and city.  Senator Paul's wanting to pay some teachers more, some teachers less, and fire some teachers, also has nothing to do with federal funds, federal regulations, federal laws, or the U.S. Department of Education. That is also a matter of state and local politics/laws/regulations/contracts.  Senator Paul seems to be calling for federal funds to flow to state educational agencies and schools without any federal restrictions on how the funds can be used. Current federal restrictions on funds include allowability (money from a grant has to be used on allowable things that are reasonable/necessary for the grant's purposeno refitting the teacher's lounge with funds intended to help disadvantaged children, for example), accountability/transparency (states/schools must be able to account for how federal funds were spent, i.e. no money disappearing into a black hole), federal funds must supplement and not supplant state/local funds (federal funds are supposed to boost schools but not be a way for states to take money they would have spent on education and spend it elsewhere or lower taxes, etc.), etc. No states or territories are required to accept federal education money, but if they take it, it comes with federal strings. It's not just a pool of free money to run out and buy every teacher and student an iPad.  The U.S. Department of Education plays no role in curriculum choices. The U.S. Department of Education plays no role in whether or not schools are unionized. The U.S. Department of Education has no role in hiring teachers, firing teachers, or their salaries. Education still IS a state and local matter. The U.S. Department's role in K-12 education is supplemental funds. Yes, the funds come with rules on how they can be spent. No, this doesn't make the U.S. Department of Education incompetent, evil, or unnecessary.   Gotcha. Yes, I agree.... DSHEA is a terrible law. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. It's just that saying that the FDA isn't required to oversee/verify efficacy sounds like they could do it but are choosing not to.   It's not that the FDA allows it, it's that the FDA is unable to prohibit it. (First Amendment.)   Not quitebecause of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA isn't ALLOWED to oversee or verify the efficacy or safety of many dietary supplements and their ingredients. It's not the FDA's fault.   Government bodies with bureau in the name are often a subdivision of a larger agency. The FBI's parent agency is the Department of Justice. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is part of the Department of the Interior. That said, the National Park Service is also part of the Department of the Interior. That the one has bureau in the name and one doesn't has no legal significanceit's purely a question of naming.   The IRS is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Patent and Trademark Office is part of the Department of Commerce,  the Food and Drug Administration is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (and prior to 1940 was part of the Department of Agriculture), etc. It's just the name that Congress chose to give them.  All of the examples you gave, by the way, ARE agencies. They all have statutes that outline their authority and area of influence. That the FBI doesn't have agency in its name and the CIA does has no legal significance. Both are agencies as a matter of administrative law.   Rand Paul gives two examples that he thinks demonstrates why the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished and both completely fail to support his argument.

Agencies have the power to regulate in the field delegated to them by Congress, but statutes trump regulations. Agencies get to interpret statutes and their interpretation of vague statutes is generally deferred to by the courts, but if the statute is clear, it is what it is.  So yes, Congress can certainly pass legislation that would ensure net neutrality. Would they? Almost certainly not-too many legislators are in telecom companies' pockets.   Yes, as others have said, you can (and need) to get it inspected before you get it registered. You do not need to have the title to get it inspected.  (I got my car inspected in VA a few months before I moved there, just to make sure there were no surprises with my car.)   And the relevance is....? He was arrested in the US for crimes committed in the US, he'll be tried in the US, and if found guilty, will be jailed in the US. He wasn't in Germany or other countries in the world-he was in the US.   No different than what's said at the [NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-inmate-conviction-overturned-1980-behind-bars-article-1.1761084) or [The Root](http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/04/this_inmate_s_conviction_was_overturned_in_1980_but_he_s_still_in_prison.html?wpisrc=burger). The real fail is that only a few papers have covered this horror show so far.         Reading the [NYT article by Adam Liptak](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04felony.html) the Alternet article references, Ryan Holle was aware that his car was going to be used as part of a robbery. The article states that Holle himself testified "that he had been told it might be necessary to 'knock out' Jessica Snyder."  If one wishes to debate the appropriateness of the felony murder rule, we can have that debate, but it is intellectually dishonest for Charles Grodin to present this case as though Holle had no knowledge his car would be used for a crime.   Crystal City and Pentagon City are pretty comparable, but Pentagon City has more immediate access to greenery through the park at 15th and South Joyce Street. Also, Pentagon City has the benefit of a 24 hour grocery store being right there. (It's one metro stop away if you live in Crystal City, but personally, I like being able to walk to Harris Teeter.)  If Pentagon City has the benefit of having Harris Teeter, Crystal City has the benefit of more upscale dining options.  It's one metro stop (or a 5 minute cab ride) between the two, so, really, either one is a good spot to live in.   Really? I mean, I wouldn't hang out at the mallway too many touristsbut I never have a problem getting too and from the metro, and the mall food court is convenient when I want to pick up something quick and cheap on my way home.    The Archstone building is REALLY close to the metro. And the Pentagon City Mall is right above the metro stop, so, that's right there too (not just Macy's, Nordstroms, Apple, and all the usual mall stores, but don't forget the convenience of the food court, which includes a Panera, McDonalds, Chipotle, Subway, etc.). You'd be right across the street from Costco, CVS, CPK, Chevy's, etc., a block away is Rite Aid, World Market, Noodles   Co, a thai place, a sports bar, an Irish pub,  and one block beyond that is Harris Teeter (grocery store) and Bed, Bath, and Beyond. You'd also be in walking distance of the Aurora Hills branch of the Arlington library, which is small, but they are quick to get in books from the rest of the Arlington library system if you put in a request.  I'm not sure what iidesune is talking about-it's an easy commute with no need to switch to the Red Line. You'd take the Blue Line from Pentagon City to Farragut West. It's five stops, and would take you around 19 minutes.  Do you have any specific questions about Pentagon City I could help with?   I do remember Spitzer stepping down. I remember Weiner stepping down. I don't remember Senator Vitter (R) stepping down after embroilment in a prostitution scandal (or scandals). Because he didn't. I don't remember Former SC Governor Mark Sanford (R) stepping down after sneaking away to Argentina, without telling anyone and therefore leaving his state without anyone in charge, to see his mistress, who he has since married, and oh, right, he's now in Congress.  Senator Vitter and Congressman Sanford both bill themselves as family values Republicans. Sanford referred to his own cheating on his wife (and by not following procedures to put the Lt. Governor in charge in his absence, cheating on his State) by saying "I think we all need grace and we all need love" but that love we all need doesn't apply to the LGQBT community because he is opposed to same sex marriage. Senator Vitter, who engaged in regular sex with prostitutes (allegedly with a diaper involved), is also an opponent of same-sex marriage.  Don't hump my leg and tell me you tripped, Senator and Congressman.   Suing another student for slander/defamation sounds like a great way to make an impression on a character and fitness application or committee.   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Federal crime.   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Federal crime.   Reason 16: The official sport of Maryland is jousting.    As others have said, every jurisdiction has its own quirks if not outright differences in criminal law.   Nancy Grace is right that there IS a misconception that premeditation always requires a plan or intent beforehand, it can be formed in the twinkling of an eye, but that is not necessarily true in South Africa.   This notice/FAQ does not require notice and comment. It's not a regulation. It's non-regulatory guidance. Other than that, you're not wrong, but you're giving people like /u/paleh0rse an inaccurate impression of the process.  This is non-regulatory guidance. It is not binding. It does not have the force of law in and of itself. It is, however, a statement outlining how the IRS intends to carry out its responsibilities and use its authority under existing law.  The IRS is stating its position that under existing law, bitcoins are treated as property for federal tax purposes, etc. If someone does not follow the guidance, the IRS cannot punish them for not following the notice, but they CAN attempt to punish them for violating the statutes and regulations that the IRS based the notice on.  This isn't a proposal. This is a statement of what the IRS believes the existing laws and regulations require and how the IRS will proceed. If you disagree with this interpretation, one can certainly make the argument that the IRS is wrong, but I sure wouldn't want to be the test case.   I can't EL5 (administrative law is a bit more complex than Schoolhouse Rock), but I can explain it. Administrative agencies all derive their power from some sort of enacting legislation (also known as an organic statute). The enacting legislation creates an agency and defines its authority and role. (There can be multiple statutes that govern an agency.)  Agencies are essentially delegated power through the enacting legislation over a certain sphere. In the example of the IRS, their sphere of delegated authority is taxation.  Congress does not need to decide the legal status of Bitcoin first because it has delegated the authority to make that determination to the IRS. An agency cannot go against the express will of Congress as reflected in the plain language of a statute. If, however, a statute is ambiguous, it is the role of an agency to fill in the gaps of the legislation.   I was in DC when I posted this.      If you have a HD television, it looks much, much better than DVDs. I thought DVDs would be as good as I'd ever need. Then I got a better TV and tried out blu-ray, and I was blown away. From action films to documentary to Disney films, blu-rays are much, much sharper than DVDs.   *friendly wave* What sort of things are you in to? :-) Movies, or games, or golf, or bowling, etc.?   There is so little guidance from the Supreme Court on school speech that I hesitate to call anything a straightup ____ case. I think Tinker should apply here, but I can see (not agree with, but see) justices finding Bethel v. Fraser to apply.   It's not uncommon for me to tap my card repeatedly and it not be recognized. I then go over to the next faregate and it works the first try. Why does this happen?   You might need to define walking distance, but there are a lot of restaurants along Crystal Drive. McCormick   Schmick or Legal Seafood are excellent at .7 and .9ish miles respectively, there's Ted's Montana Grill, there's Kora, and the like. Oh, and for Spanish tapas, there's Jaleo. You might want to start calling and see if they have reservations available.   For those interested in kick-ass female musicians, give Katzanjammer a try. They're an amazing Norwegian pop band with four women who play a gazillion different instruments each. Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHcklZEi1kk    If you're into lyrics, give Eddie from Ohio a try. They're a Virginia-based folk-rock band.   Does it make a difference? It's not as though the President's budget is going anywhere... When the time comes, there'll be another fight followed by another continuing resolution.   Sure. The Fourth Amendment protects people from illegal searches by government actors or agents, not by random people. Theoretically, evidence of a crime stolen by a robber can be used against the robbery victim. It gets more complex in practice, but as far as the Constitution goes, nothing unconstitutional about it.   Not just roads. Sidewalks too, even after folks shoveled. MetroRail running does me no good if I can't walk the 3 blocks to the station without falling.    OPM just called itwe have a snow day tomorrow.   WMATA has announced it will not be running buses tomorrow morning. None. Given this, I think the govt. has to close tomorrow, with the announcement hopefully going out tonight. http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=5672   Arguing that publicizing Gox's losses is what killed Gox is akin to arguing that efforts to expose Bernie Madoff as running a ponzi scheme is what caused his investors to lose their money.  Publicizing the issues stopped the scheme from continuing on a little longer, but that's not the same as a rescue! Accepting deposits but not making withdrawals put Mt. Gox on the same level as a ponzi scheme, and no merger or buyout was going to be able to fix that issue.   Aren't bitcoins intended to be a currency and not securities?   It is simple. It isn't all positive, but it's simple.   Oh please. In light of the recent news reports and the reports' repercussions? There are minimal repercussions unless the reports are true. And if the reports are true, it's not the news reports that doomed MtGox, but their own behavior and operations.   Oh please. In light of the recent news reports and the reports' repercussions? There are minimal repercussions unless the reports are true. And if the reports are true, it's not the reports that will have doomed MtGox, but their own behavior and operations.   Excellent timing. :-)   I'll look into that too! :) Thanks.   Ooh-thanks! That sounds promising. :-)   Cool, thanks! :-)   Hi all. I was wondering if any of you know of any good magic shows for adults in the DC area? I was thinking of going to Glenn Gary's Parlor Magic Show at some point, but never got around to it, and it has apparently since closed.  Are there any other regularly scheduled magic acts anywhere?   Thanks for the information! :) I'm really looking forward to this. One last question. Does the VIP pass only allow getting in the front of the line for one guest (not me as the one guest, but rather, is it only good to get to the front of the line to see, say, Ernie Hudson but not Ernie and Dirk Benedict)?   This looks really awesome. I've never been to a con before, but I think I'm going to go to this one. My question, though, is which ticket should I get? If I don't get the Geekend VIP pass, does that mean it is harder to get autographs/photo-ops? Will there be enough priority panel seating at each panel for VIPs to be reasonably assured of getting a spot?    When I was doing writing coaching, I charged time and a half for last minute jobs...   Which isn't to say that I'm fully on your side. :P I am perfectly comfortable with people being expelled based solely on allegations, but it is based on the totality of the evidence as part of a fair an equitable process.  Fairness is binarya process is either fair or unfair. Is there anyone ready to stand up for expulsions as part of an unfair process?   Childress's argument before the panel seems to be that those found guilty of sexual misconduct should be expelled without going through a fair and equitable process. That expulsions should occur on what school administrators "know". The problem, of course, is that what we "know" and what we can prove in a fair and equitable process are often different, and many mistakes are made when people focus on the former.   Good grief. Inside Higher Education quotes Linda Farstein as an analyst/consultant, with no mention of her history as a New York prosecutor A checkered career at best, given her appalling conduct in the Central Park Jogger case where she abused her position to help railroad five teenagers into wrongful convictions for rape. Years later, she showed no remorse or ability to objectively review evidence, by opposing the NY DA's recommendation to vacate the wrongful convictions.  Which isn't to say that Ms. Childress should be judged by the ideological company she keeps, but I am appalled by her words that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process. I am all for expelling students after an evidence-based, fair and equitable process. An allegation is evidence. An allegation may even be all the evidence required in some cases. But the notion that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process is probably the same sort of internal justification that allowed Fairstein to work so hard and putting (and then keeping) five innocent kids in prisonher job came to be about representing victims instead of doing justice and being the People's representative.   Did Sonny Curtis or Bobby Fuller actually rob people with a six-gun?   I had one of those when working at a university help desk 11 or so years ago... Until an older professor came in with his tower PC with a broken cup holder, I thought those stories were just a myth!   Deborah Lipstadt's 1993 book "Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust" is an interesting look at your question. It's been a few years since I've read it, but if I recall correctly, the reporters who were aware what was going on early on were initially disbelieved because there were rumors of German atrocities in WWI that turned out to be false. Some people, including editors, thought that what they were hearing were more of the same false rumors.   Which is rather irksome in an age where money is deemed to be speech when it comes from corporations, but federal employees can't post forward a fundraising email from the DNC, RNC, etc. to their closest friends.      I found the E E to be really unhelpful for Admin. It is unusual for me to recommend a casebook as a supplement, but Andrew Popper's "Administrative Law: A Contemporary Approach" is laid out in an easy-to-use format, akin to an outline. I'd suggest spending the $40 to rent this for a term over $40 on the E E. http://www.amazon.com/Administrative-Law-Contemporary-Interactive-Casebooks/dp/0314255575/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1391721533 sr=8-1 keywords=andrew+popper   I had no idea that moving one's car to a different space wasn't enough to avoid getting a ticket, so, I thought this article might be helpful for others, too!      Yes, it can. Exact criminal charge depends on the jurisdiction. Could be vandalism, criminal mischief, or other things along those lines.  	110
 If browser wasn't an option, I would say camera. I wouldn't mind carrying an iPad /kindle around for reading, and small radio for music, but to carry around a point and shoot is way too clunky.  and you know what - that kinda describes the evolution of the mobile phone. Camera was almost universally the first feature added after calls and texts.    Candidly - you can't cram for such an interview. Also if you do get the job by pretending to know 12+ technologies, you are just setting yourself up for failure on the job which can be detrimental to your reputation in the long run.  Brush up on the 4-5 things you know and make sure you come across really strong and confident in those areas. If they probe on the other areas - be clear and confident that although you aren't up to speed on the other topics - you are a fast learner, are eager to contribute and build a skill set and be a positive force at the job.  Our best bet is coming across as earnest, hardworking and very knowledgable at the things you do know. Sometimes the most powerful thing to say in an interview is "I am not skilled at that but I intend to learn it very quickly and have experience with other similar technologies today". If you try and fake it, you will get caught out either at the interview, or later on the job.    Good luck.       I never really appreciated him until I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel. And then I had to go back and see all his films. The visuals are just stunning.    wow. If I was the guy in the wetsuit, the shark would have seen the great brown.       I agree with your point. I have used those tools and the quality of international engineers is a huge positive surprise. Its no where near as good as working side by side with someone but as collaboration tools get better and better, it's much easier to work with someone really talented in Eastern Europe or Asia (I find Latam / Eastern Europe easier from a timezone perspective than Asia)  So the bigger worry than H1Bs is really these tools (odesk / upwork) becoming more mainstream and moving up the value chain, and unlike H1B's which are regulated strongly, there is no way to protect an American workforce from technological changes like this.  The only way forward has to be continued and easy access to training and education.   In all the focus on STEM majors by the tech world and increasingly by politicians, what is forgotten is that the US has some of the best liberal arts schools in the world, and the combination of the humanities and technology is potent. Other countries can easy produce great programmers, but they are unlikely to produce great technologists in the same volume with a well-rounded, broad-based skill set.   The path forward for the US cannot be purely STEM but access to STEM+business / arts / design / humanities in a high quality, easy and affordable way.  The biggest outsourcing worry we have is that college is way too expensive and delivers too little value for the money.      I appreciate the sentiment but the shower thought I wish you had was  - why do countries and imaginary boundaries matter any more. Patriotism is just a false hangover from the high of abdicating our own responsibilities to professional leaders.     vegan raw lasagna (it was nothing like lasagna)   Tipping.   Speaking of which - thats my favorite episode in Third Rock from the Sun   I love Rock and Roll Star by Oasis or Spaceman by The Killers to get me going.    Assuming that you have tracked your calorie intake / outflow appropriately - it might be worth seeing a doctor to check if your thyroid is fine. Hypothyroidism can result in weight gain / inability to lose weight. Its not probable - chances are your condition can be explained by nutrition but worth checking.             To quote the great Aretha Franklin:  R-E-S-P-E-C-T Find out what it means to me R-E-S-P-E-C-T Take care, TCB     Valyrian steel?!   Just kidding thats fictional but the idea for Valerian steel in GoT / Asoiaf is from Damascus steel which no one has still been able to reproduce perfectly today:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel        Candidly - not really. The 1.5 years is just a guideline. I think it looks bad if you leave a job too early, and you miss out on the chance to really evaluate the job / company. Don't fret on the exact number of months, but make sure you feel like you can talk to a holistic experience at that job.    I can suggest the following rule-of-thumb: 1. If you have already done more than a 1.5 years in your current job, you should always be looking. Doesn't have to mean sending your resume out to 100s of other companies, but look at the job sites and see what piques your interest. This regular market check makes sure you aren't just staying out of inertia. 2. Before that period - its too early to judge a job or a company (unless its downright nasty)  Rule of thumb 3 (assuming you are competent at your current job and the issues you describe aren't performance related as it sounds like from your post) - push for more responsibility. As in take it on - don't ask. Pioneer a special project that the company needs badly but no one has gotten around to take ownership (large companies have tons of those), try and take the initiative. If you feel like that is getting noticed and appreciated, and as a result you are enjoying the job more - its a good place to be. If you feel like people are resistant, you are getting more questions than support - then its time to leave.  I have absolutely stayed at a company too long. And sometimes the job gets different, but not better but it "feels" like its better. I have found only when I push for more responsibility and try and take charge of my career, I get a sense for the real values / culture of the company and then my decision is clear.   Love this story and this idea! Don't love the idea of having to read the book on China's communist readers (sounds a little dense but probably better than I am imagining)  Semi-related. My first gift for my girlfriend at the time (now wife) was a kindle with a copy of my favorite books that I wanted her to read. She still thinks its the best present she has gotten.

 I added a gif of playing through one level.   Thank you :)   I've since slowed down the asteroids, but I think it might be too slow now. I just have to find the right balance. I've also increased the firing rate ever so slightly, and thank you for the point abouut the bullets being difficult to see. I'm also thinking of implementing the "hyperspace" mechanic from the original, where you can teleport to a random location on the screen.  Edit: I just looked back at the build I uploaded, and I can't see the the bullets either. This is a glitch, and will hopefully be resolved by replacing the dots I was drawing with proper bullet/rocket sprites.   #Jovian Gasbags Jovian Gasbags is an asteroids clone I'm working on to expand my portfolio. It's in an early state, but it will be done in the next few days. I just want some feedback on how the game plays.

    Thank you r/depression/. I came across this subreddit only the middle of last year and you guys have helped me immensely.  I have a much better understanding of what I feel and why I feel it. Your replies to my few posts and all your posts about your incredibly scary problems are really eye-opening.  The inspiring courage all of you show in standing up, falling, standing up, falling and then amazingly again standing up to your depression is amazing!  Happy (well as happy as we let ourselves be) 2013, great people of this subreddit!   Just curious, what trail(s) will you be following?  My friends are I are visiting the park for 3 days over the new year and we could use some help with trail advice!   Thanks for your advice...2-3 weeks of simple stuff it is!   Thanks! I guess with this and the comment below...I will probably go visit a doc.  The thing is, I'm scared I've pulled a muscle or something. I had a really bad muscle pull once and it lasted for 2-3 months...I could hardly write for a few weeks :s Even though this is evidently much less serious, still wanted to make sure..   I agree completely!  In fact, I've been in the 1% for quite a long time.   Then I realized I'm just cribbing about silly things like animation speed. I want a simple desktop, and that's about it.    Hello all. I'm a SS beginner (BP 120 LBs). Today was the day I was supposed to get to 120 lbs, that is.   I made a dumb mistake and put on 5 instead of 2.5 on both sides. So the weight was 125 instead of 120.  I did 5, then 4 almost to failure. Then I waited for two minutes and tried again. On the the third lift, the weights jerked a little and I snapped it back on the rack, unevenly at that.  So now my right shoulder hurts. It doesn't hurt too bad, so I'm sure it's not serious. It hurts when I open doors, when I try and lift something with my right hand and so on...  It's not serious enough for a doctor for sure, and I think it'll go away with time. But is there anything I can do in the meanwhile?   Thanks for any help and sorry if the question is dumb..   Oh of course! :)   I was just saying that all of the original commenter's advice can be done in processing.   It's the learning and the love for the picture that matters, always. Whether the statue is centered only matters temporarily and only to us, that don't know what the picture means to you.   Why next time? You don't want to do any processing on the current picture?   I've been reasonably happy for the last two weeks. Very different from the bone-crushing nonsense of the whole of last year.  However, I feel like I'm losing something when I'm happy. When I'm confident. When I'm all these things that I'm supposed to strive towards.  I feel like I'm losing a certain depth in my character. A depth that lets me understand me and the world on such a visceral, sensual level. A depth that lets me relate to myself so intimately. A sorrow that's as loving as it's hurtful.  Maybe it's because I haven't been on the positive side of the emotion axis for so long, but happiness is scary.   I really like it when I'm trying to put something into words, click on a post, and the top comment has my thoughts all already laid out neatly in a single sentence. One imaginary internet point to you, Shit Faced Sir/Ma'am!   Thanks for the recommendations! I'll pitch the idea of red River gorge... Looks great!     Sounds like my PhD adviser!   My friends and I were planning to go camping in Mammoth Cave NP for 2 nights + 3 days over New Years.  But now, I've been hearing that there isn't enough to do in Mammoth Cave NP over three days and that the caves are very similar unless you know about caves, which we don't.  Is that true? If so, are there other long/hard trails to do in/around the NP?   We'll be carcamping, not backpacking on this trip. That's the only thing that's certain so far.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!   I bought the $10 kindle edition and read it on my browser and phone (don't even have a kindle!). Works just as well. The chrome app is really good.    Probably Hindi, yes. The script and language are derived from sanskrit.   There are no sanskrit news channels   And it's recursive too. The next step is only the beginning of the other 999!   Well the people have had kids and before they had kids, have not had kids. So I guess it's fair for them to say "...unless you have a kid", about some things. For example, losing a kid.  Though I agree that they shouldn't generalize to all love and loss.    I have to admit...I usually listen only to classic jazz stuff (Miles, Coltrane..the usual suspects). I just stumbled across this video and thought it was awesome!  Oh...Hiromi and Chick Corea are awesome!    Thanks a lot for your help. That looks much better! :)      http://i.imgur.com/ml1L4.jpg  My mother is the bored little girl in the bottom left :) When you zoom the photo into full size, you can see that it's kind of looks like it's painted and not very clear. Is this fixable? Would someone be kind enough to it for me.  EDIT: If you don't want to work on the whole picture, help with just the little girl part of the image is fine too!    When I zoom in, her face is not clear at all. What's the best that can be done?   http://i.imgur.com/ml1L4.jpg  Thanks for any help!   The tough part for me is not focusing on things I can't control. It's even basic: I can't believe I can't control some of the simplest stuff in life. Once I convince myself I'm useless piece of shit that can't even control whether he eats breakfast in the morning, I'll be ready to use this advice.   You don't owe her any explanations.   I've been convincing myself of that too, but hearing someone else say it really helps...Thanks!   I've been an AFC all my life.  And I'm 28 now, almost 29.   Only one three year relationship so far -- AFC, failure, beta, all that crap.   After that, two years in extreme oneitis with a girl. Friendzoned hard because of my constant need for approval from her. I could have learnt something from her...she was always clear about what she wanted, while I was always thinking about what she wanted, not what I wanted.  Until now. A few weeks back, she suddenly gave me IOI. Maybe it was because I was climbing steps in my inner game ladder, but whatever. Once she told me she was always thinking about me, I completely lost it and went back to being a needy, desperate bitch.  I'm not good at approaching. At all. And other personal problems in my life prevent me from actually meeting new people right now.  How do I deal with her? She gave up on me pretty quickly and started going out with someone else.   Well, I know what to do. I need to stay away from her at least for a while, but every day I find myself messaging and asking how she's doing, even with no real response.  So, seddit, now that I'm at rock bottom, I know it's all my fault and I need to get back on the change ladder. How do I deal with this? How do I deal with her?   Oh come on...Reminds me of the girl who introduced me to this song...sigh...  Well, great song anyway, have an upvote!   Thanks! The original draft had a lot more description, but I realized that what I wanted to get across was not what I was drinking and what I was watching, but what I was feeling...Really liberating, in a way :)   Thanks :)      A poem is not the truth   Though it is truer   Than everything else    My glass is here beside me   Empty now   The band plays   The singer sings   And the dancers dance   Only for me.    A poem is not love   And my love is not a poem    Nor is a poem the cure.    No.    It is only a bandage,   Smaller than the wound.      Oh wow thanks!   My BP is really low :( My mom always said my shoulders were my weak spot...Oh well...off to the gym!   Oh? But I feel a bit of fat around the abdominal area...But I guess lean is about right... I shall take your advice!   In fact, I started squatting at 95 lbs! The book, in fact said that it's better to start low than start high, so I went low low low :)  Thanks!   Doing Starting Strengths (1 month now and this is where I am):  Squats: 150 BP: 115 Deadlift: 145 OHP: 65 PC: 65  On rest days I do biking (20-30 miles) or running (6-8 miles) or swimming (not much, maybe 500 yards)  Do those numbers look okay? Sorry I'm asking dumb questions even though it's not Moronic Monday. I really do not have friends who do anything that resembles lifting and it just feels like I'm treading deep waters by myself here.  I'm 6'0 and weigh 160 lbs.  I'm learning PCs on my own (from the book and youtube) and I'm really apprehensive about my form...Any tips about common mistakes that people make are welcome!     When you understand," Brandy says, "that what you're telling is just a story. It isn't happening anymore. When you realize the story you're telling is just words, when you can just crumble up and throw your past in the trashcan," Brandy says, "then we'll figure out who you're going to be.       Yes yes, physical activity counts.  My mom was a yoga teacher, and she was pretty far down the road. She told me once, in one of her random deathbed talks, that in the beginning, she thought that meditation was this thing where you needed to sit and be still and think nothing.  But eventually she realized that everything is and can be meditation. If you are completely focused on what you are doing, whatever it is, you are meditating. For her, life was meditation.  However, to start with, pay attention to your breathing. That's all it takes to start off. Keep your eyes open or closed. Walk if you want, but pay attention to your breathing.   I admit you have a point, irrelevant though the aspersions to my character are, since they are not the topic of discussion here.   It is the curse of famous people to be judged by everyone. Poets, even more since through their poems, we assume we know them as well as they know themselves. Bukowski, even more than that, since honesty (like one of his women) seems to scream and lash out from his poems.     Great poet for sure. But certainly not a great man. He was an alcoholic woman hating (and woman-beating) asshole.   Still one of my favorite authors and inspiration for my own writing, but certainly not a role model for my life.    It's working for other people in other parts of the US, so I'm wondering if it's my laptop or IllinoisNet...   Good!  I mean...well you know what I mean :)   Oh well :( Illinois here...maybe it's my university internet? :s  Thanks!   That's all. Not loading on any browser on my laptop...      I think he's a success because - among other things - he thought that way. I don't think at all that it was any easier for him.   It's not like some rich guy saying that money doesn't matter... Not at all.    Wow...I completely agree with both of you...I wrote those lines as I was thinking them, and I can see now, that the poem is better without them. Whoever reads this next isn't going to see them for sure...  Thanks!   Thanks! I'm trying to start going to the gym regularly...Let's see how it goes..   As for sleep, I'm more on the side of having trouble sleeping than anything else.   He talks of rats and cats   And evolution   And free will.   And I think of you    Wondering if   Under the table   your legs are crossed over his.   Whether your hips are touching  Whether if   At home   You play with your hair In front of him    Whether you fuck like animals   Or stuffed toys   Stuffing each other with joy  My head fills with images   My stomach with pain   My heart with lead    I ask him if he wants anything   He says no  I get myself some tea   And look away into the   Glitter of streetlights.    Thanks a lot! Clearing junk day it is today....Even getting advice seems to help, then thinking that even getting advice helps again induces self-loathing. Ah life :)  Well, I shall clear some junk now, for sure. At least get this bloody table clean...  Thanks again!   I can't convince myself to get therapy. I don't think my problems are serious enough.... I don't know really... My aunt was on therapy and she never got better... Same for my cousin.. Plus, I'm really penniless right now, and there's no way I can afford therapy. I'm even having trouble affording food... Not really, but I'm getting there.  Well, I guess I'm rambling. To answer your question: Nope, no therapy, no meds.       I see stories of people overcoming their shit and I get inspired. Then I try it on myself. I make achievable small goals and I don't achieve them. I think to myself: _It's not me, it's the goals. They need to be smaller_ and I try again with smaller goals.  I don't achieve them and I think to myself: _It's not me, it's the goals. They need to be smaller_ and I try yet again.  Finally I find myself putting away one book instead of cleaning the room and thinking to myself: _What the fuck have I become?_   I find myself unable to stop thinking about the girl. I try to think of her less and think of her more. I let thoughts of her come in freely and they never stop. I care for her. She cares for me, but not like I used to want her to. I no longer know what I want. From her, or from me.  Overall failing quite badly at life. Trying, and then failing again. Trying, and then failing again. I have friends, but no one to talk to about this. Not really. Tell me what to do, dear reddit.   What's a mach loop?    You've lost your edge   Michigander? Are the women Michigeese?       Don't have a song to post. Just wanted to say that the one you posted is really amazing.   Yup, exactly what I meant too. Anyone who considers 50000 repeated words as an excuse to say they completed NanoWriMo is absurd indeed!    But at the same time, NaNo basically lets you write anything and get away with it. 50,000 words of Pokemon fanfiction? Sure. 50,000 words of the same repetitive sentence structure over and over? Fantastic. The word "butt" repeated 50,000 times? You win!  What? No. this month, you're the winner, you're the participant, you're the judge. The website only handles the wordcount.  If a person thinks he/she won by repeating the same word 50,000 times, I don't think the blame rests with the concept of NanoWrimo.  As for Pokemon fanfiction, of course! Who knows what brilliant ideas for space opera, love stories, zombies, adventure you'll come up with on the way to those 50,000 words.   For me, NanoWriMo is about the side effects more than the drug itself.   Submissions? No not really. Only 1/20 front page posts are things people may not have encountered. Go to r/music/new/ and listen to new music!   People upvote what they like. They don't upvote a song just because they haven't heard it.   Yup yup. Completely agree on all counts! My answer was incomplete and hence unfair :)   Technology is lagging behind in battery power. Increasing power available from a battery is where the trouble is. Battery technology is growing much, much slower than everything else related to the smartphones   Not sure what you're asking here. Before methods of starting a fire were discovered, humans couldn't start a fire. That much is obvious.   Are you asking what natural causes CAN start a fire?  Any natural causes that start a fire would still be fine. Lightning, volcanoes, dinosaurs rubbing against each other, stones falling on each other...   Some songs/albums are such that the songs sort of continue into each other. For example, Tool albums, Dream Theater albums, some Electronic albums... So with gapless, you can listen to them well...the way they were meant to be heard -- the beat stays consistent and you get the complete feel for what you're listening to.   Amazing!! Sounds like Muse in a way, but in a very good way. Really cool...  I wish the drums had a fuller sound though...More grand..Can't think of anything else really.      Why, congratulations!   Crossfade fades one song out while fading another in. So there is a point time when both are playing together. Gapless starts the next song immediately after the current one ends.   You can check the EXIF data for the auto-mode shot to get a good starting point :)  HDR would be the only way to do what you ask, I think. Though in this case, I like that the dark foggy areas are dark and foggy.  Really cool picture. I get a very good sense of depth because of the alternate layers of fog and skyline..   A link or a source for where you read this would be helpful.   I think the questions they asked are very good, and he did not have any reasonable answers for any of them. His idea is basically a drawing with lots of words that makes no sense. He's really, really far away from any actual Science.   Sorry I can't help with the DIY, but carpenter guy here has already helped with that. I just want to say - great picture! Nice composition colors...the whole deal! You should post it to /r/itookapicture/ too!       Buzzed driving IS drunk driving!   Also Highway Star!: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZm5EFKImog   For those in the notKnow, Alex Skolnick was the guitarist of heavy metal band Testament... really amazing guitarist...        This has been thought about a lot before. Some people even think that 2pi should be replaced by 'tau' -- a more "fundamental" constant -- and go in to quite a bit of depth on why: http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto    Did you even read the blog? "Also, look how faded the bike path paint is  one can hardy blame pedestrians for walking on it, it looks just like the sidewalk"         Only insofar as the turbulence prevents boundary layer separation. For a well-streamlines body where the laminar boundary layer doesn't separate, laminar flow decreases skin drag for the same form drag. The big difference is, of course, form drag for separated laminar boundary layer vs. attached turbulent BL.  Yup, my bad. You're right!  Hmm..I agree AND disagree with you about circulation theory. I mean, it's the only way to include a viscous phenomena (stagnation point at the trailing edge) in an otherwise completely inviscid analysis. Physically of course, the problem is that we're assuming inviscid flow while squeezing in the effect of viscosity however we can. Because: Without viscosity, we don't have lift. With viscosity, the analysis is crazy.   From the sidebar: http://www.gq.com/how-to/fashion/200608/how-to-buy-a-suit-slideshow?slide=6#slide=15  I hope this his how my suit fits. Will know today evening when the shirt and it come back from alterations!  Thank you for the sidebar! If anyone has any more information, please do let me know!   I recently bought a plain white formal shirt that I thought fit perfectly. However, I went to buy a suit and the salesman guy told me the shirt was too short since the sleeve wasn't visible under the suit. I thought the suit sleeve was too long. He said the suit sleeve was in fact slightly short and the shirt sleeve too short!  The shirt was such that it came up to the end of the wrist. The guy told me that when your hands are relaxed, the suit should come up to 0.5" above the start of the thumb and the shirt all the way to the thumb. He also said my arms are unusually long, so it would be best if I got a shirt tailored.  I trusted him and took the leap. I'm just wondering if what he said actually makes sense...Thanks!      Highly opinionated list ordered based only on the order I thought about them.  1. Kopi -- Coffee's okay, place is very nice, 50c refills 2. Pekara - Coffee's better than okay, place is okay 3. Paradiso - Coffee's pretentiously okay, place is pretentiously okay, everything is pretentiously expensive.  4. Panera - Coffee's okay (Free refills if you take the mug!), place is okay except for mealtimes 5. Starbucks - Meh 6. Giuliani - :( :( :( :( Best of all, but unfortunately closed. 7. Zojo - Coffee is excellent! Especially the pour-over. Place is nice, but far(rish) from campus... Evidently they use the same coffee as paradiso, but maybe they brew it better? Tastes better for sure. Maybe they're less pretentious. 8. Espresso Royale - Coffee is bad. Place is okay-good depending on where you go. 9. Krannert Intermezzo - Dont' remember the coffee, must have been okay. Place is very nice. 10. Aroma cafe - Beside Pekara, never been there.  I used to go to Kopi because I lived close to it. Then Pekara because that was close too, but the coffee was better. Now I live close to Paradiso and go to Panera.   Cool cool :-)   Like I said, I was out of my depth... Happy reading the discussion with people talking who are more knowledgeable than me!    I think context makes it clear enough in this case.  Consider: "ITAP with my girlfriend of trees". Similar in structure to what you are suggesting, but different meaning. So what you suggest is equally ambiguous.   No. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics would in fact, preclude the knowledge of every single initial variable at the time of the big bang!  But, if that knowledge was somehow available.. everything since would be predictable, in my opinion.  However, it is important to note that the "knowledge" itself is included in the variables, since knowledge itself is chemical reactions in the brain. So this question itself is meaningless, in my opinion. This is beyond self-aware, since the reactions that produce knowledge will need to react to themselves...phew...I'm beyond my depth here evidently  EDIT: I guess what I'm saying is that to know what OP is saying we should know is equivalent to saying that we would BE the universe...or an equivalent sized computer.   Yes, you and me both :) Even his story is pretty cool...  The original post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/124eyg/the_best_thing_i_ever_did_was_sell_all_my_pro/   Wow...thanks for the cost breakdown...that's very helpful and quite affordable too...Wordpress it is, it seems like!   Thanks! Will look into wordpress in much more detail now..   My friend and I have been traveling quite a bit recently and learning to take good photographs along the way.  We saw a post here recently from the creator of http://stoked.in and were really, really inspired! If the creator is seeing this, Thank you!!   Well, so I want to start a website for us. It doesn't need to be as good as stoked, of course. But I was curious about what it would cost to have a nice site up and running....We're not particularly interested in selling our prints. It's just something that we can feel happy about..  Is it better to use wordpress.org or to custom-design our own website? Both in terms of design and cost.   Thank you for any help provided!   You have to make the effort to go to remote places, and then there won't be crowds. When I went to Yellowstone, we stayed away from the tourist spots and were left to ourselves.  One sunrise, I walked a mile from my tent towards the river to get this shot: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/6227387180/in/photostream And there was absolutely no one apart from me there.  This shot of the Prismatic spring (http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/6227410228/in/photostream), there were crowds around the spring, so we went behind it and climbed a hill. There were still people, but far fewer.  Well I guess the article makes this point too. But for me, as I visit more parks, photography becomes less about the photo than about taking cool pictures because I could make it to an awesome place.    The air flowing over a wing needs to be at least somewhat "straight." With air flowing over and under the wing in the pattern a propeller causes (more-or-less a vortex), you wind up getting a substantial reduction in lift. Sure, there's high speed air over the top of the wing. But it's also over the bottom. In fact, turbofan aircraft may have a lift advantage over prop planes precisely because the air around the engines is going to be less perturbed than the air around a prop.  No no. Air perturbation has nothing (well very little) to do with lift. Turbulent drag is LESS than laminar drag. Channel wing aircraft did produce greater lift than regular aircraft! There were other problems with the aircraft, including construction difficulties, structural problems, slow climb and higher form drag.  Propellers DO increase lift over the wing. There are toy aircraft that wouldn't even fly if this wasn't true. The Bernoulli's explanation for lift in the first place is wrong. You say "more-or-less a vortex". Without a "vortex", there wouldn't be lift at all. The flow behind a propeller is not at all a vortex. It has a vortex structure similar the flow behind a wing, kind of twisted to form of a helix.     Right you are again. There is significant torque... The engine applies torque (say clockwise), and so the aircraft has to experience a reaction torque (counter clockwise). There are other effects, but this is the main one.   This generally results in a left turning tendency for the aircraft, which is commonly corrected with rudder input.   I remember trying a UAV flight simulator and wondering if there was a bug because the aircraft was constantly turning left! The bug was all in my head :-D    My PhD research is on propeller-aircraft interaction.  Basically, from my understanding, the high speed airflow from the propellers flowing over the wings would produce more lift at lower speed (relative to the ground), where as the jet counterpart doesn't have the same benefit.  Yes. Completely. But propellers get less and less efficient as speed increases. In fact at a certain point, they start producing negative thrust (Windmilling!) That's why low speed aircraft are propeller-driven and high speed ones are jet driven.   In the case of prop plane, there's the Bernoulli principle pushing the wings up, but I don't see a force pushing down on the engine and prop.  The propeller doesn't really produce much lift. The flow over the propeller - because of the rotation - is close to tangential to the blade (well ideally :) ) and so the "lift" is thrust.   Well, the Bernoulli principle is NOT what pushes the wing up or causes lift. The Bernoulli principle is just a relation between velocity and pressure in already established, inviscid flow, whereas lift is impossible in inviscid flow. But that is a separate discussion and not what you asked.  The force that pushes "up" on the wings (and everything directly and indirectly connected to it) is of course, the aircraft lift. The force that pushes down on the engine and the prop is the same as the force that pushes down on everything -- The weight!    Or about fucking.   In R^3, you can have mountains (local maxima), wells (minima) and points that look like horse saddles which are called saddle points, which are local maxima if you're measuring one variable and local minima if you're going along another variable!  Hope that helps!  	99

Precisely the reason I posted the article--Chris Matthews has always downplayed Bernie and it's nice to see that he has stopped that rhetoric (at least for now). Hopefully *now*, he can rightfully acknowledge why Bernie has so much support, even though the rest MSM has yet to recognize it.*^avidly ^waiting*      Thank you for being so open and honest! I'm sure that this will help many people out there that have or are struggling with the same thing. :)   It is people like you that keeps us loving our jobs, so thank you!

 Cars or guitars. Probably cars, because if I ever wanted some guitars I could just sell one of my many Lamborghinis.   When a really talk guy sits in front of you. It's the worst because you can't do anything about it. I mean it's not their fault, you can't ask them to shrink a bit for you. But it also sucks because you can't see. You just have to stick it out and see only the George Clooney parts of Gravity.   Despite any of that, the popularity of the NFL is rising at a ridiculous rate, especially internationally, despite it's horrible management. Hockey, rugby and lacrosse are also gaining popularity despite being just as, if not more, dangerous than football (maybe not lacrosse). Wether it's liked or not, the NFL is in it for the long haul.   I feel very confident in betting against you on this. Unfortunately, at this rate neither of our money will be worth shit in 100 years.   Buzzfeed lists.   I've pretty much given up hope, and it's depressing as fuck.   TV, or at least we were a few years ago we were, and are still coming down from our prime. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Office, Entourage, Lost, How I Met Your Mother, Mad Men, True Detective, Dexter, House of Cards, American Horror Story, the list goes on and on. I think in the future we will look back and realize just how good we had it.   That sounds like quite a well.   I've got some great news for you.   ...what's wrong with shoes?   I love this sub.   Show off   I'm not sure why, but when ever me and my friends smoke outside we come up with really catchy chants based off of whatever we're doing. Needless to say "Baked and naked" will make an appearance at our next sesh. Your legend shall go down in short term memory at the very least. Unlike the others though, this one will not be based off of our activities.   [Gah] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37d36t/what_should_the_first_human_on_mars_say/crloy26)   I get sad when people hate on people who drive nice cars (I don't think I have much of a bias, I drive a nine year old Nissan and I'm very content with it). Although there are those people out there, for the most part people don't buy cars based on what others think but rather based on wether or not they personally like them. One of my best friends owns a new Corvette, it's a beautiful car. He's not rich, he lives in an apartment smaller than mine and saved up for 4 years to get it. He's not a dick on the road, he's probably the best driver I know and would never drive the lest bit recklessly leste he put his precious Chevrolet in danger. And he didn't buy it because he's materialistic, he doesn't care what others think of it, he just loves cars and is willing to invest in a hobby he cares about. Yet people still assume they know enough to judge him based on his means of transportation. I mean wouldn't it be wrong for someone judged you based on your hobby or interests?   Don't use car stereotypes, a shitty driver can drive any vehicle. I've seen plenty of people that think they own the road in Hondas and Nissans.   I'm not the least bit rich, but I live in an EXTREMELY wealthy area. I personally don't want to live in a very big house, but they impress me none the less. As a lover of architecture and exotic cars, I often drive through some of the nicer neighborhoods just to see the houses. Many of them are truly beautiful.   Well that's ignorant.   Everything is obviously hard to master, but in my opinion martial arts isn't any harder to 'learn' than most anything else. I can think of lots of things that were more challenging for me.   In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.  Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line.   "One giant leap for suck it Neil"   "Witness me!"

As soon as I looked out the window I already saw four or five people I knew. EVERYONE was there. I made the snap decision to abandon Mel in the cab (I know, I'm a monster). We said our good byes, and that was it. The best part though, was as soon as I exited the cab someone else immediately got in it and it drove away.

How many days a week are you working 20 hours a day? if you were to work two back to back 20-hour shifts, there would be four hours of down time between forty hours of work. assuming that you slept for all  of those hours, you'd still only be sleeping for four hours in a night. There is no possible way you could be doing this for more than three days at a time, unless you are some kind of savant.   and three days at a time would be pushing it.

US heavy bombs are all now gps guided, they don't need to carpet bomb like vietnam anymore. B-52s can hit a separate target with each bomb it has at the same time.  In WW2 the US didn't have precision bombs. Altitude and wind currents would miss targets by miles. That is why whole cities were bombed. The only cities that were bombed were considered industry that supported the Axis,  cities weren't carelessly bombed at random.     also known for driving the BMW "Ring taxi" around the Nrburgring race track  That sounds like so much fun.  http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/drives-fun/drives/co-pilot-rides/bmw-ring-taxi.html   Forza 2 in the early races where you know you are going to lose to the fastest car. I would spin them out in the first corner and just relax the rest of the race.   I was going to say it was a military guy from Texas. The driver looks to be wearing a cowboy hat.   Actually is 3 minutes   Sounds like Cali cops.   I could tell it was in California because on/off ramps for freeways almost all look the same. I actually thought OP pic was in SoCal at first.

Only really started to watch hockey more lately, who are the announcers calling the game?  Edit - Thanks everyone for the fast replies.

I always thought since it is a reboot everything is still hot so the fans react until enough information has been processed.   I have about the same setup and i don't believe mine does this on a cold start.    Just got a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roadcam/comments/38aqws/raw_footage_dash_camera_video_of_car_exploding/cruqq8u) notification for this thread and opened it.  I couldn't understand why this video was in the list until i saw the context. Thanks for the laugh.     Why would OSHA even show up to something like this? They usually only show up when somebody gets hurt.   The thief that ordered it was probably hoping to grab the package before the homeowner received it.   we can only hope.   The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.  Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media, The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.  The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[4] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[5] although it retains operational headquarters in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham.

Probably Uber bots  Lmfao   Sounds like something my ex would do.    but I do believe it's what was going on in the video since he reaches out to the drivers door to unlock the back one.

"My initial impression is based on the fact he was at a gas station, it was probably gasoline, we got some samples we took from inside the car and will send out to the state arson lab to see what exactly burned up inside there, said AFD Capt.

The Mitch McConnell video is the same.  This video is part of the first 3 they made, probably testing the waters on what they can say. The yoga guy was made only yesterday.

We won't know until OP breaks laws and opens those doors.   Wrote this for a deleted comment to expand on this comment.   You local gas station pumps don't give you the amount of gas that you paid for, you realize this and report it to the county. They send out the county weight and measurements department and test it. They find out what you say is true. They forward it to the US weight and measurements and now that gas station has to answer to the US government and the county government as well..   The hardware store had most of the best killing weapons. The sickle was the best, lasted longer than the rest. That drilling thingymajig only lasted for about 15 seconds before you lost it.   In the celebrity world, once you are labeled "odd" it really doesn't matter anymore. Do what you want and your career heads in the direction the public chooses.    And the week after that.

That part of Nevada is very heavily mined, wonder if that has something to do with it. Would imagine many miners from Colorado have transplanted there.

Thanks Griz for what you provide this sub   Don't think looking at their own reflection is a good example. Maybe kittens that have never seen a mirror before react to the reflection but that is just their nature running into another cat they don't recognise. I've never had any of my cats after their first experience with a mirror react that way the next time they experience it. My cat Pizza loves to sleep in the bathroom, and most of the time when you come in he will look at you through the mirror. When i start getting close enough to him he will turn his head and look at me directly.  Wasn't there a "Through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman" episode where they were talking about when humans become self conscious? One of the big factors was recognizing themselves in a mirror?   How did he break his foot?   ok sorry about that should have read the rules.   Not sure what it is but i had one as well.   Nice story, where are these birds native to?

Man on the car = Man in the car  If he was on the car he would be on top of the car.  The man is inside the car.  Maybe someone else can explain it better.   I can choose to comment or not and also isn't what i get paid to do.  If an officer isn't willing to do required paperwork as part of his job, then he needs a new job.

If my details weren't already entered I wouldn't waste the time it would take to sign up for it every year.   Their whole job involves paperwork, having to do one more report isn't going to make their job harder.   Yup downvoting because someone has the opposite opinion. Every once in a while i will get in and out and it basically is just another fast food burger that tastes slightly better.   Would have to agree, i also live in SoCal but i'd rather find a mom and pop place for a burger instead.   I don't really like in and out, maybe because i've had it my whole life.   What part of the country does Culvers cover? I've never heard of them.    Don't think she is looking at the cameraman but someone right next to or behind him.

I'm on your side, but this is how the system works.  I've experienced first hand   Whoever programmed his speech box made it change anything he says about "kill me" to "feed me a pea."  kinda like cloud to butts   Consider it a bonus.   The system works on bribes, down to the smallest business. I buy cardboard boxes from company A because they are cheap, but company B gives me tickets to great seats at my local sporting events with a matched price, so i buy from them instead.

 And IIRC they said in an episode of Good Morning America after the trailer came out that the planet seen *was* Tatooine...   Reported.   Jon!   Cause there is no actual info about it I just want to know  (see, no shitpost)   Thanks   What's the science behind that?      Most/all of the deleted scenes are on YouTube as well   That scene in The Office where David Brent is getting ready for an interview and he rubs the perfume sample off a magazine onto his face.   My god, you were right!   Citizen Kane (1941) - Often looked at as one of the best and most influential movies of all time.  The Star Wars Original Trilogy (1977, 1980, 1983) - Enjoyable, emotional, action packed sci-fi movies with some revolutionary special effects.  Jaws (1975) - Well written, well directed, well acted. One of the best movies of all time.  Jurassic Park (1993) - Dinosaurs!!  Singin' in the Rain (1952) - Hilarious and well performed. Something there for everybody.   [The Shining](http://youtu.be/TgCejsyS0t8)   Good point   I don't see any reason why they would change that   I think Pixar could make an excellent movie from that   A 2D animated Star Fox show, in the style of either classic Hanna Barbera cartoons or Genndy Tartakovsky   The only thing that makes some sense is the release date    Yeah, that would probably sound better    the female   I don't wanna fall into the circlejerk, but Transformers is badly directed, badly acted, and overall badly made, while Mad Max is able to do most of those things well.   Because one does it better   Nintendo made a mistake mentioning this so early. It's not coming for a *while,* and people are talking about it like it's right around the corner. There are plenty of Wii U games that are yet to come.   Yeah, having the whole series on iTunes would be a big deal - it's the perfect compromise between Hulu and the DVD set, really.   I thought it was hilarious - no where near as good as 1, but it was perfectly fine   Ah, I play it where $75 is placed in "the pot" at the beginning of the game and only payments like taxes go in.    But it was in the official Star Wars magazine - you don't think that's a little weird?   Step 1 was 6 years ago? To be honest, I think The Love Guru kind of ruined the chance of him having a starring role anytime soon.      Mike Myers   Was the highest grossing movie ever until Star Wars...   You're still paying money for it...  Move along   Yeah, that makes a lot more sense than spending $40 on one now instead of waiting 2 months and buying a full set for the same price...   Depends on the price, I might get one.   Cable television costs money if I remember correctly...   I'm familiar with it   I think the prequels (at least Episode 3) are worth watching for some cool sequences, and if you're interested in the back story.   Sure   I mean for actual effects specifically, not buildings and cars - a battle with lots of robots and laser beams would work better with CGI, like in the Avengers, but I'm not suggesting that it should be 100% blue screened.   I'm not trying to get you angry, but this was just a pointless post.   I'm not trolling - not trying to be mean, but this isn't really news to anyone.   Well Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg with The Adventures of Tintin   Please, don't talk about it like its some low-budget risky indie flick. It's basically guaranteed to make money, and a sequel will come no matter what.    Yes    Well I guess that's not taking into account the hundreds of millions of dollars it made...   Why?   Really? There are so many places where CGI works better *and* looks better than practical effects.    Yeah, but now it exists and people use it often. Your point?   Not necessarily.   Totally - people talk about it like its some revolutionary masterpiece, but other than a few good performances and action sequences, there's nothing that makes it stand out.   It's a test image that was left in the background of a few frames. Really unnoticeable, but look it up.   I didn't mean to imply that he should go and create a new show, I meant the characters in his style would be interesting to see.   Probably    Let me guess - Mad Max, Interstellar, The Avengers, Inception...   The Dark Knight - there are *definitely* movies that deserve a stop ahead of it, like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Lawrence of Arabia. I don't think it's a bad film, but it's not anywhere near a 9 in my book.    I wouldn't - I know I can get it cheaper elsewhere    Yeah, I wouldn't, just the idea of getting one came to my mind after hearing about that.   Now that GameStop has retro consoles for sale, which one is worth getting? There are an equal number of games I would wanna play on both the N64 and the GameCube, but which one would I get the most enjoyment out of? Which one will I want to play more?  I'd love some help with this!   Hasn't this been news for a while? I know the Open Road thing is recent info, but the title is kind of misleading.   Why would you share it?   Not always    Yes, but *a* lead.   Goud points you making!!?!/11one   Sure - but people seem to have this idea that a movie (Mad Max, Terminator) can't possibly be as good if it's rated PG-13   And the car...   ToddH   Black and white???? Srsly? They had color why didn't use it!?? My film studies teecher saiys that it best movie all time, idk what talking Bout.  Prove my right??!??   Nah...   The Empire Strikes Back   Yeah, I've never understood this - if the movie doesn't have R-rated content, then what's the point in rating it R? The movie is made before the rating is given, so it's not like it would drastically change any of the material.   Pigs in a blanket?   MEIN FURHER! I CAN WALK!   This isn't a poster, it's promotional material - we know for a fact Finn is a main character    No, that was from official leaked merchandise around the time of the second trailer. This picture is also from the official Russian Star Wars website.   Watch some of the behind the scenes videos of the prequels. True effort is put into making them good movies. All of the cast and crew (minus Rick McCallum and George Lucas) are really trying their hardest to bring back the magic of Star Wars. Seriously, most of the CGI holds up well today, some genuinely good performances are given by McGregor and McDarmid, and there really are a lot of good scenes to be found. That's enough redemption for me.   When people compare a movie to other films or its sequels.  Like saying, "The Godfather 3 sucks because it's not as good as the first 2." Who cares? Can't you just judge a movie as its own work?    Yeah, that post also linked to the Fox Home Entertainment page... What were they expecting?   ... Which is exactly how Obi Wan acted in the OT...  Also, stop pretending that the prequels are the worst thing ever. They have their flaws, but they are, by no means, horrible movies. They have redeeming qualities, and you need to look for those.   I can see where you're coming from, definitely - I personally hate the dark and gritty Nolan Batman, and I prefer the campy and fun Batman.    People have not been understanding what minimalism is lately...   Charlie Chaplin and morbid are not two words I would ever associate   Well, it has very little/ a very straightforward plot. Not much there to interpret.   Exclusively Hulu   Me too - I can't wait!   He's entitled to his opinions.   In this day and age? All of them.   Right, but Marvel and Pirates are not Star Wars - I think Disney would rather put out an official trailer than have tons of low-quality recordings leak.   Yeah, but it's like posting a recipe for brownies on a subreddit about corruption in the sugar industry. Sure, they're sorta related, but it doesn't really have to do with the overall topic.   No, I'd say in September, when they release all the toys and books and everything. I would also imagine that they'd release a comic con trailer to the public.   Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Bridge on the River Kwai   I'd say at San Diego Comic Con, on July 10th  http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-more-coming-to-san-diego-comic-con-2015   Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories.   Here's my list:  1. The Godfather 2. Citizen Kane 3. 2001: A Space Odyssey  4. Vertigo 5. Lawrence of Arabia 6. Doctor Strangelove 7. Gone With the Wind  8. Back to the Future 9. The Empire Strikes Back  10. The Wizard of Oz    Batman and *freaking* Robin?? Whoa, dude.   Nothing changed - If the majority of professional movie critics don't like a movie, it's probably safe to make the assumption that most people think that movie is not good. Just because you have a different opinion, it doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong or invalid.   What about a few reviews of actual critics? If  they all say a movie is good/bad, I think it's generally safe to assume that that is true.   Those are bad things...?   So you wouldn't call The Godfather or 2001 classics?   Why not?   True, but who does it better?   Don't just assume that mobile = bad.   Well, other than the characters, the setting, the general story, the ideas and messages, etc.   KAAAANNNNNEEEE!!!!!   Not trying to tell you that you should like it, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but that's sorta the point -  It's basically a piece of cinematic "art." I know it sounds pretentious or whatever, but you're supposed to interpret it how *you* want to interpret it. There's not gonna be an explanation, because it's up to you to explain it to yourself, if that makes sense.   I remember this being put as one of the possible formats for teaser 2...   And 3 feature films...   Seriously?  Both of those exist as movies.   Rendezvous with Rama   Why isn't he allowed to have his own preferences? Why does that make him ignorant for not being interested in something?   Source?   Wait it wasn't?   	109
 Hex = easy mode imo.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, but with the two base dark orb spells alone that you can buy fairly early in the game, you have a lot of casts with them, and most bosses and enemies die in a few dark orbs, and you can breeze through most of the game.  If you use dark enchant on your weapon (my SOFS hexer uses the +10 magic mace), you can do insane damage on your one hand or two hand swings.  To compliment the build, it is easy to get some of the better caster gear pretty early too (hexer set, black set, lion mage set, etc), and most importantly is the sunset staff that comes with the hexer set.  Kill some basilisks or other mobs to get a darknight stone to enchant the sunset staff with dark, and you can have the best hexer staff in the game before you're even halfway through it.   I haven't played with a pure paladin/faith type build since early vanilla days, so I can't speak too much to that, but hexer is pretty boss, though it can be too easy/boring with pure casting.  But like I said, enchant dark weapon is killer, and you could always up your combat stats and focus on melee :D   Dude, as much as a PITA Iron Keep was, I had a far worse time in the cramped quarters of Earthen Peak being bled out the ass by a half dozen poison manniken fuck-less faces in those narrow hallways.  That shit was maddening:  FROM 1 / Fun 0  :D   I wish I could take my Scythe and Axe and BoM and etc into DaS2 :(   Thanks Captain Correct Acronym?  The world needs a hero like you?   Dude, SOTS has been fantastic.  I just started playing DaS2 SOFS a few days ago, as well as vanilla DaS2 with my RL brother, and it has been very enjoyable, though a bit clunky at first when you're used to how fast, responsive, and awesome combat in BB is.  That being said, as much as I love BB, there is a reason I sort of got bored with it in two months, and am back to playing Dark Souls 2...   Yeah... as much as I love BB for mostly the PvE (as the PvP is very limited), there is a reason I found myself playing SOFS after merely two months of Bloodborne...    There really is an incredible amount of options and choices for builds, challenge runs, weaponry, fashion, general PvE well into NG+ cycles, and all that good shit in DaS2...   I remember doing this back when the DLC first dropped on my main, an I swear, the more you get, the less they drop.  I received my first 20 within the first few hours, but then the next 30 took two days....   Never mind all the whiners, even though some of their complaints were valid.  DaS2 was still the best game of 2014, and there is a reason that even all the people who supposedly hated or disliked it still clocked hundreds of hours on it.   The best way to put it is, DaS2 is the best RPG game in the souls series, but it is the lesser of the Souls games in the Souls series.  Even then, it's not all bad, and SOFS (and the DLC for sure) helped close some of those gaps I think.  Anyway, have fun.  It's the next best game to play if you've already played the previous titles and/oror Bloodborne.  Besides, as far as the awesomeness that comes out of FROM software studios, what else can fill that gap?  :D   Ha!  I was playing late last night, well past my expiration date, and I swear I wanted to strangle that bitch.  Fuck her and her Majestic Magical Twinkle Sword of Infinite tracking.  Seriously.  Fuck her.  Can't wait to get home and slice of her cheesy-ass twinkle tits with your strat!   Enjoy your bloodborne player!  Hopefully PS4 has some more exclusives to make it even more worthwhile :D     Be ready to roll... imposing your ethics/honor/etc on others will only bring dissapointment, just like in real life.  Or, it might even get you killed, just like last night -_-   Heide Knight Iron Mask!  The missing helm to many sets, especially Alva's :D   For sure.  But even in vanilla DaS2, I was already getting more comfortable with two handing weapons, or dual wielding or other items, and in playing a one-bro run, I learned to be comfortable with one or two handing weapons with no shields at all, since 99% of the shields suck for a onebro, or have to be two-handed and even then they are limited and situational.   I have definitely been throughly enjoying it, but do you remember how much people complained about the number of enemies in most locations?  Yeah, and then they upped it for SOFS... can you imagine all that bitching, times 10?  Well, they did that anyhow, so fuck it, I think you're right.   I've never been that big of a fan of using shields, and after playing Bloodborne, I never will again, especially cuz I've been thoroughly enjoying the darker, more atmospheric places, especially with a torch.  It's been a blast for sure!   Really?  Just by lightning them?  I will have to check this out!   Dude, Earthen Peak was already bad enough with all those ass-hatless poison-douche, bleedy AIDS dick headless manniken fuckers already turning my feeble mage into a pillar of salt, and due to posts like this, I haven't even gone to Iron Keep yet...  I'm, uh, saving that place for last, after all the other three mighty dick souls      When I was a kid, like a lot of little boys, I enjoyed jumping on things.  Sometimes for fun, sometimes to assert dominance, and sometimes to break shit.  This one time, I literally broke shit, by jumping on this old plywood board out back of one of my father's friends who we were visiting out of state.  The board promptly broke, and I fell into a septic tank.  I was able to catch onto the side, and yell for help as my boots dangled in the shit, and luckily my dad came out in time to find and save me.     TL;DR - As a kid I almost died by drowning in a septic tank.  Can't think of a shittier way to go, literally, no pun intended  :D   Edit:  Shit.  In game?  Some pretty stupid stuff, though none as supid as nearly drowning in shit :D   Earthen Peak totally sucks, but other than that, I am enjoying SOFS waaaaay more than I thought I would.  Well worth the 20 bucks!.  Have fun man!   Goddammit. Really?  I just got done having my ass thoroughly raped in Earthen Peak with those godforsaken shit head clawed manikens, and now I gotta do it all over again in iron keep?  Shit...   Eh, I've heard that, but when I watched the videos on the posts here about that, I just didn't and still don't see any actual change in the hand.    I'll say DaS2 is the better RPG game, while DaS is the better FROM/Souls game :)   Wow.  Thanks for the story - I didn't know that one.  I mean, so the cash shops go with F2Play games, but Vindictus' RNjesus bull-shit on top of how grifty and pay2win their cash shop is, really is the nail in the coffin to that game...  insane grinds+cash shop are no substitute for actual content and a healthy comunity, which is why end game winds up sucking so much :/   All indications imply he is one of the great ones, along with Ebriatis, the mind of mensis, the Moon Presence, etc. I don't know if the lesser amygdalas are great ones, or servants or what not, but they each seem to have their own agenda. I think rom and the celestials are kin though.    We get kin blood from rom. There is no mention of rom or the celestials being a great one. And the fact that he is called emissary makes me think he is a middle-man; perhaps they are the new servants to the great ones post pthumerian style?   Ebriatis is the only great one we actually encounter in the 'physical' or 'waking' world. The rest of the lore indicates that she was left behind/abandoned when the great ones ascended, leaving the physical realm, or this facet of reality. All the other great ones we encounter are either in nightmares or some sort of dream. The inferences we are given I'd that ascension (the great ones) physical bodies are long gone (aka dead) and what they share in common wih the hunters (or dead Micolash) is that they retain their consciousness through 'force of will,' which is essentially life after death, an odd sort of immortality.    What I'm getting at, is your inferences of the cultists tryin to bring back (or summon) a great one seem pretty spot on. It just looks like summoning them through whatever ritual they were working only brings back a horrific abortion of a great one, some twisted monster, rather than the cruel powerful being itself, though I suppose tht could have been "Squirt, son of the butcher's toilet," one of the less heard of and least popular great ones :D   To never work when you intend it to, and to do random gestures at the worst possible times :D   It's not so much that the walkthrough is cheating, it's that it is robbing you of a beautiful, once in a generation type gaming experience, as much of the excitement, fear, danger, etc. comes from the atmosphere, the unknown, and the mystery of the game-play itself, let alone the fragmented story that uses the medium of gaming in a way most games haven't even dreamed of.  FROM games are unique in this regard, and you only get one blind playthrough...  Edit:  Also, Pistol  blunderbuss in every way, besides the spread that accomodates sloppier, frantic play   To access any and all variants of all root dungeons (so long as you have the correct base chalices), all you need to do is create a fetid/rotten/cursed Pthumeru Ihyll Root chalice dungeon, and bam:  you can create every glyph out there.  Good hunting to you o/   Edit:  The point is, don't waste your time and materials creating lesser, specific variants (ie, a cursed isz, then a fetid/rotten loran, then a cursed ihyll).  Just make the aforementioned F/R/C Ihyll and you have access to them all.   Think of frenzy as a massive 70% bleed, whereas rapid poison is a tiny flat 250 damage IIRC from the guide.   Yes!!!!!1!  THIS!    Or at least assist a boss, like being summoned by the mirror knight in DaS2 :D   Yeah.  That sounds pretty solid.  I beat him on at least two characters on long, drawn out 20 minute fights, playing it super safe by baiting out his charge/leap/vomit attacks, but on the last few characters I got sick of it, and found facing him more aggressively (closer to your strategy) to be much more to my liking  :D   I always put it straightforward like this:  Dark Souls 2 is the best *RPG* game of the souls series, but it is the worst *SOULS* games of the souls series  :D   I mean, there is a reason all those people who hate DaS2 so vocally still played it ravenously for hundreds and thousands of hours :D   *ooooh, I am here!* only happened in the DLC unfortunately, but my gawd, that was some great DLC!   Don't listen to the DaS2 hate-hype, especially out of context.  Fans still played it as much and even longer than previous souls games, and it was still the best game of 2014.     What you need to understand is where the negativity comes from:  the fact of the matter is that Dark Souls 2 is the best RPG game of the souls series, *but it is the worst SOULS game of the souls series.*  What essentially made the Souls games great (aside being weighty RPGs with high risk and reward) is sloppy, stitched on, or altogether missing at parts in DaS2.  The DLC helped make up for some lost ground there, but the fact remains that while DaS2 it is the most polished, responsive, and mechanically solid of the souls games, it is lacking in everything else wonderful that makes a Souls game :)   If anything, the edge comes from the fact that a BT build has a huge boost when it comes to firearms, I mean, the Evelynn.  Even without bone marrow ash, it can shave off respectable chunks of HP.  The 2h attacks of the chikage are easy enough to avoid, but either weapon is a joke once you slap in 3 +27% gems in them.  GG to whoever you fight.   No it's my cake-day.  You summon me!   Don't worry on the chalice thing - they use their own difficulty ratings, and are not buffed by the NG+ cycles.  Also, don't worry about the NG cycles affectign multiplayers.  Multiplayer seems to only be based on Blood Level, so you can connect to anyone within your range, regardless of what game cycle they are in.   What - you don't want to die in one and a half hits to a ludwig's holy blade with three 27% gems in it?  :P   Not to mention, DaS2 not only great DLC, but the content of the DLC itself, and the way in which they paced the DLC release of each of the trilogy really kept the community alive and thriving with all the crazy and interesting items and weapons, even months after its release, and in between the DLC, the multiplayer community was already thriving and plenty...   The point is, I don't see any DLC for Bloodborne being anywhere near as impactful or relevant as the equivelant DLC in DaS2.  I'm sure BB DLC will be fantastic, and I'm sure FROM will hit their stride as they almost always do, and I am sure it will be enjoyable, and I'm sure it will inject some vigor into the game and multiplayer itself, but even then, it's really hard to imagine any DLC for BB that could remedy the existent problems, as some of the problems are the very nature of the game itself.     If I could list and remedy the few main issues, it is this:  1.  I wish they had kept the frequent/unlimited invasions of B-Team's  DaS2.  It really kept the game alive and moving, well into NG cycles and all the various PvP Options.   2.  Covenants that had slightly deeper mechanics, purpose, or usefulness.  As it stands, these are shells of possibilities.     3.  Compared to the ease and quick nature of DaS2 (or even DaS) multiplayer, BB really was a step backwards, not just in how clunky and often non-functional or slow it is, but also in it's purpose.  We need an arena, or at least better covenant and more summon sign options for duels and fight clubs.  As it stands, while relevant in theme, the bell system fucking sucks.     4.  Variety in items and builds.  Again, I get it that they had to focus on quality over quantity, but I think everyone was spoiled in both fashion and funcionality with the unnecessary amount of gear in DaS2.  It's like night and day.  In one game we have too much redundant yet similar gear, and in BB we have sparse yet awesome and unique gear (which I almost prefer), but the lack of build diversity is what really does it for me.   Anyway, I think this is pretty much the game we get.  We'll have to wait and see what future installments bring :D   Do me a favor - if you're doing steady farming, can you give me a rough estimate of dropped chunks within your time frame?  Like I said, 8 in 45-60 minutes seemed like a common concensus for a few of us here.   You try the eye runes?  It's been awhile since I farmed the werewolves, but last I checked (and confirmed with fellow redditors), we all had consistent results, that with low arcane stats (ranging from 5-25) and the two base eye runes, I think we could get maybe, 8 chunks within a 45 minute or hour span of time?  (worth noting, I only ever bothered killing the 4 wolves in the chapel area itself, not the 5th up in the hallway.  Figured it was quicker to just run back).  It was something that wasn't too terrible, albeit still obnoxious.  Good luck :D   A big element of FROM games that I feel like all FROM fans learned to deal with, is *"NO PLACE IS SAFE."*  FROM consistently pushed us out of our comfort zones, first with the gameplay itself:  no saving or loading, death meaning something via loss of progress and currency, and the PvP threat constantly hedging and blurring into the PvE threat.     And like me (and most other FROM fans) you likely at first hated how brutal the invasions or constant uncomfortability was, but that very real fear and threat added so many juicy and delicious layers in the game.  We weren't just being challenged by the game's environment and the traps the devs laid out for us, we were being haunted by other players, and our own psyches through the immersive fear and paranoia that demanded our attention to details and the enemies and the game itself.  By constantly being pushed out of our comfort zones, by dealing with our fears, and by brutal game play, every inch of progress we made gave us satisfaction, even if it was slow and frustrating at times, and what brought real life to the game more than anything else was the base underlying premise that *"NOWHERE IS SAFE."*   This is a large part of what really made the gaming experience above and beyond most everything that was available at the time, and is still available at present.  Even if you hate hate HATE(ED) PvP in present or past FROM games, there is no denying that it added so much excitement and dread to the games...   To put it simply, Bloodborne largely removed that...   Right, but if 'not a souls clone' means having all the successful formulas and tropes of a FROM game, minus the longevity and variety of more content/items/weapons/builds/covenants/multi-player ease and options, than that kind of sucks :/   I hear ya dude, and both you and kirkhammertime who replied have your points.  For all of DaS2's faults, it really did have a fantastic amount of challenge options, challenge runs, fashion and weapon options, and thus much diversity and fun to be had in PvP, and having worthwhile, slightly meatier covenants really extended a lot of people's play-times as well (just like in DaS).  The real problem with ravenous fans like us, is that FROM created us, and no other gaming studio out there is currently coming close to making games as mysterious, immersive, challenging, and all around enjoyable in what is simultaneously a single player yet very multi-player experience...   Yeah.  What's worse is, with BB being so easy to digest and be satisfied yet bored with, is that there are few worthy alternatives outside of challenging, niche indie games.  With all the redundant, safe, forumalic games out there, the only thing left for me to do at the moment is buy DaS2 SoTFF...   It's super quick to unlock the short cut in upper cathedral ward and run up into the chapel and kill the 4 to 5 werewolves there, then bold hunter's mark right back.  I think you can kill them quicker than you can run through cainhurst, hunting down 4 or 5 gargoyles there, and on top of that, they have a higher drop rate...   Yeah.  I absolutely love the charred set and use it on a few of my toons, and I was always dissapointed that the claw was on the left - like - why wouldn't you use that bad mother-sucker for viscerals?   Have you tried summoning people in the half HP dungeons?  I tend to find a lot of summons in cursed chalices to mostly be a liability, as you are doubling the bosses HP, yet said boss can still one-shot either of you, and depending on lag, it might not even be because the other player sucks.  As a result, I never bother summoning people for these fights.     Strategy:  I used to fight this boss on half HP mode super slowly, baiting out his charge, his jump, or his vomit, but after killing him on a few characters, I got sick of taking 15-20 minutes for the perfect fight, and I started fighting him more aggressively, and ending the fight within 5-10 minutes, but it also depends on your build and weapons and etc.  Ludwig's and BT (chikage+eve) builds can burn this guy pretty quick, and if you have decent BT, you can hang back once you lower his HP enough and just shoot him to death.   This.  This right here.   Dark Souls is the better Souls game (better story, suspense, level/boss/game design), but Dark Souls 2 is the better RPG game (smoother, improved combat, floatier yet responsive and weighty).    Having played BB first, DaS2 will feel like a step backwards in pace and speed, an it will feel even slower if you play DaS last. For both mechanics and stories, I'd suggest you play them in order, blind, with no google or spoilers or easy help or maps :D   Also with noting, don't pay heed to any of the people who decry and bitch about DaS2. It was still the best game of 2014, and all is fans still played it more than anything else - we were just disappointed in some of B-team's decisions and methodology, and while it was the best RPG of the series, it was at the bottom of the list for what made souls games perfect games.    If only destiny had a story period, or characters... God that game is a piece of shit.    I'm pretty sure invasions have always worked on a larger upwards scale for all or most of the FROM games?   Thank you, and yes, I just re-read your original post and I feel appropriately like a dummy  :)   That being said, thanks for answering me anyway, and great work on the spread-sheet.  Much appreciated!   Edit:  Do you think it would be worth adding a few notes on the easiest way to farm some of the chalice materials people sometimes sometimes find themselves lacking?  Ie.:   Tomb Mold 5 = kill the rats at the beginning of great isz chalice  sage's hair - farm the undead-sage guy right next to the lamp in layer 3 of lower loran  ritual blood 5 - farm the chest in lower ailing loran which is just a quick run from one of the first lamps   And is it true, that if you create a cursed/fetid/rotten pthumeru ihyll chalice, you can then create any and all variants of ihyll, isz, and loran?  There was a PSA not too long ago stating that, and I have yet to test it on my current toon.  Thanks!   Edit:  just re-read your post, and answered my own question.  thank you!   Don't forget, it also exists because of a lack of competition.  Most of the competition copied wow in mechanics, style, formula, give or take a few minor tweeks or dynamics, so there isn't much of an alternative.  Everyone just wanted to make the fabled 'wow-killer,' and in their rush to copy the ultimate success formula, they stifled creativity and set innovation back a decade...   Dude.  Tourists aside, that is still a lot of money.  They aren't going to be investing any less in WoW for the forseeable future...   It's not a matter of making an MMO for everyone, it's about making a solid game period, and whether that is for a large or niche audience depends on a lot of factors.  But at present, and for a long time now, there are bigger problems in the gaming world.   The problem is the gaming industry at large, who have been mostly playing it safe on boring, formulaic game-play models (which you can't blame to a degree), but the lack of forward thinking, creativity, and innovation has caused much of the genre to grow stagnant and dull.  People just don't get the same kind of thrills playing the same WoW or WoW-esque games decade after decade, and until a developer comes along to shake things up in some way, shape or form, people are willing to scratch that itch, even on boring and inferior products, settling for less while waiting for something better to come along.  The problem with the skinner-box of MMO's, is that it's often the compulsion to play drives people to keep grinding away, not actual fun or solid game-play.    The large fact of the matter at hand is, the redundant WoW formula of addiction based game-play/the skinner box needs to go the way of the fuckin dinasaurs already.  A lot of people are bored with the staleness of the gameplay, the tread-mill, riding the same rides on the theme park over and over again, and very little has changed, aside this kick-starter gaming era, which is the only real hope it seems for innovation and change at this point in time, as the larger companies are there to make money first, and make a good game second, and they will not stray from their formulas...    Oh yes, I was thinking of the choice to ignite the flame or become dark lord, not killing Gwynn himself.  My bad :D   Edit:  Point remains, slightly swapped around though, and equally convoluted.   Great point.  The economy of lag-stabs in DaS1 was some real shit, and it wasn't much better in DaS2.  Love the way they changed up viscerals in bloodborne :D   With how much people either spam their own quick R1's, or how quick they can load up bone marrow and take off a large chunk of your health with a bullet, the game itself pretty much renders all other attacks obsolete (to a point), aside a few precision and specific moments...  The point is, while you're trying to diversify your swings and make PvP 'interesting,' they've already nailed you with 2 R1's and taken off two thirds of your health.  Kind of annoying at how simple the combat system makes itself for PvP.   Personally, I like to throw a few R1's here or there to get things moving, then pull out the heavier and harder hitting moves once they have fapped off their R1's, and once they are expecting nothing but R1s   Eh, even in DaS and DaS2, the lagstabs plagued it just as badly, if not worse, so it's not too much different here, other than the 30% health penalty making it an easy 1HKO, or runes making it a 1HKO, but I've noticed a lot of people can't land parries, and if they do, they often have a hard time pulling it off in time.  Point is, I feel like it's comparable to how cheesy/annoying it could be in past games, but so it goes, par for the course.   Not really.  The chosen undead didn't have to face Gwyn, nor did the game really inevitably tell you that you had to, and even if you did, you still didn't understand the ins and outs and repercussions of all that.  It's pretty similar in this game...   Hint:  you don't have to kill him, now or later for that matter.  You can keep progressing and exploring in Old Yharnam while ignoring him  :D   Whatever you do, even if it takes you a month to understand and get the hang of, is, DON'T LOOK UP ANY SPOILERS OR EASY HELP OR ETC.   FROM Software makes beautiful games, and you only get one chance at a clean, mysterious, unknown playthrough of the game, where you get to discover items, bosses, and story-elements of your own.  Drink it in and enjoy it, as for me (and thousands of others), FROM games have been a challenging and invigorating innovation in what has been a fairly stagnant, and unchallenging gaming industry.  Enjoy!   What happened?  Did it eventually boot you out?   Hate gender locked classes :/  Would have loved to play a reaper, but staring at a yappy little Elinn's underwear all day is just not remotely appealing :(   Vella is such an awesome class, and she wound up being my favorite class to play, because she was so fun, but I hate the fact that I have to be fuckin transgender   Lynn was fuckin bad-ass too, but the most obnoxious thing is that she literally skips around town like a retarded school girl.  Fucking dissapointing for such a wushu kung-fu touch of death bad-ass!   The game is fun in the beginning, a bit bland and repetitive in the middle, and fun again towards late-mid to end-game, but past 60 (more like 70), it is hard to stay competitive without cash shopping it, and last I checked, the economy had massively tanked, and if you don't have the cash to buy good end game gear, it is a long drawn out grind.  I made a good chunk of money over a period of a few years, so I was able to equip my toons well once they hit levels 60 to 70, but I can only imagine it would be frustrating as hell at present with how shitty the cash shop it is, and how ludicrous the best crafting materials cost...   Another comment:  have you played Tera since the last expansion from fall or christmas or whenever it was?  If so, how is it?  What are/were the major changes?  I plan on looking up more info on it here on this and the Tera subreddit, but if you or anyone else could provide some info firsthand, I'd appreciate that as well.  Thank you!   I loved vindictus, made a fortune on magic powders back in early 2010-teens (before economy was tanked), had great fun playin the game and leveling a bunch of toons over the years from 60-70 and then buying them the lower top tier gear, but past that, the atrocious grind that is tied into their bull-shit cash shop system absolutely ruined the game for me. The end game of pay-2-compete and not get kicked from the boat is one of the worst designs in gaming history. I'm sad as well that Nexon is such a shit company. That being said, can you explain how said one player controlled and tanked the economy?   Feminists are not NT, especially if you are a male. As for the rest, I mean it sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder, and I'm not talking about your rape comment...   Ok. Clearly you're either some insane feminist or brain-washed male apologist. Either way, you have great propensity for great bull-shit, and I'm going back to the bliss of pretending like you don't exist.    Honestly, I don't, and I never really did. I've even fairly good at quitting games once the compulsion to play outweighs the fun. If anything, I find leveling up characters, creating builds, and basic game progression more fun than repeating and grinding out end-game encounters, raids, or other redundant farming. I play a game, so long as I am having fun with it. Once it becomes stale or boring or a seemingly endless treadmill, I take a break or quit, as I don't have the patience or time for grinding and farming these days.    Scientology:  Answers for People Who Have More Money Than Critical Thinking Skills (or Intelligence)   Read my other reply.    Because she has to treat it nicely, as it has become sentient and domineering. But I'd be remiss if I didn't add that it totally gave me a chubby!   Just say no to life!  Though I suppose I would be super crazy-protective of my hands if they could net me thousands of dollars an hour for work that was something other than prostitution.    You make a good point, please forgive or at least excuse my more asshole-ish remarks, at least for the moment.  My apologies, as just like in person, I often come off as gruff, or sharp, and I generally try to make myself as approchable and logical and reasonable as possible.  Perhaps I have been a bit rash here, but so it goes with anything that excites me, but just as they are voicing their opinions, I am voicing mine, and none of it changes the fact that I find much of the bitching and moaning here on this post (go figure, the internet in general) to be pathetic and sad, and it often smacks of deeper seated insecurities and unresolved personal problems.  But so it goes with opinions and bias.   For myself, I can't help but feel that this whole thing is in afront to both the good and bad nature in man, and that catty bull-shit spoken behind someone's back makes us worse for our wear.  I think I am falsely perceiving it as the further emasculation of men, ie., just another attack on men, and as you said, it comes down to just more opinions:  ie., some men will say, *I can feel my feelings and that's fine,* and so it is, but if that is the case, then there is no need for said male to rag on a man who he perceives as a steroype or old-fashioned, ie., a big strong man who loves sports and seems simpler when it comes to his feelings and approaches to life.  At that point, it is like the pot calling the kettle black.   Part of why I appreciate the men in my life, is that they are diverse, strong men from various backgrounds, and most of them aren't afraid to confront me or each other if they have a problem that needs fixing, or something that needs to be resolved, and they aren't afraid to deal with their feelings, and I am talking former jail-birds, welders, mechanics (myself, a fighter/martial artist), and seeing this post, reminds me of what I hate in people period - pointless whining, the inability or fear to address one's own problems, disorganzied back-stabbing, and so forth.  I know it's no organized effort to try to drag men down, as clearly many of these people on this very forum (and outside by the sounds of their bitching) need no help in painting themselves in a poor light, but still, I find it offensive, but that is clearly my own problem, no?  I think the root of the problem is, I want men to be better than they are, and shit like this reminds me that, they, and me, and we, are often not.  We are fucking animals, and we often forget that, for all our intelligence, creativity, and virtues...   Edit:  Now I'm sad :(   And a lot of reports are bull-shit.  It sure is fuck aint 1 in 4 women have been raped...   You're so enlightened and smurt.  when I growed up, I want to be like you c:   And apparently the joke is on you, as there seems to be no pleasing you.  I like it that, even if I write something like, *"real men learn to deal with their feelings,"* you still choose to take offence to it, even though that is exactly what you were talking about, as if learning to feel and cope with your emotions somehow makes you less of a man.  Over-sensitive much?  It's ok, I'm sensative too, and I can admit it, and I am also a practitioner of martial arts, and can fight with the best of them, and I have and will continue to kick some ass.  Point is, I can do perceived manly shit, and I can also deal with my feelings and admit to my faults, and address my feelings as they come up.  I'm also letting you know that just because there is that old joke/stigma/judgment scale, doesn't mean that all modern men adhere to it, or are too afraid to talk about it.  I know many awesome men who are as manly as they come.  Welders, mechanics, prison-birds, all manners of men from all walks of life who aren't afraid to admit when they are in pain, when they have a problem, and when they need help.  I'd suggest you find some people you can connect with, and maybe they can help you come to terms with your own issues.   Eh, it's alright.  Did I get the job?   You write it like it is something every other man does, or something men do casually, when the reality is, it is a very small percentage of men who actually perpetrate that crime.  The last few studies I read put it something at like, 4 or 5% of men are actually that violent/controlling/fucked in the head.  That whole 25% of women (1 in 4) have been raped is a bull-shit statistic, completed at a bull-shit college in a bull-shit study.  Regret, shame, guilt, and anger for your actions and choices does not constitute rape.  That being said, while it is a small amount of women who falsely acuse men of abuse and rape, if women could stop doing that, that would be great.   Right, and so long as it's somewhat fun, what else are you going to do anyhow?   Don't feed the troll.   bahahahaha.  I enjoyed this post.  Thank you :)   Everyone has them.  The difference is, I've worked my ass off to deal with mine, and hopping on someone's asinine reddit post to vent your issues, while popular, really doesn't do anything to benefit anyone, namely the original whiny poster.  And why am I doing this?  Because I choose to, because it is amusing, and because maybe one of these whiners will pull the plug and let out enough of their own insecure, dellusional bull-shit to think, "jeeze, maybe other men are not the problem."   Chodehats are stylish as fuck though!   Real men learn to deal with their feelings, whatever that entails for the individual - and don't fool yourself.  Men talk about it all the time.   That being said, coming on here to vent insecurities and jealousies is kind of pathetic dude, and frankly, I find this post and most of the people in it really fucking sad.   I know right?  You might not like them all, understand them all, or want to be friends with them all, as you can have vastly different interests, approaches, and philosophies on life, but it's not like we need to make a pathetic thread about this to stab our fellow men in the back like a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order, right?   This shit is pathetic.   Being fake or posturing or lieing isn't unique to men or rednecks.  In fact, women lie every day about how tall they are, what their face looks like, their hair, etc...   Also, the real country people I know have earned my respect above anyone else, as they are very knowledgeable about survival, construction, creativity, and all manners of useful things.  And while they may not be the most cultured people, they are a lot more useful than the vast suburbs full of clueless, middle to upper class children who know little to nothing about life, or providing for themselves and their family.   Dude, no shit huh?  I've made several posts on here to combat the influx of bitching and whining by what sounds like a bunch of immature high-school children having identity crises, coming on here, venting their own insecurities and emotional issues, but still, the ceaseless discharge of bull-shit is still flowing!  Frankly, it's pathetic.   Women rape men too.  And the amount of men who rape women is a very teeny-tiny percent of men overall....   Thank you, 'IEatAnyAss.'  I'm sure your suggestions have been well received.   You make it sound like immaturity is unique to men and men alone...   I've made several replies along these lines to combat the influx of whiny children and pandering little bitches who come in here to vent their insecurities, and holy hell, you can't imagine the amount of butt-hurt and inferiority complexes! I get it though. I can tell a lot of them are young men and women with little sense of self-identity and few honest personal beliefs, young liberals who are hopping on the band-wagon of 'combatting the stereotypes of being a man,' thinking their is some pay-off or benefit to anyone for it, but little do they know, they give themselves away as jealous, insecure, spiteful children. They are airing their issues on here, simply because they don't know any better.   These kids need to work through their emotional issues and neuroses, as there is nothing more pathetic and obnoxious than an adult child...

Way to kill the joke.... and it still holds true in some cases... a perfect excuse for stupid people :D   I made a simple comment that this whiny, passive-aggressive, cheap-shot bull-shit makes the 'men' and 'women' of this thread look like a bunch of angsty, insecure, high-school children, that's all.   Take it or leave it, be a passive-aggressive bitch about it, whine about it, do what you will, but I stand by what I said.  This post, like much of reddit/the internet, is a cancerous circle-jerk for weak-minded people.  And if you simper enough, maybe it will get you some attention, and maybe it'll even get you laid!   And oh how they defend their pathetic whining and passive-aggressive bull-shit!   I hate the men in this thread:  you are making men sound like pathetic, catty high-school children.   Yeah!  How dare they be men!   LOL   I don't hate anything in particular about men, but I do hate people that feel the need to give credence to this post in a pathetic, passive-aggressive, dear-diary entry because they are too chicken-shit to deal with their own emotional problems and inferiority complexes.   It's not any man's fault per se that you feel the way you do, but please, learn how to deal with your own feelings, and take responsibility for your own goddamn life.  Most of this just sounds like childish bitching, and hens scratching each other's face off for a higher rank in the pecking order.  It's goddamn disgusting.  	105
 It's to prevent reproduction.  EDIT: Until they change their sexual gender.   Go to a doctor and get scheduled for a circumcision, immediately. I had pinhole phimosis when I was 11 and I know exactly what you're going through. That ballooning of the foreskin and the pain you get when urinating because the urine flows back in since it can't all escape due to the small opening. That can cause bladder infection over time if not treated.  I had pinhole phimosis for two years and it was hell. The firs time I urinated after I got my circumcision was the best feeling in the world, I was so surprised and happy. Urine flowed out so fast and easy like it normally should as opposed to how it goes out slow and restricted with pinhole phimosis.  No, there is no other treatment for pinhole phimosis that does not result in removal or partial removal of the foreskin. You can ask but your doctor will tell you the same thing. Even minor surgery to open up the opening of the foreskin wider could end up resulting in you developing pinhole phimosis once again so circumcision is the absolute solution for your problem, for our problem.  I know life is hard but you have so much to look up to. Please stay optimistic, I know it's difficult but please, take care of yourself.  Go to a doctor and get checked up for your pinhole phimosis as soon as possible.  Best of luck.   TIL: Plants can have scar tissue.   Have you ever heard of Apophenia?   I could've done that myself.   What is a pyramid scheme?   OH SHIT THAT WAS GWEN STACY   RIP Drift King, DK   Rise of the Planet of the Dinosaurs.  Dawn of the Planet of the Dinosaurs.   is this a reference to something?   Wait how do you know that Blue's a girl?   Like when they actually stumble upon the original park's visitor section?   I was really hoping he was gonna get eaten. Rather him than the assistant. The assistant got fucked up.   Fuck, now I have to go jack off.   I didn't know they were putting hair on crash test dummies now.   What the hell? I didn't know that was a thing.   bro what're you talking about reddit is full of people that get pussy on a daily basis.   The older brother's hot girlfriend was unrealistic. Dude's a pussy and a dick for how he treats his younger brother.   Wait, what the hell's baby talk then?   BABY TALK. "aww but i wanna cuddleeeeeee" "I'm tiredddddddddddduh"  Shut the fuck up.   You're adorable and so is your daughter :)  Thank you for sharing this special moment with us. You have a great kid.   But who buys porn nowadays?   Yeah there was an ad before the video and stopped me from hearing that shit.   Did you find his comment by coincidence or are you notified each time someone mentions EAP?   So it IS derived from the Rasengan.   I got downvoted so fast :(  But yeah, I totally get what you mean! It's ironic that you say Wind-Based Version of Chidori since Lightning and Wind are polar opposites lol. I would imagine the "Rasengan-Variant of Chidori" would be similar to the Supreme Ultimate Rasengan (http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Supreme_Ultimate_Rasengan) as it's practically the Rasengan without the intense shape transformation.  Have an upvote.    Yo! Champ in the making! guy is Red's father.  That guy always believed in me even when no one else did. Even when I didn't believe in myself. He da real MVP   Damn that was so clever. I would give you gold if I wasn't broke.   Since Kakashi used the same principles of shape transformation and nature/elemental affinity of the Rasengan to create Chidori, which allowed him to infuse his own nature/elemental affinity to it (Raiton/Lightning Release) - which he couldn't do with the Rasengan.  It's also interesting to note that the Rasengan was created with the intention to be able to infuse all the elemental affinities together simultaneously in one jutsu yet we never saw that happen.   Namikaze Satellite omg so much nostalgia   hotels and motels can get around it  The latch?  because technically the door can only be opened with a key that only you are given during your stay  But the guys in the story had another key that unlocked her door, right? So that's not always true    dude that's so shady that people would do that. don't you have to get your place checked out or follow regulations and inspections before you can become an official business and run an inn/motel/hotel etc. ?  this sounds like some bates motel shit. with the owner being a serial killer and what not.   This was probably the only thing that kept me going during the filler hell of Part I. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwBKzx_74I  You guys remember it? :)   Yura Yura was good too. I like how it depicted the characters in modern clothing.   Because rape culture only applies to females. right? /s.   fuck 3rd wave feminism. there is a difference between equality and superiority.  I hate how in this day and age, all a woman has to do is yell, "rape," and point the finger and she can fuck up a man's life forever. ESPECIALLY in the many cases where the case of "rape" turns out to be a lie. Some bitch lied about getting rape and nearly got a man in jail for years.   Republican on Reddit. Easy.  Can someone eli5 me this?   So basically, it's just a cheap trick to reap some internet points?   What do you mean?   7 hours later, it's #1 on the front page.   You'll see a post with 4000 upvotes but the author is [deleted]   I agree   Will check it out, thank you! Are you from Australia?   Rasenshuriken IS a Wind Jutsu. But yeah that's a fucking good question. He only has like three or four Jutsus and just creates variation on variation on variation from those three.   That makes a lot of sense, actually.    Oh, so those things already come with the hotel room? I thought I had to bring my own and assemble it or something, I'm not very familiar with that kind of stuff.   Do you have to bring your own? And do you have to ask for permission to assemble one?   Damn. So when you die you have the choice of reaching the afterlife or stay on the planet as a ghost for eternity, right?   If "cool" is just a synonym for "asshole," I don't think I want to be cool anymore. Also, why do girls like assholes then?  EDIT: inb4 someone confuses "douchebag/jerk guy" for an anus.   What the FUCK   That contradicts what I've heard about good ghosts that serve as "guardians."    Babadook  What's that?     So what I got from this is that there are good ghosts and there are bad ghosts.   Can you explain what latching your door means and how you do it, please please?   Can you explain what latching your door means and how you do it, please please?   I'm really glad your okay OP. Whatever those two guys were up to, it wasn't good.   are you a guy   fliporama captain underpants. upvote if you remember   That's like going through your huge list of Facebook friends and unfriending everyone you actually don't keep in touch with/don't really know. Takes too much time.   That's like going through your huge list of Facebook friends and unfriending everyone you actually don't keep in touch with/don't really know. Takes too much time.   What's her name, anyone??   Source?   PLEASE HAVE A FOLLOW UP TO THIS VIDEO. I wanna know what happened to that guy.   Thank you for the clarification, that makes much more sense.      Did you know there's beastiality subs too? With human women sucking dog penises.   Can you please tell me what /r/fatpeoplehate was actually about? Was it about HATING against Fat People or what Fat People Hate (EX: Exercise, etc.) ?   What the hell happened to Sakura's face. It also looks like she shrinked into a dwarf.   Anyone notice how the artwork completely changed?  EDIT: Art style.   I don't understand how people confuse a scratch for a full on punch with the fist   I just want to see what it looks like. The purple lightning raikiri   i thought that only applied to rasenshuriken   Konohoes, Konoha Hoes. Fucking smart.   WHOA. Has Kakashi Hiden been released in manga yet!?   In all those times he used the basic Rasengan, he could've infused his elemental nature within it. I don't believe he ever used Fuuton: Rasengan again after clashing with Kakashi's basic Rasengan.  Now I understand Fuuton: Rasenshuriken and True Wind Style: Rasenshuriken (Sage Mode w/Throw and Expand) is more powerful but still.   Useless, really? That's a really powerful word.   Why doesn't Raikiri have Chidori's distinct sound, "like birds chirping", if they are the same technique?   Raikiri doesn't sound like birds chirping.   Raikiri doesn't sound like birds chirping.   Raikiri doesn't sound like birds chirping.   What does "cutting a lightning bolt in two" actually mean? I can't picture that.   In the Dub, Kakashi used "Lightning Blade."      Holy shit. Isn't that class like... important?    That was just one quote not plural.   Damn that's scary   I didn't know there was such thing as an Uzumaki Clan until later in Part II.   He didn't hit him in the head, he literally scratched his forehead protector with his claws. (sharp nails that he gets in his initial Jinchuriki form)    He didn't hit him in the head, he literally scratched his forehead protector with his claws. (sharp nails that he gets in his initial Jinchuriki form)   Some guy at the Vans store sprayed this stuff all over his suede shoes and poured some water from his water bottle over it and his shoes were completely fine. No water damage to the suede whatsoever and it was dry.   Pretty sure it has a lot to do with genetics.   What's it called when you are aware that you are living in a simulated universe and not "the real" universe as we are all currently doing in this thread rn? Have we become self-aware?   artificial selection      I lol'd so hard.   There was a post that made it to the front page about how Jackie Chan is a well-known sex-fiend in Hong Kong.   Not very familiar with tumblr. Could you link me please?  There's just so many direct foreshadowing in these past episodes that it just frustrates me that we got hit with a complete curveball.   So much development and foreshadow for NaruSaku yet NaruHina ends up on top.   "When you return to your village, are you going to tell that person that you love her?"  Naruto: "Aha, no I don't think I can bring myself to do that yet. For right now, I'll just keep watching over her."  "And you're satisfied with that?"  Naruto: "Of course *nothing would make me happier if she chooses me someday*... but either way - it's okay. I just want **Sakura** to be happy. That's all that matters.   I'm fucking stupid. Thanks for the clarification   Dude that's insane. But was the girl in the video really talking about swallowing cum?   When I was a child, I hit my head on a glass table and the side of my head split open. My family called an ambulance and an ambulance came and bandaged me up and took me to get stitches and they gave me a bear they I still hold onto today. The bear really helped me calm down when I was freaking out from all the blood pouring.  EDIT: Oh I just said that.....   MMA sounds like the best choice for self-defense training.            Damn, Asian girls really do must have the best pussy   Sexy video. But those aren't big tits :(   WAIT, SERIOUSLY!?!?!?!?!??!?! IBUPROFEN IS $319!???  I need to save up what little supply I have left.   Yeah, copyright contract issues or some bullshit.   Thank you SOOOO much. How did you find that out???   It's Korean.   So, basically, the subs are fake and Nana wasn't talking about sex at all?   Did that cop just get away with threatening a kid by saying he was going to break his neck?   This shit looks gay as hell, couldn't get past 3 seconds of it. Are you sure someone doesn't get fucked or whip out his dick in this gif?   Happy Cake Day, friend.   Why does this school list Jun Fan Gung Fu and Jeet Kune Do as two separate martial arts? They're both names for Bruce Lee's system.   While this video is a parody - it does bring up many ridiculous aspects of point sparring such as the low guard and ridiculous stance. Also "Blind attacks" are illegal? What the heck.      https://youtu.be/sCLv7IeWK5A?t=4023      FUCK wrong video. I'm so sorry. This is the video I meant to submit with the song playing at the current time. https://youtu.be/sCLv7IeWK5A?t=4023   He'll always be with you, in here. :)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-SEfT21XwE  Sounds like Oregon Trail, but I'm not sure!??   Thanks man!!!   fucking real   I honestly don't know and it's killing me because I hear it all the time   How long did it take before you started getting consistent with submitting your peers?  EDIT: At least somewhat consistent   Can confirm. Fuck Hollywood for stuping down to lies for cheap racist jokes.   I honestly don't see what's wrong with being uncomfortable around homosexuals. Some people love clowns, some people hate clowns.   Holy shit.   this   I don't get what's going on. Is she being serious? If so, that's crazy that she openly admitted to being kinky like that. Can someone confirm if she's reading lines or something?   I think it was intentional.  	132
 Sweet tattoo. I love when athletes get the rings tatt'd on.  I'd imagine I would do the same if I ever competed in the Olympics - which is to say, when they make Reddit an Olympic sport.    Eh, I don't know if it will keep me from reading his stuff, but I'm definitely prepared to brace myself for it at this point.    Nah, my cutoff is 2:16am. ;-)  But yes, Salem's Lot, The Kite Runner, and Johnny Got His Gun are just a few books I remember taking me well into the early morning.    Guess that's SI for ya...   AFTA is a favorite of mine too, although that whole part toward the end with him in the rowboat struck me as just another way Uncle Ernie tried to portray himself of Mr. Macho all the time. Really enjoyed the story, but sometimes his little shifts like that irritate me.    I read "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold" earlier this year. Really enjoyed it. Nice, quick read for a long car ride.    I actually bought an Amazon Fire instead of an iPad because the Black Friday sale was too good to pass up. ($70)  Also, I despise anything made by Apple.    I'd imagine what it really comes down to is knowing the audience inside and out. To that point, I mean making sure the content is geared toward the audience, the advertisers are geared toward the correct demographic and more importantly, the quantity of prints are just the right amount. It sounds like a formula that can maintain itself for a while. As far as making a profit, that's another story all together.    Same. Want a tune up against me first? We can just drink beer and go to the scorecards. It won't pay much, but I'll spring for a nice IPA. Hell, you can be the IPA Heavyweight belt holder if you want.   Short list but each provided a little trip down memory lane (even if they were all direct references to how good they were in NHL [insert year here]).   Would your team have any need for these guys? Could you see them landing anywhere?  http://www.si.com/nhl/2015/07/08/unsigned-nhl-free-agents-likely-to-retire-sergei-gonchar-daniel-briere-ray-emery   Major props for Baldur's Gate. My friends and I still quote the wizard's use of Oppenheimer's "I am become death...destroyer of woooooorlds" quote. Which I think is a Buddhist quote, but that's neither here nor there.    Generational gap here, but that would be Warcraft II for me. And Age of Empires II. Both bring me back to nights where all my friends and I were concerned with was mining digital gold, harvesting digital lumber and coordinating our attacks.    I had four sliver queens back in the 90s. Sold them in early 2000s for $40, and now they're worth $40 each. So yeah, that too.    Kinda ended abruptly, but I liked it. Still don't know why he had to rip it in half though. Those winter coats have pretty big pockets.    To the best of my knowledge it was obsolete by 1985. ;-)  Honestly, I read it so long ago I don't feel like I could justify any comments with how well it held up. Looks like I need to give this one another go soon...   **Cuba Libre, by Elmore Leonard**  I read Get Shorty a few years ago and really enjoyed it. Picked this one up a few months back and finally cracked it open this past weekend. About 150 pages in and so far, so good. As usual his dialogue is the most amusing part of his stories.    I extended my vacation past July 4 for the sheer fact that every Tuesday my library has a book sale (in the fall they do one every other Saturday). This is the first time I've gone on a weekday.   Here's my haul from earlier today, all for a whopping total of $5.   Shogun - Volumes 1   2 (Really stoked about this find. All I've ever seen in the past was the tattered paperback version with size 1 font).    A Conspiracy of Paper - David Liss   Read the first chapter, seemed interesting enough to give it a go.  The City of Falling Angels - John Berendt   I've heard things, so worth a shot.  The Alienist - Caleb Carr I've seen this book at previous sales and always passed it over. Decided to drop my hard-earned 50 cents on it this time around.   The Bonfire of the Vanities - Tom Wolfe   I've never read anything by him, so I'm not sure what to think. Definitely purchased this one on name alone.  And of course photos, since books are pretty:  http://i.imgur.com/GM48zgW.jpg  Thoughts on any of these titles?       I picked up The Howling from a discount book store once just to see if it held up in comparison to the movie. I actually liked the book a lot more and, frankly, didn't know it was a book before the movie.   And if you're into horror and such, there are a few books in the Ravenloft series that touch on werewolves, although not to the same extent of a series in itself. One in particular, called Heart of Midnight, is about lyncanthrophy.    Start and end with college textbooks, and I'll say you're on to something.    The kid took a beating, too. Verdejo has a wicked hook, and if I'm not mistaken he messed up his right hand halfway through the fight. Ive seen photos of him in a sling since. He won it easily, but I think he put Najera down two or three times.   I agree, but emphasis on "in the range." I don't have issues with catchweights, but in more recent fights Cotto's demands on Geale left that dude totally dead on his feet at the weigh-in. I think he dropped something like 12 pounds in 10 days. Geale always looks like he's one second away from falling into a permanent zombie state, but his body language was like that of a man who was dying on the inside.   155 for Cotto-Canelo is totally reasonable for both fighters. Should be a good one.    Sorry. I'm new to the Internet. Will work on my game.   Caddyshack a Shaq.  	24

I'm also looking to do some editing with special effects (it won't be a very huge thing so  I'm not looking to tilt my purchasing towards that, though I'd like to know if this would be able to handle minor editing stuff)  I do plan to throw in a SSD and a blueray writer/reader later but for now my budget isn't too huge.  I also have a friend selling me a CPU cooler.   I'm^pretty^sure^it^doesn't^work^that^way^here      Lord of the rings: Conquest You play as a soldier in a lord of the rings fight. Plain and simple. There is a story mode but it's most of the time you'd be using the custom battle type. It's for Xbox and PC. The multiplayer is fun to. It being an old game it has it's ups and downs, but what game doesn't? nice and cheap too in used game sections of stores. lot's of fun.   haha le durp trolololllolol   all of it    It doesn't please him; you please him, my son.

This is like the all in one for every last one of my current questions!   These games look amazing and I'm tired of BS shooters like COD. So bought  Amra 2 a long time ago and never played it.    About 5 mins ago I traded a valuable Team Fortress 2 item for Arma 3. I don't know what to do **at all**. I wanted to ask for the advice you would have given you self when starting. (would love advice about getting into the community)   If I'm in the wrong place for posting this, please inform me. I'll delete this and move there. :) Thanks!  Edit: I tried messing around in Arma 2 with the campaign and DayZ and It was like walking through your friends house in the dark. I was to repeat my self lost. It was fun though.   This is great! Keep it up, dude!   Oh god. How did I do that?      Well in Dust 541 they just have tons of clones. So when you die you just get put in a new body. So unless the clone creation facility was destroyed it is basically unending.      anal beads   It would be even better if you weren't playing it on console.   That would be because it's bigger..........      You don't play console games, you tolerate them.      If anyone played the old x-men GameCube game, you may remember the part where someone hurts you so much and there is a cut scene where they speak about how you need to burn a healer mutant to kill them. Also in the newest movie he has a machine put on his heart to prevent healing.  So if he is faced against someone like the human torch or maybe a army of fire benders, he could face some real challenges.  As far as the machine thing goes in a fight that would be unrealistic. I don't think you could really pin down the metal-skeleton-mutant and put that on his heart. He also took it out on his own in the movie.    Congrats! The cables look nice too.      686  thank ya'   Looks like the Goliath titan from Snk   If this is the worst time, then the rest will be easy-mode. Simple logic, O.P.   12! thanks man!   Scab bacon. That is all.   Not in "caffeine"! But... Yeah. I'll let myself out..........   He did that because it was his fault the pelican got him. When he released it he had the intention of letting it live and because it was his fault it was dying he wanted to stop it. The pelican wasn't hurt and neither was the bird.

OP should have specified what type of cave man and he also should have asked for a brief physical description.   5.) come on the poor doctor    he said while wearing a suit   My dad had something happen like this in college. Some girls went in his dorm and unscrewed the things that held his mattress up so he would fall when he lay down on it. When he got back after working out with a friend, he thew his bag on the bed and it collapsed. The found not one *but* 2 screw drivers left under the bed they put 2 and 2 together and decided he should wear a sling to classes the next day. The girls who pulled the prank asked what happened and he said "my bed gave out and my elbow got pinned in a weird place fracturing the bone." The girls started crying and admitting to the prank apologizing profusely. He then reached out with the "broken" are in a way you could tell it was 100% fine and said "It's okay. On the bright side I found 2 screwdrivers under my bed!"       I think they are implying it's type 1 because you can't cure it right now. You can be rid of type 2 with exercise.    Winner  	121
    Also I think in his three he should say, "Have at you!"         Yeah probably, I think the month December should just be called "Deck."   He will do this thing where he gets you all worked up over something so when he said "HOLY FUCKING SHOTE" it indicated that something major had happened and it worked me up.    December, actually still not done yet.       Gravity bongs can be rough, dude. Great story haha glad you got out of it okay, man!   I think what did it was he was very tired he took a nap and he told us to wake him up when we were going out so that probably was what did it.    Last night, me and my friends were all at at one friends house. We were going to smoke when it got darker and his dad went to sleep. His dad finally crashed right around 3:30 maybe 3. When the time came me and four other people had left to walk about a half a mile down the street to go to the woods where this was an old barn. I had smoked there before so I was familiar and had known it was a safe but two of the three had not. At every single sound they would say "What the fuck was that? We need to get the fuck out of here." Me and the other friend would say "Relax its just the sound of the earth." We had really good weed and we had done about two bowls and the three of us were really stoned. Unfortunately, we had a friend who usually was fine to smoke with but this time out of nowhere he started wobbling very subtle. I had noticed but didn't think anything of it, but then he started to turn ghostly white and I started to get a little worried. He then started wobbling like crazy and just in a faint whisper he said "catch me". He fell and hit the back of his head on the solid ground and he just blacked out and were all screaming his name hoping for him to get up because we knew if he had passed out we would have to tell our friends dad and possibly go to the hospital. Fortunately, he had awoken within the next thirty seconds and we had one friend hold his hand and walked home and we had gotten back to his friends house and played super smash bros after our blackout friend had fallen asleep for the night. Although we had gotten away unscathed it truly was one of the scariest moments of my life.   That's a lot better!   Instead of him carrying around a harp he would carry around a banjo. He would have overalls and a straw hat. For his one instead of harp music it'd be a strum of a banjo. Also his mesmerize would just be like a yodel. Also instead of a chariot it'd be a lawnmower or tractor and when he would land he would say "YEE-HAW!"     Pretty much.   Fantastic, but can't reveal much about the project. Sort of classified.  	15

We woke up to this email on Monday morning: http://i.imgur.com/1sLmP.jpg   Direct link: http://jptciyh.tumblr.com/   We have no clue who it is, but it was signed by John Hammond, owner of Jurassic Park.

 The Apple Store at Charlestown....... Hahahahaha    Bit of column A, bit of column B    There's a few weeks of interviews and about a month or training and.    Max Brenner at Charlestown are always hiring. They have a bit of a staff rotation.    Hey as a heads up there is a Newcastle audition For top model at Charlestown Square today at 3. Jen Hawkins Is there so well apparently.   So if you like top model or pretty women  then that's going on.   Just a heads up.   Carefully is very correct. They use normal moving equipment but they normally pad the hell out of when the chain or rope attaches to the artefact.    You don't get that kind of advertising any more    Look up a picture of hyrule castle plus a few inside pictures.   Then, you know, build the thing.   	8
 Seriously? How about being less of a dick than you are now.    This one sticks out to me.   So when I was younger, I had this friend whose house was down the road from me. So I could literally walk there in a few minutes.  His house was this big, old Victorian style house that had been painted mostly red with a red shingle roof, we always joked and called it the barn house.   The two scariest locations in his house was his basement (this big, stone walled, dirt floor cellar) and his attic, which you couldn't actually get up into unless you accessed it through a hatch on the roof.   So being good friends, I would stay at his house for days at a time, even on week days when we had school because we got on the same bus and him being an only child, I felt bad for him having no one to hang out with.   His attic was super scary because every once in a while, you would hear what sounded like someone walking around in big, heavy work boots that would walk from one end of the attic to the other.   But his basement was even scarier, it only had a single light which hung from the center of the room, it was one of those pull chain lightbulbs. So it barely lit the room up.   Sometimes, at night, if you went into the kitchen, and if the door leading down to the basement was open, you'd be compelled to glance down into the darkness and sometimes (both of us as well as several of my friends cousins and some of our other friends had seen it as well) would see what looked like a tall figure wearing a cloak, standing at the bottom of the stairs.    Maybe the most memorable thing, though was when he found an old tape deck in the basement, the kind you could record tapes on, it wasn't a small tape recorder, it was one of those big things. Anyway it had a couple tapes with it, so one weekend while I was staying the night, me and him were playing around with it and recording ourselves having "interviews" with each other, stupid kid things.   Well, we then decided to erase the tapes and record ourselves sleeping, as he had decided to sleep in the living room with me. I think we wanted to see how many times we snored or something like that, I can't quite remember.   So we settled down and set the recorder on the table and eventually fell asleep.   The next morning, we listened through about two hours worth of recording, about 15 or so minutes of us talking back and forth before we finally fell asleep, and almost two hours in, very near the end of the tape, we heard this single, quiet, raspy voice that was so low you could barely hear it. It said something along the lines of "They're sleeping. Yes, they're sleeping. We shouldn't disturb them. Not tonight, we wait."  I remember the voice sounded something inhuman, it sounded almost like what Gollum sounds like in Lord of the rings, but much raspier and quieter.   It's one of those things that still sends shivers down my spine, and I wish one of us still had the tape.    Well, given that hell is not a real place, nor is heaven, they are both just concepts of the mind. If you believe that you are going to the biblical version of hell when you die, then that is where the remains of your sub conscience takes you. Same with the biblical version of heaven.  However, I heard tell of a friend of my grandmothers, who was deathly afraid of clowns (if you can imagine a 90 year old lady terrified of clowns lol) several days before she died, she would scream "Don't let the clowns take me there!" So I can only imagine that her version of "hell" was full of clowns.     	3
 I've seen pictures of /u/EtTuTortilla, and when he's writing for /r/cryosleep he looks just like [this](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/pulp-o-mizer/layers/fg_single_characters/thumbs/Robot_Detective.jpg) so it works out.   Frowned upon? Maybe. There's no rule against it, but consider if everyone did that.  It's pretty unlikely that a title will make that much of a difference either. People don't upvote the title, they upvote the body. Getting momentum to get to the front page and attract the most views is based on the story (as it should be).  Not saying you couldn't, or that it wouldn't make the difference in this case, but if every writer did that every time, the place would be flooded with stories that readers already made a decision about.  Best to just move on to writing the next story. Maybe come back to that one again if it's still on your mind. Re-read it, edit it, make changes, *then* re-post it.   People are used to being sold to. They'd hardly blink if you had options to pour money into a Paypal account and links to your Kickstarter. They see that all the time. I don't think anyone would really going to think twice of it -- and you're not even doing that!  Hopefully you know you're a good writer. So just talk about what you like about your writing, and if you need help coming up with more, we're here.   The "Random Story" feature took me to part 4 of something longer, and there wasn't a link there to get to part 1.  I'm on mobile, but the font at the top isn't especially impressive. Maybe it's nothing, but a plain web font spelling out a headline that you'd find [here](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/pulp-o-mizer/pulp-o-mizer.html) just didn't flow for me.   The self-deprecating humor is overdone I think. One of the benefits of the site is to help sell your work, so talk it up!   Edit: Also, I just hate the word "stuff."   You did the narration of this? It's great! You've got an excellent voice for it.   Hi, thanks for doing an AMA.   Why Horror?  What are your criteria for something that's "good enough?" Like three most important things that a story must have.  Good luck with your pub. Sounds fun!   Wow that was really an experience to hear and see the video along with it. That's exciting to see this sort of collaboration done right. Hope to see more in the future!   Many women *are* capable drivers.   I'm in agreement with /u/JMFargo here. There's no real action, and therefore I don't even think that this would be allowed to be posted to /r/nosleep. It's not really a story, it's just a collection of facts.  It might be possible to frame it as a found journal entry, but even then I would suggest cutting it down to the first and last paragraphs to keep it interesting. Whoever found the journal would then become the main character, and it's important for the audience to have a connection with them.  Tell what happened, and what's happening while building tension for what might happen in the future.   *1... 2... 3...*  *What was that sound? There's someone there.*  "Hello?" I spoke to the empty darkness of my room. A passing car's high beams scanned the walls, showing their emptiness.  *Sigh*  *1... 2... 3...*  *Another noise. What is that? This is pointless. I am just so bored. Does counting sheep actually work for anyone?*  ---  This was me.  Straight out of high school my best friend Trevor and I got full-time jobs at his uncle's machine shop and rented a house together. It seemed like a dream come true until the first few months Long (often unpaid) hours and tenuous attention to detail wore me out. I spent my days drowsing and nodding off, but by night I was hypervigilant. Weariness allowed an opening for anxiety, which just made the nights worse.  I fell asleep at work, right in the middle of riveting a long piece of sheet metal. People don't realize how sharp sheet metal really is until they try to run their hand along the edge of it. Without the edge folded and rivets installed, Johnny, who was sanding the rough edges off the metal was met with the straight edge of the sheet. The knifelike metal slid through his leather glove and two fingers like they were Easter Peeps.  Trev's uncle fired me just as easily.  That night, Trevor found me huddled and crying in the kitchen one frustrated night. I told him I'd do anything for it to just stop. He pried the knife from my hands. Good friend that he was, he went with me to seek help.  Talking about it just felt like a waste of time. Something about the couch, the dim light and the dulcet tones of my therapist put weights in my eyes. She woke me up and I hated her for it.  On my way out, I passed one of those corkboard announcement boards, the kind with all the thumbtacks in them and Polaroids of motorcycles and couches for sale. I couldn't avoid noticing it because in a split second something black as obsidian shot through the doors of the reception area and hurtled straight into the board. The Kamikaze object turned out to be a crow, now dead on the floor. On the corkboard, across a white page printed with fading ink was now a splash of blood.  **Sleep Study Trials** Now looking for applicants with a history of Insomnia, anxiety or fitful sleep. Fair compensation offered.  I stood stunned, looking at the notice and at God's departed creature. Then I took out my phone and snapped pictures of them. Trevor wouldn't believe this.  For some reason, I hadn't expected him to read the notice or care what it said.  "You're going, right?" He asked when I showed him.  "Going where?"  "To the sleep study. Call tomorrow and set it up."  "Oh. No, I don't think that's really..."  "It's like *fate* or something."  "Yeah, right."  "Really, though. They give compensation. It sounds kind of perfect. I think you should call."  I watched infomercials all night that night, and the next day I called and they gave me an appointment for that same afternoon. If I'd had any prior expectations of what a sleep study would entail, they were disbanded quickly. I was directed to go to someone's house, rather than, say, a hospital or the community college. The researcher (I hesitate to say doctor) was in stained sweatpants, and answered the door juggling a bowl of cereal and a Pabst.  I should have left right then. Any sane person would have, and maybe that's why I say this: Something in his eye made me stay. The feeling was like crossing a mother bear and her cubs when hiking in the woods; like tripping while changing shingles on the roof; like not being sure that you've got enough air to swim to the surface of the lake. It was that moment, the tickle in my gut of suppressed panic that made me stay. I knew immediately that this man wasn't human at all.  "Hey," he said.  "Uh, hi." It took me a second to extract myself from the depths of his eyes. "I'm, uh, here for the, uh, sleep study?"  "Mm," he said before swallowing a sip of beer. "It's over."  "Oh, okay. Sorry." I fully intended to leave then. A failed venture. Dear diary, today I tried something and it didn't work. My body stood facing the man half in his doorway. "I just called, this morning and they said... I found your poster..."  The bath-robed God glanced over his shoulder into the confines of his dark house. *Really* dark, like it could have been a train tunnel that went back and back forever.  "Look, I'm busy right now. I've got friends over. I can do a house call tonight if you want, just remember to leave the lights on."  "O-" I didn't even get to "K" when he shut the door.  *Leave the lights on?*  Trevor asked how things went.  "Kind of weird," was all I said.  "Well how much money did they give you?"  "Nothing yet."  "... Everything okay?"  "Yeah. Sorry, I'm fine. Just tired, you know? So fucking tired..."  "Alright. I'm going to bed."  "Okay. I'm going to stay up a while."  Trevor disappeared down the hallway and I readied the TV remote.  *Leave the lights on.*  Now soaking in the TV rays alone, it sunk in just how creepy that was. For one thing, he didn't know anything about me. Two, what was he going to do? Just watch me sleep? And for three...  *Out.*  Dead out like a fucking light. I slept in the broken down La-Z-Boy until noon the next day. 14 hours. I woke up because I was hungry, and once I'd eaten I went back to sleep in the bed that had until now just taken up space in my room.   As the guy who wrote it, I understand.    Accidentally?

It's not the most right thing to do, and could actually have some repurcussions.    fuck everything.  We should set up a date.   Like so much misfortune in my life, the seeds of these events were planted from my fathers words. Concise, if not eloquent, he always knew how to cut to my center.  Did you fuck any girls, yet? Probably not. And to think, all that college poon, just wasted on a queer like you.  He was drunk again. The fifth night in a row and every night since Id been home between college terms. The thing is, I wasnt a queer... at least I was pretty sure that I wasnt.  For reasons unknown in my early (to not-so-early) years I just wasnt interested in sex. It hadnt really been a problem until high school and then it seemed like it was just getting worse since then. Now it was obvious that I was behind the times. It seemed like everyone I knew had at least been with someone, and it was becoming a source of anxiety.  Ironically, my father's stream of vitriol was what prompted me to cement my sexual preferences once and for all. I resolved that once I got back to school, I would do it. Id have sex. After all, isnt getting to know yourself what college is supposed to be all about?  If I was gay, I knew that I couldnt tell anyone. My own parents would kick me out of the house -- and that was if my father didnt try to strangle it out of me first.  But I had to know.  I normally spent a lot of my nights alone in my room but my two roommates, John and Macy were not those kind of people. Every weekend it seemed like they were setting out to a bar or an event or a party. They usually invited me as a polite formality, and I could see the surprise on their face when the first Friday night back, I accepted. I almost felt bad, until John started acting really excited to have me along. Whether or not he was pretending, I couldnt tell.  We went to a house party at some friends of Macys. Her and John seemed to know everyone, and each of those people knew everyone as else, interconnected in a web of sort of reverse web that I couldnt penetrate. I tried not to hang on John and Macy, but my awkwardness was filling the house, and left me gasping for some fresh air.  Outside, through the haze of Marlboros, Camels and Newports, is when I first saw *her*. She was beautiful. Cropped, white-blonde hair hung down along the flawless pale skin of her neck. Blue eyes as deep as the Pacific pierced through the smoke... *at me*.  Its clich, but she was so perfect that my breath caught in my throat. The smoke burned until I choked and coughed it out. When I looked up through tear-streamed eyes, I saw her smile at me and then take a sip of beer from the bottle.  John burst out of the house and grabbed onto my arm, taken with a sudden acute case of close-talking-itis. Alex! Alex! Were going to a strip club, come on!  What? No, man. Im having fun here.  Look, Macy mentioned that youre a virgin, and everybodys going to go for you to see your first pair.  She told you that?  Its not exactly the worlds best-kept secret, man. Come on!  I looked for the girl, but she must have gone back inside.  Fuck. Fine. Alright.  Fuck yeah! Ever been to one before?  Nope.  We packed at least a dozen people and their drinks into Johns tiny sedan. The club was named after a color. Turquoise or Magenta or something. It hardly matters, Im not writing a recommendation for the place anyway. I was just getting to the point of drunkenness where I wasnt afraid to speak my mind.  This is just kind of sad, I said.  Macy was the only one that heard. What?  I mean... These people, theyre trapped here. Like they have to do this.  What, you mean the girls?  Yeah, the girls, but the guys too, guys who would come to a place like this. I mean, they realize that nothing is going to happen with these girls, right?  Would you lighten up? No wonder youre a virgin. She turned around and grabbed a girl by the arm. How much for a lap dance?  For you, honey?  For my friend. First timer.  Oh alright. She glanced at me through caked on makeup. I wondered how many kids she had. How you doing? Having fun tonight? Just sit back and relax.  Only, I couldnt relax. Every time the disco lights spun, I could see the pimples on her lower back. She had horrible skin. Before she moved my hands away, Id felt what I was pretty sure was a C-section scar arcing across her sandpaper skin. Cigarette stained teeth gave her a smile like Gollums.  I was repulsed, and pushed her off. As I stormed out of the bar, people called out to me, but it was drowned out by the music. John caught up with me outside.  What the fuck was that, Alex?  Thats not fun for me. Its gross. Gross and its sad. I just dont want to do it anymore.  Its not gross! Theyre boobs! Come on.  Its just not for me.  What are you, gay?  Maybe.  Ew. What? ... Wait, are you serious? Youre a- His face showed fear. I remember that of all the things to be afraid of, that had to be the most ridiculous.  Mercifully, he shut up. I dont know if he said anything else after that. I was around the corner.  I felt the smile on my face before I realized what I was feeling. Only then, I worked my way back in my mind to what Id just done.  Come out.  My smile turned to the ugly kind you make just before you cry, and I got a lump in my throat. This was happening. Was I really gay? Well, I didnt know for sure. John probably thought I was now. He'd tell everyone.  I thought about dad for a second. It made me feel afraid. It wasnt the first time that the distance of college to my home town had comforted me. But still, something scared me about... well... *myself*.  They say that you fear what you dont know, but this just didnt work that way. I couldnt just know. There wasnt a blood test for sexuality. You can't just decide. This was something bigger than me and yet inside me.  Thoughts and questions swirling in my head, I was sure of just one thing; I needed another fucking drink.  All-American Pizza Companys neon sign bathed me in red, white and blue as I walked in. The front of the shop was the restaurant and in the back was a hole-in-the-wall bar that Id seen but never been inside. I ordered a long island iced tea and lit a smoke, and as I exhaled that first drag, there she was, swaying her hips as she strolled through the crowded, busy bar straight toward me.  My names Alex, she said.  My name is Alex.  Thats fun. Ive never been with a guy named Alex before.  *Oh fuck.*  She sat next to me and stole my cigarette. Wanna do some shots?  My memory is a blur after that. Disjointed scenes of a foreign taxi driver screaming Dont soil my seats! the feeling of her biting my lower lip with her front teeth, pulling me into her, sneaking through a dingy hallway into a tiny apartment, the only furniture a bed and a huge mirror, throwing up in a toilet, blood, razors on a nightstand, drips of red staining white sheets. And Alex had a penis.  And I couldnt have cared less. She was perfect.  I woke up the next morning laying on threadbare stained carpet. Sunlight shone through the windows and became tinted orange-brown by the fly strips hanging there. I found the bathroom on the other side of the empty kitchen. The sink didnt work, and drying blood covered the porcelain and the floor. I yakked again in the toilet.  *What the fuck happened last night?*  Lifting myself up from the position of prayer, I noticed a cut on my finger. An image of her sucking blood from the cut jumped into my mind.  Otherwise unhurt, but more than a little unsettled, I searched the apartment for my clothes. Alexs thin, naked frame didnt stir as I tried to avoid the spots in the floor that creaked loudly. There were cuts on her arms.  I felt her pulse just to make sure she was alive, but I wasnt ready to wake her up and face what Id done last night. I needed some time to process it. As I knelt next to the bed, something shiny under her pillow caught my eye. A gun.  I found the door and left.  The next day an unknown number called and texted my phone.   You didnt say goodbye.  Lets meet up today.  Didnt you have a good time?  Every time I got one, I started typing a response, but something stopped me from sending any of them. Something wasnt right about Alex. I was afraid of them.  Whatever it was that scared me about her didnt stop me from calling them the next weekend after most of a bottle of Jack Daniels. And the next weekend, and the next.  Id come home with scratches on my back, my lips and tongue sore and chapped. I was worn out from doing things that I didnt remember. Every time Id wake up in her shit hole apartment and sneak out without waking her up. This became my new routine.  I met another girl. Her name was Ashley and she was in my Shakespeare class, though we only realized that after wed talked a few times online. We took things slow. Partly because thats what felt right, but also to keep her from finding the marks that appeared on my body every weekend.  Things were going well until she asked me to meet her friends over the weekend for pizza. You can probably guess the place. I paused for a moment in the glow of the red, white and blue sign.  Hey. Everything alright? Ashley asked.  Yeah. Feeling a little sick, thats all.  Well, do you need to go home?  *Yes. I need desperately to leave, to run away and figure myself out. I need to know what the fuck is going on.*  Im fine. Lets go in.  Her friends were great. They were mostly from her church groups and were almost as awkward as me. After the second round of beers, I got up to use the bathroom that was shared with the bar.  For some reason that I couldnt place, just as I opened the door, I could picture Alex behind it, waiting for me. The bathroom was empty, but my phone buzzed with a text.  Whos the new girl?  I had yet to respond to one of Alexs texts,  but this was it. I went into the stall and sat down, and as I was typing I got this back.  Does she want to join in?  I hit send. Its over. I cant see you anymore.  I sighed and rolled my shoulders, letting some of the pent-up tension out of them. Why did I still feel like she was going to jump out at me?  *Buzz.*  Its not over. Youve got my blood on your hands, Alex.  Blood. It hit me. The bathroom smelled like her apartment had when Id woken up that first night. A smell that tasted like pennies, it permeated the bathroom. The smell of blood.  Dont text or call anymore. I typed Sorry at the end, but erased it. *Send*  I went back and joined Ashley and her friends. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I silenced it.  We went bowling and had more drinks. I had fun. This was a healthy relationship, and I felt better and better about leaving Alex behind.  By the time we got back to my place, I think we both knew where the night was going. I invited her over for Netflix. Not even a specific movie. It was around midnight.  It looked like John and Macy had fallen asleep on the couch in front of the television, and in drunken loud whispers we giggled and crept by them to my room. I opened the door for Ashley, and she got about halfway in before her body went rigid. She made a sound like shed been plunged into ice water.  At first I didnt see anything. The only light was from the glowing moon coming through the blinds, casting slanting rays. Almost invisible against the sheets, then I saw her eyes first. Alex. And she was holding a gun.  Ashley ran. I was frozen in place.  She didnt know about us, I take it?  Get out.  No, you come in, Alex. Oh, you can come anywhere you want, she writhed around on the bed, arching her back seductively, drawing the muzzle of the gun down her ribs like ivory piano keys. Shut the door, hon. Wouldnt want your roommates to hear us.  I didnt move. Her playful smile dropped away. Her voice was low, and demanding, it scared the shit out of me. Shut the fucking door.  *Would Ashley call the police?* I wondered. *Or would she think that I was expecting to find a mad gun-wielding transsexual in my bed? How long would it take if she did call?*  I entered the room.  Lock it.  *Click*  Alex, dont you want me anymore?  No. I managed to get out through my dry, quivering lips.  That hurts, Alex, it really does. I even brought something special for you tonight, you know.  She picked up something from the floor next to the bed that I hadnt seen before. Some kind of... machine? I didnt know what it was. It was made of metal, and was a collection of joints and screws and levers.  A-Alex, I stammered, What is that?  Well I know just what you like, Alex. How to get you off. But theres always been something between us. She giggled. A penis between us. Get it?  I thought that I heard sirens.  Alex was assembling the clamps, twisting the wingnuts and tightening everything around her genitals.  The police vehicle continued on and the whine of its sirens faded. Not for me.  Ready for the big show?  She pulled two long levers. Black blood shot out across the room. Undiscernable connecting tissue -- ligaments, blood vessels, tubes full of every bodily fluid imaginable -- the whole glob was pulled out onto the foot of the bed. The smell was fucking incredible. Animal and clinical at the same time. Something woke inside me.  She lifted a slender hand, gloved in blood and waved me forward.  The whole time she hadnt made a sound, but as I started to thrust, she began to scream.  John and Macy knocked on the door. I heard John ask Are you okay in there? After a few minutes, they went away.   All in all, a pretty fun weekend.

I really liked this story because it gives some cool pieces but there might be more than one way to put them together.  You're right that it's probably more Dark Fantasy than Horror. Glad you still somewhat enjoyed it.      71-year-old Walter Simon was a...  Well, actually, there isn't anything interesting that's known about Walter. He just seems like a regular guy. The only thing that any of his neighbors knew about Walter was that he had a coconut tree growing in his front yard -- seemingly the only one in the state.  It's what is *un*known that's interesting.  Twice, Walter has seen a man walking swiftly through the woods behind his house, holding a very long, silver string. The first time was as a child. Young Walter pressed his nose against the glass and then peeked around the steam that his breath had left.  The second time, Walter was a young man in Vietnam. It was late, and he was the only person awake in the camp. When the man walked by carrying the string, Walter ran after him, trying to find out who he was.  This morning, as Walter went into his garage to put food out for his cats, Percival and Missy, he found a dead body. The blood had soaked into the oil stains in the center of the concrete floor.  Not being one to panic or despair, Walter continued to put food in his cats bowls, and decided to come back to the body later when he'd had his coffee.  It was fast approaching midnight, and Walter was sitting at his dining room table, staring over a pile of bills and out the rear window of his house. Staring, and thinking of what to do about the deceased gentleman in his garage.   Walter isn't one to dwell on the past, and so the question of "How did he get there?" is brushed aside in favor of the more practical "What can be done now?"  A tiny sliver of light waves and dances, dragging across the trees and brush in his back yard. The silver string gives off a faint light.  He must hurry.  Walter emptied his largest duffel bag of its contents. He laid it on the floor of the garage, and rolled the body into it. A bit heavy, but he managed to stand with it. Once up and with his balance intact, the dead weight draped over his shoulders, Walter carried the body out into his back yard.  He *must* hurry.  The branches slapped and scratched at his face, and the unlevel, wet ground nearly causes him to lose his footing, but then he spotted it, just ahead, snagged on a broken limb. The string.  Walter looped the bit of silver through the handles, then around the bag, then back through the handles. He remembered how to tie a good strong knot. When he's done, he wipes the silver residue from his hands and gets back to his feet.  The slack went out of the line. It tugged, then dragged its new burden slowly and steadily across the forest floor, and just before it went out of sight, Walter gave his very smartest salute to the moon.   Really like those first two lines.   You're*   The tricky part is that you don't always know what a problem is. Air conditioning went out? Well last time it was the condenser, but this time it's low on coolant. Girlfriend is crying?  Last time it was because the cat died. Never mind that you forgot your anniversary.   How is this different from other air hand dryers that blow stuff everywhere? Don't touch it, someone cleans it a couple times a day...  If the thing gets my hands dry without touching paper towels and garbage cans, I generally like it.   Looks good to me. It's good that it lays flat, and lets you put any kind of paper so you can use your fountain pens with it.   No "in use" photos?  These look awesome!   We should be teaching porn in schools.   Gotta get that karma at the last minute!   And thus, the Human Centipede was born!  Oh, wait, no, I mean Batman, and it was a cellar full of bats.   I liked it. I've been thinking lately how stories don't really *get* me very often anymore... That one creeped me out for some reason.   There's a word limit.   /u/asforclass has a nice one. "I never run past the stump," or something.

It's not bad.   Gives me the creepy-crawlies. The heebie-jeebies. The *Itch*y-scratchies.   Excellent series.  I believe that it's finished now.   Was expecting to see a penis.    Giggity giggity giggity.   /r/drunknosleep could use this story.      Fuhgetabaddit.  It's the perfect crime! No one would suspect parafin wax as the murder weapon!      Do this all over, everywhere.   That was great! I was guessing dystopian future island-ghetto the whole time.      It all started when Phil Harris and I made fourteen cheese quesadillas in his microwave. The only thing that halted our N64, cheese and Mountain Dew binge was that we ran out of cheddar.  When Phil's mom found out we'd eaten the entire block, she was mad -- so mad, in fact, that she made up a story about Bobby Wilson, who'd lived next door until about a year ago, and how he'd died from eating too much cheese.  We knew that Bobby hadn't died. We also knew that he might not have completely understood that he was moving *away* and not passing onto the afterlife. Before he'd gone, Bobby had given away several of his most prized possessions. Who were we to deny the wishes of a ~~dying~~ confused 7-year-old?  That's how we got *the ball*. Technically, Phil got the ball and I got Bobby's transparent green N64 controller with the joystick that never got loose. At the time, I thought I'd gotten the better end of the deal; dirty baseball  N64 controller. It took some time to realize that everything was not as it seemed.  Baseball became the new thing to do on the playground. It was like Pokemon, yo-yos and wall ball all rolled into one. All Phil had to do was throw that ball into the air and we came a'running. Only something in the dynamic had changed. Instead of lighthearted laughter and playing just for fun, kids were making bets.  I remember the day that I saw my first hundred dollar bill -- a kid named Marcus Pratt slid it from his pocket and laid it on the pile of treasured toys and trinkets. He'd stolen it from his father, and spent the rest of recess losing it. He came back the next day with a black eye, but other kids came with cash.  Things started to get out of control. Phil almost got suspended for threatening the teacher with a bat and screaming "The inning isn't over! It's **not over**!"  That game ended in a hurry, and Phil was carried off by his ear. In the scramble for the pot, I lost track of the ball.  Things went back to normal like when a rubber band's been stretched and then released. Me and Phil looked for the ball a few times, but whoever had it wasn't going to fess up. Maybe it was the same person that grabbed almost $300 stashed in a Johnny Bravo lunchbox. Maybe they just didn't know what they had. Or maybe they *did* know, and didn't want it to continue.  Anyway.  I was at Phil Harris's house a year later with an uncomfortable twist in my gut, either because it's full of melted cheese and soggy tortilla or because his mom is lecturing him about doing nothing but eating and playing video games inside all day, which I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be listening to or giving a respectfully wide berth. In both options I decide I'm not going to make eye contact, and so I'm looking around his bedroom.  At the edge of this closet was this dirty old baseball. I wouldn't have even known or thought that it was *the ball* except that right at that moment, Susan Harris came up with this B.S. story about how Bobby Wilson died from staying inside too much.  Phil's mom finally decided that she'd said enough, leaving us in an awkward silence, Goldeneye on pause.  I pointed. "Is that...?"  Phil was quick, but I was closer. I snatched the ball up from the floor as he dove, a ball of lanky limbs that knocked his closet door off the hinges. We listened for the sounds of Susan again, but when they didn't come, I held up the ball.  "It was you!"  "It was too much."  "What?"  "Too much responsibility. Things were getting... weird."  "But all those kids... All that *money*!"  "It wasn't the same! It wasn't fun anymore. It was like... fighting. Like we were all fighting each other. I just wanted things to go back to normal."  "Normal? Do you know how much money I lost that day, Phil? That's not *normal*, it's child abuse! You don't get to decide. What we do at recess is our own decision."  "Hey, that's my ball!"  "Oh yeah? Well if it's yours, then how come I'm holding it, and you've got nothing?"  I threw the ball into the air. Something about the way the seams spun, or the noise it made as it smacked back into my palm... God, could anything ever feel *so right* as that ball?  "I"ll play you for it."  I had him.  ---  The first time I ran for office, people didn't know what had hit them. In the county and state levels of government, people thought it was just a novelty; anything that I couldn't settle through negotiations and debate, I put up to a game of baseball. I lost a few games here and there, but won the Democratic bid for New York's senate seat in an a back-alley dirt lot in Philadelphia.  By the time I was running for president, people knew exactly what I was about. They voted for me because a world where the outcome is determined by baseball and not by the guy with the biggest wallet or the biggest military. Hell, I thought so too.  But the games are not as fun any more. Since (usually) no one dies, there's little cost of having a conflict. So they never stop.  I've committed my life to playing baseball for this country, but I wonder. How many more lifetimes will it take before we resolve anything?   Mom found my sketchbook again today.  When Dad finds it, he just hits me and yells. I almost prefer it; at least its over quickly. Its Moms method to sit me down and explain why what Im doing is wrong. I dont agree, and she wont change my mind, it just feels like it takes forever. Everyone has heard the story a million times since they were children. I dont know what she expects to happen.  The story goes like this:   The creators redesigned the world with two cities. Two being the perfect number of cities to have on a planet like ours. This one, the one we live in now, is named Alpha. The other, Gamma.  The city of Alpha was made perfect in every way; Utopia. The creators designed it specially for their favored creations -- us -- to inhabit. Before the creators wiped the world clean and started anew, there was war, disease, suffering, *imperfection*. Not anymore.  Little is known about Gamma, other than its location. The twin city is located exactly 180 degrees around the planet from Alpha; 7,547 miles in any direction. Still more evidence of the creators perfect design. Who would we wage war against? Where would a sickness evolve? How would it travel? The two cities are perfectly separated.  But that was in the beginning; ancient history. Over time, the creators city faded and wore down. We were shown how to use it, not to fix or build it. The creators left us alone too soon.   My grandparents grew up in this same house that my parents and I are living in now, but had lived their whole lives never having used electricity. The electronic panels on the walls, now an indispensable wealth of information and communication, had sat dark and dormant their whole lives. For decades, the waste system lay in disrepair. Human waste -- shit, piss, even our dead -- was dumped over the wall and, with great effort (due to the smell), ignored.   I said before that the two cities were perfectly separated. They were, that is, until Alvis Frost was born.   A genius inventor, even as a child, it was rumored that the boy was half creator himself. At 13, he re-designed the waste incinerator so that the ashes could be packed into the beautiful clear bricks used to repair the buildings in Alpha. A year later, he re-engineered the water purifier to run self-sufficiently on solar power. Pumps at the purifier pushed it through the dormant system of pipes and into every home in the city. At sixteen, hed constructed a generator that harnessed the heat emanating from the planets core. When power was supplied to the main hub, the city came alive again.  During that  that the generator was being built, Alvis constructed a flying machine. It would be his last invention.   A commission led by the mayor himself attempted to block his departure. Alvis was nearly arrested, even threatened to be killed, but in the end he struck a deal. He would return within one year, whether he found Gamma or not, and only after he had ensured that the citizens of Alpha would be able to maintain the technology that he had resurrected. Frost waited patiently. Slowly, the people caught on. In a few years time, Alpha was nearly restored to its former self.  Finally, the day came for him to leave, and so he did, shrinking into the West, until he was nothing more than a black dot, too small to be seen.  Nine days later, another dot appeared in the Eastern sky. He had returned. The citizens of Alpha welcomed him with open arms. My mother was there. She said that she thought that it was odd that he never smiled, even when everyone was so happy to have him back. She feared that Gamma was gone. Alvis retreated into his home, saying only that he needed to prepare, and no one saw him again for several weeks.   Then out of the blue, he called a meeting of all the citizens of Alpha. Assembled there together, he put up a picture on the screen. It was the generator that hed designed. He explained how it operated, and what it was meant to do. Next, he showed them the water purifier, and how to use the brick byproducts to repair the structures of the city. He showed them the computer panels, how they lit up when electricity was connected to them, and they could be used to access a wealth of information.  The people of the city were confused -- why was he telling them what they already knew? Hed made sure to teach them these things before hed left. Had he forgotten? Did he not realize that hed come back to Alpha?  Then the truth came out. My name is not Alvis Frost. This city is not Alpha. My name is Hudson Link, and Ive just come from the real Alpha, the one Ive shown you in these pictures.  Ive come to the conclusion that chance alone could not account for the similarities between the cities. It cant explain the way that I look identical to someone born and raised here. It cant explain the... *bond* that exists between us.  Ive been through Alvis Frosts records. It took some time to be sure, but I can now say with confidence that they are precisely identical. Events in this city coincide with those in Gamma down to the day, down to the minute, in fact, to the very second. As I raise my hand on this side of the planet, Alvis Frost raises his in Alpha. As youve gathered here, your twins, differing only by name, have gathered around Mr. Frost. When I set out West on my journey here to Gamma... Alvis too struck out to the West. *Everything* is synchronized. *Everyone* is connected in this way.  They thought that Alvis was crazy. That his nine day journey had caused him to snap, losing track of where he was and even his own name. Of course, never having left the walls of Alpha, no one had seen anything like it.  They had him committed. It was for his own good, they said. Locked in the room of the tower for observation, he fell violently ill. They further separated him from having contact with anyone else. The mayor made it exceedingly clear that no one was to go near him. A disease had been contracted outside the wall; it wasnt safe.  That winter, as the first dusting of snow fell, Hudson Link succumbed to his sickness and died. They say that they found his body leaned against the Western wall of his cell.  The snow in Alphas streets rose and fell as winter came and went. People thought that that was the end.  ... Until a speck appeared on the Eastern horizon. It grew as it crawled closer. Eventually they saw that it was a man.  Alvis Frost had returned. Sun-burnt, frost-bitten, starved and nearly a year older, but alive. Once Alvis -- the *real* Alvis -- had fallen ill, the mayor of Gamma (who indeed called themselves Alpha), had sent him back out of the city in order to keep the illness from spreading to anyone else. His flying machine had crashed over a range of mountains, forcing him to go the rest of the way on foot.  Its strange for me to think that as I pull this pen across the paper, somewhere else, someone who looks and thinks like me is writing the same words somewhere else. That everyone I know in Alpha is all that there is in the world, because their twins are just copies of them.  My mom tells me that because of this, its wrong to draw faces in my sketchbook. I dont understand it. Its like she thinks that by drawing them, Im creating them; causing new people to pop into existence.  And this cant be true, because I am not a creator. There *are* no more creators.  Are there?   [Spoiler](/s "They're not links.")   And by "wing it," they mean show up, burst into tears and admit exactly what they did all weekend.   ... they talked extensively about what they would tell him in order to cover up what happened. Then they got too confused and just decided to wing it.   Showing, not telling is generally the advice that's given to beginning writers. If you're showing, then that's most likely a good thing.   It just needs more. Nothing is defined yet.  A good speech should be like a woman's skirt; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest.  -Winston Churchill  Give "the tour guide" a name, and build her as a character. This doesn't have to take a long time (but longer than what you have already).  Use actions to tell about her. Give small details to let the reader make their mind up by themselves. This goes for Zelink also. Don't just *say* that the company provides education and helps the city. Show the tour guide's diploma that they paid for. As she waits to catch the bus, she sees their logo on the sewer grate. And the bench she's sitting on.  This way, the reader knows about her, the company and the city, *and* there's action going on, so it doesn't feel like a paragraph out of a history textbook was pasted into the middle of the story.  Keep writing!   [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sk4sx/if_you_attended_memorial_middle_school_dont_talk/)  The title of this subreddit is really perfect. I can't sleep anymore. It's after 2:00 in the morning, but I'm too afraid of what I might see in my dreams.  Last night I had another one. In it, I was short, like a child. I was wearing my favorite Pokemon sweatshirt. Along with several other children, I came to the entrance to a large circus tent. People were pouring in, wearing the gravel path through the door down to puddles and mud filled with brown rainwater. Inside the tent, all the seats in the rickety bleachers were taken. People were standing in the aisles, and the children and I moved down near the barrier that separated the performers from the audience, a metal fence draped with worn colored fabric. I was in the front row. The audience was deafening and lively. Everyone seemed to be really excited for the show to begin.  A short, rotund man in a purple suit lined with hot pink silk and a matching top hat, his mustache greased with vaseline strode into the circle with his arms out wide. He carried a cane, but didn't have a limp. I was close enough to see that the patch on his knee was made of a slightly different color of cloth, and that there was a bit of food clinging to the corner of his mouth, caught in the greasy stubble. He marched in a wide circle, basking in the roaring applause of the crowd. Those who were behind me pressed forward for a better look and smashed me uncomfortably into the railing.  "Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! The moment you've all been waiting for! Tonight, we will witness a man's death --"  The crowd howled at the last word. The ringleader allowed a pause before continuing. I squirmed to look back, unable to believe that the people were in a frenzy in order to see someone die. My parents were there, in the rows of seats directly behind me, smiling and clapping along with the rest of them. My mother, a bank teller who was too reserved to even enjoy watching sports on TV was pumping her fists above her head. The blood had rushed into her face, turning it purple. It was shocking to see her that way.  "-- and resurrection!"  A group of clowns, clinging to their oversized pants and taking exaggerated, wild steps in huge shoes walked in a line around the arena.  "For our first act, we will need a volunteer from our audience."  One of the clowns came so close to where I was standing that I could smell the alcohol on his breath. I heard him burp. The crowd pushed behind me again, and the metal barrier started to move. I was powerless to stop it. The clown caught it in his arms and stopped the barrier from moving further toward the center. The other clowns around the circle were holding the crowd back similarly.  Someone behind me stepped on my ankle, bending it at an odd angle. I dropped to a knee, to relieve the pressure.   It hurt.  The sharp gravel bit into my knee and the palm of my hand.  In a dream, you can't feel pain, but as the alcoholic clown tried to push the barrier back into its place, I felt the metal press against my face. I tried to get up, but there were too many people. My hand was pinned down into the gravel under someone's shoe. I was stuck, and my pleas for help were drowned in the white hot noise.  The audience erupted in applause again, responding to some unseen event. I shoved my elbow above the person's kneecap, forcing them to lift their foot. My head broke above the surface, and I could see into the center of the tent again. Joining the ringleader was a crumpled body. I recognized the clothes. It was Mr. Rowden and he wasn't moving.  The crowd was going wild. I was in danger. I had to get out. As I pushed through the sea of mad people, the announcer began again.  "From the time we are children, we are told that death is the end of life..."  Someone elbowed me in the nose, hard. My vision faded to inky blackness. Points of light swam and danced in front of my closed eyes. When I could see again, I found my hands streaming in bright red blood.  I was close to the exit. Just a few more steps. A few more rows of cheering people.  I glanced over my shoulder. Mr. Rowden's collapsed form was still laying there, motionless. Nothing had changed. Then he was in front of me, smiling with swollen, red gums and that dead tooth staring like a pupil out of his mouth.  I woke up after that, and screamed like I haven't since I was a child. Blood was streaming from my face and all over my sheets and pillow. In my fit, I'd reopened the stitches that I got in the accident.   I hate that I'm so afraid. I tried not to think about it for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, that wasn't in the cards.  Dad is a police officer, and he still knows some people from Oregon where I went to middle school and up until a few days ago, college. They're definitely not supposed to share the details of the investigation, but he found out anyway.  The body in Asbahr lake wasn't found by the police. A landscaping company that owns land next to the lake found tire tracks. The owner wanted to make sure that someone wasn't dumping their garbage illegally.  They pulled up the statue with a winch, and once the mud had been cleaned off, they posted on Facebook asking whether anyone had recently had a statue or piece of art stolen. People connected the dots pretty quickly, and the police stepped in.  The outsides of the concrete casing had been chiseled and painted to reflect a slightly-larger-than-life sized version of the person inside. They sent pictures to my dad via email, and seeing it like that sent chills up my spine. It looked real... and imagining going swimming in the lake and seeing a painted version of a person standing on the bottom staring up like that... Well, I can't imagine. The thought is almost as bad as knowing that I almost ended up at the bottom of the lake as well.  The tests haven't confirmed it yet, but Trini Baker, a girl from my class at Memorial Middle School went missing a week ago.  Dad could see how upset I got, and decided to take me out to lunch at one of our favorite spots, a little Italian place that bakes their own sandwich bread and has the best espresso. Having him with me helped me feel safe. When we were back in the car on our way home, I asked him if he thought that they'd catch Mr. Rowden.  "You know what I do, right, Allie?"  "Yeah, you're a cop."  He smiled. A lot of guys he worked with didn't approve of the term. I said it as often as I could.  "Right. And I don't know if you remember, but the reason that we moved here was because I was offered a promotion to move here."  "Yeah. I remember."  "I don't usually talk about my work with you or your mom, but there's something that's been bothering me lately. One case in particular from when you were real little. I'm not saying they're related, either... Anyway, we got this call one night... Must have been about midnight, for a suicide -- a possible suicide, I mean. That's what the dispatch said. A neighbor called it in, saying that they'd heard a gunshot.  "Anyway, we get to the place, and it's this big two storey house up in the hills. You could just tell from the street that they had money.  Nice, maintained yard, two cars in the driveway and probably more in the garage. There wasn't a light on inside the house, though. The whole place was dark.  "We looked through the whole house, and didn't find anything. The place looked deserted. No food in the fridge, no clothes in the dresser or sheets on the bed. You'll see that sometimes, with suicides. People sell all their stuff. I guess they're trying to be less of a burden once they're gone, or whatever. We went from room to room, and I mean, if someone *was* living there, I don't know how they did it.  "I was the first to go into the basement. As soon as I opened the door, I could smell it. We called in the EMT's who were waiting outside. I went down to make sure that the scene was safe. There was a guy in the corner chained to the sink, and blood was everywhere. It covered half the floor. There wasn't a gun anywhere. Thing was, though, it was pretty obvious that he hadn't done it recently. He looked mummified -- well, that's not the right word for it -- decomposed, and like he was all dried out.  "It's sad. You know, it's upsetting when you come across something like that, I mean. You don't -- as a person, you don't stop feeling that way, no matter how many times you've seen it before. Somebody chained him there. Like a dog. He used to be a doctor. He had a family. But for a long time, he just sat there chained up in his basement. Long enough to want to take another way out. My partner and I pretty much got pushed off the case after forensics got there."  "I heard that that was how Mr. Rowden died, too," I said.  "Yeah. That's what I'm saying. That doctor that died? I saw him with my own eyes. He looked like he'd been dead for a long time. But people said that they'd seen him that same day at the hospital. Like he just pulled into the driveway, walked down to the basement and died. It didn't make sense.  "So then I hear about this Rowden guy now... and it doesn't match up either. I know you said you saw him at school that day... but the guy's been dead."  "I saw him. Dad, I really thought it was Mr. Rowden."  "I mean, did he act weird? Did he look different or anything?"  "No... not really. That's what's so strange about it. He was just boring, like a normal old guy. He mentioned Asbahr Lake, and opening a studio or something. I didn't think it was weird. I didn't think that anything was strange until later, after I found out..."  "Okay, hon. Sorry, you asked if I thought that they'd be able to find him. I think that if they don't find him quickly, that they may not be able to find him at all; or more precisely, that they'll be looking for the wrong person."  "What do you mean?"  "I think that this has happened before. I think it was that doctor. There are too many similarities to just be pure coincidence. And who knows if it's happened before that?"  He didn't tell me any more about it after that. Dad isn't a conspiracy theorist. He's logical. If I hadn't heard it myself, I wouldn't have believed that he believed any of it.  They still haven't found Mr. Rowden... or whoever.   *Whatever*.  I'm starting to get sleepy... I think I'll try going to bed again.  Wish me luck, nosleep.  EDIT:  My friend Mike called, and he's in trouble.  He saw Bob Rowden talking to someone in the library. Mike didn't go to Memorial, but he recognized Mr. Rowden's picture from the articles on the internet -- the ones that said in no uncertain terms that Bob Rowden is dead.  Mike is a good friend. A good *person*. He's the type of person who would put his life on the line to help someone he doesn't even know. So he did. First, he called the police, then he walked over to the old man, grabbed him by the shoulder and wrenched him away from the girl he was talking to.  He said that Rowden hissed at him, like a feline. Little streams of spit flew from the man's mouth. The old man -- if it is in fact, human -- picked up the girl and ran down the the path between buildings with enough speed so that Mike, a pretty fit 20-year-old couldn't keep up with him. After a few turns, he'd lost track.  The police didn't believe a word. Instead of helping, they almost fined him for making a bogus emergency call, but they let him off with a warning.  Mike kept looking for traces of where the killer might have taken the girl. He believed that there was more time. That's just the way that Mike is. A helper.  He found them near the covered bridge at Oak Creek, where he followed the screams to find the girl, covered up to her neck in wet cement. He'd just gone down to the edge of the creek to help her when he was tackled from behind and knocked nearly unconscious.  What he saw then confirms everything. Mr. Rowden went up to the girl, bound and encased except for her head as though he were going to kiss her. The he opened his mouth wide, almost unhinging it like a snake's, and vomited something large into the girl's mouth, down her throat and inside her. Bile and slime ran down the poor girl's face, but he held her firmly in his liver spotted hands. Mike said that whatever it was that was "transferred," was moving. "Pulsating" is the word that he used. After that, Rowden finished casing her head in the thick cement, slowly suffocating her.  The whole time, Mike was powerless, unable to get up and do anything -- what could he have done against that kind of monster, anyway? He couldn't even escape as Bob Rowden set his sights on him next, slinging him over his shoulder and carrying him to where he had parked his old yellow truck and threw him into the bed.  At a stoplight, Mike was able to get away and jump onto a city bus which took him back to campus. As soon as he could, he called the police again. He tried to avoid telling them what he'd actually seen, instead just urging them to go to the covered bridge.  The police didn't find anything there. They showed up at his apartment a half hour later and arrested him under some trumped up bullshit charge. They can't hold him for long... but Mr. Rowden now knows who he is. He should be running.  I'm driving straight through the night, it's 20 hours. I should be back in Oregon tomorrow. I only hope that I can get there in time.   /r/thetruthishere is supposed to have true stuff as well.   Right? Gosh.  Sorry I annoyed you with my question posed in the appropriate subreddit. "No," might have sufficed.   How did you get downvoted? You basically said reading more will teach you about how to write.   I vote for the second one as well.   Confined to a bed for the majority of the day and unable to even make it to the bathroom before I piss myself, theres not much left in this life worth holding onto.  This line doesn't quite fit. If he's really so far gone, it just doesn't make sense that he'd try to write out this story for reddit. It makes me want to have it framed as a dictation or a found journal or something else.  Wish I had more for you! Good luck with your story.   Alan Goodtime is behind it!   Completely ignore the fact that she plays basketball as her primary sport. And that DoSomething.org is about inspiring kids to get off their asses, not equivalent to a full ride scholarship to play a football. She probably sent in a video that DoSomething can use in their commercials.   Story?! This is a man's life on the line!   I saw him. It was exact.   I attended Memorial for two years before my family and I moved to Colorado in 2006. I moved back into the area to attend the state college that's a few miles down the road. Maybe it's not as strange as I thought, but I was surprised at how many people I still recognized despite the long gap of time.  Mr. Rowden was the art teacher when I went to school there. I never took an art class, and I couldn't tell you much about him except that he was the oldest teacher I'd seen at the time. His back was hunched over, and he wore those old-people shoes with the velcro straps. In the bustling halls, I sometimes worried that the kids would knock him over. He seemed frail like that.  I never talked to any of my old classmates, and keep in mind, I hadn't so much as thought about Mr. Rowden in seven years. And then he showed up to my Intro to Psychology lecture this term.  Psychology is one of those Gen. Ed. classes that most students have to take at one time or another. Consequently, it's taught in one of the largest lecture halls on campus, complete with a stage and an upper level of seats. I showed up late and snuck up to the balcony hoping to avoid notice. I apparently wasn't the only one with the same idea because most of the seats were full. In fact, I almost left, figuring that I could read the syllabus myself later. Then I saw Mr. Rowden patting the empty seat behind him all the way in the back. He was still wearing the same off-white button up shirt, worn thin enough to see through, and brown flowing slacks. His hair was mostly gone, and its place on his scalp had been taken replaced with brown spots. His smile was tainted by a tooth that had died and turned brown. It was like something out of a dream.  I sat next to him, though. And despite the oddity of him being there in the first place (he said that he was auditing classes, not attending them as a student), the rest of the lecture went pretty normally. Except that he would not shut up. He kept talking about how he was retired now, and so glad to be out of the teaching game. He was building an art studio "out on Asbar Lake" which I had never heard of. There are hundreds of lakes in the area, most aren't even named, or have more than one depending on who you ask. He talked about how the old art supply store had gone out of business when a chain had come in. Between the ramblings of a lonely old man and the "Hi, my name is" first day of class spiel, I was exploring new depths of boredom. Thankfully it only lasted an hour and a half. I didn't see Mr. Rowden in my lectures anymore, though I looked for him just so I could try to avoid sitting by him again.   I met up with some friends that that weekend and mentioned that I'd seen my old art teacher. Mike, who's lived here his whole life instantly thought that it was strange. He said that he'd heard of a teacher named Rowden getting arrested a few years ago. It was big news at the time, involving a kidnapping and a police investigation. His parents even got so worried about it that they'd tried to keep him home at night. I hadn't heard anything about this from Colorado, and at first I thought that he must have been mistaken. My other friends teased me for getting hit on by the creepy teacher, and thought that it was pretty funny. I felt weird about it. I started to wonder how he even recognized me now. In 7th grade, I'd been a chubby girl with glasses, and I hadn't even been in his class.  Google didn't turn up anything about Mr. Rowden or Asbar Lake. I told myself that it was probably nothing, just Mike mixing up some rumors he'd heard from his parents.  I was walking back to my car from the library at about 9:00 at night when an old brown pickup drove up beside me. Just as I looked up to see what they wanted a bulb flashed and blinded me, then the truck sped down the street and out of sight.  I was nervous before, but now I was scared. I called Mike, just so that someone would know where I was. He was really reassuring, and told me that it was probably just some asshole college kid, and that I shouldn't be worried about something that happened years ago in the next town. By the time I reached my car I was feeling better. I said goodbye to Mike and drove to the gas station, then to my apartment.  The same car followed me both times. I could tell because they were missing a headlight. They even followed me in a circle around the block. I should have called the cops then, but Mike's number was still up on my speed dial. He probably couldn't understand a word I said, because the truck following me rammed into my bumper and I started shouting. I floored it, and then Mike picked up. I told him I was crossing the bridge out of town and that someone was chasing me.  That's the last thing I remember before waking up in an ambulance. My parents came. Someone ran into the back of my car while I was on the bridge. My car fishtailed and went through the railing, dropped thirty five feet and sunk into the muddy bank of the river. Mike called 911 and told them where to find me. It didn't take them long to get there, but they found me out of the car, laying on my back. Footprints led to and from the vehicle, but no one else was around. They still haven't found the truck that followed me and almost killed me.  Mike came and visited me in the hospital. He said that was sorry, and that he should have stayed on the phone with me. Then, he said that there was something that he needed to show me.  Mr. Rowden died in 2011. His body was found chained and gagged in the basement art studio of his home months after his death. No one had reported him missing or dead... because he hadn't stopped teaching. Six students of Memorial Middle School disappeared that same year, and it was only when they went to interview the art teacher at his house that they found what had really happened to him.  Someone had been dressing up as Mr. Rowden and impersonating him. That was all that they knew until almost a year later, when a summer drought dried up a small, unnamed lake, revealing six cement figurines posed in various ways. Inside the suspicious cement figures were the bodies of the missing students.  I saw him. Bob Rowden is back. It's not a person dressed in a disguise, but neither is it the real Bob Rowden. It's something else. Don't listen to it.  UPDATE: They found a body in Asbahr Lake. A cement statue that looks like it's been painted. I'm going to my parents' house in Colorado.  [Part II](http://redd.it/2ssfox)   I hope the next pair of glasses didn't have any side effects...   I'm not sure how you think that way as a writer, or get confident enough to try and write that story. This is why /u/deadnspread is so good. His writing is fearless. He even invented a villain, and made you understand them, too. Crazy.   It kind of starts from the end, then goes back and breaks your heart. Damn.   Just reading that made you hungry?   Careful, OP. I know you're looking for other kids who went to school there, but the last time anyone started asking questions about Warwood, it wasn't a student that responded.    This happened to me the other day! There I was, reading along, and then   You're a big guy.   Has the involvement of the masked man, Bane, been ruled out?   [365 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2r5p41/365_days/)  The night after I arrived in the city, there was a sound like the earth tearing in half. To the east, it looked like a volcano had erupted in the middle of downtown. Dirt, rocks, debris and ash fell in the streets while I took shelter in a nearby office building. The image of furious red and yellow fire was burnt into my eyes. The sound didn't stop, either. A terrible shrieking continued long after the explosion.  In a few hours, the ash had settled. It looked soft in the dim light, like the black streets had grown fur. The unique muffled quiet of freshly fallen snow set a hush over everything. With a damp towel wrapped over my mouth and nose, I made my way closer to the impact zone.  Still a few blocks from the destruction, I thought I'd seen shadowy figures moving in and out of the buildings, and darting into alleyways, always staying just out of view. At last, I came upon the crater, but it wasn't like I'd expected. Instead of a jagged edge and broken ground, the edge looked to have been precisely cut. I even felt it with my hand, and the edge of the asphalt was smooth as glass. The crater itself was approximately 100 feet across, and the side furthest away from me was still burning. That side looked like the ground had been torn or blown apart. In the center, at the bottom of the egg-shaped hole was a machine. I didn't have time to get a good look at it.  From behind me, I heard a scuffling. Bugs. A half dozen of them, closing in around me with lightning speed. I didn't stand a chance, but along with them stepped a man. With a word from him, the bugs stopped. Completely motionless. Normally, when you see a bug, their antennae moves, their mandibles absently open and close, the wiry hair along their exoshells wave up and down. These bugs did not.  The man was wearing suit that looked like it was made of liquid metal. I recognized it immediately from the news holograms, it was the type of clothing that the colonists wore on the moon.  He was supposed to explain everything once we got to the moon -- that was what that machine was for in the center of the crater, a transporter. Something had gone wrong when he'd come here because there usually wasn't any type of fire or explosion. Maybe it was damaged or... well, I don't know.  I couldn't have gone to the moon.  For about a minute, the transporter whirred and the energy built. It felt like a long time, just waiting, holding onto the metallic handles. Then everything outside the sphere shifted, the colors ran like a fresh painting sprayed with a water hose. There was a sensation of movement, without inertia, as if travelling in every direction at once. I'd never felt so sick.  When the horrible spinning finally stopped, I found myself in a wide open field full of dry, dead grass, which I promptly vomited onto. As the machine wound down, more of my surroundings were revealed a little at a time. On the edge of the horizon was a collection of ramshackle buildings. When the machine finally fell silent, I went to find out where I was.  The people here don't speak English, or any of the other languages programmed into my watch's translator. Their society exists without technology at all for the most part. These factors, when considered together lead me to believe that I may not be on Earth any longer. I've gotten along with them so far, but even after 4 days, I haven't been able to communicate with them, or to work the machine to get myself out of here.  Something tried to sneak into the village late last night, and after a commotion, I walked out to find a carcass lopped into several pieces by a giant of a man holding a wicked-looking battle axe. A bug.  They're here as well., and judging by their reaction, they have been for quite some time.   *I* am the one who coughs.   "... and it runs on three AAA batteries."

[365 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2r5p41/365_days/) [364 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2rahc6/364_days/)  The cities were drained of people when the extraterrestrials enslaved us. Being crammed in so tightly inevitably creates redundancies. Cities are inefficient. Instead, an optimal size was determined, and the population was then spread into these communities, leaving the once-thriving metropolises behind, nothing but empty, colorless husks.  I made it. Cold, hungry and tired, I stepped over the police tape and navigated the cement barricades across the road. Banners reading "Happy Holidays!" were still draped along some of the buildings. Things had changed so fast.  A year later, I was back home. It felt a little like opening the door expecting to see your wife there, when really they've gone to the store, or had to stay late at work. There's no welcome. The air is still and empty of life.  Regrettably, that was the extent of my plane: to escape -- at least to try -- I honestly never thought that I'd make it this far. Once inside the empty city, my goals accomplished, it struck me as very wrong to just wait to be found. Just waiting to die.  My stomach grumbled. I needed food. I started going toward the supermarket on Kings, but decided that the 7-Eleven on Noble would be better, since it accepted energy tips. I got to the 7-Eleven and inserted my watch in the receptacle. The lights in the front of the store flickered to life. A Muzak track even started playing from the place it had left off. I gave three energy tips, enough to last a few minutes while I did my shopping.  Power management had changed a lot in my lifetime. Environmentally conscious consumers had begged for ways to reduce our reliance on pollutant power plants while developers pushed back against space hungry wind and solar options. Wave power, using the back and forth movement of the ocean progressed the most. The components required were eventually shrunk to the point that a person could wear a band around their ankle or wrist and through the course of their normal day they'd generate enough power to power the lights in their home, or run their hologram projectors. A boom in health movements coincided and gadget manufacturers, especially watchmakers like myself, put the pieces together. You plug your watch into the treadmill for your morning run or purchase a pair of power-generating Nikes, or even moving the watch itself and you become the battery for your own life.  But it was all a novelty until battery technology opened the door to change. Previously unused materials enabled charged batteries to "stack" like building blocks. A battery would reach its traditional capacity, then those charged chemicals would realign, separating themselves into a very small threads and leaving the rest of the battery available to charge again at 99.99% of its original capacity. The process could be repeated thousands of times within a single battery, and so the concept of having a full battery was made obsolete. How you spent your power was made akin to how you spent your money. Your watch became your wallet. And so some businesses decided to get in on it. They installed "energy tip" receptacles. The reasoning being that if you wanted lights while you shopped, that you should literally have to be responsible to do the legwork to turn them on. If no one patronized a store, then the power would run out. The public generated their energy for free, and also generated it for the places that they liked to go things they wanted to do.  Power plants and city grids didn't cease to exist, but they were in the process of being phased out. Hence why the 7-Eleven on Noble could be powered by a simple swipe of my watch.  The sensation of picking whatever I wanted off the shelves was so familiar, and yet alien at the same time. This was the first time in over a year that I'd been allowed to pick whatever I wanted -- even if it was just the stuff containing industrial-strength preservatives. Surprisingly, hot dogs still turned in the rollers, looking just a shade paler and older than if the store had never closed.  I opened a bag of Twinkies, and then one of cookies. After eating nothing but bland, nutritionally balanced mush for a year, my taste buds lit up like the Fourth of July. Salty chips, sweet candy and frothy carbonated soda brought me to flavor ecstasy.   In my revelry, I lost track of time and my surroundings and the power ran out. The store was plunged into darkness. The Slurpee machines stopped turning, the Muzak stopped playing and every light in the place went out. Every light but one. From the hallway that led through a pair of double doors to the stockroom, a green light was pulsing, casting a shadow onto the ceiling. A head, shoulders -- *a man*, standing. Watching.  I knelt down behind the shelves and the bag of Cheetos in my hand crinkled loudly. Whoever it was had to know that I was there.  A sliding, dragging sound came from the entrance to the stockroom, inching closer across the dusty tiles.  *A man. A man? A drifter? Another runaway? Was he looking for me? Did he live here?*  The pulsing green light illuminated him against the ceiling, just a few feet away from me now. I cursed myself for being so careless, for not planning my escape, for not finding a weapon.  The dragging sound was rounding the end of the shelf. Green light shined in my eyes. I sprung from my crouch, and ran toward them, slamming into the stranger's broad, armored chest and knocking them backward into the glass doors and into the section of rotten frozen food. The smell was horrendous.  I wailed away with my fists, but every blow struck an armored surface -- a helmet, a chestplate, even its arms were covered in thick metal. They weren't fighting back.  *Deee-e-e-eeeeeeear sssiiiii-iii-i-i-iiirr.*  I stood back and wiped splattered curdled ice cream from my eyes. Wheels spun and whirled, sticking through the glass display case where the attacker's legs should have been. Under rank hot pockets and frozen pizza boxes, the voice came again.  "Deeear sir or madam. Tha-ank you for removing yourself. It seems that I've suffered some damage due to this accident, and my sensors are not working. Cou-u-ld you please help me up, and tell me whether I'm in a safe place to run my diagnostics?"  A fucking robot. A marketing gimmick by city's department of tourism, they'd designed dozens of the droids to wander the city's downtown, giving directions and advertising various businesses, places to shop or ongoing events for the day. They were shaped like a man, a holographic face projected above a pair of shoulders and torso painted to look like a butler's suit.  Unbelieveable.  The broken butler did help me find a safe place to stay during the day. He says that the last interaction that he's had with people or the bugs was 363 days ago, so I figure that for the time being I'm still alone. I wonder how long it will be before they come here looking for me?

 Yeah she was a sex siren who screamed like one   Are there any plans confirmed for the area front facing the taxis  The bit of land in front between the car park and the fountain path  Heard there was plans for this as well as the old Nelson Mandela site  They need to have a Sheffield store / gift shops and a few restaurants   So many epic lines in this scenes, never rub another man's rhubarb      Yeah agree, it seemed very rushed and the panel all seemed on edge  Sometimes these organisers should give set times for these things  Like at least 50 minutes per show / panel to have 20 minutes talk then the rest questions   Well, Mulder and Scully finally got together in the second film so will that play differently now we have six new episodes to view soon?  One of the things that drived the series was the sexual tension / chemistry between them, the will it or won't it happen every week, it's what kept us coming back for more  So with this no longer an issue, will there still be a spark between them that will produce great scenes, maybe they could add more humour to compensate like a lover's tiff kind of banter between them, that would be entertaining   Yeah me too but it's an odd character to get behind anyway, think early in the season she should have had interests to follow, I heard she was an attorney or something  It would be great if she pursued some job like that and stirs things up in GCPD for Gordon then at night the claws come out and she has an alternate life   Going on the recent Comic Con panel, I get the impression that she feels like a black sheep on there, not getting any notice and given garbage material to work with  Bruno Heller and the writers not giving her any real respect and other actors all getting the star treatment, I feel really bad for the actress  She can obviously act and am sure given enough scenes she would shine, she is a lot more interesting than Morena Baccarin in a non ego kind of way, like more open and willing to speak to people  She should be given more meat to chew on, more things to grasp, it seems the writers are embarrassed how they have written her into a corner and seemed like they made a mistake with her at the beginning and are wishing the character away so are choosing an easy way out by making her psychotic   Come on Riddler, put more effort in FFS   Was that Jerome at the end, WTF ???

Thing is, they are so expensive!    Could you recommend a brand of carbless sweetener?    What do you use instead?    It's found in a wide variety of powdered artificial sweeteners, from stevia to splenda. It's a starch and the ratio in stevia, splenda, is 1:1 so a 550 serving [bag of stevia](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91hm25DmYML._SL1500_.jpg) will have 550g of carbs from maltodextrin.   I know 1g carb per 1 tablespoon isn't a bad amount of carbs but I was startled when a friend of mine did the research.   Anyhow, what do you think?

You can adjust the position of the nozzle to get the perfect shot at your keester.   Also, I'd recommend buying a foot stool. If you put your feet on it while pooping, your body will form the natural position for pooping. This gets the poop out easier and is easier on your colon. It's way more comfortable too.    There are some on Amazon that you can get for under $30. Don't pay more than $30.    I'd like to pursue comedy too. I can make people laugh pretty easily.

I cannot understand why Logic chose to audio morph these endings.   I appreciate learning about different anecdotes about him and the creation of the album but I just cannot understand why he made them all choppy and weird.

My AP psych teacher was a realtor before se became a psych teacher which means she couldn't do anything with her degree before then    Sounds a lot like what my former AP Bio teacher described. She said it was more profitable for her to be a teacher.    I think Rousseau an Voltaire and the like covered that area fairly well.    Honestly, advertising seems like an awesome job to me after watching Mad Men   Considering how expensive a round of golf is, it's easy to understand how they could make some money.    The only reason I would want to be an archeologist is because I read "Timeline" by Michael Crichton.    It does seem a bit specific for a single degree. It would be like a major that focused on a single book rather than literature as a whole.    I think I'm going to try doing a dual major of supply chain management and finance, hopefully there would be some flexibility in the job market with those degrees.

 Yeah but now it's basketball season, and then it will be baseball season, and then there's constantly soccer... And hockey fits in there somewhere. And then every 2 years there's either summer or winter Olympics. What I'm saying is, there really isn't any peace for those of us who have no interest in sports   My wife doesn't wear her ring because her fingers got bigger and neither of us really want to pay to resize it. That's ~$300 that could go towards feeding our son   My wife and I would play two headed giant but both of us on separate teams. It's like being a swinger without having to have someone else's dick all up in there    I used to be subscribed there but it isn't as fun when it's just a bunch of people posting mildly uninteresting photos of their relatives and expecting someone to photos hop it into something hilarious. It's far more funny when stuff like this happens organically without any provocation    What are his best written sketches?    That psychologist sounds like he's full of shit. My wife was diagnosed by a psychiatrist and usually for the first session he schedules a 75 minute questionnaire so he can figure out the first steps of treatment for whatever he may think you might be. They ended up with a 3 hour long session because he wanted to know everything that was going on and felt very confident on bipolar 1 by the end of it.    It should also be noted how ridiculously expensive it is. Not for those with no or poor insurance coverage. If I didn't have insurance, a 30 day supply would have been $1600   Yeah we're setting up our bedroom to be a private space nobody is allowed to be in since it's pretty big. We don't have any private space in the common area because her grandmother comes up from her basement area anytime someone is in the common area. Currently looking for a TV and wall mount for our bedroom for us to watch movies and play video games and spend time together alone    I love you guys and that you're being as open as you are. There's only one thing that bothered me and I'm sure a lot of other people about jc2 that I'd like for you to avoid with jc3: retailer-specific pre-order perks. I don't mind pre-ordering games but I don't like that I have to choose which one to do it in order to get some specific item, especially if not all those stores are available to me   Her very first visit with her therapist they determined she was codependent. She got a book called codependent no more and has been working on it and for a while it got a lot better but then there were life situations that made it rear its ugly head again. Basically we're living in the same place as her grandmother, who was the one that raised her, and is incredibly codependent in addition to a myriad of mental health problems that she refuses to get help for because she says "she's beyond help"  but she also just views mental problems as beneath her.   Anyway, my brother in law lost his job and moved back into state and we let him move in with us until he gets a job and his own place but for now it's nice having him around because he helps around the house and occasionally watches our 7 month old son. However, the problem is it multiplied her grandmother's codependency and the wife has been in a prolonged mixed state/episode (we've discovered hers last for a really long time, looking back after the diagnosis and subsequent psychiatric visits) so she's leeching the codependency. Then after that, my other brother in law who is only 17 suddenly flew up here because he wanted to connect with his biological dad who he never really knew and again, further intensified the grandmother's codependency.   We're doing our best to work on the codependency and unfortunately we're not really in a place to permanently fix the problem    Thanks I didn't know about that subreddit    My post was just as choppy. Just weird stream of consciousness. Thanks for the candid advice, I really appreciate it. Since you are in a relationship, have you done any couples therapy? We haven't been at it long, but it has been really awesome so far, especially with building a toolset on how to support each other. We're doing imago therapy which is more than just going to a therapist and just talking to the therapist about how we feel. The therapist is there to just give ideas and prompt conversation with the two of us and help us along. It sounds like you guys have it together but it's something I think can be helpful to a lot of couples even without problems    I started reading a book called "Loving someone with bipolar disorder".   I don't know what I'm doing like at all. She's been going to a therapist for months, and we both go to the same one for couple's therapy. She's a great therapist and I'm glad we found her. It's actually a really funny story how my wife found her. She had made a therapist appointment and actually ended up at the wrong place in the same building complex. By some weird stroke of fate, the therapist had someone with the same first name cancel an appointment at the same time.   Last month she recommended a psychiatrist to her and he got her into a question session to find more out about her and diagnosed her with bipolar, and put her on a slow titration of lamictol, which she had taken in the past and worked well for her.   He also gave her something for her anxiety which didn't seem to work. Made her irritable for half the day because she had to take it before bed to help her sleep.  Now he put her on something newer, I guess called latuda and she only just got that yesterday. I can't believe how expensive that shit is. A 30 day supply was $1600,and my insurance required doctor authorization before they'd pay for it. Thank God they did because that helped a LOT.   I'm just talking and rambling, sorry. Those of you in relationships, what do you want/need from your SO, and for those of you who aren't what would you want?   Wife stopped smoking since being diagnosed with bipolar and found it has been causing rapid cycling, even when she used hard-core put you on your ass asleep stuff. She'd be real upset the day after. Any other random stuff would bring manic episodes    Do baddies follow you through a wormhole?    I'm finding that farming does nothing but clutter my chests and ice boxes. It's so random what you get and doesn't seem worth it for now few and far between dragon fruits are. I'm fine with having a bunch of berry bushes to use as filler for my meatballs and that way I only ever need a few food ingredients.    What's a good way to restore sanity? I made a bunch of nets to catch butterflies and plant flowers but I just hit my second winter and don't feel like I have enough to last the winter. I spent a lot of time just standing near my fire to get sanity    I know about kiting and all that but I can't seem to do that when I have 5 hounds chasing me I don't seem to fare so well. The last two times I had hounds they happened at night so I didn't have anywhere I could really go and ended up running around my camp fire until dawn so I could run towards the pig houses which are also next to spider nests in order for them to have them fight each other. The last attack I barely survived by the skin of my neck and was going insane by the end of it.   I was able to make 5 tooth traps after the last attack but I fear that won't be enough. There's a beefalo herd through a wormhole right by my base but I don't know if I want to take a sanity hit right before or during a hound attack. What I'm most worried about though is night attacks   I'm not sure but I've never had to kill more than 4-5 each day and by the time I kill more my naughtiness is reset again   I disagree on rabbit farming. My home is next to a bunch of rabbit holes and granted I'm only 40 or so days in, I've survived almost exclusively on meatballs made from rabbits and whatever filler I find and an occasional meat stew when I happen  to have actual meat. I have 30+ rabbits at any given time in my chests and can go out and collect about 2 days worth of food any time I go to the traps   ITT: tons of movies I've  never  seen    The article didn't really seem to explain very well, but what it looks like is Samsung is inserting ads into apps ran on the smart TV itself. If you are using an external device to watch something you should be fine.    How were you watching it? Was it through an app installed on the TV itself or was the hard drive connected to a computer that was connected via HDMI?    When I was a kid my mom made lunches for me every day except maybe once a week she would let me have a hot lunch at school for something I really liked on the menu or a special occasion. Back then I wished I could eat the school lunches more but looking back I'm glad she did it that way and I'll continue that with my family    Don't buy this game, it will consume your free time    The console bit wasn't directed at you personal, I'm honestly just wondering because it seems lame that they wouldn't be able to see their status.   I can see where smarter crock pot is good to use because honestly, I'm either going to look at the wiki or use the crockpot simulator app on my phone for recipes.   What does the non deployable mod do?    I think the minimap is great, and actually could could make things slightly more difficult while seeming to make it easier. Think about it. You're running around and then press the map button. The game is paused while you stare at the map and see where you need to go. But with the minimap, you glance up at that but don't pause the game. It's almost an unnoticeable amount of time but time still passes where it wouldn't have looking at the regular map.    As I said below, I play from the couch and use a controller so I can't over over my health or hunger or whatever. How has this been dealt with on the ps4 version? Do console players just get to miss out on ever seeing actual numbers?    I'd love this functionality. Having to craft a farm and then use the farm in another recipe to make an advanced farm but if you placed the farm already you should be able to add the required materials to the placed farm to upgrade it.    Don't forget additional structures. Made by the same guy and balanced just as well. Doesn't add anything ridiculous that doesn't seem like it wouldn't belong in the game.    I use always on status because I use a controller and thus cannot hover over anything with my mouse.   In addition to that, I have a mod called additional structures. It adds some bigger and metal chests that I feel fit the balance of the game well. I also have craft able tunnels which I have yet to use.   I would say anything that is cheating would be stuff that increases your stack sizes, or something that adds a backpack slot. I know that I should be able to wear a damn backpack with a coat but that's not how the game was designed/balanced.    Are there any plans to progress this game beyond small scenarios? Like being open world and actually creating your own castle and raiding other people's castles? The game is in what, alpha? And it's already so beautiful. It would be a shame to be limited to small scenarios    Alternatively there's a chrome extension    I personally like meatballs. Honey nuggets are good too if you have bee boxes. I just finished my first winter and I basically ate nothing but meatballs using rabbits save for the couple times I got some monster meat and killed a beefalo or two for fur, then I did meaty stew. I never went below 30 rabbits in my chests at any given time   Yeah I don't have the expansion so I just have the two seasons. I didn't know that until halfway through my winter in my current game. I was running around in a panic trying to figure out what I need to do and gather so I can be ready for the hot summer because of all the things I saw on the wiki and what I read here.    Do you have the expansion? There is apparently one boss each season in the expansion but just the deerclops in the original. I actually had the deerclops appear at my base at the end of winter. My screen was shaking and all I saw were it's legs at the top of my screen and I ran for my fucking life and forgot the food I desperately needed from my crockpot. Luckily I ran to where I had rabbit traps and ate some of them   I'm on my second attempt at winter right now, and I have an awesome placement minus not having bees nearby. Right near a wormhole that leads directly to beefalo, which is worth the sanity penalty, especially when I get my butterfly farm in order this next summer (I don't have the expansion). There are several pigs and sliders not too far away, I'm near a big tallbird nest if I want that, and below me is a plain with plenty of rabbit holes that ha e been my source of food pretty much this whole game. Right now I have about 40 or so unmurdered rabbits and at any given time I can go out to my traps and collect about 2 days worth of rabbit for meatballs.   I cant wait for winter to be over though, about halfway through I unwittingly activated a winter trap so I get an extra long one   My wife does that basically. She keeps badgering me to build drying racks. I suppose they're great for preserving meat and saving space on not needing as many chests, but I've been living with a single crock pot all winter so far without problems    Why hello there, me   How does this ha e anything to do with technology?    Thanks for actually showing me something. Looks like the ones near me are staying open for now    I tried searching Google but I found a bunch of click bait.    There a list that isn't so shitty? Maybe one that lists by state?    Some people use a controller so we're unable to mouse over to confirm    Is this a thing? My son is 7 months and for the second time in around a week just before he fell completely to sleep he started screaming bloody murder but wasn't really awake and crying. Usually despite being hard to actually put to bed in the first place, he sleeps pretty well. It seems that every approach to calm him down including letting him try to self sooth just sends him further into the frenzy   Anyone else experience this and have insight as to what I can do?   Are you at home where your app can detect your chromecast?    Anyone else find it disgusting that the only two choices with 128gb of storage are iPhones?    He should just take questions about Rampart   Umad brah   Now if only they would improve the mic   Damn bro...    For me it wasn't just when I started working a job with a Monday to Friday work schedule with paid holidays off, it was when the same thing started happening to my friends      How long ago was this? A few years ago I remember seeing people standing outside various walgreens in town with protest signs   Why would he annotate a print of his own books?    So take off their helmets and add long hair?    You probably got plenty of money's worth with the game on PC, what would be their incentive to give the mobile version of the game to you for free? Why would they want to develop a mobile version if they didn't intend on making money from it?    I realize that I can use the keys to keep it shut but I open and close this thing upwards of 15 times a day,ibxant be fumbling with a key each time          Even worse are gut farts. When your intestines make uncontrollable noises that sound like farts. I always seemed to get those when I'd be in the completely silent computer lab   When I worked at olive garden, we had what seemed like 4 menus going at the same time. One was just that, a menu with little to no description, just pictures. And the items on that menu always sold the most. I always called it the dumb people menu because they can just point at the picture.    Steam doesn't link with Google play or the app store so it's not likely that getting the game for free if you purchased a steam version will ever happen.    Well it's highly situational. If I did a job where I was able to spend 5 or more hours per day listening to podcasts while I work then I would be all for that. I'm a delivery driver who has to merchandise my own product, and luckily my route takes me anywhere from a half hour to an hour and 15 minutes out of town so I do still get a bunch of time to listen to stuff, but it only amounts to about 10 hours per week. I like to keep a variety of podcasts in my Playlist but I want it to match the approximate time I am able to listen, that way I don't get behind on them. I only ever really listen to them while driving for work and don't go out of my way to listen to podcasts at home because my computer time is few and far between anyway at home that I try to spend time productively when I do have it.   I've considered headphones but cables always seem to get in the way doing this kind of work   I hope to god if they do that it doesn't end up as another 3-4 hour podcast. I like the podcast and all but one podcast is already around a third of the time I have each week to listen to podcasts   I subscribe to /r/games and obviously this sub. I directly subscribe to specific game subreddits that I'm interested in. Other than that, I listen to the GiantBomb Podcast while driving. I drive about 10 hours per week for work and luckily my work Truck has an Aux port for the stereo so I've taken to listen to a bunch of podcasts. It's nice to not have to take the time outside of work to catch up on the rest of the world by listening to podcasts, otherwise I'd be stuck listening to all the same songs the radio let's me listen to   We started noticing a flat spot on his head around 2 months or so and we've tried to keep him off his back as much as possible but early on he hated tummy time and it was hard to keep him off his back short of holding him all day long until it was bed time.   We got to a point where he could stand tummy time and we keep him sitting up since he can do that on his own now. He isn't crawling yet but he rolls from his tummy to his back all the time so there's still lots of spending time to make sure he's not on his back but there's still the 10 hours of sleep each night he still spends on his back and I feel that it had countered all of our attempts at helping the flat spot.   Is there anything that can really be done at this point? I keep reading that it should have rounded out by 6 months and that helmets don't really help at all. The wife is a little upset about it because she mentioned it to the doctor a couple months ago and he said it wouldn't be anything to worry about but at the most recent visit he brought up the flat spot and mentioned wanting to look at it again in a month   4 seconds to respond, not bad  This seems like the appropriate gif to me, does OP have an alternative I'm missing?

I didn't make them though] ( http://www.imgur.com/sS4J85Y.jpeg)    Most likely you'll end up in Mullan wing if you go to Johnstone. Pryor and Colter are 21+. The rooms are decent sized and you get the benefit of not having to go outside when you want to eat. If I remember right, they're separating North and South hedges from connecting to their dining hall directly.   Other plus sides:  * That end if campus is a little quieter if you like that.   * pickle barrel is across the street   * Joes Parkway is across the street  Downsides:  * you have to walk up that long hill for class every day  * abysmal parking    You don't need a cat tower. Yeah they're nice but you can build your own if you have the tools or materials. Alternatively you can get boxes, attach them together, find scraps of carpet, even ask a carpet store if there are garbage pieces you could have, and attach that to the sides of a box and you have your very own cat castle    This is the most logical answer. Bozeman has always been full of pretty people. It's like a whole different world when I drive into town from Billings    Because everyone seems to want flashy inefficient interfaces riddles with crappy gestures  And the dev may not be really active in the community but the app is always updated and bugs are fixed just as quickly as any of the other popular apps   I wouldn't even call it lack of design. It's very utilitarian. It's designed around ease of use without flashy bells and whistles. It does the job it needs to do and it doesn't look bad in the process   I tried to rush through Dragon Age Origins because i bought it well after it came out and mass effect 2 was coming out soon. I knew I'd lose interest after ME2 and that's exactly what happened. Ended up not finishing it because I forgot what I was doing in the game    I worked at a grocery store that had an LPO. He was a cool dude but always thought it was funny seeing him walk around with a cart of various things for 8 hours a day   Or they're pissed because there's sidework that needs to be done and their stupid boss is making them follow this guy around who won't leave   What I said was only the Cliffs notes version. It's actually a little more complex. The final stream is rendered at 24fps. Main objects are animated anywhere from 8-12 fps and secondary objects 6-8 fps   Animes usually run around 12 frames per second. In animation studios, artists create key frames every x amount of frames and then basically interns draw up everything in between. The person that did this essentially created all the key frames. What you're asking is that the person draw over 720 images for about 2 minutes of video to make it smooth   I started binge watching but then life got in the way   Look, buddy, it's not the seahawks fault they they didn't show up to their own game    You may be onto something here   And then raising prices while limiting promotions and wondering why the sales staff are incompetent because these are great prices and there's no way that higher prices will cause sales to drop, right?    Maybe businesses should be liable, but fellow employees should not be punished as well. When I worked in a restaurant, we had about 150 employees. Are you suggesting that 150 people should take home only 3/4 of their normal monthly income as a result of the actions of one or two people?    I have several thoughts/points:  * Kramer should be charged with negligent homicide. Even if she didn't know he was in the bed of the truck when she drove, it was still her direct actions that caused his death.   * serving alcohol after 2 is a bad idea, even if it is a stupid law  * the laws concerning serving intoxicated people really don't make sense and as far as I'm concerned, takes away the responsibility of the person consuming the alcohol and places it directly on grocery stores, convenience stores, bars, and their respective employees. Having personally worked a job where I dealt with drunk people, the best way to cause a scene that would have never happened is to say no. Bartenders are not babysitters, they should only have to kick people out or cut them off if someone is causing problems. About 6 or so months ago an employee of the downtown Holiday gas ststion refused to sell alcohol to someone who came into the store. He left, but stayed around to jump the employee as she was walking to her car after her shift and hospitalized her. Money being spent to enforce these laws should be put to transportation programs that help intoxicated people get home from the bars.    * one person screws up and the entire staff of three different bars/restaurants are out of work for three days. Most servers and cooks already don't make much and live paycheck to paycheck and now one paycheck this month will be halved. I'm imagining several employees struggling to make rent for next month.   Taken from a post I made on facebook    Coke is more expensive than pepsi pretty much everywhere. Which sucks when you work for Coke in a pepsi dominate market. It's the end of the world every time the prices go up   Do you work for corporate or for one of the distributors? I've been working for a distributor for almost a year now and haven't done any such thing yet   I still feel like his videos are different nowadays. I started watching him right when he got around a million subscribers and I loved his content and everything felt genuine. Lately though, I can't watch any of his videos as they almost feel forced. I'm sure he's still having fun but it seems like his videos have all devolved into forced random obscenities   My wife uses seras song as her phone ring tone, that song is gonna be stuck in my head for an eternity    Depression, bipolar, anxiety, or any other mental illness    Chef came out and gave fifty lashings to every single person with a steam kettle whisk    Now all we need is the relevant key and peele    Well for home cooking you need to draw the line somewhere when you're trying to create a food that is normally from a spit   That is just straight up impressive. This is obviously an old video so I wonder if there have been improvements made to the design or if he just took it out for a day and now it has been sitting in a garage for ten years   I graduated in 2008 and we didn't even have basic programming unless you did an independent study   Game development class?

Now pack the entire area with as much scenery as possible to get the highest excitement   Come to Montana, we've got plenty of those around   I was the sauce and soup guy, I frequently had nightmares about not having the ingredients I needed to get through the day because it happened often enough and the response from management was always shitty: I felt like I was bothering them with my shitty problem and most of the time they were apathetic about resolving it quickly. It would put me behind on my prep, and Lo and behold the first customer that walks in the door when we open wants a dish that requires the sauce I don't have and then the line is freaking out and then my managers freak out even though I told them I can't make it. One time we ran out of heavy cream and I couldn't make fucking Alfredo and I didn't even get the cream until a half hour after we opened    Do you know how to use tags and Playlists to make customers home lists for shows? I recommend looking that stuff up. I tagged all the kid friendly stuff as cartoons and tagged the anime separately,  then I made custom menu buttons that lead to those tagged shows. Then I made a smart Playlist that has all the TV shows excluding the shows that have the cartoon or anime tags, that way my TV shows menu has everything but cartoons and anime.   You could do this same thing for your kids profiles so then they only have access to what Playlists you set up   I'm on gotham and have profiles...    Yeah. Nowadays I shy away from anything that doesn't have amazing payments or Google wallet integration out of sheer laziness.

I kinda got used to/liked the harsher blue light   If any of you have seen my posts before, my original M8 has a cracked camera lens so I did the advanced exchange program. My first replacement (left) was distinctly not as bright and had a yellow hue so I called customer service and they sent another one (right) which is a little closer to my original. I don't want to do the song and dance of having to send in phone after phone after phone until I get one that looks "right" to me so I'm accepting the second replacement. I suppose after a day of use I won't even notice when I don't have a control to compare it against.  At one point I had all three phones so I had to take this picture because really, how often does a guy get to temporarily possess three HTC One M8's?. To compare the brightess I used a fast shutter speed and darkened the picture further      Man, it's too beautiful, I would still use a cutting board.

I moved to billings for work and they build a Five Guys    I don't mind getting smudges on my hand, but what does washing your hand with dish soap do?   I was more asking about how you deal with the spirals impeding your ability to draw without physical obstacles for your hand    I know there are vertical spiral books out there but the ones I found had less than half the amount of paper as the regular spiral ones. I'm sure there will be some drawings where I'll have the spiral to the top if I do a landscape sketch/drawing, but I want to pick an orientation and stick with it.   The options I'm trying with is using normal orientation of the book but flipping the page all the way around and drawing on the back, or I can start from the back and work through the book backwards, or to keep the drawings on I guess "the front" I can turn the book upside down and work "backwards"   What works best for my leftie family?   Idea of the year right here   So in the end I'm better off building my own boxes if I want them to last longer?    After being a part of this subreddit since before I bought my M8, I can't help but feel there is/was some QA problems in the manufacturing process. The M8 doesn't seem to provide the same experience for everyone across the board and there are many issues I've read that occur for some but not others.   I've compiled a short list of the problems I've seen or experienced myself (and unfortunately I've experienced a good chunk of them):  * easily scratched camera lens that will cause blurry pictures  * the possibility that the lens can crack without having dropped or damaged the phone  * "loose" audio jack. Some audio plugs don't seem to make a tight connection with the audio jack and it's luck of the draw that what you have will work fine. Some cables or headphones will pop out of the last connection just enough that audio stops like you pulled the headphones out. Sometimes plugging headphones in will bring up the Google now voice search  * USB port becoming loose or damaged over time. Sometimes plugging a USB cable in will start dock mode, even if it's the same cable you always use that hasn't done it before. Sometimes the phone will get stuck in dock mode or USB host mode and refuse to charge.   * notification LED. I saw many complaints about the led being nearly impossible to see. I've gone through three replacement M8's due to the cracked lens and then receiving yellow hue screen phones. Each replacement had an LED much brighter and easier to see at an angle than my original device.    * different screen manufacturers. Some serial numbers have a brighter blue hue to the screen with more accurate looking whites, and some will have a yellow hue. Most people don't notice this unless they've gotten theirs exchanged and happened to look at the two side by side   Feel free to add anything I missed. What are your thoughts on what happened with the manufacturing process with this phone? What symptoms have you experienced yourself? What issues would you like to be resolved with the impending M9 or other htc flagship?   How do you mean shot? They just fell apart? I feel that if I were to use them I'd throw some screws into the corners for reinforcement    I have that same 5.1 logitech speaker set. Still going strong for what, around 10 years now? Pretty darn good bang for the buck. I think I bought the set for $55 new. Last summer I saw the same set in a pan shop for $50. After seeing that, I knew I wasn't going to find any good prices at that place and never went back   I couldn't really explain why. It's just that if I were given the choice of any other fish at this time in my life, I would choose Steelhead every time.    And that's the only reason it's happening: The government is heavily subsidizing the development. Without that, there is no incentive to do anything because there aren't enough people in rural areas for them to be profitable spending the money to dig the lines   IKEA definitely.   Steelhead is by far one of the best fish I've ever eaten    Mine is April 2014 so I'm not sure about the later models getting better screens theory you have :/   The one I'm sending in is HT44   I recently exchanged my M8 using the Advanced Exchange program because of a cracked camera lens. The phone I received in the mail is distinctly warm in color, whereas the phone i was about to send in was cooler, and had more of a blueish color when looking at whites. I called HTC customer support and they had me return the replacement phone and they would send me another, but the one I just got today is exactly the same. I gotta say I'm a tad bit disappointed. I don't want to have to keep returning the replacements until they get fed up with me so I'm going to have to get used to it and say goodbye to the one I'm sending in.  Did anyone else get their phone replaced and noticed a different screen hue?   You're in for a treat. I have the M8 and absolutely love it. So far it's the only phone I've had that I didn't want to replace after 6 months    8 months ago I was struggling to pay my bills on time and was over $16,000 in debt.  I got a better job at the end of April and today I have $11,000 left to pay      I really like the feel of this. Good job dude   For the most part notifications aren't the problem on the M8. It's all the icons that have to be on the status bar at all times. Like having an alarm set, when nfc is enables, or whatever you're listening to music, the boomsound and headphones icons.    And honesty, that looks goddamn amazing for being over 10 years old.    Eve Online has gone through several graphics engine overhauls.    There's a lot of rural and empty space where it isn't financially feasible to dig lines to houses in the middle of nowhere unless it's a significant development so it's not surprising to me. If you live in a city there are good chances you have access to Charter which has 30mbit internet and up to 60 in some cities.   No matter what state you live in, if you're in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, don't expect landlines to your house unless you pay out of pocket to dig them yourself    Even if you aren't manually twisting a handle to roll a window up, there are still rollers controlled by electric motors to move the window up and down so it still makes sense    Not even Google translate could decipher this website.

       If that doesn't happen, all gods are bastards.   I think what I was getting at is that in the show the millionaires would not be able to take courses, as they wouldn't be able to afford them and wouldn't have the time.    Damn shame; I'd have been interested to hear his thoughts on the matter (after being translated into english).   Ooooh narrated by Robert Webb. Interesting!   Edit: So the kids keep partying and acting like entitled cunts? I guess some change is better than none... source: watched some clips   Hahaha! If had gold to give, I would. That's amazing!   Hah, nice   Oh, I like that idea. A bit harsh though (in that you'd need a judge); getting people to partake in the show would be tough.   The psychological effects of poverty, and the inability to escape it, are some of the biggest problems at hand.   And then cancel it as it gained popularity   Awesome :D   There already exists a show like you described in your last paragraph (Secret Millionaire). That said, increased awareness and discontent with wealth disparity would add pressure for political change. Not that I'm saying a TV show could do that, but I believe that to be the general point of the matter.   That's the big problem with this idea. Current options include fame and charity.   Right, I forgot scholarships are easy to come by :p   And for the show, the contestants would actually need to work a minimum wage job.   Them too, for sure.   Inherited it?   Boy, that escalated quickly   I try to avoid /r/politics and /r/atheism because of hive mind mentality. I suppose this is a complex issue (the minimum wage   wealth disparity)...  	19

 You know it's serious when the CDC tells you to **kill it with fire**.   Kind of a side question because I don't work in stem cells (although I am in biology and biotechnology): Why don't people try to replenish progenitor cells or other "not as embryonic" stem cells in the hierarchy using iPS methods? We know where many of them reside and it could be as simple as generating the cell line and then reinjecting it back into the patient at a specific location.   Also one big part of the increased survival is **early detection**!! Get screened early and most things can be surgically removed. Surgery is still the gold standard and is really the only "curative" method, but only works when the cancer is in its early stages and has not metastasized.  People might say that mammograms and PSA tests don't have much benefit and that's certainly debatable, but gastrointestinal and cervical screenings have had a HUGE effect.   I think this must have been something they've been working on for a long time but put it on the backburner because it "wouldn't be worth the manpower". Something obviously changed in the last 2-3 years when they were planning the features for Windows 9. It might be as simple as a software workaround/"emulation" for drivers that refuse to work in W8/W9. Windows 7/Vista/XP have had "compatibility mode" for older programs for years, so this would just be the next step but on a much deeper level.   I was born in HK and am definitely very pro-democracy, but let's give China some reserved credit here for the first few days of the protest.  If this was done in America, there would be riots, smashed storefronts, and police brutality everywhere. While tear gas and pepper spray are still quite strong anti-democratic weapons, the amount of restraint by the HK police is phenomenal so far. **There has not been one single gunshot.** Remember, there are probably over 10k people sitting on that little strip and nobody has died. I realize that the bar for police civility is quite low, but they have managed to exceed my expectations.  Just remember what was happening in the Ukraine and during the Arab Spring. I have to commend the HK protesters for keeping disciplined and non-violent, and the HK police for not shooting at anyone.   I agree, let's give some reserved credit to China/the HK police for not shooting people. I'm not sure if this will continue, but I'm optimistic that China knows (1) the world is watching them, (2) they will lose all legitimacy in HK if they apply force.   I don't think the West needs to do anything if China starts shooting. HK can fuck shit up all on its own. It's not like you have a large pro-China presence there like in the other sketchy parts of the country (eg. Xinjiang, etc).   There is a huge difference between being irritable and acting like a 5 year old though.   Also, isn't that pretty arrogant? Just because he has a solid fanbase doesn't mean they are constantly checking his Twitter feed or associated social media. I like his movies but I have a day job.   I lived in Boston for six years and I absolutely agree. Drivers need to be forced to slow down because they think they are infallible on the road. They drive like they are on a race track. Granted it probably varies by city but they are likely to be more aggressive in big cities.   I didn't think it was awful, but it was way too long. I didn't see the point of that entire lock down magnet sequence.   OWS was very different than this. OWS purposely did not have a political goal and was meant to subvert the system. HKers are protesting for universal suffrage, a very concrete objective.   Can we get a livethread set up for this? This is as big if not bigger than the Ukraine situation.   ??? Property taxes go up too! Often it can be very fast depending on how hot your neighborhood is.   He was also responsible for the glass steagal nightmare that led to the bank crash.   I don't think Samantha Bee is funny anymore. Jason Jones has kicked it up quite a bit. Michael Che was surprisingly very good but too bad he got poached. Al Madrigal and Aasif Mandvi are really solid and I'm surprised Larry Wilmore got picked.   Just to jump in: you're not going to find use in doing scans of single cells. This would be useless for many types of blood cancers. But it's kind of incredible if they can use this for deep tissue imaging of solid tumors. Normally they appear as a mass of cells that just look pretty fucked up. This easily identifiable for a pathologist but kind of hard to do during surgery.  As far as I know, in a typical oncological surgery operation, what they think is the tumor + buffer room is excised from the patient. At that point they will take sections of the ends and quickly make sides for a pathologist to examine *immediately*. They keep cutting until they find nothing.  If this technology could speed that up while having no loss or even an improvement in sensitivity, then it is a big deal.   You make a really good point. These phones were not built to last. They may not bend now, but in 3 years they might look pretty warped with daily force. Planned obsolescence.  Apple is doing some terrible PR. Jobs isn't here any longer so saying that the problem doesn't exist or to minimize it by saying only 9 people have complained is a terrible tactic. You never confront the issue by denying theres a problem, especially because there's something that customers can obviously see on the internet that is the opposite. Similarly with the antenna and maps: just acknowledge that some people may have problems and sweeten the deal with a case with no questions asked.   I don't know, some people have blue cheese or stronger in their burger...   Kind of nitpicky, but that bun didn't look so great compared to that giant hunk of meat. Also, Wagyu/Kobe is not really the best type of beef for a burger.   Some of them have skin/fur problems that require the occasional shampoo.   Actually, that's pretty incredible thinking. What are the taxes on investment dividends and do they trigger when you apply them directly to things like lines of credit? In that case then it's essentially free money.   Do you seriously think that China and Britain are on equivalent levels here? One of these countries has an established rule of law (including courts, an efficient police system) and constitution upon which HK based all their laws. Mercantilism and the finance industry boomed in HK largely because of the British. You also have property rights and healthy private businesses.  In China you have no freedom of speech, a censored internet, a farce of a court system, barely any private property rights, and a business culture where the only businesses that succeed are government spinoffs.  Sure, there are problems with Britain and were problems with their rule pre-1997, but it sure as fuck was better than having China look over your shoulder.  Although I may be biased, because I'm from there.   Don't worry, China's not stupid. If there ends up being any deaths of these students, the Chinese government will execute those officers involved. If not, the HK population will riot and fuck shit up. We're talking about 7 million people in densities higher than NYC.  FWIW, people in HK do NOT see themselves as part of the mainland. There is a huge nativist/xenophobic/"nationalist" sentiment against mainland Chinese, who are easy to identify because they speak only Mandarin. Their only legitimacy in HK is because of an agreement that HK will keep its government and that the Basic Law will be enforced.  HKers are also much more affluent and educated than other minorities in China (eg. Uighurs, etc). Classical oppressive tactics are not going to work here, and China realizes that.   Side question: I don't work in chemical library screen but some labs next to me do. How much these libraries typically cost, and how many assays can you perform with them? Seems to me that they can be a resource that depratments could potentially share.   Channing Tatum looks absolutely hilarious in this. People think this movie actually looks good? It looks like every single sci-fi trope put together.   The big problem with the art direction in Wachowski films is that none of it seems particularly "thoughtful". Everything looks like it was just thrown in together without much forethought.   Do you think a good solution would be for companies to stop selling chemical libraries that include PAINS? I think there would be a pretty nice market for that.   /r/biology is basically a better version of /r/science.   Y2H was problematic especially because of the "false hit" problem. When I started graduate school it was starting to become recognized and now I think scientists generally know about it now.   HEPES? Really? That's quite shocking to me considering it's used in a ton of protein purification and storage buffers.  His tags have been known to be problematic for quite a long time. It's quite common now to cleave out the affinity tag so you're just left with either the original length of your POI or a small peptide scar.   Don't worry, that won't happen. China knows they are walking a very fine line. As soon as there is violent suppression of the protests they will lose all legitimacy on the island and it will spiral out of control. Contrary to what everyone else sees, China only has tenuous control of the entire country so long as economic conditions are growing. That's why they are so worried about a slowdown in growth (even if it's at 7%!!! this year).   In Hong Kong, you have 90% of the population that is essentially nativist/"nationalist" against outside influence. The only reason why China hasn't seen more resistance is because they agreed to the "don't fuck with us and we won't riot" treaty in 1997. If this escalates to violence, you can't stop 6+ million people from throwing out the government. Once this starts, you know that other large cities will start to push back.  Also keep in mind that by and large HK is much more affluent than the rest of China. They aren't bound by the same economic social contract. They are genuinely concerned for their rights, as opposed to many mainland Chinese who will put up with a lot of oppression for economic growth.  Source: I'm a HKer.   That... that is an amazing pepper spray defense.   http://www.nature.com/news/chemistry-chemical-con-artists-foil-drug-discovery-1.15991  Just keep this in mind. Curcumin is one of the offenders and it's in turmeric.      I think that's a little optimistic about Amazon. They might not go bankrupt or disappear, but they could become a shadow of their current selves.   As an example, Dell and HP were in a race to the bottom for prices as well as fighting tooth and nail for razor thin margins. The economic downturn and progressively cheaper components was really bad for them.   For Amazon, if their margins are steadily decreasing because of the simultaneous decrease in the cost of infrastructure and hypercompetition in pricing, then at some point it becomes very difficult to keep yourself afloat.   A lot of people complain that H1Bs prevent hiring of American software engineers. The problem is that companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook doesn't just want to hire any asshole that comes out of college. The H1B is a nice mechanism because it expands your labor pool to the entire world!  Think about it this way: if you are a multi-billion dollar company hiring for an entry-level coding position, would you hire a foreigner or a college graduate if their coding expertise was just mediocre? You would definitely hire the first one if you could pay them less and given all other things are equal.  The interesting part is when you start getting to the really skilled workers. If you are looking for a very specific skill set, why would you only look in the American pool? For some reason people only think India or China, but there are tons of very skilled workers in Europe that companies would like to bring here.   Releasing January 9th? January is the month where bad movies go to die...   I think in theory that is a great idea, but in practice it is impossible to look for something that the customer will remember.    I had to do something trivial with BofA on the phone once. One question was my last bill payment amount. Why would I even remember something like that?   People should watch Better Luck Tomorrow before they rag on Justin Lin.   They wouldn't pick Justin Lin if they didn't think he could pull it off. The first two episodes could possibly be extremely action packed and they needed someone who can direct that kind of thing. The second season is about mobsters, after all.   I think it's interesting to note that various animals (eg. some kinds of parrots and dogs) start to develop all kinds of mental and emotional disorders when they have nothing to do, have lack of stimulus in their life, or are bored. It's probably not a coincidence that we experience the same behaviors when life was not more regimented or was "more exciting" so to speak.   Python's a tricky one to learn because there's not a specific coding dogma (as compared to C++, that is). I had formal education in C/C++ and a few other low level languages, and the one thing that I was taught was that there was a specific "style" that has a little bit of wiggle room to account for different best coding practices in different coding shops. Python is really expressive, which means that while it's easy to read what's going on (and easy to do "elegant" "one liners"), it has the side effect of being able to put in a lot of personal style into the code which makes it much harder to learn if you're a newbie.   Students should be able to fact-check their teachers in science class and get extra credit for finding errors. Gives them something better to do than texting their friends all the time and they get to be actively searching about science at the same time. In high school I corrected my teacher all the time in Math class, and I never got disciplined for it.   Trying to upvote you to the top. The point is that the "rate" of evolution is really determined by the strength of the selection pressure. Punctuated equilibrium is saying that evolution generally revolves around "strong" selection pressures, which doesn't make any sense considering the amount of diversity out there and considering the pervasive level of genetic drift.   The ONLY movie where something like this was reasonably brought up (ie. negative consequences of superheroes having a lot of "neighborhood" damage) was Transformers 4. That's a pretty low bar to jump and yet very few sequels or movies actually address it. I suppose IM3 and CA2 address it somewhat but they weren't central points to the movie.   Also, I'm sure Supes indirectly killed thousands of people with all the Metropolis carnage and the final fight with Zod.   PROTIP: If you see anything that says "MSG free", but has "hydrolyzed yeast", hydrolyzed protein, or "amino acid salts" on the ingredient list.... that's MSG! Tons of people happily buy this and think they're getting a "healthier" meal.   Milk is the only one with a really high lactose content. And even then most people just have mild symptoms. Do you fart a lot? Try not drinking milk.   Not to mention about half of the cheese that you buy at the supermarket is of domestic origin. Yes, even the fancy ones.   It really depends on the cheese. Old aged ones are very low in lactose, but fresher ones like ricotta and mozzarella aren't great choices for those who are lactose intolerant.   I had thought squirrels were herbivores, until a few years back when I saw a very pregnant squirrel eating a giant chicken leg on a fence....   Does Keifer Sutherland count? His dad's Canadian.  Oops, I guess he's well known in the USA so that doesn't work for this thread.   I bet the US military would be the first to make long range electric aircraft. Practically zero noise so they could make drones invisible. Same with stealth bombers.   A silver lining: after WWII, most German cities were reduced to rubble. But they painstakingly restored and rebuilt entire cities based on historical documents and photographs. Could that be done here? It's a total longshot but it could be something that would get a lot of international support.   Random question: when do the recent presidents (eg. Clinton, GW Bush, Obama) get a named carrier?   They can sell it in illegal trucks. Maintaining a properly supply line in a conflict is another thing. For one, that would be a dead giveaway on satellite and just invites a drone visit. They aren't that dumb.   The US was sending some troops to help build facilities over there. What we need are armed guards to help protect the medical staff. If the host country cannot ensure their safety (eg. with their own security forces), then it's fair game to have an outside force impose order in this kind of situation. It's way too late to have some kind of debate about how to properly deal with cultural differences in medical beliefs. People are dying *today*.   Are most girls really that self-conscious about taking a poo at someone's place? Honest question, because my current partner is my first and only long-term girlfriend and I am pretty sure she didn't even hesitate to use the bathroom at my place.   Also, it's pretty much inconsequential considering the margin of victory. Do you think some table shenanigans can swing the vote by that much?   Interesting point. How would one attempt to detect womholes with a telescope?   Who cares about plot consistency? If you keep track of comic books then you'd know that things have been ret-conned and rebooted ad nauseum. Thor just became a woman, Wolverine is gonna die, and Spiderman is finally coming back after being taken over by doc ock.   There was a reddit comment a few days ago where this European speculated that the reason Europeans dress so well is because there's no space for giant houses or other expensive items. So expensive clothing replaced all those things and became a status symbol.   It's actually a lot easier to make pasta in a restaurant setting: The morning of they usually cook it to within 1-2 minutes of al dente. Once an order comes in they throw it in water for a bit, then sauce it up and you're done.  Edit: It seems like OG needs to have a Domino's style makeover that happened a few years back. Sure, Domino's is still not great, but they got a lot better when they admitted that their food sucked.   Even Golden Dawn stepped up the xenophobic hysteria in the past few years. People talk about how Europe is the pinnacle of civilization but it doesn't take much for them to go back to violent times.   I think you should modify that last statement: it could be very well that some human ancestor and chimpanzee ancestor (that have diverged from our common ancestor) were competing for the same resources, but that either (a) the human ancestors were more successful and contributed to reduced resource availability for chimpanzees and leading to their aggressiveness, or (b) the competition between species made them naturally more violent.  On the other hand, it is very possible that the great ape ancestor was very violent and that bonobos and humans acquired mutations that reduced it but not in the chimpanzee. It's known that pair bonding and other adaptations in humans made us much less violent (even though we're still pretty bad), and it's likely that the bonobo's lack of aggression in community living has a genetic component.   Also, let's be honest here: a lot of the hubbub in the news is with regards to *meta*-data tracking. Apple said they don't know what you sent, but do they keep records of data transit? How secure is the meta-data behind each "transaction"?   I was in electrical engineering and not CS in college so maybe the curriculums are different. But we had a few courses dedicated to assembly so this didn't seem too bad. Keep in mind that the biggest obstacle here was to recognize that the program was detecting a debug mode and to know how to hijack that check. The level 2 challenge should be much harder.   I think college town police tend to show up rather fast since there's not much going on. Especially if there is a weapon involved.   Just like to point out that low n values do not necessarily mean that it's bad. If the effect sizes are large and if the populations were segregated properly (eg. proper experimental design), then you can get away with pretty small sample sizes.   A pound of coffee per week seems like a lot. How many cups do you make a day? Coarse grind means that you have to use more bean for the same strength, so if you switch to very fine grind with a cone filter pour-over you can save a lot of coffee.   I think the two "series" are actually quite decent if you take them to be what they are. They're very different movies thematically but quite decent in their own genre.   I thought the second was the best in the series. The third fell flat for me because it felt like there was no suspense, and much of the supporting cast (eg. Julia Stiles IIRC) was only in the movie for 20 minutes at most.   IMO? Multiple reports have said that Notch was the guy who approached Microsoft about the acquisition in the first place.   Samsung's flagship Galaxy S line didn't even get NFC until S3 which was released in 2012 (some versions of the S2 had NFC in 2011). As far as I know, the entire Nexus line has NFC but those didn't sell very well. Likewise on the Droid line, NFC wasn't even a thing until the Droid Incredible 4G came out.   I don't think this will take off anytime soon, considering that only a small fraction of smartphones out there have NFC.  Starbucks had a better idea that works for most smartphones: just display a barcode on the screen for the scanner to read.   I agree. If they thought that surrender meant a lifetime in Gitmo then they would probably fight to the death. But if you give them an attractive way out then you can really break morale while you are bombing the shit out of them.   If you have problems meditating, studies have shown that walks provide similar stress relieving benefits. It has to be a long walk though.   A lot of his newer stuff on youtube isn't too bad. I think he grew up quite a bit since his freestyle days.   Won't all the extra water from the spinach make it soggy?   Mine too! I think it's standard in most electric toothbrushes.   This rationale is good in theory. But in practice it is not uniformly applied. See Bowe Bergdahl and other POWs. Many of them have no special intelligence value, and yet the US goes to extreme lengths to get them back (eg. prisoner swaps).   This implies that soldiers are worth more than reporters and civilians. Even ones that royally fucked up and walked off a base. Think about that for a second.   She was moving it around too much, probably because of habit from regular brushes. You're also supposed to use it for 2 minutes which she didn't do.   Can't help but notice that she's using her electric toothbrush completely wrong.    It depends. If you're on a long distance roadtrip then going above the speed limit will for sure get you there faster. But you are right in that if you are commuting to work, driving defensively and at the speed limit actually gets you there at around the same time.   I lived in Germany for a good while and asked my friends this exact question. They told me that everyone leaves work "early" on a Friday to get their grocery shopping done.   I think my point was that Holmes (and Watson) serve as our eyes and ears and hearts in the books. By explicitly bring out the "false dilemma" the author is trying to induce the same feelings in the reader, but the problem is that it ends up feeling phony because I don't think any reasonable person would ever feel as sympathetic as they did in that situation.   I think that kind of generalization only works if you're white.   I really hate this part about fiction. The author presents a false dichotomy to make it appear as if there was a real moral dilemma -- being abused doesn't legitimize murder. There are plenty of ways to get back onto the will without outright killing someone.   OMG.   But doesn't occupying an area for camping change animal habits in the first place? Leaving them alone by not camping would be the best option.   Just like all conspiracy theories, people have a yearning for creating narratives and especially so for things they don't understand. It's pretty much instinctive for humans to believe that things "happen for a reason" and some people end up applying this to the entire world's events.   Agreed. The US doesn't have the political will to outright declare war on Syria. Even if the US completely obliterates ISIS, there is no way they can arm Syrian rebels with enough firepower to take out Assad on their own. I guess Obama/his successor can pull a Libya and do it the airstrike way but I feel like you could only pull the "let's bomb a country but it's not really declaring war" card once.   Canadian here. 9/11 happened on the first or second week of my first year in University. I remember going down the stairs for class and noticed everyone glued to the television screen in the lounge. For the rest of the day I thought "Welp, this is WWIII" because (as far as I can remember) we had no idea who was responsible and I just assumed it was another country.  Then a few weeks later the US invades Afghanistan, I remember thinking "how did they figure that out so fast?" I thought it was a little rushed and somewhat drastic to be invading an entire country for a terrorist attack. I held out hope that something good would come out of it. When they invaded Iraq a little while later I was thinking "wait, what's happening here?" I held onto hope that they would at least be able to build a proper state, but I guess the jury's still out on that.   The Hawaii scene was so abrupt that for a while I was convinced that they accidentally deleted the CG work! It's happened before at Pixar.   It was a lot better than #1 and #2. The main problem was that the movie was too long. At about the 2 hour mark I started getting bored. The last scene with Lockdown's ship returning was not even necessary.   One day I wore plaid shorts with a (dense, thin lined) striped button up shirt. My girlfriend laughed at me!   Or you could do it the amazon way and rank by helpful/not helpful!   The most interesting thing is that the top school rankings haven't really changed all that much in the past decades. You still have complete dominance from "Western" schools, with very little penetrance from Asian ones. This is in spite of the fact that many East Asian countries are pouring in money for post-secondary education and research, while Western university funding is flat or declining.      I wouldn't call MSU a joke. LSU, on the other hand...   It's the long con. They play all cutesy before you start dating, but they slowly escalate the tiger mom persona.    It's a pretty common stereotype in Germany that most stolen stuff flows in and out of Poland.    As far as I know, the homology search by Cas9 starts by binding to a PAM sequence. So you absolutely need one even if it is dCas9. Other species of Cas9 have different PAM requirements though.    Somethings not right with the math. The US population is approximately 300 million people including elderly and children. The labor participation rate is about 62% according to the department of labor, meaning that a lot of those Op counts as unemployed could just be the elderly ageing out.    Here's an even better example: reddit admins allow for all kinds of marijuana and other drug-related subs to flourish, even though some are clearly in extreme violation of federal law. In these cases, the admins have decided that (a) they probably won't get into legal trouble, and/or (b) disagree with the law and hence won't censor it in contrast to other removed content. Either way it sets a pretty bad precedent.  	107

And in the long term, the ability to land a rocket on solid ground will assist in Musk's ultimate goal: colonising Mars.      Quantum computing is seen as the next stage in technological development, not only on the processing level but that of storage space as well. It is the latter area where a team of scientists from the Australian National University has made a breakthrough.      Novels can have multiple subplots. Most films only have one or two, if any. Theres simply not enough time for them to develop in about 90 minutes.      The ability to recognize oneself in a mirror has been touted as a hallmark of higher cognition  present in humans and only the most intelligent of animals  and the basis for empathy. A study published this week in Current Biology controversially reports that macaques can be trained to pay attention to themselves in a mirror, the first such observation in any monkey species.      It has been a big, exciting year for the mobile industry. We've seen loads of new handsets with great features, wearable tech entered its next phase and Aussie telcos have introduced some important changes to plans and pricing. Its easy to forget some of the top stories amidst the tide. Here are the biggest changes to the Aussie phone market that happened in 2014.

The planet still holds vast reserves of fossil fuel that could be extracted economically. However, according to a new analysis, a third of the worlds oil, half of its gas, and 80 percent of its coal reserves must remain unused if we are to have a good chance of avoiding potentially devastating climate change.         In an interstellar race against time, astronomers have measured the space-time warp in the gravity of a binary star and determined the mass of a neutron starjust before it vanished from view.

 Kuru, yes? Human prion disease. Only read about half so far but needed to comment before I forgot. Edit: X-files junkie. Prone to diagnosing everyone with Kuru and other random stuff. Sorry about your dad, OP.   Take that bottle of ink you gathered to a police man okay? Tell him where you found it and that daddy is uspet about it and that Maisey is gone away. He'll have special stuff to get it out of the carpet with.   Can you elaborate a bit?   Seconded.   Did you get your shirt back? :(   Too bad the're not selling condoms, common sense, and rehab.   Yeah that.   So accurate. Half the guys I went to school with are out West now.   Dude. Cops and some friends. Get out there and investigate during daylight. Your missing friend is connected to that house. Please update us with what you find.   Nova Scotia here. Wonder how long it'll take the drug to reach us. Probably the summer when all the boys come home to visit.    Drugs containing a lot of sulphur can turn your blood green/blueish.    It's alright. Just struck me funny. I have the most boring innocuous birthday ever so something scary happening on that day is... strange to say the least.   Be safe. Ask a nurse if they have a charger you can borrow. Oddly enough I had great luck with that when I was in hospital.  How did you end up there?   Upsetting that you woke up there on my birthday.    Talk to her! Maybe she knows whats going on!   Update please.   Did you put her there?   Dude. My suggestion is wrap yourself in garbage bags and duct tape and burn that mofo! Ps. Sorry about Vern. :(   Whatever it is, give it the fuck back!   Hopefully the cover cleaner is alright. The sterling silver is just a wive's tale my grandmere used to tell me but I've seen it mentioned in my research, as a way to protect yourself. So it has to be worth a shot.   This is removed but was it connected to the infected town?   Nosleep is here. Talk to us. We can help.   Man...  I have an odd relationship with one of my exes. We love one another and we're really close with a weird bond no one can understand. Anyway. In October I was talking to my Mum about said ex and saying I thought his girlfriend might be pregnant. So I had asked him about it and he was surprised as they had just found out but yes, she was pregnant. I knew the moment I got that text message from him that he "wasn't going to be a dad." So I told my mum and although we didn't know what I meant, we figured it was important to remember I had said it. He texted me on Christmas day to tell me she was having a miscarriage. I fully understand the guilt and I wish I could explain where those feelings come from. I haven't been able to look him in the eye since, for feeling like I caused her to lose the baby.   Do some research and post a story letting us know what you find!   Next time just drive on your flat. A destroyed rim is better than a dead you. I'm super glad you're okay, just know that you CAN drive on your rim.   Are you dead? Did you die in childbirth?   Yeah I was just about to lean out the window and have a smoke... thanks for helping me cut back OP.   Technically until all of the "remnants" are expelled, you are still pregnant. Also there's that whole baby dies in utero but you have to keep carrying it until labor can be induced thing.    Holy.... sh!t.   Jerk.  But also... this was really good.    SO what is it then, that makes it so you can't feel pain in your dreams? And how are you getting the wee cuts? I feel like I've missed something and that bothers me 'cause I'm covered in the damn things all the time. I just chalk it up to sharing a bed with a grouchy black cat and a 30lb border collie with no concept of personal space. But it still bothers me.

 There's a party everyday in the US *somewhere*.   Titled  Account request - Please Change Email  I use blur from https://abine.com/index.html for privacy. My email is from opayq.com. Apparently circle doesn't like them.      *If you owe the bank 100 thousand, you've got a problem. If you owe the bank 100 million, the bank has a problem.*   Time travel.  It would be even *more* noteworthy if it was announced yesterday, though.  Second would be a solution to the negentropy heat death problem.   Reminded me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb_-a9I_fto   reproduce the content  That's arguably questionable, if you take that to mean "copy it to our own servers". Google's webcache [was ruled fair use](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2006/01/google-cache-ruled-fair-use), but I can see arguments that this would be different; the guidelines mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_v._Google,_Inc.#Fair_use don't all apply.  That said, reading through that page does make one think it would be legal, as the blog post says:   After all, having an RSS feed in the first place is an implict opt-in to that sort of thing. But trying to dictate terms on top of that while telling me that I automatically agree to them unless I opt out is unacceptable, even if the terms themselves are relatively benign.    On his part, or on Apple's part?   The problem isn't with the terms, it's that Apple *assumes you agree if you don't say anything*! I'm sure the blog author agrees Apple can demand anything they want in exchange for listing. But considering someone to have agreed to terms when they're silent is silly, and will never hold up in court.  You're basically agreeing to take responsibility for your own content.  Apple is *assuming* you agree, and in order to disabuse them of this notion you must do an action. That's what's unacceptable.   Apple doesn't have to be responsible, but they have no right to demand the original author defend them. The original author made no guarantee to Apple.  It'd be the same as trying to sue your RSS reader of choice for something from my blog that you read and didn't like.  An RSS reader that runs on device is different, because the developer doesn't store it.  A better analogy would be if Google would index my site without my agreement (with an "opt-out" clause), then sues me because they got a takedown notice.  If the argument is that Apple shouldn't be responsible for the content, that's *their* job to make that argument in court, not mine.  Again, it's fine to put whatever you want in your terms and require people to agree if they want to use your service, but you have no right to demand people agree with your terms in general, and assume they agree unless they opt-out.    He is attacking Apple for being transparent. That is ridiculous.  He's attacking them for assuming he agrees to whatever they want if he doesn't opt-out.  The terms state   If we receive a legal claim about your RSS content, we will tell you so that you can resolve the issue, including indemnifying Apple if Apple is included in the claim.  Do you know what indemnify means, and why someone might not want to agree to it?   https://github.com/basil00/PseudoNode  It pretends to be a node, fetches blocks and other data on the fly from other nodes.      It was written by Professor Anthony Glees, the director of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, and has never been corrected.  Well, now it has.   The point is that it may be fine legally for them to take the content, and he'd be fine with that, but adding terms as opt-in is wrong. Especially the indemnify clause.      Fascinating. Can you tell me more about how the price has only risen ever, because of this new economic theory?

Thanks for making me read a whole article before finding out there's no more info than the title.   That's odd    Because tens of millions of people always think as a hivemind.   Statistically, that is true; the vast majority of people can't.   Have you seen https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC64C47A407D58AAC?   Wait, you mean some believe HPMOR has non-insane interpretations?   /r/nocontext       https://bitmixer.io/ is a mixer. I understand you don't trust third parties, but there's strong reason to trust them in particular, at least to not steal your funds.  They give you a "Letter of Guarantee" signed by their address, so if they ever scam anyone there would be cryptographic proof. So as long as nobody produces a Letter of Guarantee that hasn't been fulfilled, they probably aren't scamming anyone.  (As I understand it, the letter basically says "if btc is sent to addressX by timeY, we will send Z% to addressX2 by timeY2, with limits such and such". So you can see in the blockchain if it's been fulfilled or not.)  This may not be enough for you, just something to think about.   Recently?    something something upvote karma   Fun fact: a recent study showed that patients did better when cardiologists were away at a conference.  I feel this has to be relevant somehow but can't come up with that perfect line to tie it in.   Nah. Don't you have to do something to get high? I'm not quite sure what, but I definitely haven't done it.   I have ideas like that all the time and have never been high.   I'm not disputing that right now spam can dos the network.  My claim is that there are viable solutions to that. If blocksize isn't limited, but almost everyone needs to pay around the actual costs, then spammers are just paying for miners and nodes to get larger hard drives.  I'm not claiming you can make spammers happy, just that you can make anyone we care about happy.   The spammer can't win, but why can't the miners and nodes win, and the legit user pay a nominal fee? That subset is all the designers should care about, and they are not zero sum.   That's probably because they don't think those are legally enforceable in France. If there was any threat of actually being blocked in France they would cave IMO.   http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=23 t=10  In 2014, about 136.78 billion gallons (or 3.26 billion barrels) of gasoline were consumed in the United States, a daily average of about 374.74 million gallons (or 8.92 million barrels)  So 240 million gallons less would be 136.54 billion, a reduction of less than .2%.

But if you look for the link in archive.is before google removes it, they'll mirror it from google.       That's the reason I haven't had to bother to look at the proposals, just as I wouldn't bother to read your interesting exercise on how to square the circle or solve the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time.  The difference is that for squaring the circle, there are mathematical proofs that it's impossible, and for P=NP, most experts believe otherwise, and there's a [whole lot of people claiming proofs](https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm). (That page also links to http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p-vs-np.html which says why he won't check such claimed solutions.)  This "problem" of DoS that you mention has neither rigorous mathematical proof of its impossibility, nor a consensus among academic experts of the same. It's therefore incorrect for you to make the comparison.  Now, as for the actual problems you've brought up:  The government would pay to enlarge the mined block up to its limit. That's what a DoS is. The limit can be "variable" but it can't be infinite, as otherwise mempools will fill up on nodes everywhere in the network.  Nobody's talking about making it infinite (which is impossible to do without computers capable of relaying infinitely large blocks.) THere's been talk of dynamically increasing limits based on averages of past blocks, which would only be able to grow at a fixed rate even if spam was introduced.  Aligning the incentives so that miners profit when spammers engage in spamming has nothing to do with the incentives for people just trying to pay someone using Bitcoin.  That's right; currently, the incentives aren't sufficiently aligned. The miners' incentives are aligned the right way, as in they won't be forced into doing something they don't want. What we need is some kind of incentive for nodes that sufficiently rewards them for their costs. If that was implemented, then spamming would just increase funding for the costs it creates, thus being a wash.  It isn't only a 2-party problem no matter how much you try to simplify it, and not everyone can have their interests aligned to when some of the interests are diametrically opposed.  Can you prove this mathematically? Which people are in a zero-sum situation (which I'm assuming is what you mean by "diametrically opposed")? Anyone wanting Bitcoin to survive automatically has a shared interest with anyone else who also does, so the only possible zero-sum seems to be enemies of Bitcoin versus non-enemies.

Don't see the claim that it take only a few minutes.    Look, I said the effect it negligible and plays no role when it comes to "toilets, kiddy pools and sinks".  Yes, and so far you have yet to source the pools part.  Now you want to talk about pools? Do I have to find a source that says the effect does not matter to green kiddy pools after that?  The original claim was **only** about pools. There's been no goalposts moved, despite what you seem to be implying.  You don't have to learn physics, just to be able to understand the wikipedia article on the coriolis force enough to know that the size and duration of the system are what matter here. Educating yourself on the strength of the coriolis force does not require more of you than to look it up!  And the size is larger, so your sources are worthless for the question here.         SPV nodes have no way for example to detect if a node fraudulently reports the receipt of bitcoins to the SPV nodes wallet that dont exist in the fully-verified block chain.  That's actually stupidly easy to check; download all the headers, verify those, and download the block that transaction is supposed to be in.  I think the real problem is the reverse: that they could withhold transactions, and without scanning the whole blockchain you wouldn't know about these missing transactions.  E. A change would be irreversible - Changing the block size limit requires a hard fork and if the larger block size were to be abused, changing it back may not be possible due to changes in who would still be mining without coersion from outside organizations.   Changing it back would require just 51% of miners and nothing else. It's easier than changing it in the first place, which requires nodes to upgrade.    Elevier charges too much. Most publishers do.  That seems like even less of a legal argument.   You seem extremely convinced of your position, despite being unwilling to look at the proposals that would solve the problem. Why is that?  Finding ways to easily filter out spam if someone should choose to pursue DoS is a governance problem, but as soon as you have guys like Gavin deciding which people (or bots) are and are not allowed to get their transaction into the blockchain, you've just added government into Bitcoin.  Miners will individually decide which transactions they allow. If they're fine with a transaction, then it can hardly be called spam, can it? If some government wants to pay for the miners' costs, that just lowers the price for the rest of us.  The important things that need to be done (and are starting to be addressed with technical proposals) are aligning the incentives better, so that the same people who'd be paid by spammers are the ones the cost falls under, for example. Do you think that's impossible, and if so, why?  Ironically the actual banking systems in use in the world are decentralized in execution in a way that Bitcoin is not. I can deposit money in a local bank without having to have the transaction wait a turn in line on a global transaction clearing scheme before the local bank could treat that deposit as an asset.  If your bank trusts you, you could use something like Ripple or Lightning network to deposit bitcoins there instantly. Or if they trust your exchange, they can greenaddress their addresses and deposit instantly also.   You seem to both lack enough imagination to solve the problem and are unwilling to read the proposals.  If you could actually point to an analysis that showed that the network was vulnerable to Dos and that none of the proposed solutions are viable, that would be a different story.   centralized blockchain   Wat?   Yes, yes, we know about hindsight bias.   That's completely irrelevant.    It won't be. If it is it will just be the target of DoS attacks, which is why the initial blocksize limit was instituted in the first place! You do know that Bitcoin wasn't born with a 1MB blocksize limit, right?  There have been proposals. You can go read them.  Yes, I know it didn't start with a 1MB limit. The cost for spamming was also much less when bitcoin was worth less.  Are you being deliberately obtuse now?  No. I was trying to explain my earlier comment on how your argument seemed circular. I get how you responded to that, but I disagreed, as above.  This isn't a difficult concept and it's not something you should pawn off on the Great Developers running their Tons of Simulations. You should strive to understand what is going on yourself instead of just leaving things in the hands of people smarter than you.  The concepts we're talking about now are much more difficult than you give them credit for. I've done a lot of reading, there are dozens of different technical proposals at this point.  If you can't imagine a variable blocksize that isn't vulnerable to Dos, maybe you should read some of those proposals.   What kinds of fees are we talking about?   But when **transaction** fees go up  I know we're talking about transaction fees, I mean numerically how high.  Yes, if usage increases then fees have to go up. Even Bitcoin isn't immune to supply and demand, and remember that you're the one assuming the 20MB blocks are already filled up. If the number of transactions you can fit in a block is fixed, and more people want to push transactions into the blockchain, the price of each transaction must go up until there is equilibrium between transaction demand and transaction supply again.  If the blocks are completely full, then sort of. But what if the max blocksize is variable, and expands if more transactions show up? (And yes, it's more complicated than that, which is why there are developers running tons of simulations to try and figure out what's best to do.)  Fees go up - less tumblers used - tx volume goes down (since non-bot volume can't increase to match what computers could put on the blockchain).  Why do the fees go up in the first place? And remember, these fees are starting at 1/20th of the current fees, assuming 20MB blocks.    I'm not saying that no one is paying for the privilege. Criminals pay hefty fees to launder money in fiat, after all. But when transaction fees go up as you have the moon-rocketing masses on their way to Satoshi's Comet, fewer people will use tumblers and transaction volume will then go back down.   What kinds of fees are we talking about? If usage increases, the fees don't go up over today's implied fees in the subsidy (again, assuming constant price+hashrate), they go down.  What you're describing as inevitable doesn't seem so to me, because there's so many things you're handwaving (fees go up - less tumblrs used - fees go up? Circular?)   No such thing as bad publicity.   But how are those any less legitimate than others? Tumblrs perform a service, and get paid for it, and so on.  But look yourself, pegged against a stable reference point you can see that transaction volume has been flat... for months.  I'm not sure USD value is a good peg, because often a transaction is for much less than the amount actually transferred. If an exchange has a hot wallet around a constant size of btc, then USD value will fluctuate regardless of actual transfer size.    since most transactions are artificially constructed anyways.  As opposed to? Seriously, I'm not sure what you mean. Almost every transaction is created by a computer, yes. But I doubt most transactions are made not for the purpose of transferring money. There's been some stress tests (and spam) recently, but I don't think that accounts for a majority?   I think the phrasing in OP was poor.  20MB blocks isn't going to magically fix that.  Well yeah, but 20MB blocks plus increase in transaction volume will, and the whole point in 20MB blocks is because people expect transaction volume to increase.    But that's analogous to asking "why do I have to pay my barber to move those scissors around my head (when I can do it myself)?" or "why do I have to pay my employees to push keys on a keyboard (when I can do it myself)?".  Possibly; but that doesn't make the complaint wrong. I complain about Windows charging for upgrades, and use mostly Linux myself, where I get completely free upgrades. (And I do like that Windows 10 will be freeish for some time.)  Is my complaint that Windows costs somehow wrong?  Perhaps he's simply demanding that people give him free stuff.  Or stating that he's going to use the free stuff from other vendors.   How is it not a feature?   If there aren't more transactions, then there can't be 20MB blocks (well, barring much larger transactions).  each 20 MB block has the same number of transactions per block as is happening today  That's impossible (again, barring huge transactions, but those are likely to represent multiple "real" transactions ala Coinjoin).   Well yeah (although with some of recent stress tests they were), but a main reason given to raise the blocksize is that blocks are expected to fill up with greater adoption.  I feel your post is a bit disingenuous. It implies that the cost would be the same regardless of volume, esp. that part about how larger blocks wouldn't fix it. What would be more accurate is that *if* the price stayed the same *and* volume stayed the same, then the cost would remain the same.  I think you should clarify that your calculations are assuming transaction volume doesn't increase.   Yeah, 20MB blocks isn't going to magically fix that.   Could you elaborate on that? Assuming hashrate and price remain constant, increasing blocksize by 20X would cause the price per transaction to go down by roughly 20X as well.   I'm not sure if you can call that foreshadowing; it was a blatant riddle.         Hey, just read my comment again and the replies to it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/396irq/lpt_how_to_remove_get_windows_10_icon_permanently/cs1owl9).   I already answered that in the other thread.   They are in a sense, but then those aren't hard to pick through, it says right in the title of the update. Besides, you can just allow all "important ones", which pretty much is only security updates.   Nobody's asking you to buy it, it's free.   As an American, I'm not sure what this is about but you're so wrong.   Um, bitlocker was around in Win7 as well?   So why not switch back to the beta?   Copy the game files, run DOSBox.   I don't know where you got that 99% figure.  A lot of updates are just security updates, meaning you'll never actually notice any differences. The rest are usually for obscure programs or edge cases, like other languages.  I'd say that less than 5% of updates are even noticeable.   So sex with a poor prostitute is rape?   Hate to be THAT guy (actually I love it), but that should read "my friend and I".   Yes, but how many people would they have working on this? And how well do those people knw bitcoin? And if you generate new addresses, you need to communicate them whenever someone asks, while a single address (or even many static ones) could be shared among followers.  Note that some ransomware bitcoin demanders reused addresses, when that's a much larger problem.   It's rather common for fundraising to just list an address for donations. Otherwise you need to generate a new address on demand, which requires running a server and custom code.   Not flipping a switch is because of electricity.   But How Can Blocks Be Full If Spam Isn't Real   Well deliberately misunderstanding someone to increase outrage is uncool.   I don't think that's how it's supposed to work. Your link contradicts your description.     You're allowed to leave your house.   Should have included a /s   I didn't say it wasn't open source, I even called it legit.  That doesn't mean we can't complain about it. Altcoins are also open source, that doesn't mean they're all good.   Because there's no way quoting the sidebar could be patronizing.   Unless some are reusing addresses, likely for fundraising.   If you write a detailed and convincing blog post with good data, you should be able to get it picked up. If you can pay you can make an actual press release as well.   Let me get this straight: you think it's possible that it is used for terrorism, but if so that fact should be hidden?   Sounds like I've got some fun times ahead. That seems like a good start, thanks.    OP obviously means "Why do I have to pay a fee to you, if I use the pre-built binaries or source code without modifications".  Is that not how other people took it?   How about instead of whining on reddit about it, you do some research and write a report on exactly how much is being raised compared to total volume and other methods of funding, then send that to the relevant people (press release, etc)?   Can you use Multibit HD without paying the fee? If not, that counts as being unable to turn it off without stopping to use the program.  I'm also not sure if the wallet seed is compatible with other wallets.   It would take exactly the same time for mine vs Multibit HD. Besides, for some it will be a matter of principle.   I'm assuming Multibit's build process is well-documented; if not, should be fun to play with and figure it out.   Their funding model is legit. The complaining is legit as well.  Including a "feature" that most users will not want and not allowing it to be turned off (except by forking) is not user-friendly.  It's similar to the uTorrent Bitcoin mining problem in that regard.   Article makes some big conclusions with out really providing any evidence to support them  Welcome to the media.   The (forked) source would also be available, and people could build it themselves. I mean, the same question can be asked for any binary of open source code.  I'm thinking of something akin to Iceweasel, which changes almost nothing about the original code but the name.   I think I'll just host the binaries on Github.   Anyone interested in a fork that just removes this, and I guess changes the name and removes any communication with Multibit servers?   iirc there was testimony that the wallet was found on his computer.  He also agreed that the coins found on his computer were his, when he agreed to the government auctioning them off.   I know some people have done it, definitely for earlier versions of OSX. Haven't kept up with recent developments.   I suggest you enlighten *yourself* by reading the transcript of the trial, which introduced evidence for him ordering them.  The best his defense could do was claim he didn't mean them. No explanation for all the bitcoins paid from his wallet, though.   I don't know.  You're supposed to have the source code. It depends on how it's implemented; if you get some kind of certificate that signs the app, then you probably could sign an app even without the source. If you build it, then upload to Apple to sign, the question is how they know who actually built it.   That's a much weaker claim than OP. Of course, as both nodes and miners need to upgrade, if all nodes upgrade then only (51% of) miners will need to.   As a tumblr user with like 10 blogs and a couple hundred followers, your number is wrong. There are normal people on tumblr who aren't trolling.   There was a post on that recently on the frontpage of Hacker News, try searching for virtualbox there in the last month and see. If I wasn't on mobile I'd do it myself.   That exploit is long fixed, only works on old IOS versions.   Use Virtualbox/VMware.   It takes one guy an hour to change the fork so it only allows 1MB blocks that are compatible with all nodes. If 50% do not want larger blocks, they can upgrade to this fork.  All miners mining 1MB blocks will get orphaned automatically, so there's actually a strong inventive not to mine those.  I don't think you've thought through the incentives here. A miner upgrading to the new 1MB fork is just like a miner staying on the same software if the fork is backwards compatable.   Looks like you'll be able to install custom apps with only an Apple ID now, no dev membership required.   Hold my press, I'm   linky?   51% of miners could easily upgrade to the new version, then enforce 1MB blocks, which would be the same as preventing the fork.   There don't seem to be any new points in that; are we concluding our debate, then?   The world finished, never to start again.   I'm just imagining the guy processing that refund. That's probably a guaranteed audit, right?   Chances are the kind of person who can game the lottery is keeping track anyway.   How much do you have to spend before being considered professional? Since $9 million isn't enough, clearly.   They usually deduct the taxes before giving you the money, so you would file for a $4 million refund?   You will this thread   If you spend $9 million on winning $10 million, do you pay taxes on $10 million or $1 million?   Also, it's not the banks that are suing.   Check out GiveDirectly.   You don't mess with 50% of mining power.   If I mine using the old (current) software, will nodes that upgraded accept that block? If yes, then this "softfork + hardfork" looks exactly the same as "nofork", so in what sense did the network fork at all?   They send it to the exchanges; since their chain is longer, the exchanges are on their chain.  Miners with 51% can enforce a minimum blocksize among many other things.   I don't think it's the same people who agreed that are suing, though.   Because he clearly didn't read past the title, or he'd know they aren't asking for a loan?   Somehow it feels like you didn't read the article    Again, if an exchange is doing that we have larger problems.  	149
 Whaaaat? Really? How much?   I think that sums it up then.   There is one film that can make me weep like a baby no matter when I watch it or who is around. That movie is [Awakenings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099077/), and now that Robin is gone, I fear that movie will be so incredibly sad, that I could not bare it. I fucking loved Robin Williams as an actor, what a fucking tragedy.  EDIT: sorry for cursing.   I just fired up the episode, and yeah it's definitely "won't".   Amazing episode.      Riviere?   Going to be hard trying not to scare old people.      What if you eventually become a homeless Alzheimer's patient?    I'm pretty sure they did yeah.   Message this guy and ask for pictures of the discs and make sure they aren't in terrible shape.  [http://www.ebay.ca/itm/281405011576](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/281405011576)   Man, I bought all 5, and would never dream of selling them. Crazy to see the collection go for that price.   Not sure if the opiates are available unsigned?   How much are you willing to spend?   Would she be allowed to walk under the table that only has two legs in the background?   Zoinks!   Did you sell it to a guy for 40 bucks? Because I bought mine for 40 bucks from a guy who thought weed was better than tool.   Fucking yes they're coming to Calgary. Thank you.   Facebook is blocked at work, can someone copy/paste dates in thread?   Where obtain?   Agreed. Broken city is awesome, but holy fuck is it small.      Might take the trip to Edmonton the next night. I see no other choice.   I know this might be a long shot, but I'm trying to find myself a ticket to the sold out Misery Signals show next month. I cannot believe I missed the sale by this much.  Again, I know this is a stretch, but thought it might be worth a shot. Please let me know if you have a spare ticket for sale, thanks!     dong   I have a fetish for understanding, it gets me off sooo hard.   There seems to be a different fetish question on the front page every week, what gives?

Right? The outro to that song is amazing.   Thank you, I thought so too. Also, I quickly dug up this portfolio, there are soooo many to choose from.      That is awesome.   Dude..   Man, cemetery gates? Are you kidding me?    The great southern trendkill is a fucking beast of an album. That was the one that originally got me into pantera.   I can't imagine anyone else on earth doing vocals for pantera besides Phil.   Agreed.   Daaaaaamn, how have I not noticed this for the past 20 years?   I would eat this.   I too am having a Pantera kind of day. \m/      Pretty sure that's a Metallica shirt.    Agreed.   This is fucking brilliant.      The artist may have turned out to be a mooch, but I don't regret my ocular orifice in the least.   Nice, thanks for this. I was wondering how that happened.      You should definitely post this in /r/bobsburgers. Nice work.   The imgur URL reads "how the fuck" to me.      It's r/Calgary, never comment here.   I remember the controversy that surrounded the band in the media due to their electronic style shift, I was very intrigued.   I received the album from my brother as a gift on my 18th birthday. The night I got it in the mail I had plans to hike to my friends cabin, as we usually did with whatever free time we had. I didn't go anywhere without my discman and a few albums. Of course I brought this one along with me and played it on a continuous loop for the entire trip. It was how our hikes usually were, especially during the cold winter nights when there wasn't much point in talking over the wind, better off keeping your head down and conserving energy.  This story is becoming more of a nostalgia trip for me than anything else, I apologize. Anyways, I'll never forget the moment we got off the main road and headed into the thick bush during the pitch black of the night, and snow falling like crazy. I fire up track one, everything in its right place, and it ended up being one of the most memorable music moments I have, and it sticks with me more than any concert I have ever been to. I instantly fell in love with Kid A, and listened to it on repeat for weeks, if not months.   I'm not sure if it was the pitch black forest, trudging through powdered snow that was still falling through the beam of my flashlight that made the moment so goddamn perfect for that album, or if it was the album that made that moment so goddamn perfect. Whatever it was, it is and probably always will be my favorite Radiohead album.  Good times.  EDIT: I don't think this qualifies me as "old", but I remember it clearly so I thought I'd chime in. Or maybe that's me denying the fact I'm quickly getting old.   Hi.   No worries, good luck!   My experience with this site tells me it'll be back up again within the next couple months.

[If I Had A Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBAzlNJonO8)   Oh yes by, right haun man! Magine.   First the Newfoundlanders wipe out the indigenous people of the island, and now aliens? Sweet Jesus what a bunch of savages.   Good ol dump bears.   When you're from there yeah.   "North" American at least.   Quebec is worse.   I just submitted an update.   **UPDATE**  Friend got back to me, didn't call the police, found this in the same area.  [http://i.imgur.com/dbRGeGd.png](http://i.imgur.com/dbRGeGd.png)   There are no reliable estimates of the total black bear population in North America because of the animals secretive nature, but populations are believed to be about 600,000, with more than 380,000 in Canada. *Population numbers in Newfoundland and Labrador are estimated at 6,000 to 10,000 bears.*  **FTFY**   You obviously haven't hung out at the dump enough.   I'm going to lean towards this explanation. Perhaps the limb in the photo is either charred and/or rotten.   Yeah, I found it rather creepy myself.   Friend went back to Newfoundland, stumbled upon this grizzly sight. He texts me, I say "wtf", then "call the cops". Still waiting to hear back.   Not sure. I told him to call the cops. I'm still trying to figure out whether or not it is in fact human. There are black bears all over the island. Was hoping someone could help identify.   That's what I asked. No response yet.      Where obtain?   Literally my all time favorite movie. Thanks for these, they look great.   Yeah you're probably right. Glad to know there are more albini fans around, people never know who I'm talking about.   Can someone explain to me how the average post in a sub with 2311042 subscribers only manages to top out with 10 upvotes?   I would enjoy this.   I'd be interested in hearing tool work with [Steve Albini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini).   ~~covered in crickets~~   SHAYE LIVES!?!!?   I too like Palms more than Crosses.   Me too!   To be honest, I'm digging the more upbeat sound of the new album for that reason. I usually listen to heavy prog for the most part, so albums like these are a nice break in between. This is of course when I'm not listening to "Get Lucky" on repeat at my 2 year old's request.   I think it's a little more prog than other deftone related projects, could that be why?    Me too.   Different strokes for different folks I guess. Saw them live last year I believe it was, and it was so awesome, especially when they broke out Leviathan material.   It's funny because back in 2003/04 which ever it was, I was browsing a local record store for new music (didn't have a computer or internet at the time), and the cover for Leviathan jumped out at me from across the store. Best impulse buy ever.   [Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Palms/comments/2a5ysg/shortwave_radio/)      That was my initial reaction as well, have had it on repeat for two days now and the more I listen the more I love. Taking a quick Palms break at the moment but will have it on again momentarily.   This new album would be a good place to start.   Leviathan is definitely my #1 as well, this may overtake it with time.   Exactly, I'm with you.   Yeah my bad, the album artwork is pretty awesome. Thanks for linking.   I know this isn't tool related what so ever, but they have opened for them. I thought due to the lack of tool news/content we could discuss related topics. Mods please delete if you feel this doesn't belong here.  I'm just really enjoying "Once More 'Round The Sun", and figured there would be like minded people around these parts.   Ah, I see. Seems legit.   According to who?   I would, but if I parked there overnight I can almost guarantee that I would end up getting a ticket and/or towed. Seems like the parking authority only allows assholes to pull this kind of crap, as long as it's consistent. I like the passive aggressive note under the windshield, or maybe even a chalk outline marking "asshole parking".   EDIT: I forgot I had this, perhaps I should print a couple. [http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png](http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png)   Not yet, was thinking about kicking his muffler off first, and see if that works.   I laughed.   Hi.   I've brought it up with the board, and they will "look into it". Another issue I have with this is, this is our shared visitors lot with "NO OVERNIGHT PARKING". Not sure if you can see it on the sign or not but yeah. The absolute gull of some people. The only time it really becomes an inconvenience is the weekends when parking is scarce, so I try my hardest to look the other way throughout the week, but find it really hard as I pass by him everyday. Thanks for the idea.    I'm not a mod sorry.   Good eye.   It's just faded is all, if the Internet requires further proof, I will atain said proof, simply because you've been my best friend for 20 years.

My amp doesn't have a preamp so I assume if I went with the higher end I would need to pick one up.   Newbie to the audiophile world. Looking to invest in a turntable setup, and was wondering if my current [Onkyo TX-NR609](http://www.eu.onkyo.com/en/products/tx-nr609-35517.html) receiver would be sufficient. Not only am I very happy with its sound (I play 320 kbps MP3's through a PS3) but I am restricted for space in my man cave, investing in a separate receiver would be a challenge.   What would be a decent beginner turntable setup, and how could I operate it through my current receiver? I'd like to keep my budget around the $500 CAD mark, but as always, am willing to weigh my options.  Thanks.   I really liked the live suggestion made by /u/sowr in my original post. The idea that their performance art currently best represents the band really stuck with me. It's a theme of its own when you think about it, a theme which is most relevant.   Again I will reiterate that I am no photoshop expert, and there are probably many around here better suited for the task. I would just really like to see a change from what we currently have.  EDIT: TL;DR The live tool experience best represents the band in my opinion.   [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToolBand/comments/28l35u/sub_theme_of_rtoolband)      Would you be open to this?

That slammed bounce pass was a pearler.   That's disgraceful. Well done.    Yeah but I'd say niggling is less serious than nagging. It's a more playful version of the word.    1. Lebron 2. Kevin Durant 3. dick cheeks (my 2k player)  4. jeremy Lin 5. I'm tired  6. Metta world peace, what a fuckin stupid name 7. Kanye West, is he a basketballer?  8. Falls about laughing  9. There's that knob who runs around trying to intimidate everyone (beats me)  10. I'm late, screw this    Dear person that stole this article wholesale from Gizmag.com, fuck you. At least put a fucking link in.    I was pretty amazed.     He strikes me as a genuinely stupid man.   You're very kind. Here's another I wrote in the same job :  My lebanese wife's shiny locks Sprout from armpits, back, arms and her box. Her pubes are so long And so thick and so strong That she knits herself into her jocks.  You might think it's strange for a man To permit so much hair on her can But it brought us great mirth At our eldest son's birth; He came swinging out just like Tarzan.  I'll confess, though, I'm catching the bug; Even though she's quite ticklish to hug - And the 'stache on her gash Sometimes gives me a rash - It's like rooting a fine persian rug.   It seems I've been gilded -  yippee!   So what does that mean, let me see...   Well it sounds like a scream   For the whole reddit team   But there's bugger all in it for me!   -----  ;)  cheers whoever that was!      No. Not even a little bit.     Here's a 4-stanza mini-epic I threw together on a really boring job site once:  -----  My lesbian friend said "I'm horny,   But fisting's beginning to bore me.   With five fingers up it,   I feel like a Muppet.   I'm sick of my bitch speaking for me."  -----  I replied "the solution is clear.   It's penis you're needin' my dear.   They're built for the job,   Plus they'll fit in your gob   And I happen to have one right here!"   -----  "What luck!" said the lass, "I might screw you.   I've never been that fond of hoo-hoo;   A big pair of tits,   They're my favourite bits,   And most men ain't got 'em - but YOU do!   -----  I was slightly offended, but fark it -   It's not every day I can park it.   Most girls aren't impressed   With my man-booby chest   But it's big in the lesbian market.

That's some Clyde the Glide level floatage.   I think this guy should steer clear of the word 'skynet.'    Awesome! This doesn't mean you can't go enjoy food, it just means you don't have to if you don't feel like it, you can just fuel up and get on with your day.   Or just using them as marks for the actors.   Dear jesus god no no no   Speed triple is the best bike in the whole world ever.    Why would you want to drag race a middleweight triple with a short wheelbase?    Nope.    5-year-old me would probably think I've got a pretty cool life. I review motorcycles and travel the world singing... But I can't help wondering what 70-year-old me will think of me, because I have saved fuck-all cash for that guy.   It felt a little homoerotic, but hey. All for the cause!   Didn't have time to defecate on this one. My wildly puckering anus did munch a decent hole out of the seat leather though.   Yeah that's me. It was a flinch. I thought I was a goner.    Ah... Hey! That's me! AMA. It's midnight here though so I'll answer tomorrow.    Yep.   You'll be glad to know Nick wasn't put off by the whole experience. He had a ball on the back...  ... Because one ball is about all you can fit on that seat...   First two bikes I ever loved were Hondas. I'd just be taking a dump on them because they won't give me bikes to review!    Cheers mate! I'm easily bored, so I try to make stuff fun. :)   Cheers! A bit of a homage to an old Yamaha video I remember from years and years ago.    Honda won't answer my emails... Maybe I should borrow a friend's Honda and take a huge dump on it.      Military industrial complex, the one that's been propping up the floundering American economy for decades.   Absolutely. I'd buy a Blake Griffin autobiography in a second after reading that.    I'm not sure my labrador appreciates food at all either - it's gone in seconds and she's off rooting about in the grass for stray faeces for dessert.   Szekaly I think?    I use a macbook i7 with 12 gb ram, a thunderbolt external monitor and a bunch of thunderbolt drives. I really like fcpx, it took some getting used to but it's very quick for me now, handles DSLR footage like a champion and it's super fast and responsive. Mind you I only really make Web video, it's probably pitched right at my level.    Sums up Wade to me, turns around after the dunk to deliberately step over a guy that wasn't in his way. Tosser.   That or Slam Dump.    For me, it was two things. Firstly every photo I saw on Flickr that I loved seemed to be coming out of the same camera, a full frame. The crops couldn't seem to keep up with the level of detail in sky and cloud areas. I'm not sure if it's dynamic range or what.  Secondly I'd bought the 24-105 lens after trying it on a full frame and didn't realise it wouldn't go as wide on a crop, so I was a bit of a drongo.  At the end if the day I just don't get the same feeling from shots taken on my 7D as I do with those from the 5D2. I'm very happy with the 5d and you can get em pretty cheap right now.    The trouble with wheelying for girls is that by the time you finish the wheelie, you're speeding away from them. So there they stand, wanting desperately to lavish you with hero sex, but not knowing where to post it to.   No comment on the gas. I'm taking that as a yes.  ...aaaaaand as I type that, you're saying "give yourself good quality air to breathe" in my headphones. :P   I sang "this used to be my playground" by Madonna in the delivery room as my son was being born. Midwives and wife were united in their discontent.    Wow, yeah. But Danny McAskill and the Isle of skye are both cheat codes! I imagine it's much easier to film slower stuff than quick motorcycles as well.    That's some shitty drone footage though, I gotta say.    Peak horsepower is one thing, but a supercharged litrebike will smash out some serious torque on the way there. The roadgoing H2 will be fucking quick!   Get some of this goodness into ya: unintended asmr - Thai massage instruction: http://youtu.be/7SMnFQH6kNE   I'm riding a Gen 1 into the ground as my commuter hack as we speak!    That model was notorious for it, yeah. Did you try any of the ivan's gear?    Fair enough, I guess we wait and see.    I have my doubts that this will fully fix it - so many bikes from so many manufacturers come out with that throttle snatch... The MT09 is among the worst, but it seems to be an accepted part of injected bikes these days. I suspect this will improve it but not eradicate it.   Wheel spin seems unlikely.    To each his own, but I've never understood the appeal of these giant twin shock retro nakeds. They feel bargey and awkward to me, compared with the sportier naked bikes, it seems harder to get them to handle and you don't gain that much in comfort. GSX14, CB13, the whole segment just confuses me.    That would be the perfect Nique moment to cast in bronze.   Almost looks like a blackbird tail too.    It will help you get chicks all day bro.    I dunno what you mean, but feel free to have a crack at it!   If they wanna work that hard, they can have us. There's other reasons too - I used to see learners on forums watching other guys' videos and getting fixated on speedo numbers and going out to the same roads to try to match them. Or have people come on and start pissing contests. Better for everyone to have that number disappear.    Plenty of great roads in vic. Do a bunch of miles and work on staying wide on entries for maximum vision. Or head to Broadford and go mad on right handers til they feel great!    So many reasons. Mainly because we didn't have german porn.   	115
 i didn't see it at all and it wasn't tagged as duplicate :( sorry      Today is my day 3. Yesterday I had to catch the gym so i did modified leg day there(max weight squats,max weight deadlifts, bench step ups to backwards lunges).  I'm 5'11 190 lb.s I want to lose lbs so I'm eating at a deficit.    you are a scholar and a gentleman.   youtube has limitations concerning not allowing sponsors to be shown on stream which makes it not very feasible.   you can read more about it at FXOBoss's blog: http://fxoboss.tumblr.com/post/26261398738/fxopen-e-sports-recent-changes   can someone plz paste the text for those of us with the LOL site blocked?   he's talking about the hints that have been bandied around of EG signing form CLG.EU   what happened in the JD match...I left after he held the initial nydus assuming he would win   these are heart of the swarm beta codes :)   doesn't the meal plan have you slightly increase your amount of calories for phase 2?   the supplements are soo expensive bc its really the only way they can sustain a business. Similar to razors/razor blades..you only really need 1 workout regimen(although i will vouch for p90x, insanity, and body beast all being good workout routines)    since its part of a scam/pyramid scheme i stayed far away from it. Also since it doesn't have to be approved by the fda..its basically doesn't have to have any affects. also if you search shakeology scam on google you'll see its literally literred with beachbody coaches with a copy/paste page sayings its not which hides the real research done on it to say it is a scam  tl:dr shakeology is a scam..you are better with a cheaper protien shake   GomTvT was more a part of the format of GSL then anything to do with exceptional terran strength   well he is somebody now :P I think the main problem is both of them are more play by play casters...it would be like tasteless and totalbiscuit casting together..they would miss a lot   the other guy is robin and he won their caster contest. part of the prize for winning was getting to cast a semi final.    i havent found one so far.. sorry :(   there are 3 starcraft streams and 2 Lol streams. plus an eventual shootmania stream. i agree the ipl schedule is confusing   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACs_1mWHUHY here you go   nexus down at 13:00 min mark by EloHell. Thoroughly outplayed Armageddon. Armageddon had smiteless warwick and ashe/nunu bot lane that got destroyed. Well worth watching the VOD's  EDIT: VOD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACs_1mWHUHY   Has anyone figured out a way to keep these twitch commercials from blowing up their speakers without running adblock?   while the zerg goes lol and fungals?   i find the effects of locket to be relatively useless where as randuins can straight up win a team fight. I lot of times i can Sona ult in randuins while exhausting one of the carries to create a free win. where as locket really doesnt do anything(especially late gate where 200 health is meaningless)   i support most games and i rarely get past 2 aura items so sounds like you are doing it right ^.^   have IPL provided links to the samples for us to see/hear?   i assume this is sarcasm? he is participating in the OPEN BRACKET which by definition is open to anyone.   HD free for tonight so enjoy      correct. Montecristo and doa will both be casting the sc2 and LoL coverage for ogn      I would start out playing against bots. you learn mechanics of the game and how champions/items effect the game. buy one champion of each type using the IP you are earning or even play the free champs.   Save most your IP. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages at level 20:  1.)AP RUNE PAGE 2.)AD RUNE PAGE 3.) TOP/SUPPORT Rune Page  then use whatever is left over to buy champions that you have tried out during their free championship week and enjoy. Make sure you buy/learn at least 1 jungler and 1 support REALLY well because thats what you will end up playing a lot as you start playing normals. :D  Itemization can be learned via reading guides/watching streams/figuring out for yourself   ALL OF IT. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages:  1.)AP RUNE PAGE 2.)AD RUNE PAGE 3.) TOP/SUPPORT Rune Page  then use whatever is left over to buy champions that you have tried out during their free championship week and enjoy. Make sure you buy/learn at least 1 jungler and 1 support REALLY well because thats what you will end up playing a lot.   for LoL I'd say Phreak and Rivington are probably your best bet. But a lot of times they will throw LoL keywords around(the same way we say baneling bust, mech comp, etc to explain complicated ideas the will say snowball the lane etc)   you cray cray. he said the are guest   please watch stephano and/or vortix vs mech and rethink your conclusion.    i don't even scout 4 gates any more....i just sit at my bunker and kinda laugh that he even attempted it...and then some protoss does a 3 gate blink stalker build and i bm him to the ground... i hate blink stalkers.   as always your source for spoiler free VOD links: [http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/](http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/)   ...and still losing. Most good zergs know that as soon as the spot mech they should go for infestors,ling , ultra and it will kill the terran and/or trade cost/efficiently   best joke ever. Personally i feel TCP would be the better answer   4.0   which flash app are people using? I can't get anything to show up :(   i do squatz then eat oatz   the MvP mech build linked below   * 1 cc's * 2 * 3 scouting scv/drops * 4 * 5 rax * 6 factory * 7 starports * 8 upgrades/ghost academy * 9 Army Part 2 * 0 Army Part 1   what are these repetition speed and repetition delay settings...cuz i don't know about them....    in plat, my TvT has  been 50% win...my TvP is about 75% win, my TvZ was around 25% bc I was sticking with straight bio comps and would lose to a lot of early busts and late game became difficult to win against a good zerg. I'd said i've won all but 2 of my games against zerg since i went mech. The two i lost were based on me not protecting against counter attacks enough.   here are my thoughts as i watch the replay.  * no bunker at 5 minute mark...a rallied zealot and stalker could kill you straight up right now * The protoss takes both your gas and they come late...consider throwing down a 4th rax here and then taking 3 gas puma style. * bunker ESPECIALLY true since you are taking a fast 3rd * scan when your second orbital finishes to make sure he has expanded...if not you need more b unkers ASAP. also good to know his tech path so you can change your comp. * couple of supply blocks...but decent micro 46 scv's at 10 minute mark...ideal amount is 50. work on that. * you really can't afford 3 starports * at the 15:00 minute mark you are maxed....with 1/0 against his 1/1. and up 80 supply. * please for the love of god at least hot key your entire army on 1 button * the first battle happens at 18 minutes bc your opponent attacked into you with 160 supply...40 supply more than when you first maxed. * I know artosis says when ahead get more ahead...but in the words of Day[9], "sometimes you just go f*cking kill him" * the fight is done...you are still 30 supply up....instead of regrouping you chase him with a small section of your army... * you still win this fight are now double his supply! woohoo! * you do have 80 scv's....a couple too many. next time you get maxed start taking the map and choose a couple scv's and use them in your army for buffer. * 90!!!! scvs. WAY WAY TOO MANY...a good rule of thumb is that as you take your 4th base you probably don't need to make more scv's unless a lot get killed. This might be the fact the lost you this game...over producing workers. * 21 minutes and you are on 2/1....try to make that 3/3. * one emp on the templar = game over. * marauders have more sustain than marines...they can eat a couple of storms and live...need to sprinkle them into your comp late game.       40 supply lead is standard in well macrod tvp...the 40 supply lead is suppose to make up for the lack of strength in out units(similar to how zerg maxes before protoss)   the spoiler tag is their so people can use RES to filter out spoilers. Coming to reddit and expecting not to see scores is like going to ESPN and being shocked that there are sports scores there   I had gone to the gym for the past week and wimped out every time. I sucked up my pride and did my 1st day  Squat:80lbs Bench:100lbs Deadlift:100lbs  5 11, 180lbs skinny/fat never worked out any of these movements before.  Question: I saw an excel spreadsheet the other day that mapped out warmups/progression based on first day workouts. Can some one link it here por favor?   this is the 2nd of the mini-30 for 30 documentaries(basically stories they think are interesting but not enough substance for the full 30 minute-90 minute ESPN treatment) that is being put out to wet appetites for the 2nd season of the full 30 for 30   location buttons over mains mostly and then grab scv   its been shown that if you take a break from school to go after a full time career that your likelihood of actually going to/graduating from college drastically reduces   cool sent you a pm.    yeah..it wasn't caught on camera but he basically amoved his army into sieged up tanks with marine support. Gretorp was showing the small side skirmishes instead.    cool what time?   what time do you go and what workout regimen you doing?   he got 3rd at the latest IEM only losing to MVP iirc. I believe he also beat Forgg and some other credible koreans.   you put the spoiler tag as well as additional automatic spoilers provided by this reddit. Use RES to filter out spoilers if you don't want to see them :)   It depends. My 3rd is usually up before my protoss opponent so i usually work on denying it/dropping the main. If its at the point late game where he is safely on 3 bases and taking a 4th I start to go PF, ghost, Battle Cruiser with light marine support.   yes...last 5 minutes of the game...probably got the same commercial 6 times in a row :(   controlled by govt   I work in the Port Industry. I've got quite a big NDA but what I can say is that I report directly to the CIO of the ports in my state.   my 5 year is very specific and in no way, shape, or form blocks me from getting a future job. Plus my contract came with many benefits(significantly higher pay for a entry level engineer, higher levels of access/responsibility such as my reporting directly to the CIO). In the end I read the contract, processed it against other contracts i was offered(which most had a 3 yr no compete) and determined this one to be the most beneficial to me.   very true...my point was just that a 10 year no compete being in a contract isn't that ridiculous of an idea..whether its legal or not is a separate matter   i really haven't looked into it especially since my likely next employers are not in the port industry. My point is that a 10 yr no compete clause being in a contract could very well be considered normal in the business world and isn't that outrageous. Whether its legal or not i have no clear and really dont care lol   all it says is that i can't work in the port industry....thats not that limiting especially as software engineering can allow you to work in multiple industries. Plus I make bank   I'm not allowed to compete/work with in the same domain as the company I work for. So basically, I'm not allowed to work for a company that contracts out to ports(what i do now) but I can continue to be a software engineer, just in different business sector  EDIT: So to answer your question. I'm allowed to work in separate sector of the very broad software engineering industry. I think I may even be able to work in the port industry so long as I don't work for a competitor of the company I currently work for.   i have a 5 year no compete clause on my contract and I'm just a software engineer. I could easily see 10 yr no compete laws at higher levels.   you overlooked the fact that the protoss was able to have four colossi AND templars with storm. Basically, what i'm saying is your attack came too late. Also, you successfully killed the third so at this point you are ahead. There is nothing wrong with pulling back, getting to 3/3, taking some more bases and continually denying that 3rd and bleeding him dry.    I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask. Especially interested if you have experiences with WestSide For Skinny Bastards and/or SS. I've got some experience with the BeachBody workouts(completed p90x, did a month of Insanity and 2 months of Body Beast) so i can do accountability on that too   yeah but TeamLiquid is blocked by my work while reddit isn't :-/   There use to be a nicely formatted thread done every code s/code a day that would give recaps of the games and let those of us at work know how everything is going..what happened to it? All i saw today was the final results... :(   you do understand sarcasm?   I wouldn't...zerg players need to stop doing the same opening...they can't expect to beat the warhound doing their old builds from heart of the swarm...they need to experiment more.....maybe they should build more BroodLords?    the first time you put real aggression on was the 20ish minute mark...you did a double drop yes but it was relatively ineffective.   You had an early +1 but you don't use it....you can probably delay it to get faster medivacs and/or more units. Having those extra units earlier is really important imo. i would scan the natural to see his army comp and whether i can attack it while simultaneously checking the third...If the third is there i attack...if its not I pull back as he should have colossi coming VERY soon. the drop was relatively ineffective...  really imo its all about delay/punishing the third of a protoss      i actually really like that map too  EDIT:although i wouldn't mind forced cross spawns   diamond league..tired of being ranked top 8 plat  	79
    Take a look at the post, and you'll see that this is exactly my point: The media take a correlation and turn it into a causal relationship without blinking. The argument is in favour of a bit of scientific literacy among science reporters.      Very good point! I think this is a subset or version of the hindsight bias, which is a compilation of several phenomena.    The bit that I am focused on is the recollection of a feeling - the sense of reluctance to get on a plane, for example - and moving from that memory to a belief that "I knew it."   In fact, it seems that we did "knew it". The distortion comes in when we forget that we "knew it" hundreds of other times as well when in fact it didn't happen.            Like every field, mental health has bits of myth and meme strewn through it. One of these is that 15% of people diagnosed with major depression will eventually go on to end their lives. Perhaps you've heard this figure. Is it true?  No. Not true, never was. It's based on bad science, misunderstood statistics, and a field that wants to justify funding by making a problem look even bigger than it already is. Here's a post reviewing the problem.  http://www.psychologysalon.com/2013/10/how-common-is-suicide-in-depression.html        	10
                            I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5053765      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5053741      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5053741      Some of these are the most cringe making videos I've ever seen                  At first I agree but seeing how Amazon has over 70 copies of this book starting at $8.50 it looks like that's how this book is going to end up also.         Have you tried Bien Cuit in downtown Brooklyn. http://biencuit.com/  I met the guy at an auction just before he opened and could tell he was special and I just love his bread. It's crazy good. He bakes European style with dark crusts and a great crumb. I love Sullivan Street in NYC also. I think when it comes to bread you can never have enough.   Thought I stole it at $2.50 but doing some basic research I found out it's not that valuable. I love Norman Rockwell and this book is full of prints and large print outs.      I love Norman Rockwell and I was stoked to grab this for $2.50. I thought I stole it but upon doing some basic research found out it's not that valuable but I love it anyway. It's huge (Diet Coke Can for scale), really very heavy and full of prints. The Flatbread Cookbook is really nice too. I love foccacia bread.      I'm not sure, I've been watching it on and off all day and some of it is interesting if you like WWII stuff. Is it strange that as I'm watching this I keep thinking how cool it would be to have a Call of Duty version of the Battle of the Bulge or be in a tank for the Battle of Kursk.               Bullshit or not it was damm interesting!                                                      Cereal BOWL shaped bathtub. I hate that you can't edit a title and I'm to tired to delete and repost. Thanks for pointing it out.      I was near there that day and decided on getting Pot Stickers and Lo Mein instead. I didn't know they were destroyed in the explosion! My pics or it didn't happen http://imgur.com/a/GE4cW         Check this Secret Tunnel in NYC for the Presidents use http://untappedcities.com/2013/12/24/daily-what-secret-train-platform-underneath-the-waldorf-astoria-hotel-in-nyc/   It looks uncomfortable as anything I have ever seen.         Thanks, nice pics. Are any from the Potus train Cars? If it was cheap enough I would love to find a couple of these types of Rail cars and put two together and make a home on my property in Upstate NY.   Nice, congrats   Found out all this the hard way yesterday. Live in Brooklyn and ran over some debris on the NJ Turnpike coming home from the Microsoft Store in the Paramus Mall which put a hole in the engine. Insurance junked it and now I'm taking public transport everywhere. Decided to visit my relatives in Williamsburg only to discover I have to go through Manhattan and transfer to the J or M. Great. MTA's Trip Finder is not working (first red flag) so the wife and I map it out. Decided to take the Express bus (as we had luggage) into the city and get off at Fulton to catch the J. The express bus decides to take the streets instead of the highway (red flag #2) but finally make it into the city an hour later. Walk to the new Fulton Street Subway stop and many twists and turns and a lot of fucking stairs the J station is roped off, walk back to the A going to West 4th street and transfer there. Get on A going in the wrong direction (with help from a visably frustrated MTA worker whose job it was to help people find their way with all this construction, red flag #3) and end up back in Brooklyn so get off and decide to catch the G train. After waiting 45 minutes, now with a platform full of people we all squeeze into the train as the conductor announces this is not the only G train as there will be another one coming RIGHT behind in about 25 to 30 minutes, everyone laughs and no one gets off. Finally we head out to our guessed at stop, Flushing (having never taken the G before, red flag #4) and finally have to walk along some deserted blocks to get to my father in laws apt only 4 hours after we left and we live in the same boro! It's between $25 and $30 bucks each way by cab, car service, Uber, or Lyft and in calculating it would be as much to lease a new car for a year than go through all this bullshit week in and week out.    No and if you look at the pics it's a really nice tram. I'd love a tram running along the east and West sides of NYC.

Found another cool subreddit I didn't even know was in existence.      Some are my own reposts      A down the road neighbor had this same problem. Old man put up BLINDING lights on the side of his house that faced the neighbors bedroom at night. He kept them on 24/7 and would absolutely not turn them off for any reason. Numerous complaints to the cops came to no avail. She had her sons build a fence that in the middle by the lights is now over two stories tall. For a kicker the son put lights on the ends all pointing at every window of the old guys house and when he called the cops they used his same excuses for the lights. Never piss off a lady with sons.    The eye's! Their following me around the room now!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the movie the baker makes Bavarian Sugar Cookies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnKQo9n7M6Q so around that time I meet a guy who wants to hire me to run his kitchen that he's planning to open in a few months and he asks me if I can make some cookies for his daughters Sweet Sixteen party and I say sure but then he hits me with a request for Bavarian Sugar Cookies from this movie he saw with his daughter the day before the party. I research it online only to find out there IS NO Bavarian Sugar Cookie, it just sounded good to the writer. They had a bakery out in California make some sugar cookies just as a prop for the movie so there was no recipe to follow. So I ended up making large sugar cookies cut like big apples flavored with sour apple schnapps with red icing and white lettering with her name and happy 16 on them. A few months later while with the wife we sat across from Maggie and her little girl (who is cute as a button) on the subway and I asked her if she knew of the "cookie controversy" her movie has created and she said yes, some friends had told her about it and she said she's been asked for the recipe instead of an autograph a couple of times. LOL         I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5007085      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5007057                     I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4996920      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4996874      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4996810         When I posted this I told everybody to look at it while humming the Mission Impossible theme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGSUjuSBt1A and it would get funnier the longer you looked at it.         I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4991201      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4991174      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4991127      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4991089         Here you go, just make with different flavored toppings http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pretzel-bites-recipe   Ok, if your making boxed mac and cheese with the powder mix your going to get what's on the box, a bowl of cheese flavored orange colored soft noodles. Mac and cheese is a classic simple dish that if done well can be amazing and if not done well can still be pretty good. I have a lot of deli's in my neighborhood that have small plastic boxes of the ends of different cheeses cut into squares and the usual mix is cheddar, american, swiss, pepper jack, provolone and munster. It's usually around 4 bucks so if I'm making my mac and cheese I start with one of those.    In a pot of salted water, cook pasta (medium shells are great as they hold the sauce very well) until just al dente, drain and stop the cooking process by rinsing with cold water until the pasta is cooled and set aside.    Butter your baking dish, set aside.  Start with a classic Bechamel Sauce (1 stick salted butter and 2 to 3 cups flour) while stirring cook until roux is golden brown and smells nutty    Add 1 pint of heavy cream ( or milk) slowly while whisking until incorporated    Add piece by piece the cubes of cheeses and whisk until melted and incorporated into the sauce and stir until all the cheeses are added to the sauce.     Remove from heat and stir the finished sauce into the cooked pasta ( this is where you can add whatever you want to the mac and cheese such as pepperoni, chopped, cooked sausage, lobster, crab whatever you want, just fold in gently) then add to buttered baking dish.     The mac and cheese can be served and eaten as it is now but I like the melted cheese on top and the crispy sides and corners that you can only get from finishing it off in the oven.   Sprinkle shredded cheese, breadcrumbs ( I love sliced american cheese) on top of the mac and cheese and place into a preheated 375 degree oven until the topping is crisp or cheese starts to turn brown (15 to 20 minutes)    Remove from oven, let sit for a couple of minutes then serve. Try it this way and let me know how it comes out.    Decent reading list, congrats. Now just find a comfortable spot.   Just because I can't order anything doesn't mean I can't look at the menu. Besides, as a professional baker who has for years been making all kinds of breads, pastry's and assorted cookies, after you go through all the work of making 300 each almost every day for years all you want is a decent hot meal at the end of the day.               Sweet!   Thanks, it's not my description it's theirs. I didn't want to change it if for some reason the link didn't work and somebody wanted to search for it on their own. I got the wife an ice cream maker as a bday present and I'm looking for idea's gearing up for the summer. :)   That's the best one yet!

    We meet on myspace back in  in the beginning of 2008. And I saw her profile pic and said damn she's hot. It was like an artsy black and white pic of her in a bra and jeans. I was talking to my cousin about adding her and that next day got her number and started texting and met up and that's about it. We've been married for 1 year now but have been on and off prior to the wedding in 2013. Still love her and thinks she is as beautiful as the day I saw her. She told me that I looked ugly and different from my profile pic. I assure you my pic did look like me. She is weird.   	2

    980ti isnt going to happen. Why would Nvidia undercut their flagship gpu with the Titan X?   Fuck off grammar natzi.    Why do you post links to dead subs? you think your funny but your not.    was cooper dead after he ejected from his craft? and everything after that was a dream? or was he alive and did he really save mankind? my problem the cooper being dead theory is what about dr brand? shes left to die on that alien planet? or would other humans eventually find her?   There would be no life left on earth.       No one cares if you pre order or not its your money.       sell body parts you don't need?         There should be. Such a stupid move on DC/WB part. Gustin so damn good as the flash.                      The whole sub switch thing. so stupid.                      When I was in Bali I saw a dude taking a piss on the side of the street. this cant be unseen. disgusting.       this will be the last break this season. After this break its a straight run to the season finale.    Instead of Barry revealing his identity to Iris like he did in the alternate timeline in present day he revealed it to Eddy. It seems like time is finding a way to fix what Barry altered. Also in the new promo once again we see Dr wells confronting Cisco but under different circumstances. Maybe this explains why Oliver is wearing league gear because time changed so much that it caused things to change like Oliver accepting the offer to become Ra's.      750ti is not potato tier. An r7 250 is potato tier. thats a decent rig there.    ps4 or Wii U         When I broke my Clavicle back in high school. fuck that was pain.       fuckin casual. why dont you have a robot?      whats your budget?      Furious 8: The Revenge of Helen Mirren               LOL kdramasters, what a joke.    Still not worth it. Also the only reason EA dropped the price is cause so many people refunded the game.             no they just haven't updated their website.                         Can you change my account password again please?                                        I knew that crossovers were now a yearly thing but yea kinda surprising.                   Despite It looking a lot smaller compared to the other MCU films its got a great cast and I think its gonna have a lot of heart in it. I think the audience will really get behind Ant-Man once they see the movie. Sure it might not be a box office hit like Captain America or Iron Man but I think it will do well enough that marvel and the overall fan base wont be disappointed. I know a lot of you don't share this opinion and that's fine but I felt like Ant-Man needed some loving around here seen to many negative threads about it recently.       your work blocks IGN but not Reddit. Sounds like you have a great network administrator. lol   LOL            Anyone know? buddy of mine just picked up resident evil 4/5/6 for a dollar. Could they end up charging him the full price or remove the games from his library?   His spidey senses were tingling.       really? they are already introducing inhumans and that doesnt come out till 2019. Civil War comes out next year and its too early? lol.    The battle between old shield and new? Iron man will side with new shield while captain america sides with Coulsons shield?   Before being interrupted by Caitlin I got the feeling he was going to explain everything like he did in the previous ep just under different circumstances due to the rupture of the time barrier.    Last I heard it booted its first commercial game ocarina of time 3D have we heard anything since?   Would be neat if they mentioned him being on it and teased him on AOS like the week before the show premieres on Netflix. Have coulson mention a masked vigilante going around the streets of New York saving people.    We continue to get ripped off and complain when we have to pay for online multiplayer and complain about how shit our fps is. we're constantly getting poorly developed games especially this gen with the ps4 and xbox one. So why do we continue to support consoles?         You should keep the quadro as a memento of your time together.          So when Joss signed his three year deal with marvel he basically became not only in charge of the avengers for that time but also became a sort of show runner for the MCU helping out other films like Thor 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy when they needed a hand and basically pointed the MCU in the right direction. However now his time is almost up and I'm wondering who will take his place? The Russo Brothers seem like the logical choice at this point but on the side they have the ghost busters to worry about and it would seem like its too much for even two people to worry about. if not the Russo brothers who would you choose to take Whedon's place?            waiting for the inevitable "GTA V delayed to may 14" announcement         They should of kept the scene with Peters dad returning it would of wrapped up the story a bit more.    Le snacks   I get more Karma.             Ikr plus I have another resit I can use if I fail anyway lol.       How did you know? (   )       Is it really that hard to get a debit card? they are so convenient how can you not have one?            Tokyo            "being drunk" good one :)   yea what the hell. Stupid move on their part.              I'm finding it harder and harder to justify having a Netflix account anymore when its so much easier to just torrent stuff that doesn't expire.    she wasn't using it just dropped out of her pocket.    Yea also I heard the hobbit and the Lord of the rings will be available as well.    https://www.facebook.com/NetflixANZ/photos/a.924685260898686.1073741828.833905236643356/935046583195887/?type=1 theater  Maybe the New Zealand version wont be so bad after all.    Does she think hes too dangerous and unpredictable? If that's the reason she could just as easily put some device inside his head like a kill switch if he ever got out of control. Anyone reckon we might see Slade eventually part of the suicide squad on arrow?         So I've been playing basically since release and the game is great but I seem to be getting a point now where Ill start a city, get to the half way point and then just loose motivation to go any further and actually finish the city. I'm not sure why though. Anyone else feeling the same?      Doubt it. If hes leading a team of new avengers. Hell most likely appear at least in infinity war part 1 where may die and Bucky will take his place as Captain America.    Why are reports saying he wont make it out of Age of Ultron? is it just mis direction?         Goosebumps.       Allie's Bread   Dude I've been doing this since primary school. Vegemite and Potato chips ftw!       Hmm ok. well what do you think would be best? a new fan or a hotswap bay?   Heres a few pics of my case. The fan you see near the hard drive doesn't work anymore it hasn't been working for a while but I didn't think it was an issue until I saw my hard drive temps. I have no idea how to remove it because the way the case is designed. Hence why I just want to put a fan underneath the hard drive itself. sorry for the quality of the pics btw I used my ps vita lol. http://imgur.com/a/WaQ1m   So I need to put a 80mm fan underneath my hard drive. My hard drive temps arent ideal. I've seen it as high as 55c while gaming. Slight problem though. I have no where to mount it. would it be ok if I just slid it under the hard drive bay so the fan is blowing air upwards? it would not be screwed into the mother board or anything though it would be loose under the hard drive bay because I have no where to mount it.Would this be ok?      March is slowly coming to an end and the rumors last year indicated that Destiny would launch on PC sometime this month. Anyone heard anything?               I actually laughed out loud. What is that accent? Italian?   because the steam machine also uses AMD. so he wanted to make it as close as possible.    its monthly updates once the final release is out not while its in technical preview.    LOL it does not have a keylogger what a load of bullshit.                   your joking right?      Bored.    Open Office            I'm starting to think that maybe there's something to those downgrade rumors. No DX12 support are you fucking serious?          Wheres my KARMA Bitch!            Anyone else agree?   who else thought the Anaglyph 3D movies were really cool back in the day? I'm talking about Spykids 3D and Sharkboy and lava girl. Call me old fashioned and this maybe the nostalgia talking but I think the Anaglyph 3D is better than the Real3D.   If you did not tear up while watching this then you have no soul!   Personally I've never been interested into the Dark/Demon Souls type games and from the trailers BloodBorne doesn't do much for me ether. So tell me why should I be excited for this game?      I understand the episode basically retconned itself at the end, obviously some effects of barry time traveling will play into next episiode but I'm still a bit confused on if this is a glimpse into the future or just a possible out come due to barry messing with time.                So what do you guys think, should there be jedi in the game?      No way I'm watching them to make sure theirs no Jar Jar. If I even see a hint of Jar Jar I'm not watching.    They probably got the special confused with S4. S4 will film later this year once Benedict has filmed Doctor Strange which starts filming May.   Sherlocks probably high on drugs. Watson walks in and finds him stoned out of his mind mumbling a bunch of random words ends up telling some random story in Victorian London. Watson proably bitch slaps sherlock at the end to wake up him.       And even then their "bad ones" are still above average and rather enjoyable films. I.E Thor 2, First Avenger etc   $800 for a 680 which is now 2 generations old. It should be a lot cheaper than that.    As far as I know. And who says Nvidia will even release a 980ti this gen? why would they when the Titan X is their new flagship card.    Nice typo Mabel.     	200
 Aww, thanks!   Thank you!   Damn, number 19 should be out breaking hearts, not fighting wars.   I appreciate your enthusiasm and support, but I think you should be careful about making broad, sweeping statements about either gender. Both genders have experienced hardship and unfairness. And while the individuals in our situations were acting rudely, they do not portray the definitive character of their gender; they were simply being jerks.  	4

    The only thing that could make this better is if it was a perfectly looping gif..............      So, I started deving for DK1 using the hardware my school had one semester. When I tried to continue the project over the summer without access to the hardware, I found there was nothing like what you mentioned. If this has changed now (which it seems it has as of December 2014) then obviously that's good, but as a product that will just be starting out, it's important to do that from the beginning.   I am now more excited than ever to start developing games and apps on your platform. Thank you for being awesome!   This excites me way too much :D If these golden tickets are true, count me in!   One of my biggest gripes with Oculus is the lack of an emulator for development. Is this something you guys are looking into? I really like developing for hardware like this, but sometimes the costs and limited quantities make it tough.    With the first iteration of whatever you guys are making at Magic Leap, how easily will developers be able to access tools to develop for it?   Don't forget, cocoa is also a fruit.  So you'd basically be drinking a smoothie..........     	10
 But, but.. ?   All the money in the world will not help. The gratification from your inheritance will only last for a while. Eventually, you will become accustomed to the affordances if your inherited wealth. At which point you will begin to subconsciously seek help. This leads to a number of issues which you will actively self deny such as alcohol, sexual deviancy, drugs, etc.  There best thing you can do for yourself is to walk away from this person and their wealth. Or take the wealth and dedicate it to people in need, such as people who may or may not be suffering from the same advise you had to go through. This will bring you things that all the money in the world couldn't buy: genuine peace and happiness.   Your argument defies statistical facts.    You know, in a world where there was no war, men and women will still have their respective roles. This is just simple division of labor and specialization that has taken form over thousands of years. The current popular 'fad' can not simply ignore biological constraints and scientific facts you know...   Do you have any reference for this. This fact escapes very many people.   I'm equally sorry, the greater good argument is the very foundation of society. Not your opinion or decision to make i'm afraid.    This right here. This is a very brilliantly stated fact. Bernie Sanders is genuine. Hilary is a product. The exact more of the same.   If Bernie Sanders should win, it will be because more and more people are getting their information independently of the establishment media using social media instead. Somehow this may be a round about way to kill citizens united. Actually, ironically, citizens united can just about force the citizens to actually unite ...    If something shouldn't be done, then what is the logical reasoning for allowing it? If we determine that this is detrimental to women in the long run, why allow it?  It is not in the larger society's best interest and by that standard should not be allowed. Isn't this the 'greater good' argument?   This actually identifies a very fundamental thing. A bread knife is just that. Its edges are designed to cut bread. Regardless of how 'hard' or strong it is, the edges are not the same as those used to cut steel. Neither are they the same material or density. Sure, you can go ahead but you will surely damage said knife. That was the point.   This is an all too familiar response from those who have been 'capable' as you say:   "I'm a woman and a former Marine. My body is a wasteland of chronic pain, stress injuries, nerve damage, arthritic joints...this isn't emphasized enough. Sure, I did it. I kept up with the big boys, but the cost was too high. And I'm one of the ones that lasted a full,. 4 year enlistment. Attrition once women simply pass through training is extraordinary due to stress fractures, especially in the feet, legs. shoulders and back. It's one thing to last 3 to 6 months of brutal training, it's another to endure the lifestyle."   No.  My point is that you can effectively use a tool (or body) in a manner in which it wasn't designed. This will result in damaging the tool so that it is no longer retains its original characteristics, which in turn prevents it from performing its original function. A woman will have to become a man and give up her feminine qualities and abilities in order to achieve that. Think of the abilities of woman's physical body, not the least of which is the ability to conceive a child.   The nature of the activity always shapes the form, so the form should clearly indicate the nature of the activity.   "What informs your belief that if a woman is capable of completing the requirements of a job that they aren't allowed to do said job?" - Physical differences. Male and female bodies are fundamentally different. Here is my reasoning:  Man is different from woman. Even if we are clueless as to why and for what reason, the same way you can identify the purpose and function of a tool by the manner in which it is constructed, so too can we determine the proper function and purpose of the two sexes. The body of a man is fundamentally stronger (physically) than that of a woman. This is backed up by every single scientific inquiry regarding the anatomy of the body and internal biology. From ~45% greater bone density, body composition, prevalent hormones (testosterone vs. estrogen), we find consistently one is more delicate and sensitive while the other is more coarse and hardened.  This doesn't make one better than the other, it just means that their activities must be different. In the same way that using a blade meant for cutting bread to cut steel, as opposed to using a steel-cutting blade, will permanently damage the blade. The result is that it is unable to cut steel, and this misuse damages the blade and renders it incapable of cutting bread properly. This mis-adventure results in the blade becoming completely useless for anything productive. This is the end result of this current fad of women abandoning and devaluing what is feminine in the mania for wanting to become men.  Understand that men and women are equal, but understand it correctly. They are equal in value in the natural (nature) sense. This means that their activity (masculine and feminine) are of equal importance and therefore, life would come to a grinding halt if one or the other were to become distorted or missing. But men and women are not equivalent. They can not be interchanged just because we so desire. We are subject to the natural laws that govern this world (e.g. gravity) and going against them is not advisable, and neither will it end well.   What informs your belief that women and men are physically equal and capable of achieving the same thing?   But you have to wonder: "what then are we fighting to protect?" If not the women and children, what?      Yay!   TL;DR?   Jupiter/Thor?   There are proponents in favor of dissociating 'gender identity' and sexual designation of male vs. female. They argue that gender identity is independent of physical organs but instead a product of the mind. I do not agree with understanding at all. My point is that the days of 'common' sense conclusions as it were, are over. ...    The questions I have is why curriculum is not decided by the education community and instead by politicians.   Makes you wonder what else you have been so sure of and have been completely ignorantly doing wrong your entire life without a clue. What made you ignore your instinctive reaction to 'ignore' and actually watch the video?

It is a measure of interest or importance of the discussion is it not? This is not new, this is actually one of many such articles and news reports that are only increasing in frequency these days. I think it is good fodder for debate/discussion. Listen to what/how others reason about the issue and not just stick to one side of the argument or the other 'just because'.   This is an actual NPR article. NPR doesn't make things up. Listen to the interview.       Stayin aliiiiiiiiive!   I've read that this is actually a good thing since a lot of people get the opportunity to gain experience they would otherwise never have, and there is no risk to the employer in case the temp sucked.    I meant that many hold this view. And in discussing the flaws, it will help many break their illogical biases. At least that is the objective of every discussion.   It is time for the father to bond with the new born as well as to help care for it. These only appear odd because the laws here are very very skewed. In Europe and other parts of the world, maternity leave extend up to several months.   Father here. Also from a different culture. I can't help but feel that there is a very negative psychological consequence resulting from taking this important time away. I cannot imagine that as a society we expect a woman, after childbirth, to resume work the following business day. That this even exists at all is MIND BOGGLING.    Black guy here. This doesn't actually work in this case. There are many within the black community, as I'm sure I'd the case in other racial communities, who feel there are 'cultural' norms that bed to go. So, no, it's not so much racist as it is an unfair blanket statement.   There differentiator, I think, is knowing this very fact and constantly revising your instinctive or 'gut' reactions.   Upvote is a measure of importance of discourse and topic and not a measure of agreement. So you can an should actually upvote something you disagree with because you feel it's worth discussing it bringing peoples' attention to.   I had a friend who murdered all the chicks of this one chicken. She charged at him trying to protect our revenge her young but he ripped her head off if I remember correctly. Yes, I never forgot seeing this and making s mental note never to cross him.   In my experience, you don't pre 'think' what you're going to say. Just 'feel ' it. It will start to flow when you put pen to paper based on how you feel and what you want her to know. It may take a few tries but that's the best way to speak your heart.  	37
 Will I be able to do waking cycles with characters?   So can I make boids walk in rows and formations, then interact with other boids and particles like in LotR.     I model in blender. Must I uv map in blender as well? Or can I uv/box map in Element 3d and then texture the model all inside AE?   And what sort of solution is there?   I'm trying to do a lotr scale battle. How do I get them to walk? Also, is there a limit to boids? I want to render several thousands battling several thousands.      I'm just so worried about vfx for my films.   Meaning it will expire?     Does it have all the features? I see these all the time.      Basically I want to do a large scale battle sequence. Maybe a few thousand agents fighting each other   Damn that is pricey! Maybe can I just create multiple simulations and then composite them later?   Massive software? I noticed you capitalized Massive so is that a crowd simulation software?     I'm thinking of thousands of agents. I have a powerful computer.       Is it possible?      God dammit I just want a dirt cheap/used version of autodesk maya.   What does that mean?   Original equipment manufacturer. Meaning the software comes without the fancy box. Meaning it is sold at a significantly lower price.   Appon.us sells OEM VERSIONS of autodesk software at low prices. I for one, think it's legit.      Why does it look shady?      Appon.us      Yes or no?     I wanna composite green screen actors into a cgi matte as well as add cgi characters. The thing is I'm new. So give me some tips and tutorials? I have element 3d, by the way, so just consider that.    Go easy now, I consider myself a rookie. http://imgur.com/budI8hC   http://imgur.com/kAENjra this is what they look like. I am having trouble bringing out the mouth? What brush do I use? How can I sculpt the lips? Any tips or tricks?     Also, I read somewhere that after Armegeddon, God will purify all those in hell and take them from hell, leaving only the demons and satan? Is all this true?     I sculpted this head a used a uv sphere to make the back of the head. It looks great from the front considering im a first time sculpter: http://imgur.com/hgZuR4a But on the side there is noticeable "pinching": http://imgur.com/5UDuVmd     I've made a basemesh and every time I want to use it I don't want to save that as the basemesh since I want to be able to use that one basemesh for multiple characters. What could I do?     I already tried the whole "click on chose the best quality for videos in your youtube account settings!" Doesn't work. I have amazing Internet with multiple boosters, so it's not connection.    Yeah. Why do we take our children to see the latest flick? Why do teens flock to movies like Guardians of The Galaxy and 2014's TMNT? Why do we watch movies? Why do people care? The answer is the reason why we make a living out of this. So, I ask again, why do humans watch movies?   I have both, and am looking to create photorealistic renders, do I have enough?      In terms of photorealistic rendering?      Deus ex machina? As in the god? Can you elaborate?     I'm very intermediate at modeling. I'm just about a pro. I can texture and UV map like nothing. But sculpting, oh sculpting, I just can't!     Where are some tutorials to get me started? All i can find are tutorials introducing the tools, I want a tutorial which shows me how to sculpt something like a character.  Please help, r/ blender?     I came up with a story about aliens who create the human race, but have to fight hostile aliens to do so because said hostile aliens want to prevent them from creating humans due to humans destructiveness which might lead to their downfall.     The thing is, this story is pretty generic. What to you scifi readers and viewers, makes a story outstanding?          X+y+z=15 2x-y+3z=-15 -x-y+z=-7 (Hint: solve for z and get two equations to have x and y only.)   I don't know how to use this with subsitution. The best way would to. E to use process of elimination.   Thank you so MUCH  	46
 Yeah, FSU fans have experience with OK fans who are able to travel to an away game in Tallahassee; so typically the older, wealthier, and more hospitable fans.  I went to that game and every OK fan was awesome and really nice.   Yep, with UVA and Michigan being really close behind them.   Nah, it's even worse if you just started working out because you can't really push yourself *that* hard the first month. 20 pounds your first two months is straight up impossible, and he's probably greatly exaggerating.   I would say Rondo is, most generously, the 7th best point guard in the league.   His TS% is awful, because he can't make free throws or shoot with any real range, and that's not only a huge liability in the late game, but it puts him altogether in the bottom quartile of all point guards in the league in scoring ability.   His off the ball defense is not good (it's not awful, but it's not a redeeming quality for him), and he often makes plays that are more likely to get him an assist than will actually help his team.  CP3, Rose, Westbrook, Irving, Curry, and Parker are unequivocally better than he is right now. I would say he's in a tier with Jrue Holiday, Rubio, and John Wall (might not be better than him yet, but will probably be eventually); and Deron Williams and Steve Nash (might not be better than him anymore, but definitely was in recent history).  I think 8th-10th is just right for him.    I upvoted you- but could you add an explanation? Opinions are always better when you have a corresponding justification.   Let's have a thread where people don't downvote things because they disagree with them. I want to hear people's thoughts and thought processes that seem to go against the grain of the general consensus.   /r/FWEPP    Similar to you- the reformed/arminian debate was a semi-hot topic of discussion in my ministry my sophomore year of college. I (unwittingly) led the arminian side of the debate, arguing that it was incompatible with free will.    Someone finally asked me if I knew the scriptural inspiration for reformed theology, I admitted I didn't. They  challenged me to read "What Is Reformed Theology?" by R.C. Sproul, and so I did. I did a complete 180 over the course of the two days that I read that book; and a week later I read it a second time. Haven't looked back since.    Title says it all- I need a pair and I'm looking to do so on a pretty tight budget.   If you're on TLS- reading arrow's/scribe's guides probably have a much much much better correlation with law school success than LSAT score, haha. Either way, good luck to you.    The other thing I've thought about is attending a school where I am over-qualified should help with academic success. Especially with a curve. I understand a lot of it is effort and hustle, but competing against people with a 155 LSAT is way different than a 165 LSAT. Not to make the test everything, but I think its safe to say in general a higher LSAT usually means smarter. Am I wrong to think that I would have a better shot at success at the lower ranked school?    Yes. You're completely wrong. The correlation between success in LS and LSAT score is weak enough that if you're within 5-6 points of the median then you have no real advantage the rest of the field at finishing near the top of your class.    A good rule of thumb: don't go to a school where you're not comfortable with the idea of being median.   Confirmed: I am not good enough at words to write sports articles either.    Wait, what am I missing?   /r/FWEPP    Kids- MGMT   All My Friend- LCD Soundsystem   Maps- Yeah Yeah Yeahs   Hey Yah- Outkast   All These Things That I've Done- The Killers   Stan, Lose Yourself- Eminem   Rehab- Amy Winehouse   Last Nite- The Strokes (basically our generation's *blitzkrieg bop*   Gold digger- Kanye   99 Problems- JayZ   Wake Up- Arcade Fire   Clocks- Coldplay   Seven Nation Army- The White Stripes   Are You Gonna Be My Girl- Jet   I've decided to start dedicating serious time to learning how to program with literally no background knowledge of any kind coming in save for some introductory research I've done. I'm a blank slate, and I'm especially interested in website development.  My two questions are:    1. Starting from absolute scratch, what all do I need to learn to get to the point where I can be good enough to be comfortable designing websites for other people e.g. HTML, JavaScript? (that's not my main goal, but I think this is a good litmus test for proficiency).   2. In what order should I be learning them?   Also, lol at Nowitzki and Dwight being 'might'.   Just out of curiosity- would you consider Yaeger a good review course?   Links to brands?   GA   Not for my state, there's only a flat accounting and business credit hour requirement. I'm in law school and have taken a lot of tax classes which count for the accounting credit requirement, I have four FAR classes from undergrad, so I feel comfortable with those, but auditing slipped through the cracks.   I'm doing a non-traditional route to the CPA exam, being a finance major instead of accounting. I meet the education requirements to take the test, but I've never taken an auditing class before.   Is the auditing section learnable to pass with a good review/prep materials alone? Will it be *significantly* more difficult? Would you advise any sort of supplementary material to get a more grounded education first?  Thanks for your help in advance.   I actually love and would buy that hoodie with the classic paintings on it. Any idea where it's sold?   Thing here same to say exactly the came.   And Rashard was great for the 07-08/08-09 season.   If by "liberal arts hipster" you mean "anyone who has never learned how confidence intervals in statistical hypothesis tests work," then yeah. And no, he's not right, even in a technical sense.   "How often?"  "Everyone"   As much as we need a new backcourt, I'd much rather have Noel's defense to compensate for Vuc and Nicholson who are both lacking in that area.   I also think I'm in the minority for not loving Smart.   7.5pts 5.6rbs in 25mpg in February- probably on par with what the Cavs thought he could do as a rookie. I wouldn't be disappointed.    Yep. The most exciting thing to me is that Mo has shown that he has the athleticism and the mind to be *very* good on defense. He can eat up space like crazy and will be a menace on the perimeter in the next 2-3 years. Right now the Magic are playing terribly on defense; Nicholson is doing okay by rookie standards (still lost at times, but as he learns the game better he should get to 'respectable' territory), however Vuc is concerning - outside of his rebound-hawking abilities he's in the bottom tier of the league in defending post moves and contesting shots at the rim. But even with that in mind, both of them have shown very polished offensive games for young players, and our 3+ year future looks bright.   There really isn't another reasonable answer to this question.   I don't actually know, but if I had to guess, it'd be because if Harden won MVP it would be on land and not on water :P   There is no chance on God's green earth Harden wins MVP this year.   Lame. Do you know why?   Nope. Fiduciary relationships are strictly between the management and the corporation.   What do you think would be the best deals for the Magic? Post your hypotheticals here.   after fiddling around for a little bit, I came up with this:   http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b3obtzr   And not included- Minnesota would give us their first round pick.  Minnesota isn't in a rebuilding phase- so I think they'd be okay letting go of Ridnour, now that Rubio is back and they still have Shved and JJB; and Derrick Williams who is not thriving in their system but could still develop into a pretty solid player. This would be a looking-to-next-season move for them with a healthy Love/Pek/Smith trio making a killer frontcourt for Rubio to dish to.  The Hawks are largely looking to get rid of Smith somehow. JJ fills an immediate need created by the season ending injury of Lou Williams, and they would have the ability to pick which one they wanted during the summer- either letting JJ go for the cap space they crave to sign a maxFA, or resigning him and trading away Lou; and would also get a backcourt player with a ton of upside for much cheaper, and an expiring contract in McRoberts to free up cap space.  Most importantly- for us: we would get a quality guard to make up playing time; partially over the awful Ish, and partially for the hole in our rotation JJ leaves; the rest of would be filled in by Korver who gives us the outside shooting JJ had for us. Korver and Aflallo would compliment each other well as wings, and McRoberts was in the dog house anyways so losing him is not a big deal. Our team would only be slightly worse off as a result of this trade, which is okay considering our focus is on draft position at this point anyways.   Most attractively- we would get Minnesota's draft pick. Currently they're 8th in the lottery, which is high enough to make losing JJ really worth it. Granted, they do currently owe their 1st round draft pick to Phoenix, but it's top-13 protected, and they would have to pass where Portland is right now (3.5 games behind), so assuming we traded for the remainder of those draft rights it'd be a safe bet we get it.   We'd have patched together a replacement lineup without JJ so as not to be *completely* awful in the backcourt; and we'd have our top-10 pick we were looking to get for him.    Nah, they were acting without an apparent conflict of interest; so the burden of proof to even make it past summary judgment is incredibly high. The elements are a pretty complex. See-  http://www.pli.edu/product_files/booksamples/595_sample7.pdf     his has to be fucking illegal  You'd have to know a *LOT* more of the facts than what we have - but this sounds like could possibly be a breach of fiduciary duty (duty of loyalty, duty of care, bad faith etc.); in which case the minority owners could bring a derivative suit, or the new owners could sue under a direct suit.  /lawschool   What's hilarious how ridiculously everyone is over-reacting too. Is he a mentally weak partial-headcase who whines and needs a confident coach to keep in check? Sure.   Will he, if he has a good year next year by his standards, be one of the three-to-five most valuable players in league, and capable of being the 2nd best or co-best player on a championship team? Absolutely.   People seem to remember recently how much of a pain he's been on the Lakers, but forget that he was an MVP runner up two years ago with a serious argument to win it; or how he led a team to the finals over the 66 win Cavs with Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis as options 2a and 2b, and Rafer Alston running the offense. Fans who say they're honestly not interested in signing him are downright crazy.   Fab Melo will be the steal of the draft   Whoever drafts MKG will make the playoffs in the 2012-2013 season   Austin Rivers will make 6th man of the year at least once in his career   Jared Sullinger will fail as a pro   Jeremy Lamb will have the best NBA career   Charlotte will draft Andre Drummond   Barnes will win ROY   Anthony Davis will need time to develop  Those were some of the most shockingly bad predictions I've ever seen.   Let's go improving our lottery odds!!   Yeah!   Yep; looking at their professional careers (i.e. not Maravich's college stats) Wade has already had both a longer career (in terms of total number of games), a higher peak (2006 finals; 2009 in general), and overall statistical superiority in a time where stats aren't nearly as easy to come by (Maravich played half his career pre-merger, and in an era where you were getting an extra 15-20 plays a game).  It's no contest IMO.   Eh, I like the spirit of the idea, but I think a Volcker Rule with more teeth and fewer exceptions would be more on point to begin with the modern banking market; considering Glass-Steagall, even when it wasn't repealed, was being whittled down to a formality by complex bank structures up into the 90's.    I like the way you think.   Damn. Good point. Then replace Georgia with "some other SEC team".   Jameis Winston, our stud rookie QB in the wings, throws up RGIII type numbers. We return just about our entire WR, and OL, and 2/3rds of our rock-solid running game. Losing James Coley at OC wasn't a big deal because Jimbo ran the offense anyways. Collectively we break the offensive records we were setting last year, and have one of the best offenses the nation.  Defensively: despite losing three DE's and a CB who will go in the first 2 rounds of the draft, our crazy depth shines. Young guns Mario Edwards, Goldman, Jernigan, and Newberry rise up- we maintain one of the best defensive lines in the nation; and we already return all of our elite-level secondary from last year except Xavier Rhodes- whose spot sensational freshman Ronald Darby fills seamlessly. Despite losing our defensive coordinator and all-around mastermind Mark Stoops to Kentucky, Jeremy Pruitt brings the Alabama grit with him and our defense remains one of the best in the nation.  With one of the three or four best defenses in the nation, and one of the top offenses in the nation we have the talent to contend for a national title - and our coach Jimbo overcomes the coaching hump he hasn't been able to get over before - where we actually win all the games we're supposed to win.   After an 8-0 start capped off by a road win at Clemson, who was at that point undefeated and ranked 6th, we are vaulted to top-3 in the rankings. Heading into the final game of the season an undefeated FSU embarrasses #2 ranked (and undefeated) Florida to make the perfect regular season. Then it's just a matter of crushing a respectable 9-3 VT team in the ACC championship and we're off to the national championship.  In the NC game, we upset #1 ranked Georgia and get our ultimate revenge on Mark Richt for screwing us in the 2000 NCG and claim our re-emergent ascendancy to being one of the elite programs in college football for years to come.   What emulator do you have for a PS2? I've looked and haven't found any good ones.   Also, Lillard is currently one of the worst defensive players in the league, and Billups in his prime was one of the best perimeter defenders at PG in the league. That's something you really can't ignore when comparing the two.    Orlando Magic in 2008 = no one ever?   Let's not forget what league we're talking about.   Fuck the Bobcats!   *the rivalry lives on*   Well we'd have to trade him this year because he's going to be a FA when the season ends and he simply signs with another team. If you meant trade him this year for a lottery pick next year... IIRC there are rules against trading unprotected first rounders for future years, but I could be wrong about that.   They're public, but I've never considered them a 'state university'.    Yep; I'm 6'2 150. I'm also a distance runner, so it's unlikely to change, no matter how much I eat (and I do eat- a LOT).   Yep.  Based on what Nicholson has done as a rookie, and what Vuc is doing now as a sophomore, I'm quite happy with them being the frontcourt of our future provided they both get better defensively. Vuc needs to get smarter about where to be to clog the paint, put on some more weight so he can bang better down low, and get better at defending against bigs in the post; Nicholson just makes a ton of rookie mistakes- which makes sense because he's a rookie).    They're both playing well beyond their age offensively, and they could very well be 3 years away from being the best defensive rebound hawking duo in the league.  Mo Harkless is scared out of his mind to shoot, and is bad about deferring to other players. The bright side is that he's showing some very solid flashes of defensive prowess, he can straight up cover space and make things difficult on the perimeter. Best case scenario I could see him have Iguodala-level defense as a SF. He's also the fourth youngest player in the NBA, and he missed all of summer league and the preseason injured, so he might be the least-experienced player in the NBA right now. I don't know if he'll develop into a long-term starter, but I'd like to see him get a year or two before we make a decision. Adding to that- I really don't see Shabazz being worth a top-3 pick. Maybe if Turk was still our starting SF it would be worth the risk- but I'd rather not use the pick here with Mo's potential already waiting on the depth chart.  For those reasons, I think our biggest need is going to be a guard. I don't think there's a point guard worth drafting with our pick, which is likely to be top-3. I'm really low on Smart, he has a lot of intangibles that people love, but shoot-first point guards who can't shoot very well scare me. Too much bust potential there.  We *could* go for another big, and try and develop a killer rotation. Noel would bring some great (much needed) defense in the paint, but unless we luck into the top pick (or possibly the second) we probably won't have a chance to get him. Anthony Bennett could be great- but the fact that he's even smaller than Nicholson scares me, and their skillset seems superfluous.  McLemore is not only the best choice here by deduction of what we need the most, but he's probably right with (or slightly above) Noel for 'most star potential' of any player this draft. And what we really need from this draft is a star. I think we're going to trade JJ before the deadline, and DeQuan Jones is *not* a long term solution at SG.   My pie-in-the-sky dream scenario looks something like this: we trade JJ and somehow get a top-10 pick out of it. We then draft McLemore and Michael Carter-Williams... Fast forward four years... Vuc, who is already one of the best rebounders in the league, gets his defensive act together, and comes close to replacing the Dwight-shaped-hole in our team. Nicholson has the skillset to be a middle-class man's Lamarcus Aldridge, or heck, he might just be the next Lamarcus Aldridge. Mo *could* become a better-rebounding-worse-passing Iguodala, though right now this is the biggest leap of player development faith I'm making. McLemore could seriously be the next Ray Allen; and becomes our de facto high-end-elite-team-leader that you need to win a championship. Michael Carter-Williams is a true pass-first point guard (which is great because he'll be playing with 3.5 very offensively talented other starters as previously mentioned), and has the size and athleticism to be a menace on both ends of the floor; think Jose Calderon meets Rajon Rondo.  If our five starters are elite - elite - very good - very good - pretty good; then we have a team with a bona fide shot at a championship again. Remember, we made the finals against a 66 win Lebron team with Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Courtney Lee, and Rafer Alston as 4/5's of our starting lineup.  Odds of this happening? Astronomically small. But a fan can dream.   You must have missed the "/skip" at the end of my post.   Lebron James:   1. Isn't in the top-3 in the NBA in any major statistical category   2. Is averaging his 2nd lowest FTA season of his career, and second lowest FT% of his career   3. 2nd lowest apg since 2007   4. Only .3 more than his lowest ppg since his rookie season   5. Shooting a measly 42.1%*   6. career low FGA  Clearly the dude is falling off the bandwagon. /skip  *only includes 3pt attempts   Ha, I was also an FSU grad, so I try to remember the worst in Gators.   Also- depending on how we define the south- UVA, and UNC are all much better state schools.   Vandy or Duke I'm guessing... although I've met UF grads who like to refer to themselves that way. Don't ask me why.   2018, I can feel it coming.   Number of players to average 20ppg for a season:   00-01: 27   01-02: 26   03-04: 22   04-05: 26   05-06: 28   06-07: 26   07-08: 31   08-09: 27   09-10: 19   10-11: 21   11-12: 15   12-13: 11 at this point in the season, and that number *could* be below 10 before the season ends.   Do you think this is just a statistical anomaly?    On the flipside though- we overpaid Rashard by having Otis Smith (being the GM he was) bid against himself, and he was averaging 22.4/6.6 when we signed him. VC was averaging 20/5/5 when we signed him. The fact that both those guys regressed terribly while on our team is more a reflection of bad luck than it is our inability to grab tier-1 FA's.   I think you're underestimating our ability to sign non-mvp-contending all-star FA's and here's why: good players will gravitate towards winning championships more than anything else. e.g. Brooklyn may be more tantalizing than Orlando to D-Will, no question, but it's not nearly as tantalizing as the opportunity to be the floor general for a championship team.    We're definitely not going to lure Kevin Durant anytime soon- but remember, in the last couple of years we've managed to grab Rashard Lewis, Vince Carter, and even before that Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill. Those were all big names coming to Orlando. I think if we can get to a 50-52 win season with a group of young guys, we could lure someone in the caliber of Deron Williams i.e. someone good enough to be 2nd fiddle on a championship team.   I agree that patience is definitely a virtue now, which is why I don't think we should be signing anyone to a max contract until 2016. Just like in 2004-2006 we drafted Dwight, Jameer, JJ, and Fran (lol) first, and let them develop before we went for Turk and Lewis. I think that cycle of drafting good talent, letting them develop, and then once they're good enough that we're not going to be seriously building from the draft anymore- start signing the rest of the pieces we need through FA to get us up into championship territory.   I honestly don't love afflalo, and I'd be okay if we traded him at some point. I think between the three guys I mentioned above can be 3 pieces of a championship team. If we can draft three more in the next two years (here's hoping to get a good draft pick for JJ), and then sign two more down the road (an x-factor to get us into contender territory, like Rashard was) then we can have everything in place for a championship window 2018-2020.   Excluding the first episode. What episode do you think is at its wittiest, delivering the impeccable and hilarious humor that makes the show so great?   Like any other team, the Magic have one goal right now- to build a championship team. I can see us being able to attract a high-end player through FA, but despite the Devose ownership groups deep pockets were never going to be the Lakers; and like most teams were going to need to have a best-case-scenario play out i.e. nailing our next two drafts and having the guys on our team really develop well. But first, an inventory: we thought we were going to be barren this year, and while are pretty bad, we have a lot more hope than I think anyone thought going into this season. I have barely seen Kyle OQuinn play, and I dont think Etwaun Moore is going to become anything special, so Ill focus on the three players I think we can best build around.  Vucevic has been a revelation, since January when he started getting used to his minutes and role with the team- hes averaged 14.4 points, 13 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks in 33mpg and 52.4%fg. All this, and hes only 22 and a sophomore in the league. Right now hes a little light, and plays like it on defense  he doesnt have the spatial awareness or lateral speed yet to be a real paint clogger like Marc Gasol or Dwight, and hes not spectacular at defending post-up bigs yet. But hes got plenty of time to learn and get more comfortable with Vaughns defensive schemes.   Then we have Andrew Nicholson. His minutes have been frustratingly prohibited so far this year- but in what time hes had he has been phenomenal. He has a very mature finish around the rim, and doesnt look nearly as lost as most rookies on defense. Hes 23 already- but in the next couple of years I see him becoming a Lamarcus Aldridge light.   The player we know the least about of these three is Moe Harkless. Unlike Vuc and Nicholson, hes already shown some great flashes of being a great defender. Hes only a rookie, but he has a lot of intelligence about help defense; and I think as he gets older (hes only 19) he can become a lock-down perimeter defender and a great rebounder. On the other hand- his jumpshot is pretty bad (and his TS% of .500 is showing it). He looks like he can become Andre Iguodala but with worse passing and better rebounding.   The takeaway? I think these three guys can be the 3rd, 4th, and 5th best players on a championship team in 4 to 5 years when they start hitting their prime. But we still need a high end elite player who can be one of the 10 best players in the league, and someone who can lead us to a championship. We also probably need one more elite player and two more good role-players to come off the bench and give us depth. The roleplayers Im not worried about- we can sign them, or hopefully use our 2014-and-beyond draft picks to develop them (especially 2014, when I think well have a pick in the 10-13 range).   Getting those two pieces is, obviously, going to be the hardest part of putting a 2017/2018 championship team together. Jameer is great, I love him, but hes going to be 35 by then. JJ I dont expect to survive this season with the Magic. So with our likely top-3 pick in this years draft were going to want to get a backcourt player, and were going to need that player to become elite. I think the person should be McLemore. I dont see Muhammad becoming more than just a good scorer. I f we happen to land the #1 overall- I *could* see us going after Noel and having a killer frontcourt rotation with Nicholson coming off the bench. But I think McLemore has the potential to be Ray Allen, or possibly better. Then its just a matter of luring in one great free agent (Rondo 2016?) Getting our team to fit together, and letting them develop until theyre ready to make a run at the championship. This is probably all oversimplified, and just one possible route that could happen. What do you guys think, generally, about where this team can go from here? What do you think our ideal future should look like?     the rim is a fixed quantity  wat   And it wasn't really a great one either. Kindof a fluff piece.    [Gunoud's Ave Maria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y-oY74S2FE)   I'm *kinda* happy about this. It's always a shame to see a player go down, and I didn't dislike Davis at all despite his poor shot selection and undewhelming defense - but It's been infuriating seeing Nicholson get so little playing time, and I'm really hoping this forces Vaughn to integrate him  more. I also would really like to see us get into the top-3 in the draft for one of McLemore or Muhammed, so the tanking aspect of this injury could be nice.    (Checks Andre Drummond's PER)   sorry :(      :(   Why is that funny?   Shhhhhh, it's their mental defense to not having a shot at him. Don't spoil it.   Took sec. reg. this fall.

Yeah- it's been pointed out before in this recent influx of 2B1L posts, but most of the time there are enough subtle (and sometimes not-so-subte) differences in the appearance of the cheap outfit that collectively, it would be a terrible outfit.  But then again, this is a user-content oriented site, so I think it's probably an unrealistic expectation for people to be able to compile the entire outfits themselves just for the post.  I've found that I like certain aspects of the full look; things I can take away and mix/match with my own style, in which case both the cheap and the expensive listings can both be helpful depending on how specific a thing I'm looking for.

                            There is a copyediting error in this article. Gamma rays, of course, don't move at "close to" the speed of light.      There is a problem with the editing of this report. Gamma rays, of course, don't move "close to" the speed of light. The authors know this, and I assume it is merely an error in copy editing.         If you like have a look at the references I have just provided in a separate comment here.      The clinical literature on nutrition in general and meat consumption in particular is indeed complex. One of the greatest problems is finding a proper group to study ie a group that has eaten vegetarian for a long enough time so that one can assume that the dietary practices aren't detrimental in other ways. People from South Asia would be an attractive choice, but dietary factors are heavily influenced by caste and class in their case. A lot of the reputable literature focuses on Seventh Day Adventists where a non-meat diet has been a requirement for over 150 years. That is sufficient time to justify the assumption that "they know what they are doing".  A lot of the literature focuses on specific pathologies (colorectal, gastric, breast, esophageal, etc. cancers, heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure, stroke, etc.) and doesn't really give a good overview. Here are a couple of review articles that can give a good picture of the larger picture and contain a fair amount of credible references. Also they are online and not behind a paywall.  1)[Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long) A meta analysis from 'The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'.  2)[Red Meat and Cancer: The Biological Evidence](http://blogs.plos.org/publichealth/2014/11/17/red-meat-biological-evidence) From the 'Public Health Perspectives' blog connected to the PLOS. despite the title this article points towards references outside of oncology.   The grand consensus, if there is one, of the properly researched evidence is that there is a correlation between high consumption of red meat and incidence of various diseases. The picture is complicated as there is controversy over particular diseases. There is also a small extension of lifespan associated with a vegetarian diet when looking at groups where practice or knowledge gives a proper guide to meal balance. This is less certain than the connections to specific diseases. Put it as probable rather than certain. There is **no** reputable evidence saying that a totally vegetarian diet has any advantages over a 'restricted meat' (more than a week between servings of meat) diet.   That's where it stands.            The internet .... a devious marketing device funded by manufacturers of antihypertensive medications.   I see what you mean. My mind was fixated on food crops.               Yes that's true in a lot of cases. It is, however, possible to make the case and have an intelligent conversation if you approach the matter in a non-ideological, non-judgemental manner.   It's really a matter of balance. I note that the title of the article says "less" not "none".      The speaker who survived the attack during which her husband was murdered is only one of the victims of what has been a series of attacks on atheists in Bangladesh. There are others.         The metaphor that came to my mind was more "cosmic taffee" and the end would be the great "taffee pull".      I hope you find it useful.      It took a bit of work, but I found it. Phuket is actually Phuket Island, a big Thai resort (there are a lot of them) in the Andaman Sea. The photo is on a gallery of photos at the resort's [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/phuket101/photoes_stream). I have to admit that I was sceptical for awhile. The photo hardly seems to bear much resemblance to Thai architecture. The resort, however, seems to have a large number of non-traditional buildings - some quite 'strange' actually. At the end of the day it is still a very attractive photo.      Another day, another episode of Looney Tunes. I'm guessing you are Daffy Duck. I'm also guessing that the only time piece you trust is a cuckoo clock. Take up a hobby that improves you if you are bothered by your inferiority.           Stay tuned to NASA.   I don't know about the ins and outs of each situation, and I`d imagine that economicsaccounting should come into each decision. I can, however, say that there are other factors, insulation costs for instance, that should be factored in and often are. Then there are more `remote` factors that involve a larger look at the economy beyond the simple accounting of any given project. Lower costs for imported produce, for instance, are connected with fossil fuel subsidies, a big issue nowadays. It`s complicated, and beyond the scope of a simple news story.   Now **that** is an impressive picture. Where does it come from ?   Headline writing - an unappreciated fine art.            The [Anti-Authoritarian Movement](http://ak2003.gr) is the largest and most popular anarchist grouping/network in Greece. It was formed in 2002 to oppose the 2003 Summit of the European Union in Thessalonika. The idea spread throughout the country and groups using the name played a prominent part in the opposition to the Athens Olympics in 2004 and in many subsequent events.  The AAM is not really an organization with a stated program, stable membership and clear lines of communication. It is rather a network of autonomous groups and individuals with full local autonomy. There are, of course, anarchosyndicalist groupings in Greece {[Rocinante](http://rocinante.gr), [ESE](http://ese.espiv.net), [IWW - Greece](https://www.facebook.com/IWWGreece)} and the recent beginning of an anarchocommunist grouping. All of these are far smaller than the AAM, as is the fringe of 'armed struggle' groupuscles that get so much play in the international media. The less said about the latter the better.  The following English translation of the AAM's statement is from [Beyond Europe](http://beyondeurope.net). Beyond Europe is the website of a network of anti-authoritarian groups across Europe. The statement has also been translated into other European languages as well.  @@@@@  **Referendum on a outdated question but in front of a clear responsibility**  Our society is called today to handle an exceptionally critical situation. Governing institutions can no longer present solutions to a crisis that like a cancer is destroying the social net, while it is becoming clear that the survival of the system can be achieved only through sacrificing society itself. The situation created by the international financial capital and the state institutions that reinforce it is leading us with accelerated rhythm to the imposition of a continuous totalitarianism while the state of exception has now become the normal state of the new governance.  Greece is, of course, included in this experiment. Following the contemptuous offer of the institutions, the government of Syriza decided to conduct a referendum as a way to continuing the negotiation through different means. This proves of course without any doubt the failure of reaching an honorable compromise which was noisily touted as the best solution until recently. Following into the steps of the Thatcherian dogma there is no alternative, this imposition of the terms of realism leads to social passivity and an attempt to enslave life itself. This realism of continuous impoverishment, of unemployment, of no hope, of the definite abandonment of any possibility to achieve happiness, of war and of repression is very far from our own sense of logic. Society needs not only to see what is behind the closed doors of the decision-making chamber but also to move to break them.  The dissolution of capitalist promises, the inability to create a narrative that gives some prospects to the system, the civil wars that start with amazing ease and redraw borders and the agreements built on international conventions after the war lead to the same conclusion: the state can no longer determine the rules governing our lives. It is this state that Syriza wants to manage today. Syriza, however, wants to do this using all those ideas dominating until recently which led to the collapse of the system that nurtured them. Syriza has not attempted to destroy the ideology of progress, it preserved entirely the idea of growth, it continues to talk about the productive reconstruction of the country, leading to a situation that can have very doubtful results.  The referendum proposed by Syriza has no relation to the principles of direct democracy because they intend to use it as an instrument of applying pressure on the European directorate. The proposed referendum does not foresee opinion exchange, discussion and argumentation with the participation of society; instead, as it is promulgated by the governing power, it sets the question according to its own ideas seeking in the end a new agreement for the content of which society plays no role.  We need today a renewal of our devotion to the values of a different policy for social construction using direct democracy, self organization and continuous own institution building that will destroy the concept there is no alternative and obeying blindly to an endless and mindless idea of economy. New productive reconstruction can not be based on the idea of growth but on the full and absolute negation of the model of capitalist reconstruction and be based on self management, cooperative structures and the possibility for people to determine their own lives. We do not care about the currency that will be part of a national reawakening and we can not support of course a currency that is part of the financial intrusion into every aspect of our lives. We prefer to think of the currency in its normal dimension as an instrument for exchange with its main function being social needs and facilities.  Since we are part of the movement for a real social break with the internationalized financial dictatorship (which negates any idea of politics in order to put in its place the management of monetary quantities as the main social relationship), we owe it to ourselves to participate in the search for ways that lead to such a break.  Today, under current conditions and in real time, we can not remain indifferent in front of the polarization that is taking place in view of the referendum.  On the one side the YES vote is the definite entrapment to the rules and regulations of the directorate fixing a long term enslavement to a scared and defeated society, which will be soon asked to carry the weight of its own humiliation setting it as a a new regularity. On the other hand, the NO vote is limited in every possible way by the government to the terms of a new agreement, examples of which are included already in the 47 pages document, while referring at the same time to the easily digested and used in every occasion sense of patriotic duty.  Such a polarization, however, has already surpassed the calculations and the intentions of the government, and consequently the question itself of the referendum. This total attack coming from the directorate abroad and also from the system of the willing using the media as a battering ram, changed the terms of the question to the more radical YES or NO to the EU and the Euro. All actions leading to economic asphyxiation were taken using threats and ultimatums of public economic adjustment.  The effort by the SYRIZA government to combine social needs with the strong forces of money has now reached its limits, showing clearly that two watermelons can not fit under the same armpit as we say in Greek. One can not step on two different boats, as SYRIZA used to do all those years when it was in the opposition.  On Sunday, no matter what the result will be and assuming they will stay with the question, the vote of NO is not easily managed by those who undertook to support it and it may easily overcome the calculations and the intentions of the government. The fact that it uses the NO vote and includes it in the terms of its negotiation with the directorate shows the great difficulty of managing the NO vote.  The ensuing polarization opens roads of liberation and establishment of a social dynamic which has not been foreseen but which can bring forward in multiple ways the possibilities afforded by the social movements of recent years. These movements were suffocating until now or were taking a back step in front of the dynamic of representation, of assignment and of hope. This is the opportunity that is now presented to movements to take part in the battle not only symbolically but also substantially, carrying autonomously and without bosses the weight and the responsibility of the war against the totalitarianism of money, which for bosses does not just represent commercial value, but is considered the equivalent to human relations and to life itself.  We can not remain aloof or be neutral in front of this possibility afforded to movements which comes from polarization since we have been, we are and will be in real time there where what is free, public and social goes against the market and the state.

The AAM is not really an organization with a stated program, stable membership and clear lines of communication. It is rather a network of autonomous groups and individuals with full local autonomy. There are, of course, anarchosyndicalist groupings in Greece {[Rocinante](http://rocinante.gr), [ESE](http://ese.espiv.net), [IWW - Greece](https://www.facebook.com/IWWGreece)} and the recent beginning of an anarchocommunist grouping. All of these are far smaller than the AAM, as is the fringe of 'armed struggle' groupuscles that get so much play in the international media. The less said about the latter the better.  The following English translation of the AAM's statement is from [Beyond Europe](http://beyondeurope.net). Beyond Europe is the website of a network of anti-authoritarian groups across Europe. The statement has also been translated into other European languages as well.  @@@@@  **Referendum on a outdated question but in front of a clear responsibility**  Our society is called today to handle an exceptionally critical situation. Governing institutions can no longer present solutions to a crisis that like a cancer is destroying the social net, while it is becoming clear that the survival of the system can be achieved only through sacrificing society itself. The situation created by the international financial capital and the state institutions that reinforce it is leading us with accelerated rhythm to the imposition of a continuous totalitarianism while the state of exception has now become the normal state of the new governance.  Greece is, of course, included in this experiment. Following the contemptuous offer of the institutions, the government of Syriza decided to conduct a referendum as a way to continuing the negotiation through different means. This proves of course without any doubt the failure of reaching an honorable compromise which was noisily touted as the best solution until recently. Following into the steps of the Thatcherian dogma there is no alternative, this imposition of the terms of realism leads to social passivity and an attempt to enslave life itself. This realism of continuous impoverishment, of unemployment, of no hope, of the definite abandonment of any possibility to achieve happiness, of war and of repression is very far from our own sense of logic. Society needs not only to see what is behind the closed doors of the decision-making chamber but also to move to break them.  The dissolution of capitalist promises, the inability to create a narrative that gives some prospects to the system, the civil wars that start with amazing ease and redraw borders and the agreements built on international conventions after the war lead to the same conclusion: the state can no longer determine the rules governing our lives. It is this state that Syriza wants to manage today. Syriza, however, wants to do this using all those ideas dominating until recently which led to the collapse of the system that nurtured them. Syriza has not attempted to destroy the ideology of progress, it preserved entirely the idea of growth, it continues to talk about the productive reconstruction of the country, leading to a situation that can have very doubtful results.  The referendum proposed by Syriza has no relation to the principles of direct democracy because they intend to use it as an instrument of applying pressure on the European directorate. The proposed referendum does not foresee opinion exchange, discussion and argumentation with the participation of society; instead, as it is promulgated by the governing power, it sets the question according to its own ideas seeking in the end a new agreement for the content of which society plays no role.  We need today a renewal of our devotion to the values of a different policy for social construction using direct democracy, self organization and continuous own institution building that will destroy the concept there is no alternative and obeying blindly to an endless and mindless idea of economy. New productive reconstruction can not be based on the idea of growth but on the full and absolute negation of the model of capitalist reconstruction and be based on self management, cooperative structures and the possibility for people to determine their own lives. We do not care about the currency that will be part of a national reawakening and we can not support of course a currency that is part of the financial intrusion into every aspect of our lives. We prefer to think of the currency in its normal dimension as an instrument for exchange with its main function being social needs and facilities.  Since we are part of the movement for a real social break with the internationalized financial dictatorship (which negates any idea of politics in order to put in its place the management of monetary quantities as the main social relationship), we owe it to ourselves to participate in the search for ways that lead to such a break.  Today, under current conditions and in real time, we can not remain indifferent in front of the polarization that is taking place in view of the referendum.  On the one side the YES vote is the definite entrapment to the rules and regulations of the directorate fixing a long term enslavement to a scared and defeated society, which will be soon asked to carry the weight of its own humiliation setting it as a a new regularity. On the other hand, the NO vote is limited in every possible way by the government to the terms of a new agreement, examples of which are included already in the 47 pages document, while referring at the same time to the easily digested and used in every occasion sense of patriotic duty.  Such a polarization, however, has already surpassed the calculations and the intentions of the government, and consequently the question itself of the referendum. This total attack coming from the directorate abroad and also from the system of the willing using the media as a battering ram, changed the terms of the question to the more radical YES or NO to the EU and the Euro. All actions leading to economic asphyxiation were taken using threats and ultimatums of public economic adjustment.  The effort by the SYRIZA government to combine social needs with the strong forces of money has now reached its limits, showing clearly that two watermelons can not fit under the same armpit as we say in Greek. One can not step on two different boats, as SYRIZA used to do all those years when it was in the opposition.  On Sunday, no matter what the result will be and assuming they will stay with the question, the vote of NO is not easily managed by those who undertook to support it and it may easily overcome the calculations and the intentions of the government. The fact that it uses the NO vote and includes it in the terms of its negotiation with the directorate shows the great difficulty of managing the NO vote.  The ensuing polarization opens roads of liberation and establishment of a social dynamic which has not been foreseen but which can bring forward in multiple ways the possibilities afforded by the social movements of recent years. These movements were suffocating until now or were taking a back step in front of the dynamic of representation, of assignment and of hope. This is the opportunity that is now presented to movements to take part in the battle not only symbolically but also substantially, carrying autonomously and without bosses the weight and the responsibility of the war against the totalitarianism of money, which for bosses does not just represent commercial value, but is considered the equivalent to human relations and to life itself.  We can not remain aloof or be neutral in front of this possibility afforded to movements which comes from polarization since we have been, we are and will be in real time there where what is free, public and social goes against the market and the state.

The effort by the SYRIZA government to combine social needs with the strong forces of money has now reached its limits, showing clearly that two watermelons can not fit under the same armpit as we say in Greek. One can not step on two different boats, as SYRIZA used to do all those years when it was in the opposition.  On Sunday, no matter what the result will be and assuming they will stay with the question, the vote of NO is not easily managed by those who undertook to support it and it may easily overcome the calculations and the intentions of the government. The fact that it uses the NO vote and includes it in the terms of its negotiation with the directorate shows the great difficulty of managing the NO vote.  The ensuing polarization opens roads of liberation and establishment of a social dynamic which has not been foreseen but which can bring forward in multiple ways the possibilities afforded by the social movements of recent years. These movements were suffocating until now or were taking a back step in front of the dynamic of representation, of assignment and of hope. This is the opportunity that is now presented to movements to take part in the battle not only symbolically but also substantially, carrying autonomously and without bosses the weight and the responsibility of the war against the totalitarianism of money, which for bosses does not just represent commercial value, but is considered the equivalent to human relations and to life itself.  We can not remain aloof or be neutral in front of this possibility afforded to movements which comes from polarization since we have been, we are and will be in real time there where what is free, public and social goes against the market and the state.  Antiauthoritarian Movement      The [Anti-Authoritarian Movement](http://ak2003.gr) is the largest and most popular anarchist grouping/network in Greece. It was formed in 2002 to oppose the 2003 Summit of the European Union in Thessalonika. The idea spread throughout the country and groups using the name played a prominent part in the opposition to the Athens Olympics in 2004 and in many subsequent events.  The AAM is not really an organization with a stated program, stable membership and clear lines of communication. It is rather a network of autonomous groups and individuals with full local autonomy. There are, of course, anarchosyndicalist groupings in Greece {[Rocinante](http://rocinante.gr), [ESE](http://ese.espiv.net), [IWW - Greece](https://www.facebook.com/IWWGreece)} and the recent beginning of an anarchocommunist grouping. All of these are far smaller than the AAM, as is the fringe of 'armed struggle' groupuscles that get so much play in the international media. The less said about the latter the better.  The following English translation of the AAM's statement is from [Beyond Europe](http://beyondeurope.net). Beyond Europe is the website of a network of anti-authoritarian groups across Europe. The statement has also been translated into other European languages as well.  @@@@@  **Referendum on a outdated question but in front of a clear responsibility**  Our society is called today to handle an exceptionally critical situation. Governing institutions can no longer present solutions to a crisis that like a cancer is destroying the social net, while it is becoming clear that the survival of the system can be achieved only through sacrificing society itself. The situation created by the international financial capital and the state institutions that reinforce it is leading us with accelerated rhythm to the imposition of a continuous totalitarianism while the state of exception has now become the normal state of the new governance.  Greece is, of course, included in this experiment. Following the contemptuous offer of the institutions, the government of Syriza decided to conduct a referendum as a way to continuing the negotiation through different means. This proves of course without any doubt the failure of reaching an honorable compromise which was noisily touted as the best solution until recently. Following into the steps of the Thatcherian dogma there is no alternative, this imposition of the terms of realism leads to social passivity and an attempt to enslave life itself. This realism of continuous impoverishment, of unemployment, of no hope, of the definite abandonment of any possibility to achieve happiness, of war and of repression is very far from our own sense of logic. Society needs not only to see what is behind the closed doors of the decision-making chamber but also to move to break them.  The dissolution of capitalist promises, the inability to create a narrative that gives some prospects to the system, the civil wars that start with amazing ease and redraw borders and the agreements built on international conventions after the war lead to the same conclusion: the state can no longer determine the rules governing our lives. It is this state that Syriza wants to manage today. Syriza, however, wants to do this using all those ideas dominating until recently which led to the collapse of the system that nurtured them. Syriza has not attempted to destroy the ideology of progress, it preserved entirely the idea of growth, it continues to talk about the productive reconstruction of the country, leading to a situation that can have very doubtful results.  The referendum proposed by Syriza has no relation to the principles of direct democracy because they intend to use it as an instrument of applying pressure on the European directorate. The proposed referendum does not foresee opinion exchange, discussion and argumentation with the participation of society; instead, as it is promulgated by the governing power, it sets the question according to its own ideas seeking in the end a new agreement for the content of which society plays no role.  We need today a renewal of our devotion to the values of a different policy for social construction using direct democracy, self organization and continuous own institution building that will destroy the concept there is no alternative and obeying blindly to an endless and mindless idea of economy. New productive reconstruction can not be based on the idea of growth but on the full and absolute negation of the model of capitalist reconstruction and be based on self management, cooperative structures and the possibility for people to determine their own lives. We do not care about the currency that will be part of a national reawakening and we can not support of course a currency that is part of the financial intrusion into every aspect of our lives. We prefer to think of the currency in its normal dimension as an instrument for exchange with its main function being social needs and facilities.  Since we are part of the movement for a real social break with the internationalized financial dictatorship (which negates any idea of politics in order to put in its place the management of monetary quantities as the main social relationship), we owe it to ourselves to participate in the search for ways that lead to such a break.  Today, under current conditions and in real time, we can not remain indifferent in front of the polarization that is taking place in view of the referendum.  On the one side the YES vote is the definite entrapment to the rules and regulations of the directorate fixing a long term enslavement to a scared and defeated society, which will be soon asked to carry the weight of its own humiliation setting it as a a new regularity. On the other hand, the NO vote is limited in every possible way by the government to the terms of a new agreement, examples of which are included already in the 47 pages document, while referring at the same time to the easily digested and used in every occasion sense of patriotic duty.  Such a polarization, however, has already surpassed the calculations and the intentions of the government, and consequently the question itself of the referendum. This total attack coming from the directorate abroad and also from the system of the willing using the media as a battering ram, changed the terms of the question to the more radical YES or NO to the EU and the Euro. All actions leading to economic asphyxiation were taken using threats and ultimatums of public economic adjustment.

Antiauthoritarian Movement   Granted but...Rome wasn't built in a day, or fed either.   BBC: [Greek referendum: Early results show no vote ahead](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33403665#")                  Yes it is. Another person has commented on this elsewhere.                  Governments define it as such if they can't regulate and tax it. Like pretty well every country in Europe (I am uncertain about Estonia) Greece has a VAT. Never mind income tax for the venders. You don't have to be selling drugs or guns to be breaking the law from a government's point of view. I wouldn't be surprised if well over 90% of goods and services traded 'under the counter' are very much 'legal' in themselves.                  I think the wording contains more than a few 'dilemmas'. It's a situation where a therapeutic intervention seems to involve a high risk of a deleterious outcome unconnected to the original problem. The dilemmas involved would include:  -To do or not to do (the surgery)  -To improve or not to improve (the anaesthesia) and if improve how  -To prevent or not to prevent (the harm) and if prevent how  -To mitigate or not to mitigate (the harm) and if mitigate how  -To accept or not to accept the harm (patient/parent/physician/teacher/therapists/etc. interactions) and this is a really big 'how'      Bye. Travel well.               There's actually an amusing story behind the Bolshevik excuse for the raid. There is disagreement about whose car was actually stolen. The Lockhart referred to in the Libcom article was the British ambassador, and some sources say it was his car. Others say it was some communist bureaucrat's. In any case they should have returned the fucking car and told the thieves to vacation in Astrakhan. It probably wouldn't have done any good. I'm sure the Bolsheviks would have found another excuse.            Thanks. Valuable news. I was going to post this myself. Let's hope the development continues.         I know.

Neuquen ceramist union together with the workers of Zanon    Well, I don't think there is a huge surplus of goods in Bulgaria or Albania. I am uncertain about the border controls on either, but they are probably stricter in the case of the latter. As to the other two land neighbours, Macedonia and Turkey, the borders are far from 'lax'. I don't think any black market trade could make up for the loss of regular imports.                                 Currency controls apparently, but I wouldn't rule out deliberate withholding on the part of some transnational companies.   I'm sure some of the cancellations are 'crisis panic' decisions. If there is any stable situation, no matter what the stability short of a military coup, in the future then I'd expect a rebound, particularly amongst bargain hunters.                                       "The Lord helps those who help themselves".                                                                                 Fairly corrupt then. I've seen quite a bit of news about anti-corruption campaigns in China. From what you are saying the government has a hopeless cause here. All they can do is bump off a few of the bigwigs (those without enough friends and too many enemies) while the rot extends all the way down to the bottom. Sounds very much like the old Soviet bloc. I guess some things don't change, or even get worse, whatever the policies of the ruling class in power.               That is one of the paths to explore ie his writings during that period. It's been quite awhile since I've read Proudhon so that has to be charted out. I think, though I may be wrong, that 'The Political Capacity of the Working Classes' (1865) would be the most likely place to find his final views. It was, after all, his deathbed book. I will, of course, pay attention to what was or was not published while he was alive. In the end, however, I am less interested in what he thought and more in how his views ere seen and reflected in the wider labor movement. It's there I find things that make me call myself a 'mutualist'. Gradualism. The importance of cooperatives though I certainly don't see them replacing unionism. A toning down of the violent rhetoric that often flows through anarchist writings.  I'd have little doubt that Proudhon's views were among the many things misinterpreted by Bakunin, but I don't think Bakunin's personal views were wholly responsible for the immense stupidity of the 'Bakuninists' allying with the Marxists to fight the 'Proudhonists' at Basle. With the English trade unionists looking on in horror no doubt. Things to explore.  Proudhon is naturally difficult and easy to misinterpret. Not just because his views kept changing. My favorite story about that is his trial in Besanon over his 'Warning to Proprietors'. The jury found him not guilty because they refused to convict over writings that they couldn't understand. Few people have that on their CV.  In any case I look forward to your review in Black Flag.         Well, that may be so when I think about it. Perhaps infinite regress may turn out to be the only sensible answer hen all is said and done.      Whenever you finish 'La Fin de la premire Internationale' it would be great if you could send a review this way. It would be greatly appreciated.  In any case I'll be continuing on the path down the years from Bakunin to mid-century. The Berthier article piqued my interest as you might see from my own additions to what the Groupe Salador-Segui/Berthier had to say.   Here's a rather crude sketch on where I am going:  1) From Proudhon to the Paris Commune. How did Proudhon's views come to be embodied in French labor ? Proudhon himself at one time was none too sympathetic to the ideas of unionism, strikes, etc.. When looking at Flora Tristan's effect on the Lyonnais workers it seemed that she was much more influential (and influenced by) with them than Proudhon ever was despite the fact he spent much more time there. Did Proudhon change his views over time ? He certainly did, but in what way.  Proudhon's views, or at least the invocation of their spirit, became the majority current in French labor. Their role in the International. The (foolish) attacks on them by the developing 'pure' anarchist movement, exemplified by the Congress of Basle where the 'Bakuninists' united with the Marxists to defeat the mutualist current. Subsequent history supports the idea that this was one of the stupidest things that has ever been done in the name of anarchism.  Following from there the influence of various strains in French labor that adopted the name of 'mutualist' and the fact that they *weren't* all the same thing. The contrast between *Tolain* (antifeminist, individualist, orthodox "Proudhonian" position against strikes and finally member of the French government that sent the troops to suppress the Commune) and *Varlin* (feminist, collectivist, syndicalist and killed during the suppression of the Commune) illustrates this diversity. It is probably reflective of contradictions within Proudhon's own opinions. That, of course, is definitely your field not mine.  2)The years of eclipse. From the Commune to anarchosyndicalism. Growth of the 'terrorist option' in this atmosphere of defeat. This terrorism is more of a progenitor of modern 'insurrectionism' than the classic 'charcoal burner' rural adventures. Lots to say here, and none of it complementary to the terrorists.   Meanwhile the slow percolation of developing syndicalism amongst French workers which resulted in the formation of the CGT which had its own ideas, often very contradictory to those of the anarchists. I suppose I'll have to throw Pi y Margall and his quasi-Proudhonist ideas into this in talking about Spain. The slow awakening from the "sleep of fools" of the anarchists in relation to their terrorist 'comrades'. Amsterdam Congress 1907. Confrontation of the purists and the syndicalists. Neither side 100% right or wrong. Malatesta's views then and later when he also (like Bakunin) was more mature. The last major 'kick at the can' of support for terrorism amongst the majority of anarchists - Goldman's 'heavily cloaked' resolution on individual acts of rebellion.  3) Syndicalism: Growth and partial eclipse. Treading water. From the CGT to WW1 and the rise of fascism. Unfortunate consequences of the terrorist worship of violence and its influence on the rise of fascism. The disastrous myth of the Russian revolution. Partial recovery of syndicalism. Bolshevism, syndicalism, parliamentary socialism, internal labor struggles. The Spanish exception. FAI adventurism more connected with classic insurrectionism than terrorism. Opposition to the FAI and the disastrous results of their policies.  4)On the outside looking in. Anarchism after the fall of Spain. Its rebirth in the late 60s. Modern anarchism and insurrection. 'Invasion of the Mao clones'. Sources of modern 'insurrectionism'. Autonomism and other escapees from the Stalin zoo. 'Insurrectionism' today.  As you can see it's a long term project. It's not breakfast. It's a ten course meal.

                There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently.               Yes, it's a big European event, from what I've been told. I'm only considering because I'll be at ISC the week before (and already overseas). Had planned on working in some other travel but not sure if this is going to worth the time. The technical program is quite solid--lots of involvement from CERN and research agencies there.       Out in Oregon where all the folks are building their massive datacenters (not supercomputers, to be fair--but just as many cores), this is becoming a huge concern. At some point, they're going to have to move to greener pastures (literally)... not sure how this issue isn't at the forefront of people's minds--don't even see anything about it in the disaster recovery space much. Yet meanwhile, look at the situation the whole West Coast was in... not to be dramatic about it, but this is a growing concern.                     Yeah, can't blame you there--and I think I've heard the same general statement more than once in the last couple weeks.                  The top one with the vertical lines is a typical horn coral--looks like you might have some crinoid bits throughout in addition to the shells. Nice finds, though. The one your brother found is pyrite--sparkly but common too. Still a nice start to a budding collection. Try to check out the area around you there in Ohio for trilobites and other semi-common fossil specimens, they're all around if you know where to look. Here are some day trip ideas http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/GeoFacts/geof17.pdf   *rubs hands together and cackles* -- between stacked memory and Volta, it's going to be quite a year, 2016.                              Actually Jeff Squyres is their MPI guy and writes some great stuff. Not a thing to do with Cisco or pushing any agenda. Talked to him at SC in the past and he just really likes what he does, even if his company doesn't invest a lick in HPC.         To be fair, they did carry the other side of the debate here just a couple days before. http://www.hpcwire.com/soundbite/toward-realistic-quantum-computing-measures/       This is one of the best rockhounding posts I've seen in a couple of months. Beautiful, big finds. What area of CA (county) were you in?   I think that's his main point--he says it in the recorded part of the interview at the bottom that even with a top system, without experienced programmers who can optimize their codes, it's all useless. With GPUs, Phi, etc... at least having a familiar programming model is a benefit for users onboarding their apps quicker than with say CUDA            Jade (green) and common quartz   Agreed, they are quite beautiful to look at but not entirely uncommon--great find, however!      Wonderful--I love this! What tools do you use for your carving?       It's only 9 a.m. but I'm already sure that's the coolest thing I'll see all day. Where is it from?         Possibly a pink Smartie? -- Posting photos is a must here...hard to say anything without one.   Agreed here. I have several similar pieces (some next to crinoids or with horn coral intermixed) from the Petoskey area of northern Michigan.  	56

 I just searched through it myself, after reading your comment, and now feel a bit dumb. I remember thinking my tooth-fairy remark was funny as shit at the time (I was slightly drunk).   It prompted a discussion between me and Diane, because I hadn't grown up with the whole tooth-fairy thing, and wanted to find out if she had believed in it.    Thank you, I would say that sharing it with others does reduce the burden.   I don't want to try astral projection or anything like that, because I want Diane to go on to her next life and experience all the happiness she deserves. To be honest, I pray that she doesn't even remember me. I don't want her attachment to me to hinder her journey.    She was decent. She enjoyed solving the tests, but to be honest I think she liked the story lines more. Sometimes she got frustrated and watch walk-throughs. She also liked to watch me play.    I used to. But, I know she had to leave eventually. Her attachment to me shouldn't hinder her on her journey, and I want he to know that. I know she must be someplace as beautiful, and amazing as her now.    It's not silly at all. Diane and I always kept a white-board on our fridge, where we'd write things we needed to do, and our shopping list.   Some things (errands we hadn't gotten to yet, and frequently purchased groceries) would just stay on there, cluttering up the board forever.   The other day I went through the list to erase the things that had already gotten done (mostly things pertaining to Diane's funeral services, and my recent trip to India).   I don't drink cashew milk, but Diane kept it on the list. I started choking up right after I erased it.    	5
 BULLS EYE.    Thanks!!   Where is this?! I'm off Centennial and see things like this all the time.    Meowwwwwww   STOP! I LOVE THIS!   I work at a 4.5 star restaurant. We feature tons of amazing craft beers and wine on tap. This is one of our featured beers of the month.      Every creature can be good    I hate this I'm scared    Cheese graters    This isn't even popping. It's pulling out staples....idk just not my idea if this sub I guess.    I met him in Miami a few years back. He was taking shots of tequila 2 days after he left Celebrity Rehab with Dd. drew. Seemed fine at first then he got more and more out of control.    For some reason this reminds me of HIMYM when Lily goes to Marshall's for the Holidays. All it is missing is the potato chip crumbles.   SQUIRT   Lilacs....   Toledo?    Youse look like siblings.   Well thank you for that bit of knowledge. !!   I have one too! My doctor calls it a "sinus cavity". I have one of each ear. You are not alone.    Deeeeeerbed   It all happened so quickly. He bumped it with a Q-Tip and the whole thing burst right away.    Oh Yeahh, you know it!       Ohio is like that sometimes....   I know your doppelgnger.   My inner thighs get these all the time. Being female and working in a bar I'm constantly walking/power walking and it's mostly heat rash. My doctor told me to always leave them be and just continue to use my Proactive on them cause "it can't hurt". But this one was different it felt hard so I had to squeeze! Really glad I did.  	26
 I like to keep busy. I'm not really doing anything with my degree, so I have to make sure I'm working towards what I really want. Writing for games, becoming a novelist. And somewhat trying to break into film (my degree) with a short film I need to start...   No. If it is something that can be taught I'm certainly not the person to be teaching it.   Neil Gaiman is the best person to look to for this advice. There are plenty others, let me find the video. [This video is genius! Just watch this, it solves everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C48jAkVlI0)   Requiem for a Dream. That's a must.  Dallas Buyer's Club as well, though I haven't seen that myself, he was meant to be amazing.  Also, though Leto is barely in it, you haven't seen Fight Club? You need to see fight club. I don't care if I'm breaking the first two rules, see fight club.   Yeah The Amazing Spider Man 2 kinda bombed. But that didn't mean the setup for the Sinister Six wasn't spot on. Dehaan made a great Goblin. We could have actually got a decent Venom. And a whole host of other baddies. I'm eager to see where Marvel take it, but that won't be for another few years now. I just like to imagine what could have been done, and would have liked to have seen the universe they started up expand.   And for *God's Sake* somebody put *Carnage* into a goddamn spider man movie!   Depends how well received the character is. Spotlight is absolutely on Leto. And that does give her a chance to shine. The problem with this film is that there is so much potential for it to bomb. I don't want it to, I don't expect it to. But it might.   This week I've been getting up early so I can really put some work into my book. Trying to pump out at least 1k words a day. Which is great because that takes me about an hour, and I can then work on either my games, or developing my screenplay :)   Suicide Squad...?   They're definitely going to do a sequel. No doubts. Just no idea when.   I think they said if they ever did another game it would be with a whole set of different characters. It wouldn't surprise me if they did, perhaps, return to Ellie, maybe even Joel, but I don't think they want to do that any time soon.   Why would a prequel make more sense?   Add me: MC SHIMMY   I understand that. I couldn't help you find a rare, old book company. There has been a lot of news recently about first-edition novels being sold at auction. If you investigate those that might lead you down the right path, perhaps.  Failing that. If you're expecting close to 1k, shelling out $120 isn't too bad when you're guaranteed a decent return.   Also watch the Youtube channel 'Extra Credits' if you don't already. They do videos on game design and they're incredibly useful. They do a set of videos on game narrative which you *have to watch*, but also look at the others to get a good overview of game design in general. If you can bleed good game design and game-design-understanding into your prose, all the better for you.   http://gamejournalismjobs.com/  This is a great site, the one I got my job from. Just don't hold out for paid work. I wrote seven articles, and got paid $.70 so...You just have to be willing to work for free.  Never heard of that Neverwinter Nights module. :)  Having a degree is certainly a boost. My degree is in film (which helps for screenplays) but not prose (which is why my novel was so important). You just have to find the right assets you possess and plug them.   The thing about working in the industry is that it breaks into two compartments: Design, and programming. Programming is obviously...just what it says. Design covers modelling, texturing, concept art, an entire haberdashery of jobs. But nothing that commits to writing. Most studios pull writers from designers who work in another department. Like I said, not a lot of studios have dedicated writers. You could get an intership, sure. No problem. It would be mostly office work, which is something you could do. Your difficulty then comes in where to take it from the internship. You can't program, or design. If they don't need a writer, you're out of luck and stuck as an intern.   This is why I recommend the indie route. There are a lot of indie companies out there who have formed from the previous workers of AAA studios. You probably won't start there, but you can work your way up there. It *is* a ladder. Unlike AAA gaming a lot of of indie games do put emphasis on story, and will hire a writer to allow their meagre staff to work on programming and design. That's why it's so good. If you write a game and it breaks out (mine is out in three months, here's to hoping it's successful), then you could get jobs coming to you.   Oh, also, I've been working on this game for over a year. Coming on to two. I joined the game after they'd been working on it for nearly a year. Don't expect to have a gaming portfolio built up quickly. If you can prioritise work, and work efficiently, you can join multiple games and have a number of games released roughly the same times. Which leads me to...  Most of the jobs you join will collapse. It's the nature of the work. I've joined over 20 companies, some have just never been able to stay in contact, of their ideas are too ambitious, or the team just implodes. If you can work out quickly which teams are likely to stick at it and which aren't, you'll do yourself a big favour. Mostly the best way to check is to look for if the studio has anything previously released.  Also, look into GDD's, writing crowd-funding campaigns and other writer-y things. Again, it's all to put into the portfolio. You want to convince the team you're the best person so show them you can do more than write a story. Anything that involves words, you can cover it, you're the guy to do it.   Can't you go along to a second-hand book store, or equivalent and get them 'appraised', so to speak?   If you had an idea of value, it wouldn't be difficult to sell them through Ebay or equivalent. Someone out there will know how much a book of that type and age and quality is worth.   YES YES YES YES!  I didn't get this until last year, which was a couple of years after it 'resurged'. Not reading this book the moment it piqued my interest was a mistake. Normally when I finish a book I mull it over and decide how much I like the final product, whether or not it approaches the level of my favourite novels. But with this I was a few pages in and I just *knew* it was amazing, that it would go on to be one of my favourites. The prose was consitently beautiful throughout, each stage of his life was heart-wrenching and human and true. I was so surprised by how amazing it was, because it was just fantastic. No one could have expected a novel to be so good. It set out to do something unique, and it really delivered!   I would love someone to write something so in-depth about a life like that in modern times. Would be a really interesting look at our society.   I always give my characters two things:  Values, and  Motivations.  What does your character value? What motivates them? For characters enduring a journey, that's a large part of it done. I know that characters aren't always that simple and there are shade of grey. So introduce bi-values and bi-motivations. At the end of the day we are all just trying to keep a hold of what we value, and what we want (how motivated we are to get what we want though...)  Creates interesting arcs as, when the story develops, their values and motivations change. Or one changes but not the other.  A lot of the time these two coincide.      Understand. You won't get hired to be in the industry. You won't. Not a chance. There are a small handful of companies who hire dedicated writers, and, I'm sorry, you're not going to land a job straight away writing for Irrational Games.  Indie games though, that's the way to do it. But understand that every single writer, who doesn't know anything about *making* games and just wants to *write*, is trying to break into the indie scene in the same manner, it's super over-saturated.  Here's what I did:  write stories and write screenplays. Demonstrate you can write both prose and dialogue. If you can hand in a properly formatted screenplay (alla Celtx) all the better. I had a completed novel underneath me when I started to apply. It demonstrated I can stick to a task, and won't flake. It was also in decent condition, and I was pretty happy presenting it as the main part of my portfolio.  Get your hands on Unity or UE and learn basic game programming and modelling. Nothing heavy, just enough to understand how everything is working under the hood. Be aware what the rest of the team is doing, and, above all, understand the limitations of the medium and that *the story never, ever comes before gameplay*. If you can show that you have a basic knowledge of Java or a C language, or of art and model design, it again shows a willingness to learn and get involved. I'll tell you why this is important. I write big, I like big scenes that are incredibly cinematic, but I know they can't be made. I understand how the team are limited, by time (mostly) but also by the engine limitations and priorities; and making sure the game works comes before the story. If you are writing, and you understand that something won't work, you can save a lot of time and hassle by understanding that an idea won't work, and just hand in a more tame version.  I found work for an online gaming magazine, and wrote a few articles. Show dedication to the medium, show insight and passion. Again, a good portfolio helps for this.  Breaking in isn't easy, you really have to make yourself stand out.  I think that's everything...      Would mostly look at books, and my own writing, as a way to keep me on track. Maybe mix in a few other things.  So I just wanted to ask what kind of things do you like to see on vlogs? If you watch booktube vlogs, what do you like about them, or dislike?  If you are a booktuber, any advice for a newbie?  Just looking for general advice and ideas from the community about what kind of things to include or exclude.  Thanks :)   Yeah, Antichrist is a different kettle of fish. It's something else entirely. But totally worth the watch. If you've seen his other films then you'll be ready for the blows that come, so it won't be too bad. It is though a really good film, and it's held together really well.   Lars Von Trier.   The dinosaurs aren't dead! They're on Atlantis!  Screw No Man's Sky and Ark. We need a supernatural, pirate, Dinosaur game.   Eh, get it in store. Try order from Tesco, etc?   It never struck be as being anti-religious for the sake of being anti-religious. I actually don't think it's a reflection on Christianity because Christianity didn't exist. It's an interesting idea about how the religion could have formed, and the new testament. Without it ever really being a bash at religion. It just removes the miracles and makes Jesus a normal man. Which I think is ok.   Neil Gaiman. Read his kid stuff, read his adult stuff, will read his comics when I can afford the entire set.  Also Philip Pullman. Love HDM. And I quite enjoyed 'The Good Man Jesus'.   Nymphomaniac.   Whenever I preorder from Game I put down a fiver, and then pay for the rest when I pick up the game...  Are you talking about online?   Ah, of course, so obvious.   Gotta ask why does it matter?   Atlantica.   *Pirate Asassin!*  What's more kickass than a *pirate assassin?!*  I swear to God if there were dinosaurs my tiny mind would have exploded.   You're asking for historical accuracy from a video game?   It was always there to help, in the bottom corner :)   "Hairy *baby*...hairy babeee*"   Sure. Look at the 'formatting help' at the bottom of the typy-window.  An asterisk on each side is *italics*. Two asterisks on each side is **bold**   Thanks for sharing those. They were great.   I would be quite interested in this. Had a look on the website you do film reviews too? Looking strictly for someone to do games because I would enjoy doing games and film. I've written game articles before, but not film.   I do my best to help =]   I have been known to do that myself. Waiting for something interesting to pop up I can put a comment on :)   Good luck. If you want to I'll read over what you've written (when you've written it.)   Sure. Just appreciate the ramifications of your protagonist expecting his younger sister to enjoy being raped. Sure, he doesn't understand, and the audience will get that. But you've still got to write it. As long as you don't dwell too heavily on it. Perhaps her screaming is him first realising something isn't right, it's not the same as all the other times. The catalyst for him to start panicking and *really* worrying about his sister.   So phrase it as "something was wrong, this wasn't like the others times."  Than; "The others had liked, why didn't my sister, I thought she would like it."  Everything will be ok.   Writing my story, need to use italics, which is a simple ctrl + i away. But no, my stupid fingers put in an asterisk. Bad stupid fingers.   Do we all spend too much time on Reddit?  Edit: Sorry I mussed up the heading. Missed out the 'you' dang it!   Then you lose his innocence. You can take it multiple ways. It's possible he's familiar with sex, but being familiar with the concept of rape could be a bit much.  I think that even if he understands what is happening it hinges on him not quite grasping why it's such a wrong with to do? Am I right? If he's just upset because his sister is crying, and in pain - that'll do. He doesn't quite understand *what* it is exactly that's causing that. He just understands its something bad.   Maybe he does understand. But just think about what kind of an edge you want the scene to have. You can make it excruciatingly sharp if he's very innocent and doesn't understand.   Couldn't just do a repeat of a guy being eaten off the toilet...   Probably wouldn't understand rape. Just have to say he tied her up, she cried a lot, and he moved on top of her. The boy wouldn't know or understand any of the finer details. You would just have to be sort of vague, but in a sense that everything that was happening would make sense to the reader. It would just have to be all action. A very literal telling of what was occurring.   **The Golem's Eye, by Jonathan Stroud**   I wanna play...   Evolution?   It doesn't hurt. Really doesn't. Forearm might get a bit sensitive, especially after a while - and that'll make it sore. That's the worst of it.  As for tipping. I live in England, and we don't tip here. I wanted to once. But I'd been lying down for two hours, and shivering from the cold and having my ribs tattooed for two hours. I got up and I was woozy as anything. Forgot to give him more than he asked, because he did a fantastic job.   If you really want to throw everything and anything that matters to you out the window, sure.   Social life. Friends. Family. Hobbies. No time for films. Or games. Or pets. Or relationships. Or reading. No job. No money.   If you wanna live like Asimov and forsake the internet (and do all your research from thick encyclopedic tomes), that's fine.   Today's world is ridiculously different from Asimov's. Difficult to compare.   To the contrary, holding down a blog would likely significantly boost your productivity towards a story.  Let's face it, you can't spend an entire day writing a story. You'll burn out, or get bored, inevitably procrastinate. But, rather than not be writing, you could be writing a blog post. This will break up your writing, going from story to blog and back. It'll keep you in the right frame of mind. As mentioned, if you work in tidbits about your novel (even just progress, anything you're struggling with) it'll keep you motivated and on point. You won't be working on the novel, but you'll be thinking about it. Kinda passively working on it - in a way. Having an audience might be significant boost to your writing as well. Keeping a blog is fun and an audience gives it a point to exist: if you're writing about your novel, that point to exist comes over to your novel. You're more motivated to work on it.  I hope that made sense. I'm sorry if it's all gibberish.  To summarise: keep blog, it will help. Focus less on it.   Maybe update once a week. Don't write too much. You have to give yourself a break from your novel, nothing wrong with that. So put that break into a blog. Stull being productive.   I want you to know that I hate you.  (Read: I wish I was that talented)   No.  The original is perfect.  You're treading on hallowed ground...

Just think about what you want and where, and what it might entail.  Also, don't forget you might not like the game when you're older. You really have to think about the future with a tattoo as niche as a gamer tattoo, and with as much detail as the one you want.   I have Advanced Warfare on XB1 - that's the same thing right?

There isn't enough space on the neck to play the D chord, is there a more efficient way than using all three fingers? I'm always pushing one finger off the fret, so one string sounds muted.  Bm is just a pain in the ass, looking for hints and tips.  [This is what I'm learning to play](https://ukutabs.com/p/passenger/let-her-go/)   I imagine the term trilogy like the Von Trier trilogy. Or the *Cornetto* trilogy (Edgar Wright). Held together not by narrative but by something else - team, or director.    Gaming. I would go into gaming.  Probably programming.

But Lux Aeterna is the most epic song I know.     Haha no. Just straight up chat. Back in the days before Facebook. 'Cause Myspace was, lets face it, pretty naff.

I think anyone who has seen *The Truman Show* has entertained the possibility that they are in their own version.  *(It's real)*   Good point, well made. I think it stands though. It's an oversight, a fairly large one.    I would say the portal was too small. Not enough gravity to get through.   I got that on Dayz. Tried to be nice. No luck. I even tricked a guy into thinking I was a friend - he had ammo I needed. I got close and killed him. There was a guy running on a desolate road, coming towards me. We stopped, stared at each other, neither making a move. He turned his back on me - judging me as not a threat - and I took him out from behind. Shit does that to you. Gotta survive. And then, when I had a really good character. Good weapons, plenty of ammo and food, someone took a lucky pot shot at me with a sniper rifle - never even saw them or the gun. Just *boom* black screen. Buh-bai good character. I later found my corpse. Picked clean.   Iron man falling.  In space.   I had a dream about a mouse. It was a really messed up dream. Let me give you some backstory - just a little. There were two mice, siblings, and their mother. I had been looking after these mice all day, but they kept on running away. My day had consisted of myself looking for these two tiny mice. Just the siblings. Sometimes I'd find them, and they'd get away again. I had to look after them, that was really important. When they were lost I had to find them.  I don't know what happened to the one. But I was with people, and they asked me if I was hungry. So they went and got fish 'n' chips while I sat on a wall, looking on the floor for two mice. I hadn't seen them for a long time - and I was very worried.  Eventually the others returned and they passed me a folded up paper bag. I opened it up and out popped this nose shape. A tiny mouse shaped nose. But it had been battered and deep fried - like a fish.  I know that sounds fucking stupid. But as this tiny orange nose-shape poked out it hit me that it was the mouse. And then it hit me again that someone had fucking deep fried it. Had probably boiled it alive and battered it. And then someone had given it to me. Knowing full well I was meant to look after them.  I forgot about it in the morning. In midday I was reminded, I nearly broke down into tears.   I don't think I've just felt so...helpless, like I've ever lost something so totally, and failed so miserably. Just opening that bag and seeing that nose, and being hit by so many realisations. It really fucked me up. I still get sad about that mouse, sometimes.   23  Male  England.  (H)   Yeah, like I said. I had a feeling RDR would be one of the most requested.   Red Dead Redemption. Though I don't expect it will take long for that to happen.  Otherwise Skyrim (an obvious choice). Or Brutal Legend. Because I can't get enough Brutal Legend.   Finished it now. I did enjoy it. Parts of it were quite smart, and it was well put together. It was a bit slow, but that wasn't a problem really.  I read most everything. As much as possible.   Get a bow. Recurve or Composite. Much more need to practice and put time in. Much more rewarding. Bow is the same thing the whole time but bow is very different.   Archery...Just buy a cheap bow and a target. Sorted.   Thankyou, sir. I will try this out shortly. (Not that I can play yet but it's always fun =] )   I'm English, and straight. But my sister (and her girlfriend) are gay. I just think America has done a really good thing here. A stellar step forward. I know it hasn't been easy in America but they've done it now. And that's really important.   I've already joined /r/ukulele :) I'm sure I will be spending a lot of time there over the coming days.  Do I wanna know on Ukulele? How do?   I'll get help. I really don't trust myself to do this. I have friends who are quite musically talented, they should be able to change a string.  Because even though I love my purple ukulele, I will get judged for it. :) Maybe not too keen to take it into the shop to get strung.   Might not be a good store. They do bass and guitar and Piano. They sell Ukes, but I've never seen strings :/. Might have to go into the city. And isn't that always fun?...  Also, I have no idea how to change strings. I probably should, I do not. Would definitely need help. Which I could feasibly get from the internet but that isn't the same.   Probably buy nylon. That's what they usually are right?  So in all likelihood I'll wander into shop and buy whatever I am recommended.   I have no idea what I'm doing :/   Yep, I read the reviews. Best advice given was to get new strings. Ones that aren't goddamn plastic. I'm already picking up Jason Mraz's I'm Yours. Same four chords over and over haha. It's just so difficult to learn because it doesn't sound right because the strings sound awful.    You mean...that's a thing?   Haha. No, unfortunately it was the very boring E string.    I mean...my bass is ok. My bass is broken because my friend snapped a string while tuning it so he lent me his. So, even though I'm not playing it. My bass is nice. Just...needs new strings...   Yay! I've really wanted to learn to play for ages so I just though...Sod it, buy one!  So I bought the cheapest one Amazon and it just arrived. It's bright purple (which is kinda awesome), and the strings are plastic and shit - but hey, I got what I paid for (less than 20). So, if I stick at it, I'll go and buy some decent strings. And if I really stick at it, I'll buy a decent one and really go for it. For now I'm letting the strings rest (apparently they need a bit of stretching after tuning), so I'm gunna leave it alone for now and see how if it sounds any better later on. Whoot. Back to learning 'Do I Wanna Know' on bass.  Edit: it's really strange going from tuning a ukulele to tuning a bass...Like, *I have to stretch now!? This neck suddenly seems so long!*   JUST DO IT!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuHfVn_cfHU   The themes and ideas are great. I totally appreciate them, and what he was trying to say. But just...everything else missed it for me.   Yeah, that's the thing about Fahrenheit 451. It's pretty universally loved.  I just didn't like the writing or the execution. He had a great setting and a really good idea and it just...felt like he didn't do anything with it. But I think if I read it again I would appreciate it more. I went in I think expecting something different, so if I read it with my head in the right place I might enjoy it more.   Fahrenheit 451...   POKEMON!  The original version in the nineties, when there were 150 *good* Pokemon and that was it.   Or it could have Beauty and the Beast. I would have been super young.   I don't think anyone else would go with it so well.   fowl fowles fowl fowle   To be fair, what else would I mix it with?  Two of my favourites. Fuck yeah!   Songs a bit loud, can't really hear your bass line. Video looked awesome though, good production values.  Is this song difficult? I've wanted to learn it but for some reason I've never got round to it (...contemplative silence...)   Coke. Coke is the sweet nectar of the Gods.  But also: Budweiser/Captain Morgan's. (Depends if I'm in a lager or rum mood)  Coke  Coke  Tea (The other life-giving nectar of the Gods)  I dunno the last one.   Don't blame the devs blame the publishers don't blame the devs blame the publishers   Erm, didn't you see "A Series of Unfortunate Events."  Tsk.   On the morning the last Lisbon daughter took her turn at suicideit was Mary this time, and sleeping pills, like Theresethe two paramedics arrived at the house knowing exactly where the knife drawer was, and the gas oven, and the beam in the basement from which it was possible to tie a rope.    Thus, another issue with the elite controller. The controls do seem to be able to be ported towards PC, but look built for console. I don't know what they'll decide. Other than recommending a controller. Which, obviously, doesn't suit everyone.   Generally the aim of a thing. If things are generally seen as high culture - such as books. That's so. However something done solely for the pursuit of money regardless of any art...  Maybe that doesn't declassify from high culture. Maybe it does.   Same for anything. Film sequels made for bullshit money. Films are high culture, but are also art.   I don't care who likes what. I don't have anything against twilight, or erotic fiction in general. If something is done for a purpose, great. If something is done for money, then it ought not be culture at all.  Yes, I've opened myself up to a lot of backlash. I know that's a flawed argument. I would rather support a low end-indie film like 'Ink' than a blockbuster film made-for-money like 50SOG.   Tyrannosaur. Heavy Scottish. Also a great film. I would link to the trailer but they removed dialogue and made it musical for the exact reason that international audiences couldn't understand it.   I guess with full controller support. I heard them saying that you would use the 'silver' button the XB1 controller - which is referring to the Elite controller. I hope it doesn't rely on you having that. That's a damned nuisance expense if it is.    These days high culture is mostly anything that isn't reality TV. Some people might exclude TV altogether.   Mostly theatre. Some films (especially in cinema). Most books.    Didn't bother me as much in DA:I. I mean the first time I encountered them it was a dark cave and my fire spell illuminated the outline of a giant spider and I was like "fuck...get to the back, get to the back..where's my team!" Not a fun time.   After that it was ok. I don't know why fantasy has such a hard-on for giant spiders. Like in Skyrim when that giant spider falls from the ceiling in one of the first story missions. FuckyouBethesda.   Entertaining books are high culture.    I can't work out if you're defending poor grammar or the book...  Hmm?   This grammar is typical of someone who read that grammatically illiterate piece of shit book.  That's my problem with it.  Books should be high culture. Not reality-TV-level bullshit.  	112
    https://i.imgur.com/u7fu7TW.jpg   Then lumberjack-off.    I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my push-ups. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, *I simply am not there.*   You listen to the song by Megadeth.   lol this article literally has zero to do with politics. It's from a psychology website about an event which is a news issue and not a political one. The author barely even mentions anything political in the piece.

Learn your history before you post your pandering, smug may mays for le wise teenage redditors who just got out of school for summer and just completed their first government/civics course.    Lincoln wanted to kick free black slaves out of America and send them to British colonies because he didn't want them around and because he "didn't want racial strife" in America. *Freed* black slaves. For the not-so-smart among us, that translates to what we know and refer to as "black people" in modern day America here in the 21st century. I guess wise redditors knew that already though. I guess Lincoln is racist? Even though he was on the side of The Union as their leader and freed the slaves like wise *progressive* and liberal reddit teenagers were told with such pride and conviction by their burnt out Baby Boomer high school civics and government teachers who forced their students to watch MSNBC political talk shows for homework each week and regularly voiced their disdain for The Tea Party and FOX News in class any chance that they got? I'll wait for wise teenage redditors on Summer Break to figure it all out. After all, I'm just a racist, dumb, uneducated redneck who clings to my guns and religion and hates Obama. I'm totally not a highly intelligent, well-educated White male atheist from a heavily liberal metropolitan area outside of the South who doesn't own a gun and who voted for Obama though, right? Right.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linconia  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8319858/Abraham-Lincoln-wanted-to-deport-slaves-to-new-colonies.html  http://www.history.com/news/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-lincoln-slavery-and-emancipation  Sorry to interrupt your circlejerk here. By the way, Lincoln didn't really care about blacks much. He was opposed to slavery of any kind that enslaved a man or woman of any color, not just blacks. Big difference between him being opposed to slavery and that consequently meaning that he liked blacks or wanted them in America. Quite the opposite, really.  Try to come to terms with the fact that Lincoln and other American presidents and heroes were "racists" by the definition that redditors have of the word since some of them owned slaves and/or didn't think that blacks were equal to Whites. Good luck.       Maybe he'll rebuild his reptuation.    Mom needs to chill   Not long for this world. That's how long.    "You see that over there? Everything the light touches is our kingdom."

       This is incredible. I was so immersed in this video alone I was expecting the actual movie to start playing :(   I learned quite a bit from that. Thanks!      It really is the little things.      That's got to be the worst poster I've ever seen.         He is an awesome, awesome down to earth film critic/movie reviewer who is ultimately just a guy who loves watching and talking about movies.   1. What is your favourite Studio Ghibli/Hayoa Miyazaki film?  2. What made you want to get into movie reviewing?  3. Do you ever want to move onto something else? E.g. Directing, Writing  4. what are 10 films you think EVERYONE should watch?  5. How do you view the film making industry and where do you think it is going?

It's my favorite.   Is that...sarcastic or.....?   Yeah but I cant see how Mad Mac Fury Road is 'art'. It's a fun summer action movie.   I read that in his voice.    What he said.   Read it. Love it. Can't wait to the remake.   I agree with you there. But the supposive 'sexism' around Age of Ultron, 50 shades of grey and now apparently this is really quite pathetic.    This movie is going to be something. 'The Neon Demon' how does that not sound intriguing? Oh, it's also going to be violent and fucked up as hell.   This sounds so fucking stupid.   Oh boy, Ian McKellen....seeing that just brought a grin to my face.   Are you going to do a part 3?   I'm sick of this shit. Whenever a movie comes out there's always some controversy surrounding it. They're just movies for fuck sake, nothing more, nothing less. Enjoy them for what they are.      The fuck?   The.....The Fuck?  [here's](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3117504/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl) the IMBD synopsis. I kinda want to see this just to see what the fuck it's really about.   Beautiful film   What was the movie? I'm guessing Mad Max Fury Road.         It is a [copy](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/052610_dkrcover.jpg)      Wow, Hardy with that beard and haircut must meen that they are STILL shooting 'The Revenant' with Leo DiCaprio.    Oh man that just gets under your skin.   What the fuck was that first one about...?   Looking forward to the remake?      I'm not trying to emulate him, I never said that, I'm sorry If I even implied that. All I'm asking is how would someone go about doing that.   I'm not trying to emulate him, I never said that, I'm sorry If I even implied that. All I'm asking is how would someone go about doing that.   Not a dream but in Year 3 my teacher came up behind me and whispered "I had a dream about you last night" and then walked off. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but as I've gotten older it has just haunted me more and more. No shit, she actually said that.   For those of you who don't know Tyler Durden is Brad Pitts character from Fight Club (1999).  How would you go about becoming someone like that? Giving up all your material possessions, fancy car, fancy house etc and just completely let go of everything and "let the chips fall where they may" as he said (?)  It's just something that sounds really interesting? How would you go about it?    Same here. And that short montage that follows of him shooting people. Chilling.   That was the point. Stuff like that happens all the time in The City of God.   Not one Studio Ghibli film? Really?  Or are all of these TV shows?   It is a powerful film filled with disturbing and horrifying yet unforgettable scenes, which stayed with you after your first viewing?   Does anyone know of any other gritty batman art like this?   Wait, Nick Fury wasn't always bl... ind in one eye?   John Wick was pretty good. For what it was.      I'm pumped as for this!  I'm seeing this in gold lounge.   Say goodbye to all your Karma.   That was me exactly except with the second star wars teaser.....and it was the night before my final uni exam -_-   I figured.    I knew what it was I was just a little unsure of what it symbolized.   Oh I don't know, maybe the guy who wrote and directed the first incredibles?   Tom Cruise always wants new directors for M:I movies.   What's that supposed to be?   :D   What's the third one? I know theres Finding Nemo and this...   He will be. Sam Jackson confirmed it.      Taking my Grandmother to see The Wolf of Wall Street two years ago. We were both expecting a gritty crime drama in the vein of Goodfellas or The Departed. Man oh man....NEVER again.   For example there is an edition of Death of the family that comes with a Joker latex mask. There's another one for The Court of Owls that comes with a COO mask. I just wanted to know if their are any other editions like this or similar?   Hahaha   Now THAT is Mad Max.   It's Tyler holding a bar of soap.   Now THAT hits like a fucking bullet train.      My post or the one you just posted?   What? hahaha    *Plot? It's X-rated, it doesn't need a plot.*  Hilarious!      I think it needs to be updated. You should remove a few movies from the list as I have not seen hardly any people talk about some of them.  Also, I've been noticing some increasing circlejerking over famous cinematographers such as Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki. You may want to crack down on that before it gets out of hand.   Seen it. Love it.   Romantic Comedies that are extremely well written that deal with disfunctional people and/or families or other similar themes. Thanks!   Wait, so do they mean all that stuff about Nolan and Tarantino being gods and moon and interstellar being like the best films of all time?   /r/moviescirclejerk? Yeah what's with them??   DESTROY-E   Also, who decides what or who gets circle jerked?      Hey Dr. Z!  Just a quick question, why do teenagers or kids bully others?   He was good in the small part he had in unbroken. Maybe David Ayer can straighten him out in Suicide Squad.      This'll dominate the oscars.   What is that from? Please tell me.   If anything, your comment just spoiled it.   Spirited Away. Of course.      I see what you mean. Btw, how do you get little thumbnail superhero symbols like that? I can see you have Iron Fist as yours, how do you think of the upcoming show will turn out?   Im at a war with myself over whether or not to watch it. Is it good? Should I watch it?            Goblet of fire.  Each tournament is a climax in itself.   I can't believe I actually clicked on this.   /r/documentaries should help you more than us.      Hi Mark, I love your work! You are hard to pinpoint as an actor because you are so diverse and are always choosing new and different projects, I love it! You were great in Avengers and Foxcatcher, I cannot wait to see Infinitely Polar Bear!  I just wanted to ask you, what are your thoughts on the recent outburst of criticism against Joss Whedon regarding Scarlet Johannson's character, Black Widow?   Really?   It was shot on film, that's why it looks a little hazy. But I can asure you that that's a 1080p screenshot      All good dude! Enjoy, It's a good one!   The Cabin in the woods. It must be.  Awesome movie.   You have a point.    Spiderman 3 (I grew up with it)   John Wick, The Raid 1   2 and almost any marvel movie that isn't Iron Man 2 or 3.   Have you read the Dark Knight Returns?   And then to a boxing movie! (Mike Tyson biopic w/ Jamie Foxx)   This brought a smile to my face.   I can see pennywise there.   I've been waiting for this for years. Is this guy a good actor?   I think Adam Driver will do an excellent job as Kylo Ren. We know absolutely fuck all about him, but the dude looks intense.      Okay I need to watch this right now.

FINALLY SOMEONE!!!   **Inherent goddamn Vice**  This is a movie that just gets better everytime you watch it. I have no fucking idea what's going on half the time, but neither do half the characters in the movie and I bet Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't quite know either. And that's the beauty of it.

 Shiner and German Chocolate Cake. Thank you German Texans.      What was so great about them?   They can be baked or fried.  source: I'm a bean   Nah he was just pushing it up like a push pop and kind of scrunching down the sides. Pretty ingenious if you don't have a spoon.    Though you're being sarcastic, I am truthfully a kind person. I might falter occasionally but it's something I believe is a very simple way to positively influence your immediate surroundings.    Any who, he's not the subject, focus or punch line; the morning box of chocolate ice cream is. And my first thought was, "what's that dude eating", followed by "can't be ice cream", followed by "wow it is ice cream", followed by "I should take a picture", followed by "I want some now".   "Maybe there's one deeper, I'll just stick my dick in there and wiggle it around a little to make sure."   I've just never seen anyone eat straight out of a big box of ice cream like a push pop, at 8:30 AM and in public. Found it amusing, no judgement.  He honestly didn't seem healthy though. He was slurring when he was talking to the bus driver and was doing what looked like the heroin nod when he wasn't munching on his box.  Could have just overdosed on chocolate though.   Technically it's also ice cream after dinner.   You should have seen him when he was done.  The epitome of "I've made a huge mistake" face.   There's usually a wait on weekdays, it's just not an hour. Usually like 20 minutes. Maybe not in the summer though.   How much do you think letting go of Mankins contributed to this?    Oh my gosh, fake internet points I totally don't care about. Better whine.      That's Spurts for ya.   Transformers 4 has grossed a billion dollars though...   Like your mom.   Implying you are now OK with it?   I love to think that my mom doesn't lie when she calls me handsome.   If you're hung over every weekend for the past 7 years like clockwork, you're an alcoholic. It's OK, we've all been there. I've been there. I just don't have the same quick recovery time I used to so I had to cut back. It's not a bad thing, it's just a thing. But yeah I'm probably sheltered for pointing out that you spend 1/7 days a week hungover and that's not an outlier (which for your age range probably isn't - but this isn't just your age range).     Do you know what average means? You obviously cover the high range. A lot of people obviously cover the low.  Not that it's not bullshit, but just because you're an alcoholic doesn't mean everyone is.    Here in Canada and the US, we pretend we never even had concentration camps, and ours didn't even involve genocide.  Huh? Learned about internment camps in WWII in middle school and high school.   To invent your own life's meaning ***is not easy***  Apparently it wasn't easy to read to the end of the comic, either.   Can you expand on that at all or are you just being contrary?   Define douchey.    But think... you might not have such a high regard for the brand if not for those contracts.    If you have to ask...   Except you know, all the rich people that don't live like that, of which I'm guessing is the majority. But yah...   I mean, you're spending over 100,000k min to buy a fucking status symbol, it's inherently snobby. There are cheaper cars for the performance value but people don't usually buy Ferraris for the 'raw power'.   It's astounding to me that the majority of commenters here are surprised that a company that caters exclusively to the the rich is snobby about their product. *They fucking have to be.*   Not really. Brand integrity is crucial to their business model. It's stupid to not read what you sign though, yes.    They're not coming to Texas period :( I hate when that happens and I just don't understand why you wouldn't include Houston, Dallas or Austin in your tour. It's not out of the way between the West and East coast and there are a lot of people here.   Well, it says that exact thing on the song page, so there really isn't much to argue about.

Kind of the opposite really.    Here's some advice, don't let it get to you. Don't assume something that's just gonna make you annoyed. Why?   If only people could just ignore the things that they've already seen, or at least stay out of the comments so that the discussion isn't centered around how "we've already seen this; we already know this."   It's just a bunch of lame whiteys. You're better off not going.   He's basically a spider man clone, but a little different I guess. It came out in the past couple of years.

And it's almost like everyone doesn't see every single post ever posted to reddit. But thanks for letting us know you already knew this and for constructively contributing to the conversation.   I know. I expected them to be bland and uninspiring, like Flacco.   Joe Flacco's wooden personality led to the colossal failure of McDonald's Mighty Wings. He is so stiff and boring that even Colin Kaepernick's movie star looks couldn't carry the ad campaign.   k   It's not a pecan and it's not too big to be an acorn because it is an acorn.   Nah it's an acorn. Freeze it right when it hits the floor. Clearly not a pecan.   Ah yes, the episode with the Randy Newman.    Probably the other way around.

Makes sense, pizzas are born in ovens and not on stove tops.   Way more fun than the broken record that says "You must be fun at parties".   Damn thought I had top /r/NBA scorer on lock.   280 PPG and 5.85 Assists.  God?   I did the skillet thing for a little bit, but the toaster oven is just much easier, same result, and no extra cleanup. Can even throw the broiler on for a minute to brown the cheese.   Throw it under the broiler for a minute.   That's not a movie...   Half siblings =/= step siblings.  I think half siblings have the same genetic similarities as 1st cousins.   It's because procreating with someone you share familial genetics with (i think up to 1st or 2nd cousin?) has a pretty high chance of resulting in a genetically insufficient baby. And also the taboo factor.   I legit don't care about your sleeping habits.  Shares sleeping habits.   What if she was also black out?   Well, horseradish with mustard, starch and green food coloring.  Wasabi is hard to grow and cultivate, so most places outside of Japan feature the horseradish surrogate.   I think you really saw the brilliance of BB's coaching when Brady went down a few seasons ago and they managed 11 wins with what's his face.   Ha no I know. He's definitely a great coach. Definitely one of the best, and is one of the best 'talent managers' any sport has ever seen. The most talented team doesn't always mean they're the best team, but he made sure they were. I do however believe that from an Xs and Os standpoint, Pop is the front runner.  You don't just stumble into 11 championships by being a so-so coach though.   Well 8 of his 11 championships featured a player named Michael Jordan.   Man it would be so embarrassing if people knew I looked at naked ladies online.   I've heard way more vocal support for it's preservation into something usable.   Gotcha.   You said they can start buying houses after they go around the board once. Or I guess you just meant in the general construct of time.    :   Alert alert: alert   Duh alert: duh   I can't agree with that just based on the staggering amount of talent that was dumped in his lap. Now I think it takes a very special kind of coach to be able to lead those types of players, but I don't think he's as good of a coach as Pop.   But he isn't an editor. He's a random guy posting an article to a news aggregator site populated by pedantic, finicky assholes.   How can you buy houses without a monopoly?   It's not the key, it's the exploit of a broken game.    It could have been worded better.  Your title is worse though.    Health advisory: I don't really give a shit.    A warning about Russia.

I think we're more like Tom Cruise, arguably the biggest action star in Hollywood's history with just enough craziness and chinks in the armor to warrant some mockery.   	107
          I am using the term socialism because the system you describe, even if you consider it distinct, seems like a version of socialism.   The history of socialism is quite interesting. There have been many forms proposed. All retained the core elements of government (or community) control over the means of production and distribution, and a government (or community)  centric society at the expense  or individual liberty. Each form has had its own unique elements.   Did you know that Naziism and Fascism were actually forms of socialism? Both retained the classical elements of socialism while Naziism added extreme racism and Fascism added extreme Nationalism respectively.   You mentioned the Nordic model as a system you thought worthy of emulating. Albeit, that system works for those few countries at the present time, I do not see such a system working well in most countries. Such a system requires a stable, rich country of homogenous like minded people, in a very stable period in its history.  Do you think such a system would work in poor countries such as current day Guatemala,  or Sudan? What about countries in the Middle East with strong religious fervor?  What about those same Nordic countries during WWII?  I agree with you that the rich have an inordinate and unfair amount  of influence over the rest of the people. Rousseau complained of this as did Marx and many others since. I am not convinced that without oppressive and violent coercion by  government that such  power can be controlled. A revolution might stop such power abuses temporarily but historically a new clique of elites always arises, becomes wealthy, and then goes on to abuse the poor and powerless.   The history of governance has always been about royalty, warlords,  powerful elites oppressing the powerless and the poor. I fear such a condition is hard wired into human beings.  The only system ever developed that has understood this human reality and instituted steps to combat it is the US Constitutional based Jeffersonian republic model.  That system understood that man, left to himself would always revert to a system of elites imposing their will on the poor and powerless. That system created a series of checks and balances to control abuse of power. That system is slow and cumbersome but it does work. The three branches of government, frequent elections, a hard to amend Constitution, and a right of the people to keep and bear arms all assure that a truly abusive or controlling government can't ever succeed for long.   In the end, no government is perfect in controlling human nature.  Any form of government, including the one proposed by you, must grasp that.      The Nordic model seems to work because the population is homogenous and the countries' military security is heavily secured by the USA. It concerns me that such a government model is not sustainable economically if the US stopped supporting them militarily and the population changes and the welfare states become overburdened by immigrants from the Middle East.   I also fear that such socialist style governments have had an historically horrendous track record as it pertains to human rights and violence against their own people.                             So do you support a socialist political solution? Is there any government past or present that comes close to your government preference? I am trying to understand your views. Thanks   Always try to clear away your defective chute first or else your reserve chute is likely to get tangled up in defective chute and then splat..   So what government system or party do you recommend?   I agree with much of what you say. Much of the campaign will not involve debate of the issues and proposed solutions by the candidates. Instead the debate will consist of the Left claiming the Right is evil and racist. Each side will talk in platitudes such as "defend the middle class".   The only political entity that speaks of political change and means it is the Tea Party elements of the GOP. The Tea Party opposes not only the big government, big spending Democrats but also the establishment, old boy, DC insider wing of the GOP.   The Tea Party stands for lower taxes, smaller government, and less regulation. In essence it stands for greater personal freedom of the people.           She also plagiarized a recipe for a book called "Pow Wow Chow". She stole 3 recipes and claimed they were hers. She AND her husband also claimed to be Cherokee Indians in that book.    Top Ten nicknames for Elizabeth Warren who lied about being a Cherokee Indian for the purpose of stealing an affirmative action teaching position.     10)  Dances With Ethics  9)  Pinnocchahontas  8)  Sitting Bullshit  7)  Forked Tongue  6)  Poserhantus  5)  Hunts at Whole Foods  4)  Sackatheeconomy  3)  Hiataxa  2)  Lie-a-watha  1) Fauxcahontas   I mean Leftist, Progressive, Liberal, and Socialist.    Conservatives are against any political leader who holds Leftist positions regardless of race, sex, or any other factor. If Hillary is elected then we will oppose her. If Bernie Sanders is elected then we will oppose him.  The NYT shames itself by suggesting some racial motivation. I challenge anyone to offer proof that the GOP is racist, supports racist policies, or offers racist candidates.     "Romney made real conservatives stay at home and that's why he lost" to be incorrect.   and am ignoring those that simply don't or won't vote at all.   I believe you are missing the fact of the current schism within the GOP between establishment, RINO, DC insiders, and capital "C" Conservatives, Tea Party members, and Libertarians.  While the former group voted for McCain and Romney respectively, the later group stayed away from the polls. The latter group will not support any more milquetoast fax Republican candidates. If a true Conservative becomes the nominee then the latter group will support that candidate in force,  In the end a true Conservative candidate will have the vast support of the GOP, and with that the support of a significant portion of the Independent vote, will outnumber the 33% of the voting public that identifies with the Democrat Party.   Just as Obama energized the Left, so too will a Conservative candidate energize the Right.          The word "sheriff" derived from an old English government official called a "shire reeve". The shire reeve carried out various administrative duties for the king. The sir names Reid, Reed, and Reeves also originate from shire reeve.          http://i.imgur.com/dKobujn.jpg?1      Conservatives should also read "Liberal Fascism" by Jonah Goldberg. Read it slowly and take notes. It's a great book.          Thanks for the insight   I do not dispute the claim that the climate changes.  I have not been convinced that climate change is due to man's activity in a meaningful way. Obviously there is some anthropogenic effect.  I am concerned that all climate change models have been wrong. That fact alone proves that climate change modelling is imprecise and thus our understanding of climate systems is not well understood.   I am not convinced that rising CO2 levels is bad for the planet. Historically, CO2 levels have been much higher.  I am concerned that Leftist politics has tainted scientific examination of the climate.  I am concerned that grants and professional scientific advancement are dictated by those with a vested interest in claims of anthropogenic climate change.  I am concerned that those who are pushing climate change are opposed to the scientific method and continued study of the climate.  I am concerned that data on climate change has to be modified for various reasons.  I am concerned that the proposed solutions to climate change involve raising taxes, increasing regulation, and empowering elites.  I am concerned that those solutions will be very expensive and results are not guaranteed and at best would result in almost non existent improvements.  The bottom line is that this is an issue that should be determined entirely by scientists, who can offer reproducible results.  Concepts such as consensus, politics, gaia religious fervor, environmentalism, leftist ideology etc have no place in this issue.  Do you agree or not agree that this issue should be determined by scientists employing the scientific method and that non scientific input should not be considered?   There is no such thing as a scientific consensus. There is only the scientific method. Are you opposed to the scientific method?   Can you explain why NASA climate models have all been been wrong?   Just. Provide. Proof. That. The. GOP. Is. Racist   Can you explain the 18 year pause in warming?  Can you say what the normal earth temp should be?  Can you say what the normal level of CO2 should be?  Can you explain why every climate model has been so terribly wrong?     Actually it does. My world is entirely based on reality. If you disagree with me then you should use facts, logic, history, and debate me on why I am wrong. If you prove your point then I will concede that point to you. If you are wrong (as your claim that the GOP is racist) then you should be man enough to accept that you are wrong.      Please refer to my previous comment below. I realize you wish Hitler was not a socialist but he was. Did you know that the acronym "NAZI" stands for National Socialist German Worker's Party?   Hitler and Mussolini were life long socialist writers and supporters. Both philosophized newer, better forms of socialism that they believed kept the core beliefs of socialism (such as government control over the means of production and distribution and a community based society at the expense of individual liberty) while introducing more effective measures.        They formed their own versions of socialism (Hitler created socialism with elements of extreme racism and Mussolini created a nationalistic version of socialism.        If you ever read Marx, you would know that he viewed socialism as a point in a political continuum in which societies began as agrarian, moved into capitalism/industrialism, then evolved into socialism (which included "cooperating" and controlling some capitalist industries in the interest of expediency) and finally moving on to Communism.        The fact that Hitler and Mussolini used industries does not mean they supported capitalism. It means they were in keeping with socialistic doctrine of controlling (not just owning) the means of production.        As for your claim that Hitler killed all socialist and communists is partially true. Hitler, as a socialist (Naziism) favored his version of socialism and oppressed all other competing forms of socialism such as the communists. Hitler did not like communists because he thought they were too internationally focused, too theoretical, and contained too many Jews as members.     I bet you are also an MMA cage fighter, Special Forces trainer (possibly a Navy SEAL) and all the ladies love you.   No, it is obvious you are uneducated past a high school level and you are incurious of the world around you and are simply a follower. I am not criticizing you, I know I appreciate people like you when my car needs to be waxed or I need someone to serve tasty snacks at parties.   The bottom line is that I CHALLENGED YOU to provide proof and you simply could not do so. You failed plain and simple.  You proved that I was smarter than you and I appreciate the compliment.    Your comment shows that you are not simply uneducated but you are also uncreative. I see a bright future for you working with the public and serving them French Fries. Hahahaha   At least 150 other redditors have made that exact same comment before you.  If you ever make it to college, in one of your first year classes the professor will discuss the concept of "irony". When he or she does, please take extra effort to concentrate on that part of the lecture.  Good luck at college some day!  PS I hope you also take a history class.    At least we are both laughing. I am laughing at your lack of education and you are laughing at me being correct and exposing you for being uneducated. Hahahahaha   Seriously, have you/did you even graduate(d) from high school?    Praise Jesus! Welcome fellow member of the faithful! Who needs facts when we have FAITH! Praise God! Now please follow along:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwU-3HZx1vk   I know you feel the need to joke about this but please consider that I made a simple request for you to provide proof of YOUR claims and you simply could not do so.  I challenged your belief system and you failed to prove that it is based on fact and not faith.  I place you in the same category a some snake handling Pentecostal baptist minister in the hills of Arkansas preaching about Jesus. If I asked him for proof of his beliefs he would act just as you did and respond just as you did.  You and he are the same.       To say the current GOP politicians are not racist is to ignore overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  Such as?  Why can't you simply provide any?  Reason? Such evidence does not exist  You heard a claim by an uneducated person and now you parrot it.  That my friend is ignorance not education....   It is expensive to shoot but huge 50 rd magazine and non existent recoil make that gun a keeper.    When rights are created by government then they can be destroyed by government. The US Constitution is precious and unique.    Dude, all I am asking you to do is find me proof that the GOP is racist! Why can't you do a simple google search and find me a link that contains facts (not opinions) that the GOP is racist?  The obvious answer is that you can't. Please don't get mad at me because you are uneducated. Take this moment as a suggestion to get educated. Life will go a lot better for you if you lead an educated, factual life and not be lead by religions, sorcery, magical thinking, and willful ignorance.   Facts not faith  If you are in high school, graduate. If you are out of high school get your GED. If you have graduated from high school then try Community College.   Good luck   Hitler and Mussolini were life long socialist writers and supporters. Both philosophized newer, better forms of socialism that they believed kept the core beliefs of socialism (such as government control over the means of production and distribution and a community based society at the expense of individual liberty) while introducing more effective measures.

Hitler, as a socialist (Naziism) favored his version of socialism and oppressed all other competing forms of socialism such as the communists. Hitler did not like communists because he thought they were too internationally focused, too theoretical, and contained too many Jews as members.   Hitler, Pol Pot, and Mussolini were all socialists. Are you denying that?!!   You are obviously a racist. /s   Interesting how your desired form of government, socialism, has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. How did the policies of Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mussolini, and even Maduro "benefit average people"?                                             We agree that cops are too quick to resort to deadly force.  Can you offer any facts to prove that the GOP is racist, supports racist policies, offers racist candidates? This is a serious question. It is often claimed that they are racists but there is never any proof. I am asking you to simply do a google search and provide me with proof that the GOP is any more racist than any other group in the US.  The Democrats have a long history of overt racism in America: supporting slavery and fighting a war to protect it, Jim Crow laws, creating the KKK, segregation, etc.  Republicans were against slavery (remember Abe Lincoln?), fought a war to end slavery, Ike sent in federal troops to desegregate Southern schools because Democrat governors vehemently opposed integration.  Let's see if YOU can provide proof that the GOP is racist. This should be easy if what you claim is true.  Note: Please do not provide self supporting opinion articles from far Left web sites.   Thank you   I think you are confused. I am saying that the GOP isn't racist and the media claim that the GOP somehow condones or defends this cop's actions is false.   I personally think that cops in this country are too quick to resort to deadly force and shoot people.       What amazed me about Queenstown NZ was just how few boats there were on that lake.    Jesus is everywhere. So is Allah. Do you believe that simply because I say it? Without proof, your views are just your uneducated opinions. Sorry   Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig's disease...How did he not see that coming?   If you can't provide proof then you are admitting that it is a false statement. Come on, this should be easy to do if what you say is true   I asked if you graduated from high school because I asked someone else a question and you butted in and made a lame comment. That seemed like the type of thing an uneducated person would do.       Can you provide proof of GOP racism? If it is so pervasive then it should be easy to do....crickets   But did you graduate from high school?   GOP accepts the fact that the climate changes. We do not accept the claim that man is the major cause of climate change nor do we automatically accept the claim that rising CO2 levels is bad for the climate. We believe that the science of climate is not understood to the point that we can simply say "the science is settled". We should continue to experiment and study.  We are further suspicious of the field of climate science being co-opted by Leftist political motives. The issue of climate change should be determined by science and not ulterior financial or political motives.    I disagree that the science is separate from the proposed solutions. The two are inextricably linked and the solutions of raising taxes, expanding regulation, and empowering elites is the motivation for politicizing the science.    Can you provide proof of GOP racism? If it is so pervasive then it should be easy to do....crickets   GOP does not deny science. The GOP is resistant to accept issues such as man made climate change in which the science has become overly politicized with Leftist ideology. The Left's solution to climate change is the same solution they always propose: raise taxes and empower elites.    Why is that? Can you provide any proof that the GOP is racist or supports such killings? Do you even have a GED?   thanx   The person who made this video is shit...and now he's holy                                                After peeing you can shake it off      Why isn't the law of supply and demand effecting supply? If I were a company that made ammo and I saw high demand for 22lr, I would increase my ability to manufacture it. I would keep doing that until demand was satisfied and prices leveled off. Why are none of the companies doing so?                The public trial and sentencing of Obama to life in prison.   In the USA school lunches are just about Michele Obama being bossy and dictating what the common people's kids eat while her children in private school eat gourmet lunches.   Yup...... Haha   Typical liberal phoney. lol                     Voter turnout for past 10 election cycles is around 53%  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections  The link below shows party identity figures:  http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx   Simple math proves my point.  47% of the voting public do not usually vote.  Of that group, approximately a third identify as either Democrat, Republican, or Independent respectively.   Assume the entire 33% of Democrats vote for the same candidate.   According to you,  that fact alone would decide an election regardless of how the Republicans or Independents voted.  Result? Your claim is foolish on its face.        How do your figures in any way show how many people, of either party did not vote in any election?   Your comment that "The Dems decide if the GOP wins by turning out or not. " is ridiculous on its face.   Given how closely national elections have been decided, If either party had unusually heavy turnout they would win any given election.   If Ted Cruz or Scott Walker (or any other candidate that was acceptable to Conservatives was the nominee) then not only would the regular GOP voters vote for him but also the voting block that has stayed home for the past few elections would vote as well.   The result would be a GOP landslide win.       Conservatives are simply refusing to vote for RINOs anymore. This has been brewing for several elections and will continue to get worse. There is a real divide  within the GOP. Many Conservatives are calling for a third party or a real clensing of RINO elements from the party.    The Dems decide if the GOP wins by turning out or not.   You wish                     Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are favorites now. There is very little stomach for establishment or moderate  RINO candidates within the GOP. Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, even Marco Rubio have very limited support.   In the last election, huge numbers of GOP voters stayed home in protest over Mitt Romney because he was perceived to be just another big government DC insider.    Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are favorites now. There is very little stomach for establishment or moderate  RINO candidates within the GOP. Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, even Marco Rubio have very limited support.    As a Conservative I can say that the popularity of Jeb Bush within the GOP is misleading. He has no support from Conservatives and only has the support of establishment GOP DC insiders. As other GOP candidates enter the race he will fade into single digit support. He has zero chance of becoming the GOP nominee and thus zero chance of becoming president.     Hide the Japanese girls!   I could see it if he lived next door to a crack house...   Ditka is the only other bear to have more heart attacks      "ISIS"         Obviously all Liberals don't think that way but the vast majority of Liberal intelligentsia, leadership, policy makers, philosophers, feel that way.   Leftist ideology requires that a cadre of elites formulates policy and the common members follow without question.     Don't feel bad (seriously). All Leftists quickly bow out of any in depth debates. I honestly don't know why that is but I assume it's because Leftism and all of it's strains are ideological and not based on hard facts and careful analysis. Leftism is noble in it's proclaimed aims of elevating the common man and alleviating suffering but in practice those goals never seem to  get achieved. Rather, the Left seems to always get into trouble when anyone challenges their policies and coercion and violence are required to enforce compliance.   The woman in that picture was not risking her life to escape communism, the woman was escaping socialism, totalitarianism, any ism you want to call it but she was trying to escape having others impose their will upon her and coerce her into obedience.   Best of luck. Peace   The woman, and thousands of others escaped or tried to escape from East Germany during the cold war. They tried to escape a socialist government that built a wall and under penalty of death tried to keep people in. Why did East Germany do this? Why did the other socialist Warsaw Pact countries do the same thing? Why does Cuba do so today? Why does North Korea do so today?  Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. The Soviets, the Maoist Chinese, Castro's Cuba, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge (the killing fields), Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, etc to name the most egregious examples.  How can you possibly condone the actions of those socialist regimes?   ALL Communists are socialist.   Why do you feel the need to insult me? If you had a strong argument you would not need to do so.   PS over 100 redditors have made the exact same comment you made about my user name. Not very creative of you to do the same   That isn't a part of liberal ideology  Not so. Liberal ideology dictates that only poor people choose military service because they have no other alternative. Once in the military, those people are tasked with killing, raping, and oppressing brown people, usually for oil or resources, and as a result, become psychologically damaged and sociopaths.   A small "L" liberal is interested in power vesting in the people and not the government  A capital "L" Liberal  is a socialist who follows a strict Leftist ideology   That was pretty rude of that fireworks display to just barge in there like that.    So why was the woman risking her life to escape East Germany?   Those redditors who support socialism should consider why this woman risked her life to escape from East Germany to West Germany....            http://www.thomas-neger.de/                                 There may still be hope for America                     Another nail in the climate change coffin                                                      It's re-posted once a month and I up-vote it every time                             they're also statisticsly less likely to attack or commit a crime on someone of their own ethnicity  Chicago LOL         In the USA, libraries are just for old men who are too cheap to buy the newspaper and want to read it for free.    Hi Travis. Remember me? AHHHHHHHHHH  	199
    Originally went, "Poles, what the fuck autotldr?"  Read the article: Connecticut has strict rules for attaching things to telephone poles that make it quick and the cost (sounds) fixed. Also half the state jumped head over heals for this. Comcast is unhappy and still doesn't thing people need gigabit.   I used to always buy Intel, and it worked great. Still works great. My 7.5 year old laptop still runs very manageably for most things, including 720P video (1080P is a bit of a struggle). Then I read an article about how much of an asshole they are when I was working on an HTPC about a month ago. I went with AMD (they also have better integrated graphics IMO) and it's been running amazing and was probably half the price of a comparable Intel chip      Yes, exactly   So is this original theatrical edition, special edition, or special Lucas edition?   This seems cool for the elderly and those with lower leg muscular diorders/degeneration/other.  As an example person: when I was an RA in my undergrad, we had a girl who was usually in a wheel chair, but we would occasionally see her walking around (mostly just the building) with the elbow supported braces. Once she decided to walk to the Student Union. Not far by healthy individual standards, like a 2-3 minute walk. We had to call medical services to have someone pick her up/take her scooter to her because she was so exhausted by the trip she couldn't get up. This would have helped her a lot, especially when she over exerted herself.   Why don't they ever combine these sorts of things with a battery rather than trying to replace the battery? Seems like you could store the charge in the (super)capacitor, let it discharge into the battery to charge that or be used by that in real time to slow the discharge.  Seems like if that worked all you'd have to do is tap your phone on the wireless charging mat for 5 minutes to load the (super)capacitor then walk away as it slowly discharges through or into the battery   Better farming practices would include implementing drip irrigation systems instead of flood irrigation where most of the water is lost to evaporation. Sure it would be expensive to implement, but the water savings and should pay for it quickly and the yield would not be diminished.   I can honestly say books are a part of the reason I'm with my current girlfriend.  *The Name of the Wind* and *The Wise Man's Fear* specifically. They kinda helped kick things off and get us to really start talking   No, it doesn't. If, for example, an army base has no walls or security than another army base, but people are trying to get into the other army base more often, it does not mean the first base is more secure. It means that fewer people want to get in. While that does mean a lower chance of being compromised, as you say, that does not mean more secure.  More secure means that if there is an attack, or whatever, you can block it and not be compromised. Maybe that's through being more difficult to infiltrate or some other method, but a simple lack of attacks does not mean more secure   Being in a rental, I think I have only CFL or LEDs, definitely not incandescent. I'm not sure how to tell the difference cause I can't see the inside (where the CFL coils would be) cause they're all frosted   The problem is that the studios won't accept the message that is being sent. To make it easily accessible and affordable does not make sense to them. If they did that, then RIAA and MPAA would be meaningless because people would actually pay a fair-market price and they'd have no one to sue.   Also, based on the current model of people buying stuff they wouldn't get as much money, because more people won't buy a cheaper product (according to them). The same exact number will, cause that makes sense based on price.  	13

 I'm a guy, but I love the idea that even in such a story focused game with a Male lead, there are options to play as Female members of mother base for the open world missions. That's really cool, to me. I wonder how far it extends? Story missions are probably exempt?      This is great! Imagine if life was like Animal Crossing, everything be so simple y'all. This music would play every morning. haha  note: except tom nook would be our slave masters.    What about the game do you dislike? I think it's fair to say most people have experiences where the masses like something and you don't, there's nothing wrong with that :) plenty of games to enjoy after all :)   I borrowed MW2 from a workmate, I had huge problems with the way it portrayed militarism and heroism - it *felt* like propaganda. Didn't even finish it.   Noah. Underrated and amazing film.   Its the internet I spose theres always going to be some people complaining about something   Indictment on patriotism and allegiance, through a tragic lens vs a patriotism fuelled Tv show. Tonally very different series' imho   They are two very different characters opposites in intent and design too. But Kiefer is a good actor, because if anything Jack Bauer character in a game with the tone of "Platoon" is kind of incongruous.   But Kiefer already impressed me in trailers and GZ :)   I thought he was great in GZ to offer a counter opinion.    Snake and Bauer are completely different characters on opposite spectrums in many senses. That said Kiefer is a good actor and I doubt it will be the 24 jingoistic action man thing for Metal Gear.   Yeah, I heard that there is a ton of tapes, Videogamer did a great preview of the game on their youtube channel I highly recommend.   Yeah, I've been extremely impressed so far.   In Peace Walker, the tapes were specific to missions and stuff, so it will probably still be contextual. Videogamer's recent preview said they don't understand how Kojima Productions could have made as many tapes as they have. So I assume there are a lot!   To defend them they aren't the biggest studio and they have a lot less shackles on their systems than most games almost guaranteeing some bugs :)  They also have an insane ability to establish a sense of place.    I want an easy mode in dark souls - i've used guides but alt tabbing out of the world is immersion breaking. I love the atmosphere and design but I personally don't want a challenge in that way. I respect people that do though.  I also understand forcing no easy mode is Good to introduce people to new things. But I want a mod or something, personally :) i like the idea of less challenge.  Scared to write this post but there you have it :)   Codec calls are tapes now you can listen to them while playing its more convenient that way I reckon. :)      We would but the sub has self promotion rules :o :P   Sort of, if i could distill it i would say there would be:  1 skill/trait 1-100 for dialogue efficacy 1 skil/traitl 1-100 for combat efficacy 1 skill/trait 1-100 for magic efficacy 1 skill/trait 1-100 for stealth efficacy 1 skill/trait 1-100 for athleticism  None of those stats overlap into other mechanics, but if the game is designed with all those mechanics in mind it makes picking skills more of a "what i want to do" scenario instead of "how do i make my stats balance so my character good at this?"  Skyrim sort of does this, i think.      Yes and no.  Yes single skills for gameplay but have so many gameplay elements that upgrading those skills in different combinations and ratios makes it fun.  E.g.  I want to have a stealth assasin so I will put points into combat, stealth, and athletics  I want a stealth ghost so I swap combat for magic, so i can cast invisibility.  I want a wise talking theif? I choose stealth, dialogue and athletics.  Imagine the points directly correlating to how much X Y Z gameplay elements you wabt to engage with.  Instead of having dialogue split up amongst skills reverse it so the skills are split into specific mechanics.  	22
 Not no. 3. No 2 is a lie.   Aladdin was a really good film, and Robin Williams made it excellent. I miss Disney's hand drawn films...   I love animated films.    I use an iPhone.    I love Android.   But stock Android is aesthetically much better.   I would draw something today...   Baymax is the most lovable character :D   Do check it out, it's really good!   I loved Frozen as well!   Most of them aren't kid's movies these days. I am super-excited for Inside Out, which appears nowhere close to a children's movie.   Paperman is a really good movie. One of my favorite shorts, along with Feast.   Even I am a huge fan of animated movies! I prefer them over normal movies.   Up was awesome. I love most of the Pixar films.   Lion King is a classic.   But Fantasia 2000 was a disappointment :(   The Toy Story trilogy is simply amazing!   Aladdin was great, especially Robin Williams!   But it feels bad that Ego lost his job :(   Does it require proof?   Wall-E is amongst my favourite movies. A truly amazing movie, and my favourite Sci-Fi movie ever.    Musafa's death is the saddest part :'(   The Toy Story trilogy is truly awesome!   I've never seen a Miyazaki film :(   The Incredibles, like most of the Pixar films, is awesome.   I liked Wreck-it Ralph a lot, especially Ralph's and Vanellope's character.   Mine would be Big Hero 6 and Toy Story!   It's bloated and ugly.   The layer that Samsung puts over Android.   TouchWiz is bad.   TouchWiz.   implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed.   When are you planning to sleep?   Am?   What's the time at your place?   So, what's up?   Hey! Last night I was trying a difficult drawing, and I messed up :(   implying you shouldn't already have eaten them.   I love Vada Pav!   fuarte   **HOW DARE YOU MISSPELL OUR LORD'S NAME?**   Not SfR   **LJDAWSON LJDAWSON LJDAWSON LJDAWSON LJDAWSON**   Sorry for that.

BTW, is it the South or the North you are living in?   Cities here in India are madly populated...   We stay far away!   I have been obsessed with Disney and Pixar movies lately!   It's 7.38 pm here!   Still up?   k   KitKat     Hey, Grandpa!   What's the time there?   L   Hey, what's up?   Hey!   Big Hero 6  and Frozen!   I love the sub! Praise DuARTe!   /r/androidcirclejerk    BTW, what does your flair mean? I can read Hindi, but I cannot understand your flair...   Flounder = Nexus 9   But overheating?      It's good?   I might see Dumbo now...   You should see it. It's excellent!   I just finished Pinocchio!   Hi! I am watching movies...   /uj Don't. The touch issues are bad.   **DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE**   *Moderators are a lost cause, only Lord DuARTe can save us now.*   I am on a Disney movie watching spree!   41C here too!   India...   41C at my place!   Almost Monday here :'(   Sure! I will PM you once my college starts :)   I will try to do that...   That's what I want to do! But let's hope I can get there...   What are you planning to pursue?   I kinda attend often. Like, once a month... I am there for 10 mins or so...    I visited a temple today!   7pm here!   It's evening here :)   Even his face is a bit similar!   Even I am loving this site!   Yes, the expressions of Genie were amazing! And he looks kinda like Williams, too!   I'm fine! What about you?   His Genie's role is my favorite, though!   Yeah, but the movie was disappointing, not befitting to an actor of his calibre. The first part was excellent, though.   Sorry, the last one o saw was night at the museum 3, which was pretty disappointing :(   The last Robin Williams movie I watched in the theaters was Night at the Museum 2...   The voice of Robin Williams is excellent!   India.   I watched Aladdin yesterday, and I loved it too :)   I just saw Big Hero 6 and Tangled, and I loved them :D   Saw any movies lately?   Hey, what's up?   It's almost 3 PM here...   Yes, it's 2.15 pm here...   Even I loved Elsa's character! I just drew her, too...   Yes!   Unfortunately, my exams were going on when it was released :( Now, I plan to watch Frozen again...   It's 10.55 AM here...   I am curretly on a Disney movie watching spree... In 5 days, I saw Tangled, Big Hero 6 thrice, and Aladdin...   Yes, nearly opposte ends! Saw any movies lately?   India. Where are you?   It's 10.40 AM here!   I am fine. too :) What's the time there?   Tom's Hardware's Android 5.1 performance test apperars to be surprising, as I found the real-life performace of 5.1 much better than 5.0. It's silky smooth with no frame-rate drops.     Hi! How are you?   I think it might be either Tintin or Baymax for me!   Abki baar DuARTe sarkar.   ICS   Damn, he's... DuARTe.   Do you deem yourself worthy enough to wear them?  	113
 I got bored halfway through the first and haven't watched one since       From an evolutionary perspective, all that is irrelevant. Intelligence is definitely beneficial.  When a species is developing intelligence, what they might do with it on lard scale thousands of years down the track is not relevant at all   But they did - we come from lizards      Well it was a good sub   A L I M O N Y  L  I  M  O  N  Y   What's the rebuttal?   Big ones may not fit in your car's cupholder.      Agreed. But when you buy a giant ass suit, have someone practice using it all week and write a fucking theme song for him, you gotta milk it.   TIL that meeting someone is badass   Wouldn't it be Batmans because it's a proper noun? If my name was Steve and I cloned myself I'm pretty sure it would be correct to say "There are two Steves"      Go to bed   Are you retarded? Both controllers are valid options for most games. Maybe he would have preferred the Steam Controller for its unique options but not having rechargeable batteries made the WiiU Pro Preferable.      I thought Reddit wasn't trying to monetize itself and ran off Reddit gold?   motives  No, we are assigning names to acts, not motives to animals.  If you have two dogs, and one is well behaved and the other attacks anyone on sight, it is perfectly fair to describe one as violent and aggressive. But to you they're not... because using those words would be anthropomorphising them.  So what's your solution: come up with new words, or pretend both dogs are exactly the same?      Definitely a memorised act from what I've seen.   Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to enhance their acts.   Their live act seems to fit this definition of standup routine perfectly. Maybe if it's a group it isn't considered standup? But sounded like the right word to me.  Semantics aside, yes, I'm referring to their live shows.   You're right, but they didn't say that. In which case it makes them hypocritical. Which is also within their rights.   I'm just curious to know if they actually broke a specific rule/I'm overlooking something or if the mods are being hypocritical or making excuses to ban specific subs.   I have no idea why you think I thought they need to be lawful or fair, I understand how the Internet works.   So they'd be fine with those subs in the long run, it was just too close to the original banning of FPH?   Right, but it was different people making these other subs, with a different set of rules. Can it really be called ban evasion? They're making a place to avoid the mistakes FPH made.   Unfortunately, my post tracking informed me it would be arriving with the scammer today, so I hastily tied it to a GoG account. The account is empty so I could sell you the whole account, but I can fully understand if you don't want to take that option. As of now I'm just considering it a loss.   These subs weren't even around long enough to break the brigading rule. Why where they banned?  What exact action should fatpeoplehate have taken to not avoid getting banned? How could I go about re-creating that sub with a few changes to prevent in from being banned?      I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.   Why were those subs banned, if they technically didn't break any rules?   You understand that plenty of bullies also have great self-esteem, right? I hate this idea that anyone that is mean must be doing it because of 'their own problems'. Some people have everything handed to them on a silver platter, along with looks and health, and still enjoy picking on others.   Honestly, I think you're really overstating the problem. Fatpeoplehate gave a lot of people a place to go and discuss that kind of content, sure. But now that it's deleted I can't imagine the average FPH user going out of there way to post that content elsewhere. It's too much of a hassle, you will get into too many arguments and just find most of your posts banned, have to constantly be making accounts, etc. It's too much hassle and it won't even come close to what made browsing FPH entertaining.  I, personally, loved FPH, but after it's deletion I'll simply continue to post relevant things in other subs and slowly forget it ever existed. The average FPH user is probably more likely to do that, then try and 'fight the man'.   The thing is, this law basically decides what you consent to and that's that. I'd be interested in seeing how this case plays out in court though.   I'll take the downvotes in stride.   Sounds... boring tbh.   Because the cast was awful.    As the YouTube commenter that lead me to asking this question puts it:  Do women toss their ass at Yo-Yo Ma?? Or is that just Rock and Rap stars?   Is it possible that you are biased towards Yo-Yo Ma and know who he is and that is colouring your perception of his music?  Would you feel the same 'passion seeping into the music' if you did a blind test of 10 musicians, 9 of which are random classical musicians and the 10th is Yo-Yo Ma?   Yes, it's still available. How would you like to sort out payment?   Why would they ban it, it hasn't broken the rules. Are you legitimately retarded?   Already lodged. My main concern is he will use the code in the next few days and eBay will do nothing. I'd prefer to be proactive.   I'm definitely going to give it away if no one buys if before then. If I lose it, I would prefer it to be to a stranger than a scammer.    So I recently purchased The Witcher 3 physical. However, as it was shipping, a friend purchased me the game on Steam. When the physical box arrived, I decided to sell it on eBay. I wrote the CD key down as I was also planning on selling it online. Eventually someone on eBay purchased it. Unfortunately, after I shipped it, they instated a chargeback. I do not use eBay often so when I checked his history, I noticed he had no prior purchases and his username was a random string. I contacted him and he responded by saying he has no intentions to send me the game back unless I pay for shipping (which he says is somehow $30).  **Long story short**, I've obviously been scammed. Fortunately, I have the GoG key. I want someone to use it before he the package arrives at his house. If anyone is willing to purchase it, I'd be willing to arrange some sort of exchange. We can work the details out, but I'd feel more comfortable receiving payment in advance if possible. I can show you the chargeback in a screenshot as proof that this occurred. I will charge you the price as per GoG in your country so you're basically just buying a digital copy of the game from me.

He can't control the version of himself that makes choices over those 10 seconds, so he can't game the system by using the extra time to think or by using trial and error over a series of visions. He also can't use his power within his power, ie the version of him in a vision would never choose to use his power. He can, however, use his power, do something, and then immediately use his power again to see what they thing he did changed.  Round 1: Both Tyson and Lee are at their peak.

Round 3: One overdrive use, magic as per round 2, default weapons.  I understand the ambiguity between cutscenes and battle, just try and bridge the gap as best as possible.

We have moved from Vic, to Nsw, to NT. I will be moving to Adelaide next month.   No problem   Also I'd like to add if you actually read my post, you would notice that while we split the bills, it was far from an even split. I definitely put more into assets and I think I paid more on rent and bills in the years leading up to the last year and a half.   1. Because she is kicking me out and trying to keep all the things we bought together, so I would like legal grounds to take what is mine. So, ethically, she is the one that needs to 'man up' and give me what is mine. I would just like legal support instead of trying to take it by force. (For example, I paid 12k for the car, she paid 8k, but it's in her name, you're saying I don't deserve at least an even split of that amount? Not that it matters, because I'm asking for LEGAL advice, not your opinion).  2. LEGALLY a de-facto relationship IS entitled to a 50/50 split.  Under Australian Law, separating de facto couples have substantially the same rights and liabilities as those of married couples with regard to property settlements. This includes claims for spousal maintenance and superannuation splits.  So, morally, I think she owes me since she is trying to keep more than a fair share of things - after cheating on me - including personal property that I paid for out of pocket (the majority of assets I believe I paid for to begin with).  And legally, up until a year and a half ago I was entitled to a clean 50/50 split of assets and finances. I am wondering if those rights still hold considering the change in finance arrangements over the last month.  **Finally**, this is a board for legal advice, nothing else. "Man up" isn't legal advice. I'm asking about my legal rights so take your useless advice to another sub.  I mean, seriously, you want to live in a world where someone can cheat, kick their partner to the curb, and keep all their things? You want me to roll over and take it? That isn't manning up, that's being a little bitch and letting someone walk all over you.      I started flossing several months ago. Sometimes daily, usually every 2-3 days though. There is usually a bad smell released following the pluck, even if no food is trapped there. Is that normal?   If it helps, I never would have noticed if you didn't point it out.   Basically, for about 6 years me and my girlfriend split all expenses. I can't say it was exactly 50/50, but the point is it may as well been because no one ever questioned whose money was being used on expenses. For the first few years we did do an even split, but we gave up on that idea after some time. For some periods, I was probably paying more and vice versa.  However, around the 6 year mark, we moved cities and I went back to Uni. My girlfriend got a full time job and handled all the expenses. I've been trying to find part-time work for a year and a half with no luck (truthfully, I was looking for full-time work for awhile, got a job, then realised I wanted part-time considering it would delay Uni graduation by 4 years, hence why it took so long to find part-time work).  Recently, I she started behaving funny, being generally unpleasant, and then I found out she was flirting with some guy at work. We broke up, and she's going to go sleep with him now.  The thing is: she has most of the money. It's hard to say why, because we really, really didn't keep track of expenses. I know I bought her considerably more expensive gifts over the years, there were periods I was paying more of the rent, etc., but somehow I currently have nothing. I think most of it disappeared because I was paying small bills with no income to my bank account over the past 18 months, while she paid big bills, but at least had a steady account due to working. The main expense, rent, was paid exclusively by her.  The split is $1200 in my account, about $12k in hers, plus she legally owns the car that we share.  So: am I entitled to any of that money? Technically it has been far from a 50/50 split for the past few years, but there was a mutual understanding that it was OK for me to leave my job and look for part-time work as we were trying to set ourselves up for our future, so Uni was more important (I graduate in six months by the way, what timing!). Am I entitled to any money?  **TD;DR:** Broke up with girlfriend of seven years. For first 6ish years we paid no attention to who paid for what and treated our money as combined, but expenses became unequal for the last 18 months. She now holds most of the money. Am I entitled to anything?   Tina Fey's name, Tina Fey.   Google her name you cockhead   And they're not even real friends   It's shit   Gold.   This is what I hear   :(   Isn't the joke still on you, since she wouldn't have got the movie anyway and you took a beating for nothing?   Tina Fey   Yeah, but that's usually MFF not three women   Be willing to move anywhere - even overseas - and your employment options will improve from bleak to slightly less bleak   Basically I want to sort my music folders by their filesizes.  I have artist  album  tracks folders. I want to sort artists folders by the contents of all the subfolders within them, by filesize.      Basically, two girls in a relationship, where one of the girls is dominate over the other and forces the sub to watch her fuck other women?   We have this thread every year!   You also don't have to deal with a new 30 minutes of setting the background, characters, exposition, etc which imo is one of the biggest 'chores' in a movie.   You might be eating healthier  It would be more fair to say you are eating fewer calories. Some 'healthy' foods are higher in calories than unhealthy ones.   Don't forget to work the balls.   Half-Life 3 was a given  I don't think so. For a while, we were simply waiting for Episode 3. Since it took so long for Episode 3 to come out, people began speculating that it must be Half-Life 3, because there is no way they'd wait all these years and just release a small followup to Ep 2.  No one really knows what happened internally though. Maybe they wanted to make Ep 3, but changed their minds to HL3. Maybe there never was meant to be an Ep 3. Maybe they purposely decided to backbench HL3 to work on more lucrative projects. Maybe they simply kept delaying it for one reason or another and realised one day "oh shit, we're sitting on another Duke Nukem Forever".  Valve is too secretive and we don't know.  However, at this point, working on Half-Life 3 definitely would be 'going back' as it's a project that's been in limbo for awhile, not something they've been consistently working on.      People are actually upvoting this and downvoting posts for calling it out for being three years old?    When you walk into a theater, should they have the staff there ask if you've like to give your money to charity before seeing the movie too?   Thatsthejoke.jpg   So basically, I'm a short male (5'5'') and quite skinny (57kg). I've never owned a suit before and no stores in my area stock suits that will fit me (a blow to the ego!) but I need one for my new job.   I decided to buy online, but since I can't find suits in store nor do I own a pair, I don't have any measurements.  So my question is basically: where do I measure myself and what are the most important measurements to look for?   Additionally, will there be a high degree of consistency (if I measure X and the store says X is there still a good chance it won't fit due to variables in body shape, size conversion between countries, etc).  I'm Australian and looking to buy from a British website (Asos) since they seem to have a good return policy and lots of smalls and extra smalls.  Edit: Forgot to specify, mostly looking for the suit jacket as I already know my pant size.  Edit 2: Just occurred to me, suit styles may affect the answers? What would you recommend for an accountant in terms of style? Am I overthinking at this point?   What a fat fucking cow, please never post her again.   Why do people post this shit.   And how is this reconciled with the fact that male/female brains (to my knowledge) are on a spectrum, not simply a male brain and a female brain.   I still do actually, we live nearby and I have a house key. I have come and gone greet since most of my stuff is still in her house   I need the files ASAP for work, I'm willing to take the risk   No idea about secret questions, tried it and couldn't remember. Phone number is for a number neither of us use anymore   Some of you will want backstory, so here you go: Long story short, my ex-wife locked me out of our joint gmail account. There are important emails on there as well as photos of when I took out scene overseas that she claims she will be deleting. I do not put this past her. I have spoken to a lawyer about getting a court to demand she give me access, but I'm worried she will delete important emails by then. My best chance is a keylogger, although I fear they're already gone.  I understand I can maybe recover these emails by contacting Google, but I sincerely doubt they're give them out.  tl;dr: Need keylogger to steal access back to a join email account. It does not need to be amazingly discrete, she will not think to look. Just something that won't have any popups, doesn't show up in taskbar/task manager and so forth. I can circumvent antivirus software myself, but one that doesn't appear there either would be an extra bonus.  Edit: Bonus points if it can run itself at startup without anyone knowing.   Specifically one of these  http://www.pullupbarsg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/top-features6263.jpg  Would it cause the concrete to crack?      It happened awhile back. He was talking with Australian troops on TV, one of them told a story about a soldier (or soldiers? memory is a bit fuzzy) dying in war (might have been his friend?). Tony Abbot's response was "well, sometimes shit happens".  He got a big backlash for it and his PR response was that the quote was taken out of context (you can watch the video and decide for yourself, but it clearly wasn't).   This news reporter was confronting him about it and asking him to explain the 'context'. Abbott realises he can't, and for some reason acts like a child by bobbing his head. He can't admit he's wrong, but can't find a good excuse.   You can condition most animals to respond to any sound. I can get my rabbit to come to me by making a clicking sound with my tongue.   The only reason I'd be hesitant to do this is because he'd probably chuck a hissy fit and you'd need to find someone else to certify your marriage.   I asked if most do, not why some might.   Damn!      So I have a legit copy of Windows 8. I plan on taking advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10. As I understand it, as long as I upgrade to Windows 10 in the first month, then it's mine for free forever?  My question is, if I decide to fresh reinstall from my Windows 8 disc, say, 13 months after the free month ends, will Microsoft know that that copy of Windows 8 has used the free upgrade for Windows 10, and allow me to get it for free then?  I guess another way of asking this is: is it free forever and linked to my copy of windows 8, or is it simply free to acquire for this period and thereafter I will have to pay if something goes wrong with my drive?  I ask because I happen to be having drive issues at the moment.   For example, I'm browsing Reddit and GameFAQs flawless. I can Google search just fine and I'm downloading a game on Steam.  However, most websites return[ this message](http://i.imgur.com/NeyK7eF.png) (including Gumtree, eBay, Paypal and others).  Disconnecting and reconnecting to my Internet connection (through router settings) seems to breath temporary life into my connection, causing some (but not all) of these websites to work again - although usually they won't work. It's often the same set of websites, but not always, that give issues. It's the majority of websites that DON'T work. Occasionally I crawl to a snail's pace even when everything is working.  This has been happening for months. There are periods where it will be like this for days or even a few weeks, followed by periods of flawless browsing. I have replaced all the hardware (router, cords, filter, etc) I can and tried multiple browsers and devices (the websites that don't work are usually consistent between theme).  Finally, sometimes pages will just partially load - usually a lot of text on the far left side of the page (basically, only the text loads with no formatting or images).  So... what's up?  (ADSL2, Dodo, Australia)      Where exactly is the cringe? They invited him on stage, handed him a trophy and he gave a thank you. Where is the 'mistake'?   I swear my work colleagues shrink an inch or so when I bump into them on the weekends.   A master of CQC vs the billionaire detective.  **Round 1:** Bruce vs Snake in a hand to hand fight, no weapons, no armour. First to surrender, die or become knocked unconscious loses.  **Round 2:** Stealth. Batman and Snake a placed in the woodlands at midnight. Snake has his camo suit/tranq dart, grenades, guns and other gear - and Batman his suit and basic gadgets. First to 'tag' the other person wins (this can be accomplished by sneaking up on them and touching them, hitting them with a batarang, tranq dart, etc. Basically just 'get the drop'). Who is most likely to succeed).  **Round 3:** Two identical Metal Gear Rex's are on the lose, wreaking havoc. Snake hunts one, Batman hunts the other. Who defeats their Rex first? They get the same gear from previous round (can't call airstrikes in or Batmobile, etc).   I'd be ten times worse.   That's different because they were cheating by allowing an outside participant without using Phone a Friend.  If they use phone a friend there is no problem with them Googling it. They even addressed this when they replaced Phone a Friend (it's now Ask An Expert or something like that) by saying a lot of people were Googling so it was spoiling the point of the lifeline. People have done it for ages with no consequences. It is allowed.   then to mention there is no type of matchmaking at all so you need to fight anyone you randomly find  True, but this gripe isn't For Glory specific. In fact neither is the point about lag.   Then your issue is with pay inequality.  Let's say in an alternative universe, Sting earns the exact same amount in an upfront payment for writing the song that he would have received in royalties up to his death in our universe. Are you still complaining about his pay being too high? If yes, then royalties aren't the issue - you just don't like the earning potential of musicians.  If no, then your point doesn't make sense.  You're literally just disliking a specific form of compensation. Removing this option will have serious consequences on the economy, potential business contracts, copyright law, etc. Hell, royalties are also really aren't that much different from rent. You make something, then you live off that investment. I guess renting houses shouldn't be a thing either.    I have almost completely negligible lag, is it really that big of an issue with others?   For Glory in general at that. I might be wrong, but it seems to be the consensus online that For Glory, particularly 1v1, is bad.  It seems odd to me, considering this is typically considered to be the 'competitive' mode. You don't see people complaining about standard layout Chess matches being bad because of tryhards, etc, and advocating for random starting positions or other variations that often.  Not many people want to see games like Dota 2 or CS:GO become casualised.  So why does Smashbros draw so much ire towards it's For Glory modes?   I don't think so, since it's asking for examples rather than asking for coverage of a specific period (eg. "Was there civilizations that did not have gods?" vs "What was life like in Medieval Europe?" (which covers many centuries and locations)).   http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/633202-super-smash-bros-for-wii-u/71888639   That's [blank] af.   The royalties are part of the pay. Imagine how badly you'd damage the economy of royalties couldn't exist. It's part of the overall compensation package for the work you did, you just get it later and it's a potential gamble. I'm fail to see how it's pay for doing nothing   How is it an issue that she hadn't heard of them? Who cares?   Why you say that?      But on da surface   I have no issue with that   And soon they'll be sisters based on that recent interview       Yeah, or is experiencing a life of crippling loneliness.   As others said, it's not perfectly lined up with months at all.  However, even if they were, it would just be a coincidence. When there are millions of man made concepts and millions of biological functions, it's not that farfetched to think a few variables might line up.   Most girls aren't even 28 days. my girlfriend's are 22 days apart.   Me too. Thing is, I kind of want everyone to know how I've been manipulating them because it would feed my ego   You share your Reddit posts with your girlfriend?  honey, come quick!

 When I came home late last night, I found my wife with another man. I was furious, and to hold myself back, I sat down and drank from a bottle that was left on the table. Then, I sang a song to cheer myself up. When I felt a little better, I looked around, and said to myself, 'Shit, this isn't my house,'.   I sort have to agree with what you said.

[PokLogic is best logic](http://www.rarecandytreatment.com/comics/998955/irony-in-a-pok-shell/#cpage)   I was in 6th grade. I woke up in the morning and saw my mom crying in front of the tv. She told me I still had to go to school. Everyone was talking about it on the bus. I remember joking about it, making nazi and muslim references to it with a mormon friend of mine.  I got to class and every single teacher had the tv on. If they wanted to do the lecture, they'd just turn the volume off and continue with the lesson. One teacher, being a veteran and having his brother overseas already, scraped the entire lesson and just had us watch the news. He told us on a later day that he would like to put Osama Bin Laden in a chair and have pigs eat him alive, like in Hannibal.   A few months later, we went toilet papering in our neighborhood. Got the wrong house (we thought it was an acquaintance of ours), but it ended up being a muslim family. Cops were called (I ran). My brother and friends told us the family thought it was a hate crime, some sort of retribution for what happened. My friend (the mormon one) made them cookies, and everyone cleaned up the mess. All was well.  But those were some fucked up times man.    [I read this in Terry's voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZx5OgKQNrA)   Your opinion is valid, though your word choice is poor. These are people that are completing who they are as a human being, who they know they are inside and out.   transgendered  transitioned   became fabulous.  became whole        No, the government says theres an Orange County and a Los Angeles County. Then, there's tons of cities in both of those. The locals, know there are differences. My ORIGINAL comment about Anaheim, you know gay club, not talking about freaking maps and jacking off to pictures of maps, was that people that visit Anaheim think it's Los Angeles. It's not. So that's all I'm saying. I wasted so much time arguing with a 19 year old about symantics. Goodnight, man.   Different laws, ethnic populations, local history; honestly your argument is bizarre at best.   I completely agree with you. But can I just say, for a slight comment I made about Disney indirectly having a gay club, this is so wildly off-topic?   Trans is an umbrella term. Pre-op, post-op, dress at night, dress in bed; it all boils down to, and I kid you not, be polite and ask how the person in question wants to be identified.  In that sense, gender and sexuality are two different things.   It's all really complicated and hard to explain. I might suggest popping in to an AskReddit and be like, "wtf, someone explain this to me." That could be funny.  Edit: Oh, also, genitalia are none of your business. I couldn't think of a nice way to put that, but it's true. I have been put down for asking about that myself. Good way to get smacked. I don't suggest it.   So who has more credibility in the matter? The spectator, or the gladiator in the colosseum?    Same, if I walked in to a party in LA and told them I was from LA, they'd be like, yeah, where. I'd be like, oh I was raised in Laguna Beach. They'd laugh their asses off and tell me I'm not from LA.   ... Have you been to Orange County?

And with a few new laws going forward in California about drug related crimes, and segregation based on race (sexuality and gender seem like safety issues to me, but whatever), its really anyone's guess what will happen.   Yeah, hence the deletion. I'll be civil.   So before it was more mainstream to be gay, lesbian, whatever, individuals that didn't fit within gender archetypes didn't have the luxury of being in the closet. Men with higher pitched voices, intersex individuals, women that had no interest in feminine things. These people were the first to be out, and were usually ostracized for such. They probably didn't want to 'look' or 'act' queer, because it could mean death, imprisonment, your life getting turned upside down. People within a percentage of our population don't fit gender archetypes, it's most likely a mix of genetics and upbringing. Some parents know their child will end up gay. Some are thrown for a loop.  The world is a funny thing, but it takes all the colors to make a rainbow.  And i was being a dick. So here's my take. My apologies.   Yeah, there is a high chance of them being picked on/sexually assaulted, especially more femme individuals.   There's nothing wrong with being femme. This whole dichotomy of 'masc' and 'str8-acting' and 'femme' or whatever, is really all just ingrained fear about being labeled different.  Though, yea, like I said in another comment, my boyfriend and I wouldn't fit in much of the 'gay' gay category, but we also don't call ourselves masculine, at least in the serious sense.   My boyfriend and I are pretty 'masculine' (Edit: Parentheses matter), but I'd for sure go to the special area, and i don't know any gay clubs in LA.

Hi Nina! Dedicated listener and supporter of my local NPR station (KCLU),  I have a question about same sex marriage. My partner and I are both young, and have been flirting with the idea. When it comes to the news though, we're both extremely confused what's going to happen. Both the states we currently live in have legal same sex marriage, but what court case would take it to the Supremem Court? Why was it such a big deal that the court passed on hearing the case before them?  Again, thanks for doing this AMA!   And why don't we buy that land from the Tanzanian government, then hand in to the Maasai? From what they are be compensated, it doesn't seem too expensive.   I simply think too many people are misdiagnosed, or are really addicts, and not suffering a mental disorder, and then some are doing both, and some are neither, just like doing drugs...  And enough is enough. Let's take away a BIG problem, for an entire year, and see what's left, BEFORE we pump people full of pills and put ideas in their head of diagnoses. Maybe?   http://www.leafscience.com/2014/09/13/marijuana-rem-sleep-dreams/   My dreams were all about smoking, intense paranoia, or regret. For awhile.  I havent dreamt about smoking in 9 or 10 months   For me, the hardest time was the first 3 months. I had to understand why they were difficult, so I read a lot of material on withdrawal symptoms. A lot of which can be found on the Marijuana Anonymous website.  Also, out of sight, out of mind. I didn't keep mementos or pieces or pretty bongs.  I drank a ton of water. I limited fatty foods. I kept in contact with people that would support me, and just eventually stopped talking to the ones that rather me just smoke with them. It was less deliberate, and more natural.  I got a job as soon as possible, to eat up my time. I'm already a trained dog groomer, so it wasn't that difficult to find one. Especially since by month 4, I was pissing clean. Problem was, most of my grooming was done high, so their was a bit of relearning to do that I'm still dealing with a year later.  I can't really tell you much what to do, but if you have any other specific questions, I can tell you what worked for me.    Since I was 16, so... 7 years?   The amount of race-related humor that gets on the front page of r/funny alone makes me sick. I think ^ this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

My partner lives really far away [that's us, me in front](http://i.imgur.com/34lzpiP.jpg), and I've been kind of new here still, so a community would make me feel more at home. Also, a show sounds like it'd be a sick idea, if we could come to some sort of consensus of what sounds good. That's where hiking might be the better idea... not sure. Any who. Peace.   [A designer dog maker regrets his creation](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201404/designer-dog-maker-regrets-his-creation)  I love telling my clients this story.   [Just look at him... thirsty for bitches...](http://i.imgur.com/4FN3zI9.jpg)      You raise an interesting point, taxation and dogs, specifically gun and working breeds.  Back in Europe a hundred or so years ago, working dogs and the sort were not taxed. They had their tails docked to prove it. 'Pet' dogs had full tails, and were thusly taxed.  Modern day licensing has nearly wiped out canine rabies in America, and can be very helpful in returning dogs to owners when lost (micro chipping yeah, but again, not everyone does that).   I think of it as a dog census. In the grooming world, that break down of breeds that are registered pretty closely matches what I see in the salon. It's good to know what breeds come in in my community to know what tools and the like I'll need to buy.    dog licensing is important. rabies verification is important. frugality is pathetic.  any who, I was being a bit tongue and cheek.   get a few, put them in quarantine, and hit me up. let's talk rich Beverly Hills people business.   that's sad.... now i'm sad....   http://www.laanimalservices.com/laws-policies/animal-licenses/  dogs cost like $13,000 in a lifetime, if you can't afford $20 a year, don't get a dog lol   So here's the thing, or few things...  Not everyone in LA County, or anywhere, registers there dog. Plenty of reasons. Illegal immigrant, bench warrant, conspiracy theorist, tons and tons of reasons. Also, they don't believe in rabie revaccinations?  Another thing, these least common breeds, are the only one registered in the county. I didn't see that breed but it is most for sure in LA somewhere. Just not on this data sheet of registered list for one reason or another.  By the by, love me some viking-esc puppies. So cute.

Probably the internet. Scruff, grindr, OKCupid. But not always, as in the words of Frank Sinatra, "Love is a many, splendored thing," and can happen anywhere. Having a network of friends and people you know who are also gay or bi can be a life saver.  Coming out is an everyday process. It is safer in this country then ever before.

I was addicted to weed and alcohol... and pills were fun. Mostly weed. 2 rehabs (1 outdoor wilderness), 4 hospital stays, and a host of doctors visits. Compounded with me being gay and lacking common sense, I was a high risk for everything and anything. I was in it balls deep for about... 6 years, with breaks in-between.  I moved with my partner to a new state, created a new hell for myself, went to a hospital (like seriously, being catered to is what gets me off, hospitals, doctors, rehabs are like icing on an awesome cupcake of addiction), and i said enough was enough. I started in a program, left the hospital early, and have been sober for...  ...about a year and a few months. I moved from my partner to continue my sobriety and job searching and education and yadda yadda yah adult stuff, but we are still dating, and i'm going to fly out to see him tomorrow.  Weed addiction is a serious, sometimes deadly issue that gets swept under the rug because of how low risk the drug itself is. People don't die from smoking weed, but they sure as hell can ruin their lively hoods.   Well. That's my $3.50. Hope to strike a chord or two. Cheers.  Edit: My life today! Forgot that part. Well, no medications, pray daily, gainfully employed for most of my sobriety, and have great relationships with family and friends. Still dress like a stoner. It's hard to shake off lazy fashion.

 You're certainly trying to stuff a lot of Florida into one week!  I'm a Florida native, and I've lived and partied and visited pretty much the whole state.  All the alligator stuff is Everglades/South Florida stuff, including the airboat tour. Very cool, very fun. If you can afford it, get a private trip instead of one of the public tours. The public tours are bigger boats, seats for anywhere between 12 and 20. The private ones are you and a guide, out in the swamp, on a smaller (and faster!) boat. Eating alligator is a Florida tourist thing. You can get that at just about any decent seafood restaurant. It's best blackened with cajun spices, if not that, then fried. Step it up a bit, and look for Gator Jerky when you're in South Florida. That's some good stuff.  Kennedy Space Center! I love KSC. Very awesome, super sciency, can experience the whole place in half a day, but if you want to do any of the longer tours, or have lunch with an astronaut (Really!!) plan on a whole day. Surfing you definitely want to do on the East Coast. Cocoa (near KSC) has some great surf spots, head north to New Smyrna Beach (the birthplace of Florida Surfing, and home of one of the longest surf clubs, the Surfari Club. *Full Disclosure: I live in NSB, I'm partial to the scene here.  Crystal River/Blue springs is awesome. Your Canadian? So maybe your used to cold, but swimming the springs in Feb is not something that this Floridian would do. Check on that swimming with a manatee thing, pretty sure that's illegal everywhere in FL.  Sarasota is alright, the museum is really the standout, the Ringling Museum of Art is the home of quite a few masterworks. Great trip down there from the Tampa/St. Pete area as well. The Sunshine Skyway bridge that takes you over the mouth of the bay is Florida's tallest bridge. If you have time, stop at the little gift shop place on the north end of the bridge, and learn about the Skyway Disaster....a boat struck the bridge causing a collapse and the death of 35 people.  St Pete is great. I grew up in the area. Make time to get to the Bayfront...it's the touristy sort of area of St Pete. Very pretty. Make time for the pier. You like the Ringling in Sarasota, you'll love the Dali Museum in St. Pete.   The beaches are great on the gulf, but I'm an East Coast guy now, so I'm partial to the beaches in Florida that don't smell like dead fish. Personal opinion, and hot topic for debate here...which side of the state is better.  North to Tampa to find Ybor city for the Cuban, the cigars, the brewery. Have fun at the strip club.       In the pictures that you show, it's speciation. Certain types of shrimp will cook to a different shade of pink, or even orange. Also, within species of shrimp, diet can change coloration by quite a bit.    In other news, my Christmas list now includes body armor.       Do you have the video of the absolutely epic beatdown that guy must have received after doing that to that dude? I would whip him like heavy cream.   We do have a medical movement, and it looks like it might make the ballot, but the voting blocks in the center of the state and the north of the state are ultra conservative, and the new folks moving in are generally moving into areas that are already democratic/liberal. Over time, change will come, but I just don't know how fast.    Somewhere in the ultra-conservative, rightwing-religious middle states, most likely. I'm thinking Kansas. Unfortunately, here in Florida we won't be that far ahead of them, methinks.   I agree. Glad to see Turtledove on there twice, but none of my favorites are on there. Hard to chose when all he writes is althistory I guess...                        SUBconsciously....I'm doing that thing right now. Add a head shake to it, does that change the name?   Here in FL we have something called "Cottage Industry". Google that shit, if your state has something similar, you are allowed to sell a certain amount of certain items without hitting the threshold for the thousands of laws to kick in.  We haven't done anything, but we've looked into it for homemade sauces and rubs and mustards, and while I don't remember what the unit limit was, it was easily within the farmer's market saleability level, if that makes sense.   Funny. I use this gesture often. Both unconsciously when I'm thinking, and as body language to show frustration. It never occurred to me that it might have a name. Saving to see if anyone comes up with it.   She's upset that you're happy? You guys split, mutually, to be frank, it's none of her damn business if you decide to get over and be happy. If you're trying to rekindle, then I would be careful how you present yourself, but if you're happily unmarried, then be happily unmarried. Her opinion shouldn't matter anymore.   Those are all very attractive representations of something that I don't find attractive at all. Plus one for calling it "resting bitchy face" though.   Two ways.  Before sexytimes. Bring up sexytimes in casual conversations. Ask him if there is anything he wants that you're not doing, or special things he wants. If he doesn't ask you the same question back (shame on him if he doesn't) use that opportunity to mention it.  During sexytimes. Grab his fuckin' head, kiss him, tell him to lick your fuckin' balloonknot. NOW! (This would work for me if wifeypoo told me that, I would respond accordingly.)  Edit: Do not say balloonknot under any circumstances.      [Where's George.com](http://www.wheresgeorge.com/wild.php) is very cool. Check it out, enter the number.   I think AS is worth reading. It reads long...not exactly action packed, but especially today, with so many conservatives quoting Ms. Rand, it's important to know what they're quoting. Read it for that, if nothing else.   Disclosure: Yes, I am a liberal, but I'll admit that I had to rethink some of my ideals after reading this book. I also reaffirmed many of my ideals.   At first I wanted some potato salad....and then things got weird.   Yeah, me too.

Got to be **in** the basket    Don't miss that next shot.   Yes. Stretch the skin and do so carefully.    That's usually how it works. I guess it would have been better to say...if you think there is a chance, put the drink down and have some water, if you're there to get wrecked, don't chase tail.   Yeah, it happens. It has happened, or will, to just about every dude you know, so don't sweat it.  Tips: Don't drink so fuckin' much if you think you're gonna get laid.      It is sort of just Franks' plus garlic. Still delicious. I have so many hotsauces in my cabinet, sometimes I'm just choosing which shade of red I want to use.   Sharks are my goto utility/long-approach/fairway/ohshithowdoIgetoutofthisbush disc. I love 'em. Picked up a Shark3. Like it, don't love it. It's long...it's I think only one number higher in either glide or speed, can't remember off hand, but that thing sails. I use it as a steady straight short fairway utility, but just don't have much need for that in my game. I usually reach for the 3 when I hit an early tree, but have an umimpeded straight shot to the tee that's too short for mid-range but too long for approach. I often overshoot with this disc though. It sails easily, at least for me. I also use this disc for rainy days, as I can crank it off the tee, and the grip on that fat rim negates any slippy from the rain.   My wife and I were together for ten years, had two kids together, a whole life together and hadn't pulled the trigger on getting married.  We wanted to, we just hadn't gotten around to it.  I wanted to still surprise her, but I knew it would  be difficult, what with a shared bank account, a shared life, a shared house.  First, the ring. I enlisted the MIL. I had her bring prospective rings to my job, and I would look at them, and then she would bring me some more to look at a few days later. Once the ring was selected, I had a good friend hold on to it to keep it hidden, and as the ring I eventually choose was a heirloom ring, payment wasn't an issue.  I talked to the family without my SO's knowledge and planned a dinner so that her sister and mom and family at large could be there.  I had the sister involved in securing the restaurant and decorating...and also on some after engagement dinner party favors. That last part my SO was aware of, and she kept asking if she should go meet her sister, and I kept having to come up with excuses why that was a bad idea. (Mostly because she wasn't at her house, she was down the street at a restaurant near our house!). This led to my wife being a bit grumpy as to why I didn't want her leaving the house that day.  I asked her if she wanted to go get dinner, and kept it vague, telling her to dress up, and got her and the kids loaded up in the car and headed out.  When we pulled up in front of the restaurant, she started complaining...it was a nicer place that we hadn't been to  yet, and she didn't want "to go with the kids...we should go there alone so we can enjoy ourselves".   I've got 12 people waiting inside, and a ring burning a hole in my pocket at that point.  I think I said that the kids and I were going to go have dinner, and if she wanted to come in she was welcome to.  When we got inside, she saw the family gathered, and thought that that was the surprise; that the family had gotten together for dinner.  I had a speech planned, blah blah blah, all this time together, blah blah blah....  All I said was "I knew that I loved you, and even after today, I know I want to do this." Got down on the knee, she said yes, restaurant clapped, wine from the manager, family had a great meal.  We were married on the beach four years ago. Our best friend officiated. All of our friends and family were there, and she hasn't been mean to me since.         Threatens by fax? Does North Korea even take North Korea serious? Who threatens by fax?

Thank you for that injection of ultrafunk into my otherwise boring day. You guys rip.   Unrelated, but I checked out a couple videos of  yours on the Tube, (I really liked that Byrd cover, BTW) and eventually I got to a point where all the recommended videos on the right side were 9/11 conspiracy films...   Yeah, I'm a fan of that one.  I don't know what to tell you; I feel that it's worth reading through. More things happen towards the last half, good things, great stories, but the overall feel of the novel won't change. At its heart, it's just a story about a dude and the things that happen in his life.  Read it. Give it another couple chapters. I think you'll get more into it.   Insomnia. So many ties to the DT series. Start reading it now, and tell Ralph I said hi.      My fourth birthday party.  I don't have any other memories even around that early, at least anymore, but I remember a lot of things from the summer I turned four.   I was born in July of  '72, and '76 was the Bicentennial for the USA. It was a big deal, turning 200, and everything, I mean everything, was red white and blue. I remember seeing flags everywhere, and the Fourth was pretty epic.  My birthday cake (about two weeks after the fourth) was red white and blue, and my presents were wrapped in red white and  blue and even the toys I got were red white and blue.   I'm terribly guilty of this, but I rarely waste food.  I like to shop without recipes/meals in mind...that helps me make value based decisions. Instead of going to the market and hoping to find a good price on a particular cut of meat, I can go to the market and find the best deals and worry about production later.  I also like the challenge of coming up with new meals every day (that I get to prepare meals at home). It's a nice game to play. Got to pull something out to thaw sometime after lunch, and that gives me about four hours to figure out what I'm going to do with it.  Saying that, I also don't buy "rare" items and/or speciality or expensive items without having some idea what I'll be doing with it later, and if something goes too long in the freezer without being used, well into the crockpot you go, and poof! STEW!         God save me from a steakum, and steakum style cheesesteak are possible proof that Satan exists.   Absolutely valid, as most steak for a good, real cheesesteak are going to be hand cut, and you just can't achieve that thin of a slice with a knife and years of skill.   The Philly Cheesesteak is at its heart a steak sandwich. A *sliced* steak sandwich.  You could make a steak sandwich out of any cut.  You could, if you wanted, just put a hunk of chuck on a bun and call it a steak sandwich, but it would be impossible to chew. So sliced.  Meat has a grain, like wood. If you have to slice up some steak to grill, you want to consider the grain. You can cut cross-grain or with the grain.  With the grain, you end up with long slices of steak with the grain running down the length, meaning that when you bite into it, you would be trying to chew across the long grain (strands, if you will) of the slice. Think potroast, how it falls apart into those long strands, it would be like that, but nowhere near as tender. (We're not going to talk about grilled meats vs roasted meats here. There's something special about grilled meat, and when I want a cheesesteak, I want that grilled flavor, if I wanted something all tender and pot-roasty, I'll have a Carolina style BBQ sandwich.)  Across the grain, you end up with a long slice of meat with the grain running in short strands from the top to bottom of the slice, instead of along the long axis. (Think stacked, like a bunch of matchsticks in a row.) This is better. Your bite is separating strands of meat instead of trying to cut through them. Easier.  So, knowing this, why Ribeye? Fat.  Fat is flavor, for one thing. But maybe more importantly (like something could be more important than fat/flavor, right?) the places on each individual slice where there is fat, there will be a break in the muscle strands, or grain, providing yet even more ease when it comes to chewing. It provides probably the best grilled steak slices, as long as you aren't trying to avoid fat of course.  There may be a fair amount of tradition involved as well, but that's for someone else to talk about.   GO TIGERS!!       i-Dye poly is available at most craft stores, and you can find it online. Just make sure you get the iDye that's made for polyesters not cottons.   Mix iDye and water. Use slightly less than the amount of water suggested on the package for the stovetop method. No alcohol needed. iDye comes with a color conditioner in the package. DO NOT USE.  Mix up your iDye, toss it on the stove, heat it up to just below a simmer, turn off heat, let cool to the touch, dye away using the dip method or paint method. Dye stores in plastic for just about forever, you just have to heat it up to just below a simmer before using it again.  My only complaints about iDyes are that the colors are a little unpredictable. One dye and you have to let a disc sit for ten minutes to get a vibrant red, and the next dye it happens in two. Other than that I love this product. Better than old RIT. There's been virtually no fading on my Gold Line River, though I have seen some fading with use on some Innova Champion dyes that I have done.  [You can buy iDye just about anywhere online](https://www.google.com/#q=iDye+poly safe=off tbm=shop) or in a brick and mortar like Joanna's or Micheal's. (Hobby Lobby carries it as well I believe, but fuck Hobby Lobby.)  [Here's a link to an (old) forum post about the switch to iDye from RIT.](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/showthread.php?t=43518) It's a little out of date, but informative.  Happy dyeing. (This stuff is harder to clean up when spilled or dripped than RIT ever was because it dyes quicker. Be careful, keep some acetone on hand or be prepared for permanance.)   I did a gold line River with i-dye poly, and it's one of the best looking dyes that I have done.   The two most important things to remember about wind...  1. Wind acts on your disc like it would act on a wing. It's sort of counter-intuitive, but throwing into the wind results in an *increase* in wind speed, meaning your disc is *faster* and throwing with a tailwind means a *decrease* in speed, meaning your disc is *slower*.  2. Wind acts on your disc the most when the flight plate is exposed. Once you give the wind something to push, it will push it. So as your disc turns over, wind begins to work against the flight plate, either fighting or increasing any turn.   There's lots more about how your discs will work in the wind, and you have to go out and throw your discs to experience it. You can read up all you want, and that will help, but it won't make sense until you see it in action.    Well.  I just don't know what to say about that.  I would say that I want my ten minutes of life back, but at the same time, I am completely willing to consider it a sacrifice to whatever YouTube Gods there may be to never allow me to watch something so confusing ever again.  Now, I am going to go drill three holes in a bridge over a creek, and stick my penis in them.  Thank you.                           Hmmmm  My personal opinion.  * Beast - Champion.  * Beast - Pro, preferably beat in. * River - Gold.  * Shark - Champion, preferably way beat up. * Anode - Proton. Because rubber rim grabs chains.   A very interesting point, and one that I feel that I partially agree with. I don't know if both behaviors are because of nature trying to control population though.  I also feel that this argument needs to be divided...pedophilia is the attraction to the *prepubescent* while ephebophilia is the attraction to younger partners that are generally post-pubescent, but socially immature. The two are very different.  There have been some societies that have accepted pedophilia, the ancient Greeks probably the best known of those, but there have been other societies that have punished that behavior.  Ephebophilia, however, has been generally accepted up until fairly recently. 100 years ago it would be completely acceptable for a 30 year old man to marry a 15 year old girl, and the expectation is that she would bear children for him fairly quickly. It is just recently, as our society has changed, that that behavior has become unacceptable.  So, does homosexuality, pedophilia, and ephebophilia share the same genomic process, or is it changing societal pressures that define these issues?  Homosexuality has been generally accepted through the ages. See above for ephebophilia and why it is accepted. So why has pedophilia not been as accepted through the ages?  In short? Consent and protective behaviors.  It is hardwired into us to protect our young. Society may be able to define when a post-pubescent child is "of age" but nature defines the line between child/adult differently; by the ability to procreate. Pedophilia is the attraction to prepubescent humans, humans that by no definition are adult, either societal or natural, and that makes them children. And our nature requires that children be protected.  So, I feel that homosexuality and ephebophilia are very related: both are fairly "natural" (for lack of a better word), both genomic, both acted upon by societal pressures. (Simply meaning that some of this behavior has been accepted or not accepted based only on how society at large feels about that otherwise natural behavior.)  Pedophilia however, is very easily viewed as an act of aggression, from an adult human to a child human, and biological processes require that we protect our children, making this behavior unacceptable to most of us.  Leaving that, I do not believe that nature intends a certain part of the population to be homosexual, I believe that it is natural for a certain part of any population to *be* homosexual. I think it is part of us. I think that it would happen among smaller populations as well. (I don't have links handy, but homosexuality was well documented in the American Indian, and accepted, and through most of their history they were not acted on by population pressures.) Ephebophilia is a natural behavior as well, the only difference is whether one follows the morality of the society that declares these individuals off limits or not.  Pedophilia seems to be more about power and dominance than sexual urges. More like rape than preference. I think many more studies need to be done to help us understand pedophilia, but it would seem that this behavior comes from somewhere else in the brain.      Don't know the story, but it's not King, I know everything he's written very well.               I didn't know that food was supposed to taste good until I was about ten or so.  That's when I started spending my summers with my grandmother, and oh yeah, Gran could cook.  What dish did I hate as a kid? All of them. My mothers idea of cooking was from the "heating things that come in cans until they are hot" school of culinary preparation. No butter. No seasoning. Nothing.  Be ten. Take a can of green peas. Dump then in a pan. Heat until hot. Now eat them. Go ahead. I fuckin' dare you.  Those sad shriveled green balls of mediocrity would sit on my plate, mocking me, knowing as well as I that I wasn't leaving the table until I ate them, and also knowing that I would rather eat paste then have to suffer another victim of my mom's reheating.  When I spent my first summer with my Gran, I remember quite clearly asking what kind of food she got, because it tasted so different. Fried chicken (she used mayonnaise instead of egg wash, try it, amazing) home canned vegetables, field fresh vegetables, so good, baked hams, with brown sugary glazes, and sauces! I didn't know about sauces! BBQ ribs! Fish fries! Potato au gratin, homemade! Bythegods its amazingness was only overshadowed by its awesomeness.  And then I went home.  Those fuckin' peas were waiting for me. Not good. I was ten, maybe eleven, and I told my mom how good Gran's cooking was. (It was my father's mother)   It was not received well.  By my third summer or so, I asked Gran to teach me to cook. I helped cook dinner at home by the time I was 14.   Now I'm a professionally trained chef, working in the business, and considering taking my Gran's recipes and working a cookbook that combines her love of food with her love of family, geared for family cooking; recipes that mom or dad can make that go with recipes that the kids can cook as well.  Thanks Gran. I wish I told you how much those times in the kitchen mattered to me before you died. And Gran Rusty, you should know that I have a  batch of your icebox pickles in my fridge right now...they're still my favorite snack.

(My name is not mark.)                                       [Reminds me of my favorite cover of Hotel California](http://vimeo.com/35456805) by the Gipsy Kings. (Vimeo vid, great sound, stupid vid)         nothing but spread. It just sort of hangs out doing its fungus thing, you know, being ugly, making you uncomfortable in situations where you have to take your shirt off. I had it on my chest and belly.   They're spreading. They get darker/more pronounced when you exert yourself. They're slightly raised.   Yep, it's a fungus.  I can't remember what it's called, but I had it. The doc told me it was related to athlete's foot (causing some lovely jokes about atheletes body, which I don't have, but did).  Doc prescribed me some super expensive ointment shite, but as I talked the nurse on my way out she recommended that I try something else first.  Head and shoulders. The anti-dandruff shampoo, the regular kind.  Use it as bodywash for a week or two. See if it helps. If it don't, off to the doc with you.  *I'm not a doctor, but I play one on Reddit.      If you're sure that it's printed/screenprinted/heatpressed on, (there is no indentation and the printing is invisible on the reverse side) the only thing that I would recommend trying is pure acetone...not nail polish remover, just the stuff they make nail polish remover out of.  Pure acetone. Get it at yer hardware store.  Start with the corner of a rag dipped in acetone, and work a corner of the plastic to make sure it won't damage the plastic...as long as the plastic holds up, you're good.  Keep in mind acetone does not "dissolve" ink...in that it doesn't make it go away; it just breaks down the "fixer" in the ink that makes it permanent. You can loosen the ink with acetone and then spread it around your media. Use small amounts, and work small areas, acetone-ing small patches and then picking up the ink as you go with a clean towel.  Good luck, use at your own risk.                        The stupid is strong with this one.  Also, he's the former Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, primary House author of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and chairman of the House-Senate energy conference committee.   Annnnnddd...he's probably not an idiot; he's just pandering to his base to protect his real constituents: the oil and natural gas industries.  And here is the actual quote from committee: "Wind is Gods way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where its hotter to areas where its cooler. Thats what wind is. Wouldnt it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, Im not saying thats going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something, you cant transfer that heat, and the heat goes up. Its just something to think about."  Oh yeah, and The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Congressman Barton on its CREW's Most Corrupt Report 2011, for not accurately reporting investments in the natural gas industry which profited him $100,000.   Your brother has weird hobbies.   I like my wife to shave completely every now and again....but mostly I prefer that there just is no hair in my way.  For me, it's because I'm visually stimulated, like most men. I like it shaven every now and again simply for the view; I can see all of her, and that's what I like. Overall, I prefer a neatly trimmed bush, trimmed just for the ease of oral.   It might not be you....I'm just not a fan of kissing.   My wife and I have spoken about it, and come to understand it; I don't mind kissing, but open mouth sloppy making out, it's just not my thing.  Might be that, or it might be something about the way you kiss...or oral hygiene...but don't let that stop you from talking to her. You won't know if you don't talk, and if things are good between you, it can only benefit the two of you to sit and communicate about this issue.            Yep. Port Orange blows. Get out south to NSB or north to DB. PO is nothing but oldies, methies, and coppies.   Sploosh? Sprunt?  Oyster Jam?  Fish Squish?      Every now and then I want to like ol' Rand.

All through high school, my friends and I were semi-amateur skateboarders. (Way before Xgames made it cool to skate again.)  Each summer, we'd take a trip cross-state to the East coast for some surfing, and to skate the East coast scene.  I wasn't much of a surfer, I preferred wheels.  I was talked into going out on a pretty rough day. I could get up on the board, but that was about it.  One particular afternoon, after many beers and some 420 happytimes, we headed out into the surf.   I paddled out, caught a few waves, wasn't really feeling it, (I just wasn't much of a surfer) just ended up sitting the board outside the break and enjoying my state of mind and the weather and the waves.  THE PAIN WAS IMMENSE AND IMMEDIATE. Searing white hot pain across my calf. I had no idea what had happened, I went into instant panic mode...I honestly think I Jesused across the waves instead of swimming in.  In a haze of high and sun and beer and pain, I was running in literal circles on the beach, screaming about how my leg had been bitten off by a shark. Running in circles, *on two perfectly good legs,* yelling about my missing leg, and how much it hurt.   After some friends, some passer-bys and some lifeguards got me calmed down, they determined that I got hit by a jellyfish. Nasty sting, nasty swelling leg, non ending pain.  After an overnight stay in the hospital, we aborted our trip and headed back home.  After the story was spread around my friends, and their friends, and parents and neighbors and mailmen and the guy at the quicky-mart, I went back to school that first day to mocking cheers of "What's up Shark-boy?" and "Hey! Shark-attack!" and that sort of thing.  I wore the nickname of "Shark" for quite a long time after that, and with some pride, and even though I have left it behind me, I still have some friends that refuse to call me anything else.         I can't help you with translation or correction, as your spanish is quite a bit better than mine. (I am just learning.) But you should know about [lang-8](http://lang-8.com/), a website that lets you post diary style entries and have them corrected by a native speaker.   I've been using that site as a step past places like duolingo and memrise, and my learning curve has increased quite a bit. Give it a shot.  Also, well written piece on legalization.    Link takes you to thank you page at end of survey.                   Absolutely with the lyrical ability, but I was having trouble with the comment running away with me and getting wordy.  One of my favorite little nugget of Dylan trivia is that the one-time Poet Laureate Andrew Motion once said that  "Visions of Johanna" was the greatest song lyric of all time.    Liking Bob Dylan's music, and understanding his place in music history is sometimes two different things. You can have a great amount of respect for his songwriting ability, and the reach of his influence, and not like the way his music sounds.  I am a fan, I like his raw emotional sound, and the way he sometimes feels like rhythm and meter are options not requirements. A lot of people can't handle that voice of his, all gravelly and indistinct, but for some of us, that's exactly what we're looking for.  When it comes to Dylan's music, standing alone, you either like it or you don't. Just because you understand that he's the [most covered artist of all time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artists_who_have_covered_Bob_Dylan_songs), just because you understand that he basically invented folk-rock, just because you know that he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, that doesn't mean that you have to like the music.  It's easy to understand how he become such a fixture in the American psyche, not just for his music, but because when MLK gave his "I have a dream", Dylan wasn't in the crowd...he was on stage...having just sung "Blowin in the wind" and "Only a Pawn in Their Game".  He has the respect of so many musicians, and not just because of the body of work that he has produced, but because when other musicians at "Live Aid were preening their egos about how much they were helping Those Poor Starving Africans, he had the temerity to bring things a little closer to home by suggesting that perhaps some of the money might be used to pay the crippling mortgages that were putting American farmers out of business." Because of that, Willie Nelson was inspired to instigate Farm Aid. He also had the balls to take an electrified band on stage at the Newport Folk Fest, and after getting booed off the stage, keep working, and changed folk-rock. Again. After he pretty much invented it.  There's so much more that he has done, for music, for entertainment at large, that gives him a place in our music history:  He introduced the Beatles to Pot. (That was probably a good thing)  He dared to break the mold of the three-minute single, releasing six and seven minute songs.  Sure he's won Grammy's, but also won Golden Globes and an Oscar.  He took "The Hawks", turned them into his backup band, and gave birth to "The Band". (If you don't know who they are, look them up.)  He was asked to come up with some background music for a Western, and penned "Knockin on heaven's door". (Not bad...)  He is what he is, when it comes to what is recorded and played. You can like it, or not...but you do have to "get" Bob Dylan. There are arguments that he may be responsible for taking Rock and Roll and turning it into Rock music, giving birth to a movement. As a songwriter myself, I agree with the amazing Tom Waits when he called him "a planet to be explored... for a songwriter, Dylan is as essential as a hammer and nails and a saw are to a carpenter".  You can dislike his music, that's okay. Not everybody likes the way Dylan sounds. But just be careful that you don't confuse the music with the man. The person that won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for "profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power" might just make music that you just don't care for, and that's okay.  Sorry so wordy. I'm a big fan.      Not really. But I have found a way to slow some of it down.  Junk mail is so prevalent because of cost. Junk mailers pay a low rate for bulk mailings making it cost effective to send out tons of shit every week. Some junk mail contains return envelopes that allow you to respond to offers by returning the card or envelope to the company that mailed it.  **Junk mailers do not get a discounted rate on return mail**. They accept the increased cost as part of doing business with you.  Any time that I get a piece of mail that has one of those pre-paid envelopes or cards on them, I send it in. Sometimes I write a joke on them. Sometimes I just write **NO** really big. Doesn't matter, I send it off, sometimes empty.   I have noticed over time that I get less offers of these types, so I have to assume that somewhere there is someone keeping track.   Google that shitty country song "Don't take the girl" if you don't know it. I think that is what you are talking about, but I don't know what that device is called.   It's hard for a man to admit that he likes to watch My Little Porny or some such.   First: why do you assume every girl hopes that her man doesn't watch porn? Pornography can and is a healthy part of a sexual relationship for many couples.  Second: A man who says he doesn't watch porn usually is embarrassed of the porn he watches. It's very rare to find a man that isn't into porn of some kind. They exist, but they're rare.  Third: Start watching porn that you like in front of him. Search out types of porn that you normally wouldn't watch, and engage him. Show him that you are totally okay with the most offbeat porn you can find and see what he responds to. (I don't care for 'regular porn'. I have a very sexually adventurous wife who loves getting freaky in all kinds of different ways, so most porn doesn't do it for me. I like to watch the weird shit; not because it turns me on, but because it's something that I don't see at home. (No honey, I don't want to watch you pee on an octopus, I just want to watch three Asian girls do that.))   High-five her on the buttcheeks.   Ryan!   Love the band!  Saw you guys multiple times at Floyd's Music Store in Tallahassee. (I even drunk-peed on the front tire of your bus one time, sorry about that!) So glad you guys have stuck it out together for so long, and still are putting out great music, and I love that you're doing what you're doing with Feed The Children. It's good to see folks using fame/money for good works.  So, question:  As artists with some modest success, are you and the gang doing the Feed The Children thing because you are finally able to (financially, time-wise, etc.) or because you feel like you owe the world a little something back for being graced with the ability to rock for a living?     I have this problem at work as well. My servers seem to all have the idea that no matter what the customer says, they have to put it on the ticket. Makes me insane that I can't seem to change that behavior.         Nope. Love it. Do it all the time. Sometimes without reciprocation.    Quick! To the Reddit Science Cave! We need a study!     Can't speak for other men specifically...  Me personally, it's not about the "facial" so much, as seeing myself cum. Having masturbated a lot before ever even coming close to having sex with a woman, I associate my orgasm with the view of myself cumming. My wife doesn't care for the facial at all, and I don't mind that, but every now and then I do like to "watch" myself cum, and we've worked out a compromise that works for us both.     I have done the whole facial thing before however, and again without speaking for other men, I also felt a little bit of that shame/guilt feeling. How could it feel so good to do something like that to someone that I cared about? Strange. You and SO should talk. (That's always the answer...this sub could just be called r/gotalktothem) Maybe you could find some common ground that works for the both of you.   Why are we rewarding fuckers like this? This is one of many reasons why I killed my TV years ago...people like this getting fat stacks of cash for acting the way we all hope that our bosses don't ever act. Boycott this show. We've got enough trouble in the industry with all the cooking shows and the nonsense "reality chef" shows painting an untrue picture of what our day to day life is like. /rant            I vote Tipp City as well. It just sounds right. Here's my two cents, sir, and congratulations on a job well done. (Working hard to get one in my city)   Do you use fryer boil-out in that place?  We have had great success in taking our boil-out *after use* and storing it in a big bin. Soak anything and everything in it for a day or two and *it will shine*. **SHINE**. Miracle stuff right there.   Glad to see someone repping Zach on this sub. The guy rocks. Amazing vocals, amazing musical talent. I think the only reason that he's not ultra famous is that he is one of the few acts that you truly have to see live to appreciate.   Dennis Miller was funny? When?   Really, just one more than I have now.  Every independent listener, (not a repeat offender) makes me happy. I don't have a large count out there, but that's not the reason that I do this. All this work, all this time, all this fun, is because I *have* to do it, I don't have a choice.

Your momma's so fat, it takes her two trips to haul ass.    I did a tribal Shark on Champion plastic that way. Worked well with two colors, (Black and blue) but it had some bleeding. I've cut on plastic as well, but it's such fine handwork that I wouldn't do it again.   That's the tough part. Simple designs you can eyeball. You could also used fixed point reckoning, or registration marks.  One way is to use uncut vinyl over part of the disc that won't be died. Cut a small "v" notch in the center of that piece. Before you stick the other stencils on your discs, center and cut matching "pointer" notches on each of your stencils. Use these fixed points to help line up each successive stencil.  I've heard of other dyers using laser pointers to line up the center of the disc, but the vinyl that I use for stencils is way too thick for that.

A stencil for each color that you're doing, with just the single color that you're working on cut out on each one.      Yep.

 That's evidence of its origin. If Muhammad came to people with a pre-written book or stood and narrated the Qur'an in a long session, you can say somebody else may have written the book or he memorized what he was saying. He was an illiterate man, revealing verses on the spot to issues as they came up..    You should reply to him, not me. He might've missed this post.  Thanks my bad.   You sure about that?  Yes - it was hyperbole though - to qualify - every substantial sect that originated within the first 500 years after Muhammad that's survived till today. I can't honestly speak to every niche group that pops up and attributes their beliefs to Islam.  And yes, that's all Taqiyyah is, or at least, that's all it is for the 12ers.  So the below is not taqiyyah? What exactly is this sort of permissible lying called?                          :   :       .  http://www.alseraj.net/ar/fikh/1/?XjhPbzfm661074534768 1 30 1   race traitors.   In the past 20 years in the USA, the number of pigs killed by Muslims is next to nothing compared to the number of pigs killed by non-Muslims....even in the last year...   We need to use those hadeeths. We don't go and say "My madhhaabs says so." If they have hadeeth to prove their methodology, then we accept it. If not, the act is haraam. I didn't say this... Allah and his messenger said this.  Without taking a position on the issue myself given my lack of qualification, I don't believe you're qualified to be having this argument. You're arguing against Sadl because "If they have hadeeth to prove their methodology, then we accept it" when you don't seem to realize the proof that Malikis/Awzais historically used for sadl was amal of the community.  Advice - Don't get lost in meaningless and fruitless discussions that you don't have the detailed and specific knowledge to take part in.   Those guys aren't necessarily Shi'ites. Malikis from certain regions also practice Sadl.   Shi'ites are allowed to pray behind Sunnis as long as they make their intentions and the prayer itself independently (per Khomaini, Sistani, and others). [Praying in unity is purely out of taqiyah](http://www.rafed.net/books/hadith/wasael-8/wasail13.html#299) and doesn't meet your fardh requirements (unless you make independent niyyat and simply make your movements together).                If this is in Iraq, he's probably actually praying a separate prayer behind the Sunni Imam. The only scholar I can think of that I believe allows Shi'ites to pray (and not have to recite) when behind a Sunni is Fadlallah and plenty of the other major scholars in Qom and in Iran consider him a deviant.   Also much of the Qur'an is directly addressed to Muhammad and deals with issues specific to the ummah at that time  That's evidence of its origin. If Muhammad came to people with a pre-written book or stood and narrated the Qur'an in a long session, you can say somebody else may have written the book or he memorized what he was saying. He was an illiterate man, revealing verses on the spot to issues as they came up.   Galatians indicates that Paul was on quite friendly terms with at least the apostles James and Peter.  You claimed that Christ's companions corroborated the claims of Paul the enemy - I'd really be surprised to see any statement independently by them recorded to that effect...this is what you said: "The church only accepted this former enemy because people who knew Jesus vouched for him." Evidence suggests that "the church" was a little less scientific in accepting canonicity and attribution...  And referencing a letter of Paul to prove the companions of Christ supported his assertions is circular reasoning...  God talks to me - my evidence of this is my statement that God talks to me. Paul says he's homies with James and Peter, therefore he must be good friends of James and Peter. It doesn't support your claim in any case that I've never heard from an academic at any rate.  That IS what free will implies, yes. Allah in the Qur'an also directly states that He will guard the scripture.  Not in Islam, there are countless passages saying God *does* a thing where human agents are the actual doers in Qur'an and ahadith. The same applies to your Old Testament. Are you suggesting that when God says he "does" something - like gives somebody a child - he comes down and intercedes against the course of human agency and free will in some way? If you are, your claim would contradict Biblical expressions of Godly attribution - not just Qur'anic ones...  The apostles were convinced...  They were convinced of something, sure. There's no real evidence that can be attributed to them directly to suggest they were convinced of your religion and not some other early Christian doctrine.  Ah, right. Those Nazarenes are quite similar to contemporary Messianic Jews in terms of what they affirm and practice, but there isn't much evidence of their existence as a firmly established sect with that label until the 4th century, **removing them quite a bit from Paul.**  We only have a direct use of their name in the fourth century - that doesn't place them well after Paul. The first mention of them by "the church" fathers suggest that this "heresy" originated well before then - Jerome and Epiphanius (4th century apologists of what would become your religion) explicitly place them well before the time of their writing. Back full circle to the point - your claim of some sort of mass acceptance of your Christianity by 'devout Jews' has no evidence - the evidence we do have of Jewish acceptance of Christ actually contradicts it, and Pauline Christianity appealed to non-learned non-Hebrews who had no understanding of Hebrew scripture, in many cases rejecting it point blank (like the major sect of early Christians who followed Marcion), while others ignored it implicitly (like Justin Martyr, an early father of "the church").   The idea is if somebody's got a gun to your head, you don't do something stupid out of sense of misplaced pride, and a slightly excessive desire for martyrdom.   Every Islamic sect allows that sort of lying. Are you suggesting that this is all the 12er concept of taqiyyah is?   Paul was considered "a ringleader of the Nazarene sect" by the Jews (see Acts 24) so I don't know what you mean by that bit. You are correct about the Ebionites.  You're thinking of the wrong Nazarenes. The early church apologies differentiate between whats referred in Acts 24 (a general outsider statement) and the actual Nazarene sect I'm referring to.  That doesn't really answer my request for evidence of Christ's disciples ever provably testifying on behalf of Paul the enemy of Christ.  Marcion is an interesting figure, ostensibly accepting many of Paul's writings yet fundamentally disagreeing with much of what Paul said.  Well, his version of Luke and the Pauline letters aren't identical to - say - the KJV so I'd wouldn't be surprised that he did disagree with some of the statements attributed to Paul.  The point of all that, if we step back, was that of the early Christian religions, Marcion's was one of the most substantial at the time (in terms of size) - and his religion (like that of many Pauline Christians) was very *not Jewish*. Something which flies in the face of your assertion about a myriad of devout Jews suddenly accepting Christ as Lord and Savior, Dead and Risen. By and large, the Christianity of the Jews that accepted Christ early on isn't much anything like your Christianity.  How could God ensure that agents of free will would protect the Qur'an if they are agents of free will? He may have foreseen that they would, but if they are agents of free will then He Himself did not bring it about.  Are you suggesting that unless there is some kind of miracle, an action done by a human being can never be attributed to the one that created the human being?    Compare this to Christianity, which spread like wildfire in the most inhospitable of circumstances....  But it didn't. You had a myriad of religions that attributed to themselves to Christ, and a variant won out. With Islam, one set of primary ideas has always been mainstream...  Is it reaching to say that the church made it the orthodox doctrine? Because that's exactly what happened. Paul only acquired credibility because what he wrote was NOT heresy to the early church.   The fact that one version of Christianity that endorsed the writings attributed to Paul happened to win out historically isn't evidence that there was one monolithic entity ("the early church") that had the greatest market-share since inception...  The church only accepted this former enemy because people who knew Jesus vouched for him.  You'll understand that making claims about Jesus' companions giving veracity to this guy without evidence isn't very convincing. Paul's teachings were most popular amongst the very sort of people who didn't ever know Christ (a Hebrew). For instance, the Marcionites who rejected Christ's Jewish heritage and outright denied Hashem. Meanwhile the early Jewish churches (Ebionites, Nazarenes) seem to unanimously give no credibility to Pauline doctrine...  The question you're asking here is "why did God give us free will?" This is completely different from the question I was asking, which is "why didn't God protect the pre-Qur'anic revelations?" You turning my finishing statement around on me is a false equivalence because you're not asking the same question. You haven't answered mine either.  God didn't protect the Qur'an by sending down a magical barrier or writing it on stone tablets or Gold plates and then sending it down. The Qur'an was protected by human agency, people who had free will. It goes back to your original misunderstanding that God's promise that the Qur'an isn't corrupted requires him to come down and protect it by some divine miracle. God protects it by agents with free will - huffaz al Qur'an (memorizers of the Qur'an) and the early companions. So no false equivalence here, it gets to the heart of your hypothetical...   Also, it means lying in conditions which are life threatening, not to spread agendas.  Are you saying that taqiyyah in 12er tashayyu is exclusively for life-threatening situations and has nothing to do with anything else (like spreading agendas)?   Amd are any of their claims substantuated (I'm guessing no, especially the taqigya  Well taqiyah is a doctrine of the [Shi'ite sect](http://twelvershia.net/) and Obama's family came from a Sunni Muslim area - so I wouldn't lend it much credence.   http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Hadith/Ulum/israel.html  About the explicit statement by Muhammad on where israeliyyat are and are not acceptable.  The closest thing in the Qur'an off the top of my head would be where there is a verse that explicitly calls out the Jews for "worshipping" Uzair.   since it is apparently within the power of Allah to protect His revelation, why is the Qur'an the only revelation that was protected?  Because of the community that developed around Islam. The last guidance was sent at a time, place and to a people that were perfect for its preservation and spreading (their accomplishments are testimony to that). The Companions of the Prophet are considered the best generation of mankind in Islam. It was thru normal human agency that the Qur'an was divinely protected.  This was far and apart from the communities that developed around Christ or the other Prophets, yielding traitors like Judas and others, or vast chunks of Moses'/Aaron's closest companions start worshipping a calf, etc. It's also far and apart from Christian/Jewish scriptures that aren't provable to any of the relevant parties (immediate disciples of Christ or immediate contemporaries of Moses). And whereas with Muslims you have colophons establishing unanimity on the essential texts (Qur'an and several mutawattir ahadith), or at least allowing some means of non-textual verification - you don't have the same with the Bible. You have books ascribed to people who had no direct connection to Christ and who don't list their sources. In some cases, you have writings taken as canon written by the very enemies of Christ through his life - who supposedly saw him in visions after he left. And then you have other texts which have literally zero connection to Christ and are wholly 'prophecies' of later day Christian (Shepard of Hermas, Revelations, etc.)  How did a bunch of devout monotheistic Jews come to believe that Jesus is God and rose from the dead if Jesus preached the contrary and was spared from the cross?  But they didn't. Early Jewish acceptors of Christ (Ebionites, Nazarenes) didn't accept the modern standard we use to call somebody Christian or not-Christian. Did Pauline Christianity eventually win out and the other sects become marginalized to the point of non-existence - sure. But you're reaching if you're going to suggest that any substantial subset of devout/learned Jews accepted that particular variant.  The only way I can think of to reason around this is that He has some ulterior motive for sending people astray, perhaps to give them a test, but this does not make sense to me as the action of a Lord who wishes for all to believe the truth about Him.  I'm assuming you're a Christian, and therefore, Muhammad is a false prophet to you. Logically though, we can turn the table and say that God also created Muhammad with foreknowledge of Muhammad's false doctrine and his false teachings. The only way I can think of to reason around this is that He has some ulterior motive for sending people astray, perhaps to give them a test, but this does not make sense to me as the action of a Lord who wishes for all to believe the truth about Him.  Hypothetical why-not-this' aren't a good argument against claims of fact.   Runescape was the shit ~~a few years ago~~ **aeons ago**. Do people still play that? I heard they nerfed the wilderness...

Until you realize he's hiding a stiffy under the pussy.   See men of Reddit, in your absence, a 4 Chan guy is filling the gap.      I came here to say just that - like Ukraine only just discovered propaganda as a tool of war. Ridiculous title.   Was hoping to come with something snarky. Clicked the link - and just awwww'ed. Damn it.   Holy God - it's like a curve ball from Baseball ---but with his feet!    FYI it is only the Protestants who have different versions of the Bible. The Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church use the same Bible and are 99.99% doctrinally compatible with each other and less different than Shia and Sunni Muslims in terms of actual different religious beliefs. If you base "corruption" on different versions of the Bible, then simply ignore Protestantism.  Well Catholics and Orthodox have different Bibles too (Catholics don't have 3 Maccabees for example) - (TheMoreYouKnow).  But his claim to corruption is based on the fact that even before Catholicism, there were substantial theological and textual variants. The Marcionites, people who had a Bible canon well before any of the elders of the Catholic church even thought of deciding on one, had their own version of the Gospel of Luke. They didn't recognize any of the other Gospels that became mainstream later on, and they didn't accept the OT. etc. And that's just one sect - there were tons of different groups each with their own text in the early Christian era. So his criticism of Biblical veracity goes a little deeper, and is a bit older than the modern sects of Trinitarian Christianity.   The differences with Sunni Islam and Shia Islam are nearly not as much as their similarities, noted that they share the same belief structure. The only thing is political shareholders within the caliphate.  In premise, sure. But in reality, for the majority of Shi'ites (Ithna Ashariyya) No - it's not. Imami Shi'ites invented their own religious tradition - that contradicts every other legitimate sect. The fundamental concept behind understanding their/your religious texts is that the Imams would say one thing to the general public, and one secret message just to the select few. So in Sunni books, in non-12er Shi'i books, etc. Imam Jafar as-Sadiq will say one thing. But in Shi'ite books, that same issue will have two narrations. One that agrees with everybody else (in the region of the narrator) and another version that's supposed to be the "truth". I'd be happy to bring you a simple example even.  As far as disavowing Shi'ites as Muslims, only a few people go that far. For the most part, Sunni scholars give Shi'ite laymen the benefit of the doubt. I can link you to people who are extremely critical of your religion and don't consider it Islam, but if you ask them about the status of the average kid in Iran, they won't drop takfir willy nilly on laypeople.   If God is willing to send someone new to redirect his direction  Where is the redirect? At no point in canonical Jewish scripture or Christian scripture does God say "xyz is the course humanity will take indefinitely and this is my Final word on the matter and so-and-so is my last recipient of guidance". Islam explicitly states "this is it". So it's still compatible with previous prophets, whereas if Bahais except Islam was revealed by God - it is by definition incompatible by its own primary texts. You're comparing two completely incomparable situations.    Well he did wait about 600 years before he sent Mohammed. He could have avoided all of this by telling the people of the time everything he told Mohammed. God could have made sure the Gospel was going to never change. But he put it in a time and place for a reason.  And he could've just not let Adam and Eve eat the fruit and just do away with this nonsense by not putting that temptation out there. If you're going to argue about what somebody believes happened, based on "what ifs" and "why not this?" - you're not going to have a fulfilling discussion that goes anywhere. Your premise is intrinsically flawed because you're suggesting that there are simpler ways of having gone about things - but using that rationale, we can work our way back well before the Bahai religion was even invented.  Not to mention that though your solution to a single historical incident may appear simpler to you than what humanity experienced in reality - it doesn't make it 'truer'. It's a meaningless hypothetical..   Yes. Joining a terrorist or criminal outfit doesn't make you any less human than joining an organization that tortures and experiments on people (the SS, the CIA, etc.)   He was already on it.

On the same exact page...you have reports explicitly stating that Muhammad wore his hair down to his shoulders...long hair for Wa'il would obviously mean something meaningfully and abnormally longer than that...   By whom exactly?  In Sunni texts. You're using a Shi'ite source, quite literally the narration you're referring to is from Wasael as shi'a...   Not inciting religious hatred (there's plenty of gurdwaras, mosques and temples that do so on the regular).

Bring any who plan or act on atrocities before fair courts to be tried in the worlds eyes, randomly killing people as revenge can only make things worse.  Don't worry - they will.

I was happy to leave the sand box when my tour was finished, but what those monsters did to those innocent children is just sick. I would do anything to go back and shove my m27 IAR up some Taliban ass.  The Taliban you were fighting and TPP (also TPA) are completely different entities, with their own structures and their own leadership. The Afghan (original) Taliban actually condemned the attack...  But of course, if we're mad at a group of people, they're just a monolithic caricature.   No. He didn't. Said "statement" didn't come out till much later - hardly "within hours". During those several days, the Taliban actually demanded evidence in order to turn him over. So we bombed them.  You want to shut down a conspiracy theorist, understandable. But at least get your facts straight...   Don't be silly. You can't attach laser beams to them. They're just ill-tempered scorpions flying out of explosions (which they'll survive unlike everything else in blast radius).   Mirror/DailyMail would be the onion. The difference is that most people know the Onion is satire. These tabloids are credible sources here on /r/worldnews...

"We may have tortured you a bit, but look on the bright side, we could've killed you"      Yep - editorialized title. Should read: 22 killed in air strikes. Actual facts from "article":  LANDI KOTAL: At least **22 suspected militants** were killed in air strikes on their positions in Tirah valley of Khyber Agency on Tuesday.  So basically, 22 people are dead. They are supposed to have been militants. Whatever the case, the Pakistani army will be seeing red for the next couple months.   The rational strategy is to make your enemies fear for not just their lives, but the lives of their wives and children if they help the US and/or don't help the Taliban. It's a means of breaking the enemy's will to fight.  It wasn't 'rational' at all. People will fear for their lives, but now there will be national consensus for more govt. operations. At the same time, because of this incident, the total government shutdown scheduled by PTI (for the 18th of this month) and PAT (for the 17th) were both cancelled. It is literally the most irrational thing they could do - both in terms of what was done and timing.   Thousands. The Pakistani government allowed US drone strikes that killed over 1,000 people in total (though the US only targeted 80 or so individuals). We can get away with killing children because male child in the blast radius over 16 (or 14?) is considered an "enemy combatant" in official tolls. Meanwhile, the devastation by the recent Pakistani army offensives blows the US-drone strike toll out of the water.  Not that what TPP is doing is justified, but there is context here for sure.   The most powerful quote by the alleged TPP commander, "What about our kids and children[?]"   thank you.   Unless you run an increasing militarized police force.   It isn't just about deaths - it's the strange deaths, suicides and unsolved murders that are (as you imply anecdotal) reaching mainstream media that is causing worry.   I don't know that violence is definitely going up, but we're far more connected to the world and local pockets in our own borders than in the past - so it will seem that way to us.  Federalization of the police. At least in the US. We'll continue to hear stories about bad cops, and the gang-culture of police agencies. The public will support government moves for more 'over-sight' by the bureaucracies that have demonstrated such commendable management skills to date. They will snub out secessionist ideas, with continued crackdowns against locals who are becoming less nationalistic, and more local and globalist/humanist at the same time. You'll hear more about the "homegrown" ideologically driven threats (vs just the Muslim/Russian bogey men). At the same time Obama talks about body-cams, the DOJ continues to [auction off and gift](http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2014/12/16/US-Army-Will-Start-Selling-Surplus-Humvees-to-the-Public-Starting-Tomorrow-7724296/) 'excess' military supplies to local agencies.  Meanwhile, the Islamic bogey man has become realer than ever in the past. No more exotic names - the newest 'threat' is quite literally "the Islamic state". Their stated ambitions have encouraged lone gunmen scenarios by wackos in different countries, completely unaffiliated with the group, to attack their local government and civilian populations. Hilary will become president while Republicans hold heavy elsewhere - resulting in one of those great divided presidencies that gives leadership an excuse to be ineffectual on all issues except corporate interests and the military industrial complex. Increase international role by Western governments in the Middle East will result in reprisals at our door-steps, and we'll continue to tell ourselves they hate us for our freedom and enjoin in the fundamentally flawed circle of violence.  The US/NATO rift with Russia will continue to increase and become problematic with more proxy wars and attacks on allies of these nations by independent parties. China, inexorably tied to the US by trade and debt-purchasing will be assessing their next move. Iran and it's proxies will be continue to increase in conflict with 'Sunni' powers while Israel will continue on a far-right trend.  All in all, use condoms when you're having sex, light up joint and try to enjoy the good things in life. There are less cynical theories about the future as well - still light up a joint and enjoy the good things.   Worse - it's an image of click-bait with no real punchline.   The goal is to make participation in the military more "costly" for Pakistanis who might otherwise consider joining, along with those already in uniform.   Pakistani military isn't the sort of volunteer military you have in the US. You generally need family connections to get into the military - and then your next generation takes your place (if they don't move abroad). In other countries, like Iraq, attacking military bases says 'don't sign up'. But in Pakistan, the people who are in, are in.  It remains to be seen what the effect will be in Pakistan.  It's a blessing for the current leadership. Pakistan has been seeing a lot of protests lately about ineffectual government and a younger generation wants new blood (Imran Khan). Nothing like a tragedy to stir emotion and bring diverse stake-holders to the same team.   No - it's a desperate attack by a group of people who've been seeing the Pakistani government do the same to their loved ones and families. I'm not justifying the barbarity, but it's not taking place in a vacuum. If the Pakistani government had adopted less of an American-themed "disagree with us and we'll bomb you back to the stone age", and actually brought stake-holders to the table, Pakistan wouldn't be so crime/terror ridden as it is under present leadership.  That's if we assume PT are responsible - according to Shah Farman, theres no proof of that yet.   If we last for generations to come, secessionist movements don't pick up steam and somebody else doesn't take the world super power slot.

With some customers even when you try to explain all the new electronic ways to bank, they just pretend it doesn't exist afterwards.   As one of those annoying customers, let me explain our logic as well. I can speak for basically anybody who isn't over 80 that still goes into the branch for these personal banking tasks.  - Debit cards are *one more* card to keep in the wallet. Too many cards, trim the fat and the debit card has got to go. A lot of people use CC for just about everything and don't typically need to pull money. When we do, its easier to go to a branch located in a nice retail space you were going to be in anyways - and walk up to the teller with your drivers license (a card you generally need to keep in your wallet) to pull the cash. Most tellers in my experience fill out all the necessary information on the slip for me as well - an added bonus. I literally stand there and engage in the small talk they're trained to make with me.  - When you use an ATM, you can't easily rob the bank. Every now and then, many people get these temptations to rob the bank. Breaking into an ATM is not easy (source: Breaking Bad s02e06). Slipping a note to the teller that you've got a gun is very simple (hint: you don't actually need to have a fun). I've personally never robbed a bank. But we like knowing we've got the option when we're going by to withdraw money anyways.  - There are no lollipops/coffee at the ATM machines outside of the branch. You need to physically be in the branch to appease yourself of these amenities. At that point, you might as well just get to the teller if the line isn't looking like the DMV.     You know the best part?

It's a shame that we just keep regurgitating the same nonsense about how they hate us for our freedoms and bikinis - rather than reassessing our international role.

Or were we monsters to begin with and [we created monsters?](http://rt.com/news/213843-isis-creation-prison-iraq/)   That assumes that the nature of time is exactly as we perceive it. Your light bulb analogy assumes...  Right - you asked 'Why does *casual dependence*...' A moment in time and its discrete precedents are related by casual dependence (a function of time). Only thing I'm assuming is that time is what we know it to be, and not something we don't know it to be.  that the present is somehow a privileged position within it.  Not the present, any discrete moment in time has the same issue with respect to casual dependence and the idea of there not being a beginning. I said, 'select a[ny] discrete moment'. You can select a moment 5 million years ago.  For a different analogy, consider an infinite wire, a light bulb, **a power source**, and flowing current. As long as the wire is superconducting, there's nothing problematic with this situation in my mind.  Where is the power source? The beginning of time? Because that's precisely what I was pointing out (time has a beginning). If your wire is infinitely long away from the light bulb, no matter what distinct point you select on the wire, you are no closer to the power source - so there's no basis for supposing a flowing current up to the selected point.   Select a discrete 'moment'/snapshot F in the physical universe (in our case - the present). In order for that moment F to have occurred, the moment before it must have occurred (casual dependence). But in order for that moment before F to have occurred, the moment before it too must have occurred. And so on tending towards infinite in the reverse. You never arrive at F because you infinitely keep requiring a dependence for each dependence you select. Temporal infinite in the reverse isn't a logical proposition in the only universe we know.  By analogy, suppose a dim lightbulb is connected to an infinitely long wire. In order for it to be lit up, current must reach a discrete point on the wire closest to the bulb. In order to reach any discrete point on the wire, it must have reached the precedent discrete point on the wire. So the lightbulb can never actually light up since for every point to which current should have reached, it requires it to have reached the point before it - to infinite.

They'll expect you to provide a proper source though, so find the 'Arabic original of the purported Daesh tract and go on over there.    Also, there is something pathetic about a guy who supports a war and even helps convince others to go off to kill and die for the cause while he sits at home tweeting about it.   Kinda like your average military recruiter in any country with a contingency abroad   Islam actually has explicit restrictions associated with going out for fighting in certain cases while your mother is still alive   They believe he was raised into heaven...  That's complete bull.... Show me one single hadith from the Imams saying he was raised into Heaven...he was reportedly on Earth for over a hundred years during ghaybat as saghirah and you don't have any textual support for him floating into space as part of his ghaybat al kubra.   Can you link me to one single video of that than? These guys don't shy away from the camera when cutting people's throats, mass executions and even driving around with corpses behind their motorcycles. Or at least some reputable source suggesting that they do. If there's volumes of evidence, it should be a pretty quick find. Let me know.   He couldn't play on his ipod.   We'll see if its actually him or somebody else's life ruined by social media witch-hunts (like the Boston Marathon Reddit witch hunt)   Unmasked: the man behind top Islamic State Twitter account  Channel 4 News has chosen not to reveal his full name   He must be. The problem with driving on shabbat isn't just the analogy to riding an animal - but the fact that you're igniting fuel to drive. The prohibition on burning fuel is independent of whether you do it using your clothing or mode of transport.   We have sinkholes too - ours are just younger.   Notice how this same issue is being framed in the other subs. Fuckin Disgusting.   Holy fuck. Stay safe bitch   and ISIS tortures  Is there any evidence for this or do we just assume that anything evil we do, they must also engage in?   drone strikes that kill without a trial and has unknown collateral damage - good  Collateral damage is known. We've targeted about 88 individuals. Over 1,000 people have died in drone strikes.   False equivalency  Agreed. There is no documented evidence to support that ISIS tortures their captives.   UNDERCOVER COPS in march just exposed - they were instigators of looting. Pulled gun on protestors when discovered. #berkeleyprotests  https://storify.com/CourtneyPFB/undercover-cops-outed-and-pull-gun-on-crowd   This gives an even different context:  https://storify.com/CourtneyPFB/undercover-cops-outed-and-pull-gun-on-crowd   Which, as far as anybody knows, only applies to our current universe. How do you know that anything of the sort applies "before" our universe?  I didn't say anything about 'before our universe' (i.e. before space/time). I'm saying an infinite regress doesn't make sense *in the context of our universe* as an argument of time - given causality. I'm talking to *empirical causality* - so the causality we know.   Do I understand you correctly that you're OK with infinity up, down, left, right, front, back, and future-wise...  Unless you have a reasonable basis to suggest those aren't possibilities, I'm going to assume they're possibilities.  What makes that one direction different?  Causality. Each discrete 'moment' of time, from the present moment we experience, is causally dependent on its precedent moment. If there is no 'origin' for time in our universe, the present moment could never have been arrived at.   How do you know our current moment couldn't be reached?  Empirical causality.  How do you know that existence isn't cyclical? Our universe could constantly "refresh" with the death of this one being the cause or beginning of the next one.  Sure - existence could be apparently cyclical. The universe can 'die' and then 'restart'. But if those events take place in time, you still don't escape causality. And if you don't escape causality as a function of time in the material world, then you still can't have an infinite regression.    Regardless of how things got to right now, "this present moment" does indeed exist. The fact that perhaps you can't fathom that there may be an infinite amount of something before it doesn't mean it's not possible, only that you aren't capable of thinking about it.   It's an ancient argument that's been stated in different ways on different topics dealing with the physical world. It's not a matter of being incapable of thinking about an infinite regress - It's simply the fact that it doesn't make sense to even posit that as an option.  I've seen people try to reference this sort of argument more than a few times in the last year or so, and I simply do not understand it. Can you try to elaborate on this point more  We can step through it. We agree that "this present moment does indeed exist" - do we agree that the moment immediately precedent to "this present moment" also did "indeed exist"? And that "this present moment" is casually related to the precedent (i.e. this moment exists because the moment before it existed)?   Do you see a similar problem with an infinite spatial extent that you do with an infinite temporal extent  Not a problem with an infinite temporal extent. Time can *tend towards* infinite (we can't know if it will, but it's logically plausible). Infinite 'space' also isn't inherently problematic. But you can't have 'turtles all the way down' - not in the physical universe.   People *in* Ferguson were burning down some shops and what-not - sure. I'm not excusing idiocy. The people protesting during the day, and the journalists covering them were not being "beat down" by the cops? I've got plenty of cases I posted submitted links about over the last few months...   I don't have sources - I remember reading about it in a history of Muslim conquest of India. The argument had something to do with how the Hindus had the Upanishads and some of the mashaykh and rulers accepted not only taking jizya on them but conferring rights of ahlul kitab on them as well. Do you read Urdu - I can see if I can find something more specific lying around?   There's plenty of different subsects of 'Buddhism' - different groups have believed different thinks afaik.   And you show a very poor understanding of a very simple concept . The question isn't whether infinite can exist on paper, in theory or if it can exist in positive time/space - all of which are obviously plausible. The question is if an infinite regress can exist *in the physical world* as an argument of time. In *the physical world* where each discrete moment (however subdivided) is dependent on the preceding moment, you can't have an infinite chain of dependencies and still arrive at a particular point (e.g. this moment). We're not talking about conceptualizing a number line - we're talking about whether or not there can be an infinite regress of **causes**   The original Kalam argument had the "everything has a cause" phrasing, only the revamped version by Craig has the new wording.  Are you saying that Craig interpolated the wording to the arguments? If so - that's patently false - it was always effectively the same as "every effect/accident (or "everything that comes into existence") has a cause". The wording isn't needed to accommodate a cause for the first accident that is itself not an accident, since that isn't what was ever posited...   1) How do they know it can't be an infinite regress?  How would the present exist if there were an infinite regress and no beginning? This present moment could never have been reached..  You can simplify it to something linear, imagine a casual chain where each event on a line depends on the preceding event. And the events preceding exist infinitely. You can never reach the final/current event because each dependency has its own dependency, ad infinitum.   Do you have a source for the version of the du'a you're referring to (from which of your hadith books it was derived)? Short answer: no. Long answer: Different parts of that du'a (as they usually originally exist in different pieces and become combined later on) may be plenty of Sunni texts but I'd need sources and original text to find out.   I believe it doesn't violate the Islamic principle of shirk, does it?  IMO it would. Shirk is any association w/ God. Saying anything about God outside of what is empirical or supported by texts would be shirk. An avatar afaik would be God taking on a human form (like the whole xtian - Jesus isn't God but is part of the Godhead - hence an avatar).  Also how are the Vedas seen in Islam? And during the time of Mohammad?  The Vedas, Gita, puranas etc. are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. There also doesn't seem to be explicit mention at the time of Muhammad. I vaguely recall a hadith (not confirmed on the authenticity) that encouraged conquest in India. It's impossible that some people weren't at least nominally familiar with it though given that Islam spread as far as China within Muhammad's lifespan (as he'd sent companions there).  At some point in time, Muslim scholars were open to considering certain Hindus as people of the book by classifying them as Sabeans or simply as a separate group. Scholarship in the region, at the time, became inclined to believe that Hindu scripture originally had the hallmarks of Monotheism but was corrupted over time (like with the canonization of the Gospels or the preservation issues with the Torah).   Muhammad was asked about how before Islam, he used to participate in gatherings of the notables of his tribe to assess the situation for the community and provide help to its most destitute. When he was asked about it after Islam, whether he would still attend something like that (i.e. engage in something like that with non-Muslims), he reportedly said yes. Doesn't really answer your question - but sets the stage for why Muslims tend to be focused beyond just local issues.  It's not the same exact struggle, but do people feel companionship when they're wronged in similar ways? Yea. Same way Irish revolutionaries traditionally had a sort of common understanding with Palestine. The same cops beating down in Ferguson and elsewhere in the US go to Israel for training. They use weapons designed and [tested on Palestinians](http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/1639) (google Eram Efrati for more info). It's the same struggle - down to the weapons used.    I wouldn't be surprised if you got shot.  Except that this is the version of events according to the cop - while several witnesses saw a man with his hands ultimately in the air being executed. Regardless of whether the cops version of the beginning of the events is accurate. And if you've dealt with cops anywhere in this country - especially in law, you'll notice that it isn't as a big deal to fudge reports, or even commit outright purgery. Examples abide in r/bad_cop_no_donut and r/law.   Personally - I wouldn't recommend books. Walk into a mosque if you got one near you.   The problem with what you're looking for is that you'll likely be really inquisitive, and any person only has so much time. There are hundreds of people reaching out to any reputable scholar, and he'd be setting aside a disproportionate time just to address your questions. I have a feeling you'll be thoroughly disappointed.   They've been running paid whitelists for a while now and weren't telling people. It's more in the open now and they have a business model associated with extorting the companies that run the ads. I could care less about their business model - what bothered me is the deceptive nature of initially not even disclosing the reason behind specific whitelisted domains, etc.    Yea, there's some pretty obvious interpretative interpolations in brackets, but w/out a direct link to source, I wouldn't trust Memri for shit beyond a gist.   Like, what am I even supposed to say now?  You're supposed to ask for the raw Arabic material, verify its them, and then justifiably become infuriated.   This. They can have Shitcast send you a letter. They won't win their case.   That's an interesting assessment.   Are you tryna say /u/Igotdagold is a narc?   You're an accidentally great person. God bless you sir.   Can confirm. They are the second link in spite of supposedly being a really good torrenting site and not just SEO content spam and shitty ads. So I've heard - I've never actually used the site....What are torrents?   Thank you ad block!  You mean thank you AdBlock Edge and a giant middle finger to AdBlock Plus.   And porn ads make more money than no more ads. That way of looking at it is still relevant.   No - I think I'm not being clear. What ISIS has released pushes even Islamists away from them. Remember the Taliban? They also put out videos, just like ISIS (not as great production value back then though). Hated by the world, recognized as the legitimate govt of Afghanistan by two countries though. Had quite a popular following and the unpopular decisions they made (like blowing up the Buddha statue) were the sort of things that the international community didn't like but your super devout Muslim could get behind.  And they were with it to the very end - opium production eliminated - crime rates down - people living and moving about in most parts controlled by them with security - even when the world super-power came knocking, they refused to accept foreign intervention and only would agree to handing the accused party over if evidence was served. They had, and have, a large fan base in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Other Islamist groups? Pakistani Taliban. When Benazir Bhutto was shot and killed, these guys denied it (and legitimately had no role it). When Malala was shot, these guys apologized. They denied accusations and apologized for mistakes - they didn't ignore the former and boast about the later. UIC (before al-Shabbab), somebody opened fire on a movie theatre from amongst their extremists. They were tried and executed. The Islamist group punished its own under the same law applied to everyone else.  Why did Muslims in these regions support groups like Taliban, Hamas, or UIC? Because these groups represented *law* in areas where all that's needed is for a dictator to ask for your head. They represented unbiased establishment of this law, and they believed several of the laws were divinely inspired. They believed - and do believe - that what they're doing is for the good of their society Muslim and otherwise, regardless of what you and I think. I can comprehend that "islamist who wants to live by the quran and hadith without compromise" perspective.  What are the ISIS videos? Let's kill a journalist with no court proceedings and evidence that our action was justifiable. Let's do the same thing with another chap. Let's do it again. Let's get an entire city of average citizens to beat some captured soldiers to death. Then ride their corpses on our motorcycles through the streets. Lets put out tracts that openly allow for slavery in spite of modern connotations. Let's do it without any apologetic material. Let's execute prisoners en-mass, with no depicted attempt at justification. Let's basically give countries an overt excuse to throw a wrench in the stated objective. Let's endanger the lives of the muhajireen (immigrants) who came to Syria during the course of the revolution.  So basically, there's a big difference between what ISIS leadership is self-representing and what those other groups self-represented. They're not currying favor with secular Arabs or devout Sunnis, they've alienated everyone including many of the more crazy devout sort. They are quite literally their own worst enemy (assuming their stated objective is truly their objective).   No, the interpretation is on point (assuming that this is a real ISIS document). "That their right hands possess" means slaves - it's historically always meant slaves. Islam never outright prohibited slavery, it merely discouraged it.   'counter productive to their jihad.'  Literally every single piece of media they've produced has been counter productive to their stated cause. Every last one.  	140
 I belive it's called the [Mozambique Drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Drill)   Finally, it feels that Far Cry 2 is often largely forgotten and overshadowed by it's sequels. However I still feel that FC2 was the more compelling game for me, despite its very obvious flaws and shortcomings.   Here's a few things I really liked about FC2:   1. **Weapon Loadouts** were a lot more realistic, you had to really prepare before a mission otherwise chances are that you will most likely die.   2. **The Buddy System** The idea of having buddies that would help you out in combat and can potentially die was both rewarding and harrowing at the same time, even though these characters aren't fleshed out, you do feel a sense of comradare with them as they are the only characters trying to survive in the harsh African climate alongside yourself, the player.   3. **The Fire System** It felt like the fire system in FC2 spread a lot more and engulfed everything in it's path. Compare this to FC3 and 4 and it makes them look like tiny shrubs on fire. I'm not exactly sure why Ubisoft went backwards in this regard.   4. **Weapon Jamming**, ok this one is a double edged sword. It was pretty tense to be in a fire fight and having your gun suddenly jam, however this happened way too often. While there was a system to tell how degraded a gun was by its looks it still jammed too many times, even for guns that looked of good quality. The main issue with this is you pick up poorly maintained guns off enemies who never seem to have their guns jam on them. This was more a case of interesting design idea but flawed execution.   5. **Time and Day** Finally, the time and day. I really loved doing missions where you had to take out certain people. It would start off with a long drive to the safe house from where you would unload your weapon cases and take what you had carefully prepared, then you take a nap and set the time progression for you to start the mission. It was really nice being able to control the time and day like that and you felt like a proper bad ass doing the set up for these missions.      What other open world games do you think do long distance detail really well? Witcher 3 may be a candidate for that in the future...   So Motorstorm with Driveclubs weather system and first person view point would be heaven.   Yep the good job line is actually perfectly delivered imo.    Also if that pilot has a family they are probably going to be fucked for generations to come.    Hey guys what graphical improvements/engine improvements would you like to see in Elder Scrolls VI. I'm assuming that ES:VI will use whatever engine that Fallout 4 will use, so I guess this question can be meant for both games. Personally I would just like to see a much less rigid movement system, the movement in Skyrim just felt super rigid, especially when you jump! Obviously graphical improvements will be seen, my dream would be to see nice volumetric clouds like you see in Driveclub, [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4l39926dJ4), now I understand that it's obviously a racing game so that tech being used in an open world would be very taxing, but I think it would be nice to explore the possibility :D   Personally the best way to do it, assuming the Broccolis sign off on it, is to get approach it take elements from the best stealth/action games out there at the moment and add their own Bond flare to them. E.g you could borrow the dialogue system from Alpha Protocol, the combat system from Arkham perhaps with an animation set which is more suited to Bond's fighting style. This is assuming Rocksteady are actually the developers behind this game as they seem to do a good job of resurrecting video game franchises that are dead in the water.    "Farking idiot"   I really would like to see a Neuromancer film. It just seems a bit too difficult to adapt into a film though. The only thing related to the film production is this [poster](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qiG1icHA--/184i8h6ghlbc5jpg.jpg)   Oh ok Flaming Dragon...fuck face   I don't think Nolan really does commentaries. At least not in the last films released, here's hoping Interstellar is his first.   The film Oblivion did another cool alternative to using green screen [Here's the video on how they projected the environment onto the set to naturally light it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DCkIuv82Q4)          Fucking hell, that was amazing.   I feel that Insurgent (Divergent 2) looks pretty abysmal. The first one was already a lacklustre film cashing in on that hunger games crowd. Now they are splitting the last film into two parts as well...   Which story??   I feel the problem with the Hobbit comparison is that you can clearly tell that the majority of the cg budget went to Smaug. Don't get me wrong Smaug looks amazing but the look of the film is very inconsistent with some parts looking amazing while others looking average.    Well to be fair that's actually not a brand new Audi it's actually an 05-06 model.   I really liked this film. This particular film shows how much better the flow of a car chase can be when the actor is doing all his own stunts.   April here in Australia.    Yeah true that his experience on Alien 3 is probably what drove him away from big budget studio films.   So a studio is willing to put in $200 million to produce a Bioshock film, who do you get to direct and write etc? Would it be set in the 2007 game or Infinite's universe? Who would you cast as the main characters etc. Just a little discussion to spark our creativity!   Fincher would be interesting, I don't think he has really touched fantasy/sci-fi since Alien 3, unless i'm missing an obvious film he did recently. He would be a very interesting choice as he has a lot more weight with his name now and his last film, Gone Girl did very well at box office.      As a green p plater soon to go on my fulls, as scary as it sounds you tend to pick up so much more skill while driving alone. At least I did since my parents were not so great at driving haha.   How much did this cost?   Funnily enough I saw the first two films in HFR and the last one in regular 24FPS and I think I would have preferred to see this one in 48 since there's a lot more action happening in the film. I did notice some specific parts where the scene appeared to be jittery, especially during the long panning shots of landscapes. In your comment regarding the actors looking superimposed, I felt that they still looked superimposed in 24, I think this to do with the overly digital look of the film which is just a big step backwards when compared to the LOTR trilogy. Personally though I think Battle of Five Armies serves to be the one that benefits from the 48 fps since there's not much downtime during the film.    Supposedly James Cameron is planning to shoot all 3 Avatar sequels in 60FPS.   My name is hefe   Here in Australia it was called The Wrong Man, I feel Lucky Number Slevin is much better, The Wrong Man sounds like some shitty rom-com.    People may disagree with me but I am gonna say Michael Mann, I love me a good crime based film and with that distinct look he films with.    So basically once Ari created his new agency with Babs what is the estimate of his salary? I am assuming it was a few mil right?   "Having the knowledge of from the Golden age of Knowledge and being able to bring that to the Golden Age of Tech Phase II, it makes it a whole new level".   This sounds he is talking about some RTS of some kind.    The one on the left actually looks awesome. Tobacco era really brought out some interesting and great liveries.    At least it wasn't as bad as the [DBZ Kinect trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umM0jivA4cw), nothing is that bad...   Do you guys think if BMW ever come back to F1 in the near future that they would link up with Williams again or would they become their own team kind of like Mercedes AMG? Was there bad blood between Williams and BMW after the split?   I don't think the average smart phone user is going to have a bluetooth controller though. The real question is whether it will work well enough with touch controls without the need for a controller.   There's actually an option to recap the story on the dragon age keep website. In that you get to create a character and make story decisions that carry over into DA:I, like the Mass Effect 2 comic. It's actually pretty great since you just export that character into the game.    I actually have a 2012 118i and on my registration it is classified as a wagon for some reason.   Damn lol thanks anyway.    So uhh you gonna tell us where you bought that?      That guy 9 seconds in nodding. "Yeah he's definitely possessed."   The game is completely functional now imo and is definitely worth buying. I got it and launch and still enjoyed it and now that they have added weather it is now a different beast entirely (in a good way).    I'm sure there's a Studio Ghbili film around here that can fit into this theme.   The first one Knights of the Old Republic, it's available on Steam.   Personally I think the character is fine the way he is since the clone wars expanded upon Boba in a sufficient enough manner that would lead him into becoming a big bounty hunter. The studio would never let him have his face covered for the whole film, so that idea is out of the question. Also it would severely limit the actors ability to portray his full range of performances.    This, I really can't stand that woman.    I fucking love when this happens followed by the inevitable "player x has left the game".   BB-8 aka Ball Bot 8   u wot m8   Also [Elysium](http://whysoblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/elysium-whysoblu-7.jpg)   and James Cameron.    How does the older iDrive system hold up today?   For me it was Bilbo in Fellowship where he tries to grab the ring from Frodo.    Sorry I meant Matthew fox (guy from lost)   I was wondering if the studio will ever release the alternate ending for WWZ since I heard that it was pretty much finished. It would seem like a more complete film since it was fairly obvious in the theatrical cut that many characters that pop up during the film were clearly meant to have a bigger role (e.g Michael Fox's character). Will this ending ever see the light of day or has the studio just buried it?   [One of the best scenes in the game in my opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6RHg-BCk0g)   So I was in Year 8 when I went to see this film, not realising it would be 3 hours long. I enjoyed it but it never really stuck with me. I'm curious if you guys felt the same way in that everything felt way too drawn out and could have used a good trim in the editing room. Also do you feel the CG still holds up to this day since that was a very specific focus of the film?   I walked into the showroom at Castle Hill once and saw the prices for these beds, basically you are paying about 15-30k...for a bed.   I would say most of the cgi in Star Wars Episode 1 still hold up, especially the pod race scene.    Nexus 5 Android 5.0 on Telstra.    [You](http://s.mlkshk-cdn.com/r/2KNX)   New Zealand but not Australia, wot.    Not to mention he has been releasing a film every year. Prometheus (2012). The Counsellor (2013), Exodus (2014) and The Martian (2015)   I'm pretty sure its because he was fucking sienna millers character, I think that's the idea since he managed to get out of the drug game unscathed but was undone by something as trivial as sleeping with someone else's girl.   Wasn't this supposed to have been released in October?   Don't think it's ever mentioned and I believe that was the intention, he was never supposed to be known.   Definitely agree. Love the inspiration for their engine sounds in all Star Wars films.    Shiit same here haha i'm 23 atm just graduated from uni and I swear my mum never wants me to leave...   Hahah yep, they do love their tron legacy soundtrack, with good reason though since it's fucking amazing.    I would just like to say that I fucking LOVE this film. Such a fantastic film on the drug trade. Daniel Craig kills it as the main character and rightfully so since they got him for Casino Royale after this film. Matthew Vaughn can direct man, he manages to inject a certain flavour into every scene, I can't really describe it but it just feels so well composed you know? I would urge anyone who hasn't seen this film to check it out right now! Here's two of my favourite scenes in the film both with excellent music to boot.   [Opening monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_0D8F_X7us)  [The facts of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U4aCMIBYSY)   End of Line by Daft Punk from the Tron Legacy film.    It's Thai.   First time I heard this was in Spec Ops:The Line, perfect use of the music, great soundtrack as well everyone should check it out.    I really love the idea of Kanan not being a fully trained Jedi since there is room for his character to learn just as much as Ezra, I like the idea of him not having the answers and being upfront with it as well.    Yeah that's true, didn't put that together. Damn shame really, I would have loved to see him have one last crack at the title in the Mclaren-Honda.   So 2014 is wrapped up and Button doing fairly well to get a 5th position what do you think his chances of him staying at Mclaren are?   God damnit seriously JB better get a seat next year, he truly deserves to have one more crack at the title in a good car.    [Not like this, not like this...](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-30744-not-like-this-not-like-this-gi-DBvb.gif)   I think I am [well versed](http://simpsonswiki.com/w/images/thumb/0/00/Big_Book_of_British_Smiles.png/250px-Big_Book_of_British_Smiles.png)   What were his ideas for the Hobbit films?   I would say the Counsellor, it's not an amazing film but I think it's an interesting one, worth checking out in my opinion.   I'm fairly sure she did the 50 shades version as well.    It's by Beyonce i'm pretty sure.   I always thought Daniel Crag in Layer Cake nailed it in this [scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_uwF9y8SQ)   I wish I was old enough to see and understand The Matrix when that first came out in the cinemas, alas I was only 8 years old though :(   So I played through ME2/3 on my PS3 back when they came out, however I decided to rebuy ME2 on PC since I wanted the faster load times/higher resolution etc but the DLC for ME2 never seems to go on sale. It's not listed on Origin and it is only sold on the Bioware store which you have to purchase with Bioware points...seriously who thought this would be a good idea?   The majority here would disagree with me but fuck you anyway, I think Star Wars Ep 3 is a fantastic prequel story wise. It sets up the tragic fall of Anakin and essentially sets the tone for Ep 4. The story imo was all wound up very neatly. It would be a perfect film if Lucas wrote the story but not the screenplay.    Jennifer Aniston for best actress, you wot m8?   I think people are a bit confused since there have been so many dystopia films that have been released in the last few years that all borrowed heavily from 1984.    I would love to get back into this but the PC community in Australia is pretty much dead :(   Jurassic Park (1993)   The rumour was that Netflix aus will be $20/month, is this true? I already have a US netflix account and vpn so unless the catalogue is just as good as the uk/us netflix then i'm not sure if I want to switch just yet.    Holy shit I didn't even realise Louis CK was in this one [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29PG-8Tywo)!   According to Hans Zimmer they are actually working on releasing the track for free. Here's the [source](http://hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco id=1256) which I got from the [Nolan Fans forum](http://www.nolanfans.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43 t=12452 start=1200) if you scroll down you can see where they discuss it.    Yep I travelled to Hong Kong in Jan and they had [these](http://annatam.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_3635.JPG). It really baffles me that countries which have the infrastructure and money to put these in place don't do it.   I have been waiting for a question like this...In no particular order.   1. Oblivion (2013) 2. Tron Legacy (2010) 3. Avatar (2009) 4. Prometheus (2012) 5. Elysium (2013) 6. Pixar animated films as well as some Dreamworks films such as How to Train your Dragon 7. Rush (2013) 8. Cloud Atlas (2012) 9. Inception (2010) 10. Any Studio Ghibli film.  11. Gravity (2013) 12. Interstellar (2014) whenever that Blu ray gets released.    lol   The set design looks unreal.   OP if you enter the code MAYHEM100 at [Dick Smith's online store page](http://www.dicksmith.com.au/markdown-mayhem-100) you will get $100 off a new PS4. Also unfortunately we don't really have Black Friday sales here, I guess the closest type of sales are Boxing day sales so basically the few days after Christmas where you can get some pretty decent deals.   Hmm I would say Michael Mann but then again he only has 2 films which kind of disappointed me (Miami Vice, Public Enemies). It's only because they were back to back though. I have high hopes for Blackhat since I would just love to see his take on the hacker underworld.    I reckon this Alfred will eventually grow into a Caine-esqe Alfred. Starts off a fiesty/bad ass and slowly starts to reign it in when Bruce probably gets into trouble during his teen/early adult years.    Hahah that bug for me will go down as one of the most hilariously frustrating bugs to ever exist in gaming.    Hey guys this is my first post on this sub but I was kinda wondering what cues do you think FO4 could take from newer games engine wise, ranging from graphics to physics.    [The Descendants](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033575/)   I would love this but I feel that it may be a tad too dark for the network, although with that being said the latter seasons of Clone Wars got pretty fucking dark so they may be able to make it work .   I loved seeing this gif with flags superimposed over their faces during the world cup.    lrn 2 read m8      I think city circuit would be pretty dope as well. Something around New York, although as a Sydney resident I have always dreamed of having them race across the harbour bridge.   	112

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola   He's already [whining](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-22/walker-says-obama-religion-question-is-why-people-hate-the-media?cmpid=yhoo) about it.   OK then, let's think of the questions the media should be asking Scott Walker.  My suggestion would be, why do you feel you have the right to tell America so many [inaccuracies, misleading statements, and outright lies](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/)?      Here's a [start](http://www.progressive.org/news/2014/10/187897/scott-walker%E2%80%99s-corruption-problem).   None of this nonsense about tailoring bills to local needs.  Just pass the bills handed to you from Koch Industries.  Walker has sure increased Wisconsin's government efficiency, and made it much more responsive to its most important constituents.    They should use this bill as a campaign slogan - 'Passing laws written by out of state lobbyists for the People of Wisconsin' or 'Bringing legislation from lobbyists directly to you!'   Well now, that should clear up any final doubts about who Walker and the Wisconsin GOP are  working for.   Stop that.  You're going to wise up the American voter.    I prefer to think of him as their little "Scottie" dog.  Although now that you mention it, GOP could be an acronym for Greed's Obedient Puppets.    I'm sure Scott Walker loves America.  He just loves it's richest people better than the rest.   Giuliani's message these days is -  'Hey, I'm saying something outrageous, listen to me ! Over here, look at me!  Pay attention to me, to me!"    They [the Republicans] are attempting to cast themselves as the party of the middle class, even as they push policies that would undermine working families and exacerbate income inequality, the official said.  Why the Democrats haven't been pushing this such G.W. Bush took office, I'll never understand.       Welcome to Wisconsin - America's Low Wage, High Profit Paradise   Believers ignore evidence. No amount of failure will change the minds of the supply-siders.  They'll always be a reason that something else is causing the failure, and the policies will work, [just give it more time](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-rose/article7024256.html). Which is the excuse of failures everywhere.   All of Obama's cherished deficit reduction  accomplished at gruesome cost to the American people  will go straight to the 1 percent if Walker (or Jindal, or Jeb Bush) is elected.  Why don't the American people ever wise up to this game?      Voodoo Redux!   He sure is. An honest campaign slogan for Walker would be something like 'Help me help the richest' or 'Concentrating America's wealth at the top'.   I don't have an on-line source for this, but in The Empire of Liberty (Oxford History of America) page 577 reads "Although some of the founders ... were fairly devout Christians, most leading Founders were not deeply or passionately religious and few had much of a spiritual life ... Most of them, at best only passively believed in organized Christianity and, at worst, privately scorned and mocked it."  The leaders of the Revolution were more often men of the Enlightenment than men of the Bible.   And on page 578 ... "it has been estimated that scarcely one in twenty Americans was a member of a formal member of a church." The importance of religion ebbs and flows in American history.  As you point out it was very important a number of the colonies I should have said revolutionary , not colonial America), and would rise again during the second Great Awakening, but at the time of the revolution and the nation's founding, American was a largely secular place. (And I've oversimplified the situation in my summary here.  Get a hold of the Empire of Liberty if you want to learn more.  You'll be better informed about the early years of America than almost all your fellow citizens.) Edit: Missing sentence   The Puritans certainly looked to the Old Testament for inspiration, so I guess you'd have a point.  However, colonial America wasn't a particularly religious society, many of our Founding Fathers were skeptical of religion (or indifferent church members)  and current form evangelical Christianity barely existed until the 19th century.  Do you think the Oklahoma legislators wants the AP course to cover those topics? I'm guessing not.   I'm glad to hear it that it's discussed in churches.  It's a very demanding message, but I can't ever recall anyone suggesting that we display it in courtrooms or public buildings.    P.J. O'Rourke was quite funny back in his prime. And that's my complete list of conservative humorists whose work I've enjoyed.    But not the [Sermon on the Mount](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7).  Somehow these fundamentalists always manage to overlook the inconvenient parts of the New Testament.   If racism consisted of being too nice to people who are different than oneself, we probably wouldn't see it as a major problem.   Interesting. Precisely who is giving me marching orders?    The IRS estimates that a stunning 56 percent of business income that individual returns should have reported went unreported in 2006, the latest year for which these data are available.  Who knew that [Leona Helmsley](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1891335_1891333_1891317,00.html) was a prophet?   Almost like a Biblical curse, isn't it?   Hope you're right.  But the math that worries me is the billion dollars the Koch Brothers are organizing for the election.   Paul Ryan - Nobody serves America's tax cheats better!   They want their own little obedient 'Scottie' dog to run the country for them. Since their goal is clearly to concentrate America's wealth at the top, they'll want a well trained puppy like Walker      They all work great in theory ... it's when you involve actual human beings they run into problems.   The article starts out with the question how does broadband in the US compare to other countries?  Well, if you remove the most populous states, which are the areas that have the densest population, (where you wouldn't have the physical limitations) from the comparison, I guess it looks pretty good.     FTFY - If you break up the US, none of the 10 most populous states make the list for the 10 fastest broadband places in the world.     I hope your right, but I'm not so sure.  The Koch Brothers and friends are planning on spending a billion dollars in 2016.  Might be enough to put anyone over the top.   His slash-and-burn policies of the past four years have nothing to do with responsible state governance. But they do signal to billionaire GOP campaign donors that he is willing to ride roughshod over the needs of the people in Wisconsin to prove that he can do the two things required of any contender for top office: Concentrate power in the executive office and **redistribute wealth upwards**.   Why else would the Koch Brothers be so keen on this guy?  So we can have an economic system that's fair to everyone?        Also Monday, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office reported that Walker is delaying May debt repayment of $108 million to help balance the state's shortfall in the current budget ending on June 30.  Here come the accounting gimmicks.       That's what a nation's enemies do, not its putative allies.   In the most recent poll, done in May 2014, a plurality, 42 percent, said God created humans in their present form  Damn that's a frightening number, isn't it?   Why doesn't the mainstream press call out or politicians on this nonsense?  How did we wind up with Rolling Stone as a better source of information than most of our "news" sources.   I meant the poor wages, no rights and exploitation part.  They can't be  owning up to that, are they?   But do you ever hear anybody point this out in the public debates about immigration? I haven't.   Thanks for the correction, I should have said few rights.  However, while illegal immigrants have rights under the law, the fear of arrest and deportation often means they are afraid to exercise and assert their rights, and have de facto no labor rights.  edit: under the law, not until the law.   This is about my favorite comment about work and success. (Not too surprising. I hear you guys who go to MIT are pretty smart.)  I can look at my own career, and I see I've done reasonably well and worked reasonably hard, but luck (my first job happened to give me an opportunity to learn an in-demand skill ) and good judgement (choosing what tech skills to learn next) have had more to do with my success as hard work. There are plenty of people who have worked harder than I have and have a lot less to show for it.    I'm quite sure politicians of all persuasions will express a great concern about wage stagnation right up until Election day.  And then ...   If only she were an atheist as well.   Fits nicely with their climate change dodge.   Illegal immigrants are fearful for their jobs and have no rights.  Really, the new model for the American worker. Enjoy your future, American workers.   And will our legislators ever do anything about it? Probably not any time soon. It's like  tax cheating.  Their big donors benefit from loopholes and lax enforcement.    Out-of-state money, uninspiring opponents, and running in non-Presidential elections. Walker raised huge amounts of money to fight the recall In 2012. Wisconsin elected Tammy Baldwin to the Senate, who is about as far removed from Walker on the political spectrum as possible.    Given were the money if flowing, the Republican primary is looking like a Bush-Walker cage match.     It's probably more realistic strategy than running on his charisma and record of public service.   The Wisconsin tradition of fine public education - That's so over.  Edit: missing word        Just in case anyone still isn't clear on the GOP agenda.    Nothing's more important to America's future than checking everyone's urine.      So extending the logic a bit, we don't need to pay Congress's   technology because Abraham Lincoln wrote with an ink pen.  We should stop paying for their airplane tickets to go to their district because James Madison traveled by horse drawn coach.  And we should remove the plumbing from Congress because if an outdoor privy was good enough for the Founding Fathers , it's good enough for clowns like Dave Brat.   Or better still, use state employment as a reward for your cronies and toadies.     Blaming civil servants and bureaucrats distracts from the fundamental unfairness of the U.S. economy.     Nope, he's proved himself a useful tool for the 1%.  I'd say he's the Republican Party's leading Presidential candidate.   We're not joking about the incident, we're joking about the Republicans transparent and self-serving attempt to manufacture a nonexistent scandal out of a tragedy. That's what's messed up.   I'm sure they won't have any problem sacrificing their constituents access to health care in order to show how principled they are.    We can't have citizens who can think for themselves.  We like 'em ignorant and docile. /s   Yeah, a blue state Republican really needs to watch the rhetoric.   ghazi needs to become a suffix, like -gate,  for all Republican ['scandals'](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/08/08/president-obamas-16-watergates-so-far/200358) .  Net neutrality-ghazi, IRS-ghazi, Birth Certificate-ghazi   So, I'm guessing "I misspoke" must be a Kansas regionalism for "I lied".     In today's least surprising piece of news, more evidence that Ted Cruz is a hypocrite.   Control of Congress has allowed the Republican Party to defer its public campaign against Mr. Obamas initiatives, since they are dead on arrival. But the G.O.P. will not have that luxury in 2016, when it will need to offer a more cogent and specific response than it has so far.  I'm sure they'll go with the usual, a tax break that largely goes to the wealthy.   Shlaes and other fantasy tax-plan advocates have a big problem: Their math doesn't work.  They already are!  Look at how good they are with imaginary numbers.     Yeah, instead of being under the thumb of corporate interests, like a good lawmaker is supposed to be.   How about the party of arithmetic?  But none of those fractions, they're too hard!   I think the Koch's prefer their own dog, little 'Scottie' Walker from Wisconsin.      So naturally the Republicans have embraced it. It's kind of a pattern.   Well, we do want to encourage that Entrepreneurial Spirit.  And you got to work with what you got. But seriously, I think its largely a way to throw another obstacle in the way of our poorest citizens.  If they were really interested in reducing people cheating the government, they'd go after contractor fraud or tax cheating. That would save us a lot more money than food stamp ID's.   We could even get [Bernie himself](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/09/19/bernie-sanders-folk-album-president/) to sing the songs.  Although I get the impression [we might not want him to](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/18/sen-bernie-sanders-office-responds-to-the-unearthing-of-his-epic-folk-album.html) .    But wouldn't get a movie as good as American Sniper, would we?   A better person than myself would not take such joy in watching Schock twist and squirm.  Fortunately, I am not that better person.   Yes ,and the Democrats are the party of the 1%, and Louisiana's finances are excellent and look, it turns out that up is down and South is North.  This guy is really starting to sound desperate. Or he's auditioning for a spot on Fox News after his political career hits a hard stop   Excellent idea. Let's issue one to everyone who receives  food stamps, and then everyone on food stamps will have a valid government issued ID for voting. Although I wonder if the vote suppressing Republicans have truly thought this plan through.     He was hoping the 'fever would break' and he could reach some sensible compromises with the Republicans.  Sometimes optimism doesn't pay off.   We sent them a bill, representative Michael Burgess told Politico, and they need to pass it. They need to pass our bill. A tantrum is not far off.   Yep, the Senate is supposed to pass all the bills the House sends it without modification.  Except then what's the point of having two chambers in Congress?     Judging from their views on economics, I think most Republicans find math a foreign language as well.   Hmm, you sound a whole lot [Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/opinion/paul-krugman-twin-peaks-planet.html) there, who I'm guessing you're not a fan of. And as he points out in the article, there are a number of other things going on. Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.     Christ almighty, the Keystone job bill again. It'll solve everything,  It's the 'key' to America's recovery. The corner'stone' to a bright American future.  C'mon GOP, you're not pushing it hard enough.   Butter him up and put him on plate. Rand Paul is toast.  Which is a shame.  I don't want him to be President, but if he stayed in the race as viable candidate, some of his better ideas, such as less foreign intervention and ending corporate welfare before reducing social programs might have become part of the Republican primary debate   You've got a point (especially about housing size), but, while we're looking at Pew Surveys, wouldn't you think this has something do with at well? http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/    The Foolish, Historically Illiterate, Incredible Response to Obama  Seems about par for the course.   I really hope 'drafting error' catches on as a euphemism for a lie.   Maybe.  But with full Republican control, we'll get the unrestrained  version, without any of that worker protection or rights nonsense.   Too bad Russ Feingold doesn't want to run again.     Wait until the Republicans have control of all 3 branches of the government.  They'll turn America into a high-profit, low wage paradise.   Somehow that concern about government waste and inefficiency disappears whenever its money for defense.   Brownback should turn it into a campaign slogan "Helping Kansas Children by spending Less on Education" or "Ensuring a Bright Future for Kansas through crappy schools".    This should be an issue during his presidential campaign.  Scott Walker couldn't find criminal activity is his own office, but he'll keep America safe from terrorists.    Agreed.  Wisconsin is turning into North South Carolina.   Wisconsin is apparently now part of Dixie.   And yet people think Ryan's a hypocrite about the deficit. Puzzling, no?   No, but they've made a good start.   He should make it into a campaign slogan : Scott Walker - Putting my out of state donors first!       Theyre not legislators, theyre just assholes, a senior GOP aide told CQ Roll Call  A comment that would apply to a lot of other 'legislators' as well.         Somebody had to step up, now that Michelle Bachmann isn't there to provide the crazy anymore.   Because their obeisance to wealthy interests and donors trumps their conservatism.     The GOP is making the Onion redundant.    Because the Republicans always win off year elections in Wisconsin. In presidential years, the electorate votes in Tammy Baldwin, who is about as close to the obverse of Scott Walker as you can imagine.   Sounds like an Onion headline, doesn't it?    However, our Republicans Presidential candidates are [out in front](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/05/12/where-the-2016-gop-contenders-stand-on-climate-change/) of the climate scientists and the American public on this issue.  /s   I was fifteen or sixteen and many of my friends smoked. I didn't really have an idea what being addicted to something meant, but I sure found out.     Sure, I'll try a cigarette.  	116

    My first thought was Grandma Death.         [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNLvqnuaXRw)   This is in Ouray, Colorado at their annual 4th of July water fight. Two person teams battle each other with fire hoses until only one remains. The crowd is always right next to the action, so things like this happen from time to time.         This reminds me of what happened in my high school. I was in band, and it was generally known amongst the band kids that one of the female students was living with the male band teacher and his wife. She didn't have the best home life, so we all wrote it off as a creepy form of charity. We found out later that our band teacher got fired, and when we also found out he was getting a divorce it didn't take long to figure out what happened. After his divorce, he moved to a different town and married the girl who was living with him.   We had high hopes for our next band director. He seemed so nice. My senior year was his first year, and we didn't have any problems with him. Seven years later, he ends up in jail for underage p in the v. I ran into him at a chocolate shop last year when I was with my parents, and I didn't recognize him. My dad did though, and he could tell that the creep remembered me and was intentionally avoiding me. Never did find out all the details on that one, though.  [Hold on a minute, I found the link!](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/montrose-band-teacher-accused-of-sex-with-student)   There are a lot of nice people here as well.

 Bunga bunga parties will make him good at the end.      Some real bonkers at their best.                           He got trained not to make final judgements, but to present facts only (dot, dots, final picture). All the rest was a work for politicians. I profoundly admire this man, and how deeply he personally struggled to come out...finally            And if you give him a chance to conduct a proper investigation into real happenings on that day, I bet he'd do it eons better   cheaper than most of current serving brass.

 I don't agree. I was curious when I read about your screwdriver mishap, and so I clicked through your username. You seem like an amazing, funny, generous, resilient person. Your husband is lucky to have you.    Of course not.  Her hands were at her side...    I'm going to say something crazy.  I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you.  I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain.  Too many endorphins.   Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...  But none of it was as bad as the pain I had when I got swimmer's ear at 12.  THAT was the worst pain I've ever had.  I wanted to claw my way out of my body.    Hold up guys, you're jumping the gun.  A potential start date is a normal interview question.  It has to do with whether you're a conscientious employee who is going to give notice to your current employer.  If you're actually going to get the job at your level (an engineer), they're going to present you with an offer letter.  That letter is going to tell you your salary.  Benefits are not something you'll get FULL details on until you're an employee because it is proprietary.  What they will tell you is what they offer in general terms (medical, HSA, life, dental) they may disclose if it is a high deductible, but they don't have to.     Site your sources, please.  Edit: I'm being serious, I'm Googling in vain trying to find people who have hurt themselves because they AREN'T trying to be hygienic about their periods.  Plenty of improper use, but nothing here about letting it soak into your clothes being dangerous.  I've never heard of this being an issue in a third world country, I'm very sincerely curious.     Well, provided you actually still get your period (many active women do not, and if you aren't eating properly, your body will shut it down), you could use a menstrual cup.  Really, though, we're talking about being in a trench with the intent of killing other people.  You're going to get dirty.  It's not like your period is an illness.  You're just dirty in a different way.  It's a non-issue.    Well, so far we've had Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea minted on dollar coins.  Neither would have been my first choice.  I'd like to see Madeline Albright or Condoleezza (I've retired from politics to teach) Rice on a bill, but I know that will never happen.   Well, since my daughter was born, I don't save anything.  I've been trying, but it's just not very likely.  In order to save to my actual savings, I would need to decrease my contribution to my Roth 401k, and it's important to put in as much as  you can as early as you can, so I think that's the priority.  After my bills and my deduction for retirement (About $2000, which is mostly essential things like $220 a paycheck for health insurance, $200 a week for daycare), my take home is about $500, which I must take my phone bill, fuel for my car, and student loans out of.  This leaves me with roughly $100 a week in "mad money." I save little if any of it.     I've tried something like six times now to make it through the last season of Nip/Tuck.  Finally I just read the damn Wikipedia article, pictured it in my head, and left it at that.  I think one season into the move to L.A. it was sort of watchable, but enter Hearts and Scalpels, and all of a sudden it was literally painful to watch.  I don't know if there was some unhappiness but a long network contract or what the deal was.    http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html   Here you go: http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html   lol, I'm a girl!!!! It was a reference to this: http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html   Please see my edit.    I'm not a he.  It was a reference to this: http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html   Does the listing say it's two records?  Mine came with only one...    Theodore Roosevelt.  He's a bull moose who carries a big stick.  We can do it in the tent. Yes.    Women can't participate in trench warfare because they will die from a yeast infection if they get too dirty.   Edit: This blew up overnight and I got a lot of questions as to whether this was a belief in the 1990's.  It was a reference to this [Newt Gingrich chestnut from 1995](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html).   Pros   -Won't be as prone to run away from home  -Won't bleed on your furniture  -Can't have unexpected puppies  -Won't die from complications of birth (lots of dogs, like English Bulldogs, need assistance up to and including surgery to give birth to a litter)  -Stabilized mood  Cons   -Can be expensive if you don't qualify for financial assistance  Edit: formatting and typo fix   The poncho is a staple of failed fashions to be reintroduced every five years.  Check out your local consignment shop (Goodwill, Savers) you can probably find an array of ponchos from as recently as the year 2007.   African Americans are 13.2% of the US Population, and yet make up 60% of the total prison population.    Are you really trying to tell me that when Will Parish gets all choked up describing what his wife was wearing the first time he met her your stone cold heart doesn't break just a little? I don't believe it. I bet you blubber like a baby. It's okay, man, me too.    For real, though. There are two scenes in this movie that make me cry every single time. I got the VHS set for Easter when I was, like, 14. Great choice, man!    Right, the point was about accepting personal responsibility. Yes, sometimes things happen to use that we wouldn't choose, but what we can choose is how to overcome. :)   1) I expect nothing.  2) Haven't you ever seen those posts on Facebook where they show like a turn key for opening a can of sardines with text like "Like if you know what this is... Don't give it away!"  3) You know what I'm sick of?  Older people telling me about how unfortunate I am to not know what it is to have spent my childhood outside or to be unwired.  Hello, I didn't have a cellphone until I was 21, and we were outside all the time.  My SNES had a strict half hour a day limit on it.  It's called parenting.  By the same ticket, it's not "impressive" that I listen to talk radio or like Led Zeppelin.  4) What even IS a 90's kid?  I was born in 1987, and I'm the first to admit that anything prior to 1995 is a bit blurry.  I found out who Nirvana was at 15.5 years old.  Yet I'm told people born in '98 consider themselves to be 90's kids?  Call me crazy, but I think you should probably have to remember the actual decade to associate with it.  Like my husband.  Graduated HS in 1994.  THAT'S a 90's kid.    This isn't a city, but I was SHOCKED at how beautiful Nebraska was... I mean, I had always heard it was so boring, the most boring state there is, even... look, Iowa and Indiana both have much worse landscapes... Gentle hills covered in tall grass that moves in the wind is quite beautiful! You know what isn't?  Acres of soybeans.  And in Indiana?  Even the billboards are boring.    It's okay, man.  My disclosure is currently sitting at 0 points.  This is precisely what I'm talking about in my response.  We shouldn't have to gird our loins because more often than not people choose to be vindictive.     Senpai just noticed me, ladies.  Check that off the bucket list.    My daughter had a lip and a tongue tie.  We had the tongue tie corrected when she was two weeks old, but the lip tie was too minor to do anything about.  She was making me bleed and I ended up getting mastitis twice.  I spent very close to a grand on lactation counseling before I ended up just exclusively pumping for two months.  I got mastitis again, and finally when I got Reynauld's syndrome from pumping for about six hours a day, I had to admit I was missing the forest for the trees and needed to accept it was over.  I needed to dry up, realize that she wasn't going to starve because she was on formula, and give all this time back to her.  It was still really hard and I still want to cry talking about it.    This seems to have turned into an "unattractive generalization about my gender" type of thread.  My answer to the actual question is that I let my daughter sleep on her stomach and I failed at breastfeeding before we even hit three months.    To join the party: I've experienced more sexism and misogyny from other women than I ever have from men.  If you are a smart and capable, dependable type of person, I will do everything in my power to pull you up and beyond my level.  Pulling people down doesn't do anything but hurt your soul.  Stop doing that!    This sounds exactly like something me and my sister would think up playing with our Barbies.  It's not a good Barbie game without a serial killer involved.  Sounds like this kid took it one step further.  I approve.  Future novelist.    There is no such thing as divine retribution.  Good things don't exclusively happen to good people, and bad people might never get their comeuppance.    To expound on that idea, once people get over it, you're only a victim if you allow yourself to see it that way.  You are the only person who is uniquely in charge of your own destiny.  If you hate the way things are, you can change your entire reality.  You really are the only thing that is holding you back.    It's getting better.  That bullshit about getting pre-qualified for 4.25 times my annual wages would never happen post-bank reform.  We're seeing the beginning of college tuition reform.  As someone who is getting old enough to think about the younger generation, I'm actually optimistic.  For while the way they go about things isn't always what I would do, I sure as heck wasn't fighting against inequality at age 12.  Young people are more conscientious, civil rights minded, and generous than I think they've ever been.  I am also seeing a shifting of values insofar as life-goals, which are more aligned with the reality of inflation and the wage-gap.  Marriage and homeownership are being replaced with travel and experiences.  While that isn't what I've chosen for myself, it's certainly more cost effective and probably more satisfying for people who don't want to look back and have regrets.   Sorry about how sentimental this reply was.    Ignore the "7 second rule" on the freeway.  The theory prevents tailgating.  For every 10 mph you're traveling, you should have 1 second between you and the next car.  You count them by waiting for them to pass a traffic light or sign and then count aloud.     This isn't really all that creepy, but I did shoot a soda out of my nose when she asked me this at age 9: "What's the difference between menstruation and masturbation?  Because I can't really tell the difference."  Clearly, this is what happens when you are desperate to seem more knowledgeable than you are.      Well, another thing to look for is something that your dad uses everyday, but would never spend a lot of money on for himself... like a coffee maker.  If he loves coffee, but bought the $20 Mr. Coffee model from Wal-Mart, replace it for him.  What kind of razors does he use?  Does he use $.99 Shampoo?  Scott toilet paper?!  Just give him a nice version, and make a joke about it.  Royal treatment on me, dad. :)   Technically, I have already obtained my version of the American dream.  I have a career, I'm a homeowner, I'm married, and I have a child that I'm able to support without financial aid of any sort.  Despite my considerable amount of financial responsibility, I'm still able to put 12% of my wages into my retirement fund, and if I retire at 65, I'll have enough to live comfortably until I'm 90.  I'm not yet 30 years old.  I'm also making enough money to pay my mother a high enough wage to enable her to stay at home with my baby.  I think my success where a lot of millennials are coming up short has to do with proper financial education, which I'm sorry to say did not come from high school or college, but from my mother.  The danger in my mind is over-extending yourself.    The first time I went in and got pre-qualified for a homeowner's loan, my husband and I were making a total of $40k a year.  We were approved for $170k.  Right now we're a $75k per year family with a $70k mortgage, which isn't even as much as I was pre-qualified for on my wages alone (pre-qualified for $95k).  I was also advised from the time I was 16 that I need to contribute to my retirement as soon and as much as I can, as you need time for your money to compound.  Later, I had a retired family member tell me how much he regretted putting most of his money in a traditional 401k instead of in a Roth account.  I immediately took his lament to heart.   I got my first credit card at 16 so I could begin building my credit.  I've got a score of over 800.  I've never paid a car payment in my life, since a car is only worth getting you from point A to point B... it will never be a lasting investment.  Better to just shell out for that junker, run it dead, then move on to the next one.  tl;dr: I think it depends on how much common sense parents are able to instill in their children.  It's possible to have everything you want and more if you know early on what it takes to hit your aims.      Although, I have to say, his sister is a class act too.  My Great grandfather was an amazing wood worker, and he made these lovely matching boxes as his and his wife's final resting place (they both wanted to be cremated).  Debbie took their ashes out and had them converted to JEWLERY BOXES.  My great grandparents are currently in ziplock bags at the child molester's house. :-/   My great uncle.  He's a child molester.  He's assaulted my mother (she was 12), raped my aunt (she was 15), and one of his daughters suffered from urinary incontinence until her 20's while the other just completely shut down at age five and didn't speak again until she was about 10... so I can't say for sure there, but it stands to reason.       You should try to think of a gift that is based upon an innocuous detail he mentioned at some point.    I remember once when I was 20, I came in to visit my grandpa wearing a pair of Chuck Taylor hi-tops.  He told me he had a pair just like them in the 1960's.  They were white and his wife had thrown them out.  Now he was in his 80's and I'd never seen him wear anything but cowboy boots, so instead of actually replacing them, I made him a photo-realistic portrait of a pair and gave it to him several years later.   People love to feel like you're listening to them even when they don't have anything too terribly important to say.    Well, with 20 more characters, maybe I'd be more successful than I thought. (Just kidding! 2verbose2live)   He's my... uh.... 1st cousin twice removed, I think.... He back handed a toddler, Great Grandma didn't like it.  The irony is that there are a number of child molesters that Grandma never knew about that were/are about 12x more deserving of her ire.    I'm a big fan of https://twitter.com/katvapid  If I could be as snide, witty, and pithy as Kat in 120 characters, I'd actually have an account. :-/   No man, they just [screw with Jell-O boxes.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/02/20/ethel_and_julius_rosenberg_how_a_jell_o_box_helped_convict_them.html)    Better yet, hire Steve Buscemi to give them the $10,000, gift card, and bad news.  Then kill yourself.  In your suicide note, admit you always loved that person.  Done.  Dust hands.    The way I eat is the most prevalent one.  I always put off eating better.    Yes, and then it all falls out.  I'm not even kidding.    I have a whole list of childhood crushes that are not altogether conventional:  -Marty Stouffer - Wild America (like PBS, not the movie with Devon Sawa)  -Tom Petty  -David Spade  -Dana Carvey  -Norbert - The Angry Beavers (stop judging me)  -Eric from Captain Planet  -Jesus Christ (I'm an atheist who loved beards from age 2)  -Brian May (from Queen)  ... I could go on into my teens, but I think this is probably enough disclosure for this particular post.    A nail clipper.  There has never been a moment in my life where I think, man this nail clipper is a useless waste of space.  I'm always glad for it.    Well, I think that's down to preference and lifestyle. I am a woman, so I don't sweat a lot, and I work in an air conditioned office. You don't want to end up with the "Fitbit rot" so if you do choose to go with a rubber band, make sure you have enough slack for air to circulate and you clean it with isopropyl once a week. I think a better option in my mind would be a NATO band. They're made out of Nylon, more secure, washable, affordable, and have classic preppy style to them in a variety of colors. :)   Just be smart and earn people's respect through your performance.  The point was supposed to be that we shouldn't be upset about stuff we can't change, and even if it doesn't seem that way now, people how overcome the same issues at an even greater disadvantage.  Furthermore, what you're seeing as a defect is actually an asset in the minds of many people, so cheer up!  I was trying to make him feel better about something that is probably not going to change for a long time.  But, you know, thank you for all of your valuable contributions.    Thank you for attempting to help me, but what I meant is that while I know full well how to use it correctly, the majority of the population does not, so rather look like I'm wrong (while they would be wrong about that), I just revise. ;)   Well, you can see my advice regarding how to be taken seriously above.    Man, try being taken seriously as a woman who has a baby face and is also under five feet tall. I got offered a kids menu printed on a damn football while out to dinner with my company's CEO while I was 27 and six months pregnant. Just be smart and earn people's respect through your performance.   Postscript: The next day I gave a performance summary to the second in command of the largest utility company in the United States about how I single handedly turned his outsourced program around... Like a boss.    Why would you want to fix your baby face? It's actually a proven fact that human beings are drawn to partners who look younger than they are due to viability of genetics. Men are even more attracted to women with vaguely babyish features... Here: http://study.com/academy/lesson/physical-traits-and-attraction-symmetry-ratios-the-babyface-phenomenon.html   Y-you got a reservation?  But how?  Damn it, Sean!    Guys, c'mon.  It think it's probably something like "Next round of golf is on me," in addition to the normal picking up the tab on drinks and meals.    Right, hence the "most people wouldn't trouble," I was making room for extreme pragmatists who use it as a means for manipulating situations by being highly aware of different aspects.    Well, probably because most people wouldn't trouble to imagine what it is like to be someone else and go through an event as that person if the experience didn't inspire some sort of emotional response in them.  When I'm empathizing, I also tend to communicate in a way that makes the person feel less alone while not being sympathetic (read: pitying them).  Edit: word   This is also my husband's birthday month.  I got him a ticket to see two symphonies by two of his favorite composers.  I also got him the complete Polar Bear Caf anime series since that kind of absurd humor would appeal to him and it's kid friendly.  Note: My husband is not my dad.    Well for one thing, my condescending old relatives wouldn't be able to post that transcript of his stupid graduation speech on Facebook once a week.  Guess what, not all of us take our parents for granted or think they're moronic and boring...     We all have preferences, and that's all they are: preferences.  Things don't become problematic until we're trying to force people into an ideal against their will.  Personally, I don't really find moderately overweight men or muscular men attractive.  My ideal is someone who lists slightly to the left in a strong wind (read: skinny af), however I happen to be married to someone who is perfectly average if a bit tall.  It's not a deal breaker and I'm not going to starve him to make him more attractive.    /u/late_night_grumbler He makes me laugh.   Edit: I also really enjoy these thoughtful and intelligent ladies: /u/hugsouffle and /u/unsweet_tea   This is a great, well thought out comment.  Thank you for taking the type to write it out.  This is just what I was looking for. :)   Please don't post jokes about how you also only start half the time. I'm seriously curious about where the new-car mentality comes from.    It would, but not in the way you think it would.  This person would clearly need to be able to kill things with their mind.  The government would waste no time in kidnapping this person and then turning them into a wartime weapon!  The corpses resultant would nourish the earth.  The end.    Well, my sister had absolutely terrible taste in music.  She would listen to Good Charlotte, Ashlee Simpson, Trapt, Blue October, New Found Glory, Howie Day... I absolutely hated it then, and some of it I still do... but occasionally some idiotic song will come on and I'll like it in spite of myself because it reminds me of her.  This is the inverse of what you're asking.    No problem, man.  I'll mention too that at my old place they mandated the amount of notice you had to give based upon your pay schedule e.g. if you are salaried, you must give one month; if you are hourly, you must give two weeks.    You just gave me an eye twitch.    /r/advice But, hell, why not.  There is usually a difference between sick leave and vacation.  Some places don't differentiate and just call it PTO or Paid Time off.  You need to check your employer's policies.  There is usually a clause stating that you need to give notice IN WRITING and that you need to work all of the days in notice (unless the employer dismisses you) to be paid out for your vacation.     Well-groomed, charming, conventionally attractive guys.  If you use hair-gel and can charm strangers, I'm going to assume you have a great game and could possibly be carrying an STI.  I'm not about that life.    Sounds to me like you have a problem with being present.  Obviously we all need to think about the past or present on occasion, but the aim is to visit, not reside.  Instead of thinking about all the things you need to do next, focus on what you're doing now.  Try to enjoy it.  Your memory will improve.     I'd advise against taking this person's comment seriously. :-/   This one is so prevalent that I actually re-write my sentences to not include them so that the majority will not assume I'm wrong for using "affect" more than not.  Yes, I have anxiety and worry about things like this.    Yeah.  In my high school there was only one Hispanic kid in the whole building.  I don't think I ever heard anyone call him by his real name.  It was always "beaner" or "wetback" or "brownie" or "spic..."  Now having moved to this area from a predominantly Hispanic community a state away, I was totally shocked and ask why the hell you would do something like that.  The response I always heard from the other kids was "He doesn't care, he knows we're not serious."     No, however my husband's first name is a common shortening of my own name.  You will not believe the moronic questions we get about it.  You would think we lived in the Good Burger sketch with the twins.    Real Talk: I'm sure the kid would come out with just as many issues, they would merely be different issues.  On paper, I have a much better life than my mom and those advantages would pertain to my child, however, circumstances aren't everything.  My mother never struggled with crippling anxiety.  She's a pretty happy person, if a bit insensitive to things she doesn't understand.        I don't know the names of any tracks, but my husband plays this bizarre atmospheric music that is pretty much a foghorn playing for 24 minutes and occasionally there will be this high pitched beeping that he can't even hear... Protip: if your dogs whimper because of the beeping in your music, it's no good.  Turn it off!    I totally get what you're saying, but you know, a "I'm sorry, I missed that..." would go a long way.  It's totally not fun to feel beneath notice.   YES!  My husband fucking tells his mother everything, then remembers it as telling me... Like MAN if you had TOLD ME that we were having company, I'd be nervous and thus I would remember you telling me.  Do not tell me you told me.  You told your damn mother again!  Of course what I really say is "I would appreciate it if you could try telling me a few times :)"   Three times a day or so, I will say something to my husband and he will act like he didn't hear me.  Like he'll be obviously looking for something, and I'll say to him "What are you looking for, baby?" and he'll just not answer, not look at me, and then leave the room on a search for something that is probably exactly where I think it is.   He also does this when I ask him to turn down the volume in the car.  I swear to god, I am NOT a mumbler.  He's just being an ass.    Older doesn't mean smarter or more driven or really more anything.  I absolutely hate that your age doesn't actually equate to brilliance.  I think this would be a lot easier for me if I had seen it in action prior to age 22.  Like, so let me get this straight... you're 57 and you're working for $7.50 at a call center and this is your whole life?  I don't understand.  You're bumming me out.   Probably making sandwiches for my husband.  I like to add all kinds of things that if I told him about he probably wouldn't try the sandwich... so when he inevitably tells me it's the best sandwich he's ever had I'm like :3    I was riding with my mom in the car in winter and there was salt on the roads.  She said "It pisses me off that the Indians use all this salt... aren't they supposed to care about the environment?"  I sat there for like two minutes before I managed to say "Mom, for 150 years white people forced them into boarding schools where they erased all traces of their culture.  That's more than one generation.  What are you even talking about?"  She didn't believe me then, but like two years later I proved to her that assimilation is a thing and it happened.  She tells everyone now.    I actually prefer them.  I left the following comment on some other post:   Be awkward and malnourished. I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type. I like 'em hungry looking.     If you're going vintage, you want to look for something that has been serviced and cleaned and checked for accuracy.  If you're using eBay (which is a great way to find watches), you should check the finished sales on watches with the same movement.    There are typically three kinds of watches people are looking for: Quartz (meaning battery powered), manual (you wind it), or automatic (it winds itself through the movement of your arms when you walk).  If you're looking for a low profile, you will probably have to sacrifice the convenience of the self-winding automatic.  It's better to go vintage than it is to buy a brand new watch that's a cheap piece of junk... like a Stuhrling.  Yes, it's pretty, but you won't have it long.     If you really have a timepiece you love, invest in some watch tools so you can change your bands on it.  Get a nice band or a few.  I have a BROS buffalo leather band on my vintage Zenith, and I love it! :)   Yes, there are people in the world that have it worse than you, but that doesn't make what you're feeling less real.  It doesn't negate your feelings.  I recently had someone point out that I was being unfair in a discussion because I was failing to acknowledge the validity of one group's plight because the plight of the other group was so much greater.  That was not fair of me and far from sensitive.  I never do this on an individual level, but when it comes to groups and broad generalizations, I have a much harder time.    "When you call me close to tell me your body is not beautiful I want my body and my hands to be pools for your looking and laughing.   It used to be cerulean, and that's still the answer I'll give automatically, but I think that it's not strictly true.  Colors benefit greatly by having other colors around them.  It's like one of those t-shirt displays at a shop.  You buy one and take it home but it never looks as nice as it did with all its fellows.    According to my body-builder friend, you can live healthily a very long time on broccoli and flax-crusted chicken breasts.  I asked him the same question.    Where they keep the snoovatars and you get gilded for reasons that are hard to pinpoint... you know... that place.    You know... the image-less image board everyone uses....    Miracle, kismet, zeitgeist, caveat....    Calm down, I'm just remarking surprise since I would have expected you to say something like "I'd be the person who comes to your house and breaks your arms for asking the same question I saw five times yesterday alone."  I'm old, married, and, yes, I have bad taste.  You don't need to tell me you have no interest.  I'm just trying to have fun with you. :(   Tumblr's favorite topic is extremely subjective.  It all depends on who you are following.  I could ask the same question but it would look like this: "Why are child-free people who abuse children tumblr's favorite topic?"  or like this: "Why are the politics of black hair tumblr's favorite topic?"   You've bothered to give this answer multiple times, you who hates repeat questions.... it's strange.  I have no idea what you look like, but I'm pretty sure no matter how you look, I'd prefer you over Ryan Reynolds.  He gives me the creeps.    Was it a LATE NIGHT, Grumbler???? AHAHAHAHAH T_T   I'll take it! ;)   Omg, you guys.  He's talking about me!    Cersei Lannister.... We never got a single clue prior to her narration chapters that she was practically a paranoid schizophrenic whose mania was fixated on Tyrion.  I always got the impression that she didn't like him, but I never thought for one second she was AFRAID of him and imagining him hiding behind every corner.... What the hell?  Edit: Maybe we find out later that someone is poisoning her and she's actually going insane and that's why this was never foreshadowed?     Cheap prescription glasses... I'm looking at you, [Zenni Optical](http://www.zennioptical.com/).  Thank you for saving me hundreds vs. Lenscrafters.    Two books:   Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro  The Reader by Bernhard Schlink    Kicker: It's actually spelled "lemin."  Yes really.  	101

 A perfect job for a defensive minded coach. But where to find one of those...   Weidman/Silva II    Spotify was huge for me. I just make a point to listen to a few new albums each week. I try to mix old artists with newer ones too. r/letstalkmusic has been a great resource too. I try to read a little bit about the artist while I'm listening and that usually leads to their influences, which opens up another opportunity to try new music.    How did the principle know whose grades to change?    [10] guy probably called it that.   When people make fun of you for liking those bands, they don't actually care or think any less of you for it. What they will think less of you for is if you act ashamed. Just own it and people will be cool with it. At work, I'm known as the music buff who sings along to Taylor Swift. Just accept that you like what you like and people will respect that.    Curious, can you get mineral oil at any store that has basic skin care products? I've never seen it.    Exactly. Javy Lopez was a huge midseason pick up in 2010 too.    He disappoints me every off season, but I'm happy in October.    And this is the one comment that doesn't have gold...   Tl;dr  What's my purpose?   Why am I doing this?   Who am I doing this for?   My friend, 22, is getting married next week. Like a chump, I waited until the last minute to get the couple a gift and everything on their registry has already been purchased. What can I give him that will be special? My max is $100.   How long does it take to get something tailored? I bought a jacket for a wedding on the 28th and the sleeves are just a little bit  too long.    I don't think so. Simple goals like reading 20 minutes a day, listening to new music every week or practicing an instrument every day are easily accomplished with a little discipline and go along way in improving oneself.    This isn't a genre or artist I'm familiar with but I've heard so many good things about it, so I gave it a spin today. Can't say I was too impressed. There's a lot going on, but nothing stood out as exceptionally catchy. I might have to listen to it again to make a better judgement.    Check out [this transformation]( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bfoi2) by /u/nmp12.  I bet you could pull off something similar.    Why doesn't Vivek just coach the team himself? It's obvious he wants compete control anyway. Just cut out the middleman.    I really want to hear an explanation from Pete and Vivek. If they have someone like Karl or JVG linned up, then I won't be upset. If this firing is a result of Malone not living up to expectations, then this firing is outrageous. Look at this roster and tell me with a straight face that it's underachieving. Our best player has missed the last 8 games and we're still less than 2 games out of the 8th spot. I don't think there's a Kings fan alive who isn't pleased with the team's performance this year.   If Malone was fired because we weren't playing the ultempo style Vivek wants to see, then Vivek needs to go. It's about winning games, which we were doing for the first time in 8 years. Style counts for nothing.     The only way this makes sense is if ownership has been in secret talks with another coach and an agreement was made. Unless a George Karl announcement is made this week, this makes no sense. We haven't made the playoffs in 8 years and right now we're less than 2 games out of the 8th spot with our best player missing the last week and a half. No rational person can call that underperforming.    Or, you know, cover it on their TV channel.    1. I posted this over 2 hours ago.   2. As of 20 minutes ago, the last time I had the channel on, they were showing a special on dinosaur fossils.    Right now they're showing a program on dinosaur fossils.    Hostage situation in Sydney. CNN can barely be bothered to mention it.     Edit: RIP my inbox. I get that it's on their front page now. It wasn't this afternoon when I made this comment. You don't all have to tell me the same thing.   They probably don't want the terrorists to be able to see what the police are doing on the outside.    Russell Wilson is the quarterback we hoped Kaep would be.    Only for 11 months of the year. As for October...   I'm surprised LA is willing to deal Kemp within the division. Especially since the Padres are a big bat or two away from being a really scary team.    She apologized and claimed her friend was on her Tinder. I laughed it off and then she unmatched me.    The conversation always starts at the bottom for me. Maybe it's different on iPhone.    I hate people who think they're better than Tinder.    I don't think he's boasting, but he clearly doesn't take driving drunk seriously.       "Should have had at least a dozen by now, so be it."   Fuck him if he thinks driving while drunk is a joke.    Came across her just now. Sacramento?    I bought a cheap one. It's so bad I don't even bother using it anymore.    It was briefly the name of what's now the Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.    At least it's not Power Balance Pavilion.   *"Let's force a bunch of businesses to close on the busiest shopping day of the year. That will make people support our cause."*   It seems like we have talent at every position, but as a team we're absolute garbage. It's frustrating.   You don't need to cycle creatine. Just take 5g a day.   Garbage   I'm asking my brother for a liter of clean urine.   A George Forman Grill, Crock-pot or a rice cooker.   This is supposed to be the Manning family, which happens to have 3 NFL quarterbacks in it. Archie, the father is long retired, but Peyton currently plays for the Denver Broncos and is easily one of the top 5 quarterbacks ever. His younger brother, Eli, is good, but nowhere near as good as Peyton. He also has a knack for throwing interceptions, when the opposing team catches his passes.   You mean you can't punch a police officer in the face and put your hands on his gun?    What is it about protests that make people think they can block off roads? Get out of the street!   Michael Brown was an asshole. The looters are assholes.  The arsonists are also assholes. OP never mentioned protesters.    There are legit cases of systematic racism everyday in America, but this is not one of them. This is a case in which a man assaulted a police officer, tried to grab his gun, and was killed as a consequence of his actions.   Looks like protesters were sitting on the car's hood and the driver just punched it to get out of there.   I wish the video started a few seconds earlier.    Did you go out and ask them? According to CNN, the majority of the 61 arrests last night were Ferguson residents.   He's certainly popular, but I don't think he will be able to make it out of the primaries.   This morning, I heard talking heads on CNN blame everyone BUT the people of Ferguson for the riots. It takes a special kind of mental gymnastics to watch people burn their own city and then blame the police, outside agitators, the prosecutor, etc...   This is so irresponsible. Someone needs to be fired for this.   My work sells cheesecake. The last two nights I ate a slice at 520 calories a piece. I'm curious how bad it would be if 520 of my 3000 daily calories came from cheesecake if I did that everyday...hypothetically of course.   Hopefully he's able to play 3B for the rest of his career, because Sox fans won't be happy with having a DH who can't hit more than 15 home runs and .280.   Look what those racist cops made him say!   Freaking Jake Tapper always trying to protect female reporters. Let them do their job and trust their judgement to keep themselves safe.   It's justified because he assaulted a cop and tried to grab his gun.   Yet you're still watching...   Police should go home and let these people burn their city down. This is disgraceful!   It's the punching a police officer and reaching for his gun that did it.   And tomorrow they will blame police.   Word is that an announcement of indictment cannot be made unless the suspect is in custody. Darren Wilson has not been asked to turn himself in and an announcement is scheduled for about 10 minutes from now, so it can deduced that there will be no indictment.   This is going to be a shit show.   There will be no indictment, Ferguson will riot, protesters will blame police. Count on it!   Seriously! I don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea.    Well, what's the answer?   I'm nervous about our rotation. In the playoffs, MadBum was dominant, but everyone else struggled. A healthy Cain will help, but who knows what he will be capable of. Adding another reliable starter will be huge.    I'm gonna miss Pablo, but the reality of it is that he is a .280 hitter who has surprisingly little power for a man his size. As much as I like him, I don't think he's worth $100 million. If this means we get Lester, I think we come out ahead.   Supposedly Posey wants to catch.   We have $100 million to spend on free agents now, which can only mean Matt Duffy and Joaquin Arias will platoon 3B next year.    The guy didn't owe us anything. Boston is a great city with a good team. Let's just be happy for the good years we had with Pablo and even happier that we didn't overpay for him.   I'm sad to see Panda go, but glad we didn't shell out $100 million for him. If this means we can sign either Tomas, Lester or Headly, I think we're better off.    This is my biggest complaint about MFA, which is still one of my favorite subreddits. I see students asking for advice all the time and it never fails that people suggest the stereotypical MFA uniform. While an OCBD, dark cuffed denim and Allen Edmonds look nice, they're way out of place on a college campus, let alone high school.    Someone once told me to dress 10% better than the average guy. That way, you look better, but don't stick out like a sore thumb. Given that I went to a university in southern California where the average guy wore a tank top, basketball shorts and flip flops, that wasn't hard.    To me, dressing well is a combination of looking nice without looking out of place. There's a time and a place for the MFA uniform, but 11th grade isn't it. To be fair, it seems like this is less of an issue now than it was a year ago, but it's a beef I've always had with MFA.    Sorry for the anti-MFA-circlejerk-circlejerk.   If they rejected everyone who had tried pot, there would be no military.   Noah and Gibson each with 5 fouls. We have to attack the paint.   Just reread Hatchet as a 22 year old. Still as good as I remember.   If you consme more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. If you consume more calories than you burn and don't exercise, you will gain fat.    *"I wonder if I'll be able to recognize Joe Torre as a k--there he is."*   So, he left his insurance info and a phone number with no area code, which could easily be figured out, and he wrote it on a whatever piece of paper he had on him, which happened to have a Bible verse on it? How exactly does this make him a scumbag?    The best one I've made is buffalo chicken. I cook about 1.5 pounds of chicken covered in a bottle of buffalo sauce and dry ranch dressing mix on low for 7-8 hours. Then I just shred it and eat it on a sandwich roll, usually with some broccoli on the side and milk to drink. It's delicious.   I'm all about simplicity, so if a recipe has more than about 3 ingredients, I probably won't try it. Sometimes I'll just cook chicken breasts in water, shred them, and then mix it with brown rice. Chicken can also be slow cooked in beer, which gives it a different flavor. Check out /r/slowcooking for more recipes. They're a little more adventurous than me.    For the most part. I bought a slow cooker and I cook a ton of chicken in that. I also cook a lot of rice. If I cook 2 cups of rice and 1.5 pounds of chicken, I can get about 3 meals out of that, which I refrigerate and eat over 2-3 days.   I also make breakfast burritos with eggs, hash browns and sausage. They're delicious, inexpensive and if I eat 2 of them and a glass of milk in one sitting, it's over 1000 calories. I only make about 8 at a time with 10 eggs, but I've seen guys prepare them by the dozen using 40+ eggs. Just wrap them in a paper towel and put them in Tupperware.    Are you preparing meals in advance? When you go to bed at night, you should know where your calories for the next day are coming from. If you're waking up and scavenging for 3000+ calories every day, you won't be able to sustain.   Nice progress. I love short term progress pics. It makes the future a little less daunting.   Comcast customer support keeps friendzoning me.    M'Netflix    I'd rather see this picture without Photoshop. I guess I'm unique like that :-)   Has there been a better linebacker in football the last 3 weeks than Chris Borland?   49er fans complaining after every call/no-call...    To motivate myself to eat enough protein, I would force myself to eat my own semen on days when I didn't get 120g by bedtime.   Gotta get those sperm gains.   Man, what I wouldn't do to discover AC/DC for the first time again...   They were playing a bar in my neighborhood a few months ago. I drank so much during the opening acts that my friend and I just decided to leave early. Regrets...   Ever since I started paying for Spotify, I've been listening to full albums while I lift. It's like killing two birds with one stone since otherwise I would just sit on my ass in my room and listen. I've been going through the White Stripes' catalogue recently. I think their self titled album and White Blood Cells are my favorite to lift to.    If you like Hash Pipe, give their album Pinkerton a listen. It's my favorite Weezer album. I also keep going back to a band called Battleme. They're just the right pace for me to lift to.    I also made [this playlist]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7) of movie scores a while ago. It's good for when you want to feel like Batman while you lift.   9 players, 8 uniforms.   I highly recommended *All the Shah's Men*. It's perfect for someone who doesn't typically read history. It reads like a thriller, it's short enough that it doesn't get bogged down with minor details and it helps explain the way the world works today.    A hockey team will be, like the Kings were, nothing more than a toy for the Maloofs. They'll be excited at first, but then they will lose interest and neglect it. I wouldn't trust this family to own a pet, let alone a sports franchise.    A gentleman he is not.    Brother, if you ever break your arms, you better move out immediately.    Where do you usually go out? I'm almost always willing to go out, but I live in Auburn, so Sac is a little far for me to go regularly.    Yes. Part of the appeal of lifting is that it's something I can do alone that is still productive. It's not that I don't enjoy being social. It's just that it takes a lot out of me and I need to recharge. Lifting is something I can do to get my necessary alone time yet be productive, as opposed to watching Netflix.    If there's one positive from this season, it's that it looks like we have another stud linebacker.    I'm tentatively planning on being in downtown Roseville around 9:30. Probably at a place called the Opera House Saloon, but there are a few other bars in that area we can check out too.    You sound like the right guy to know. Are you over 21? We should hit some bars together.   I'm not set on a particular place. In the past I've had the most fun at the Opera House, but I'm open to going anywhere. Thinking 9:30-10ish.    My dad has fond memories of this Mac and cheese, but the recipe was never written down. I asked grandma, who now has a very poor memory, but she couldn't give me any exact measurements ("a whole gob of cheese", "a splash of milk", etc.). I did my best to recreate the recipe based on what she told me and it turned out pretty darn good.   Boil 2 cups of macaroni in salted water (grandma insisted that the water be salted)   In a baking dish, mix macaroni with approx. 1 cup of cheese. I used sharp cheddar.   Add 1/2 cup of milk  Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, stir, then bake for 10 more minutes.   I want those black Adidas Soccer pants, but they're so expensive. Is there an off brand alternative?   Dibs on Scat Shadow for a band name.   I made a friend from Espoo while at school in San Diego, CA!    If my math is correct, it's about 1300 calories. 150 calories per 4 oz of chicken plus I put it on roles that are 130 calories each. I got 3 sandwiches from this batch of 1.6 pounds. I don't know about protein.    I've seen other recipes that include butter or even cream cheese. That would add some calories if you're desperate.   	108
 Why the hair?   What's your best memory of filming UHF?   Exactly my thoughts. I was so confused why people were so obsessed with it. It felt like an overly long YouTube action short.   * Dredd sucks. * 22 Jump Street sucks. * The Dark Knight is the most overrated movie of all time, but it doesn't suck.   Desh. All the people that are sent to kill him are the CIA's "assets".   Don't let the people fool you: Brothers sucks. I'm too lazy to explain why here but it does. The Hurt Locker does a brief but good job of shoving the *life after war* thing in your face; regardless, its still a great watch.   [The Messenger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790712/), with Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson, is great. Check it out.   MMW: No they won't.   The Guard is great. I'm getting ready to see Calvary now.   In Bruges or the entire Cornetto Trilogy   Asylum and then City. Unless you finish up quick and can't wait for Knight, I say don't play Origins. It adds literally nothing. The story isn't half as good as the previous two, and gameplay is not nearly as fluid and is full of infuriating glitches and bugs that devs refused to fix.  People will disagree but honestly it was a really upsetting release for me, seeing as I 100% the first two (which I've never *wanted* to do in a game before). I didn't have 1/50th of the fun playing Origins that I had during Asylum and City.   [Ooh La La - The Faces - From Rushmore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--HaFAtC17U)   Neat.   It's pretty great entertainment. It's just a guy with a camera following a different cop/set of cops per episode, hence the title. Its been on for like 30 seasons.   That was surprisingly good directing. That oner in the hallway that ended with Blue Eyes silhouette behind Malcolm was great.    I have checked out their other stuff. He is awkward. That's not my problem. A main component of his job is to not be awkward. Get over *your*self.   Theres still time! Reboot with Donald Glover!   Damn hipsters.   Good one. I forgot about him.   Not my favorite, but definitely the best of recent: Koba from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.   The "human work" scene with his scars shows the emotion behind his hatred for humans, and the scene where he [SPOILERS](#s "goes from goofy monkey to killer ape at the weapons cache and throws Ash off the balcony") are two of the most intimidating and villainous actions I've seen in a while.   Watching House I always surprise myself remembering Hugh Laurie is British. Who else has a flawless accent?    http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102  That's the first Google result for "David Fincher Alien 3 Problems". I didn't bother reading it but I'm guessing it covers it. Basically Fincher had little to no control over the film and was constantly arguing back and forth with the studio. He has publicly criticized the final result in the past.   You've named most of them. Fincher hasn't ever made a bad film (not counting Alien^3) and so far Denis Villeneuve is 3/3, all of which are excellent.   Fassbender and Phoenix.   Titus Welliver has never not played a cop.   DJ Qualls gets typecast as the guy whose name end with "-y" or "-ie".  Seth Rogen is typecast as Seth Rogen.   I love the movie and the documentary. I was wondering why people were downvoting you.   Original. Then Redux.   DOES IT HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA?  edit: I didn't mean to do that in all caps but I'm happy with how it turned out   It fades with overexposure. When I found out about ASMR I listened to several videos a day. After a few months I stopped getting tingles unless I heard something new, since I jumped on the bandwagon pretty early on.  Since then I took a break for a few weeks and am now back to experiencing tingles just as powerfully as I used to.    *Spiders Are About The Mass Of Cow   In response to all of your replies in this thread: just fucking google it.   I love how into it he is.   Shut down? No. Better regulated? Yes.   I figured they were messin about.    Falling Down   I opened the video while I was doing something else and didn't notice it wasn't soccer until 3 minutes in. Fucking hilarious.   The host of this show sucks.   He may be the best villain I've seen in a movie since the Joker. Especially during that scene where he takes the gun from the weapons tester after using his goofy disguise.   I didn't see the first one. I was fine.   Dat tracking shot with Malcolm running through the building ending with Blue Eyes in the background tho   It also made me realize that Jason Clarke could make a damn good Joel.   I've seen Secretary. I'm not going to sit here and lie to myself.   Someone's mad.   The Grand Budapest Hotel museum scene was incredible. And hilarious.   equals crazy delicious.   I saw them filming this in Venice beach almost two years ago.   I don't know much about Miles Davis or this movie, but I sure as shit love Don Cheadle. I'll see it.   The one on the right looks like a young Chevy Chase.    Birdman.   There Will Be Blood...   Lecrae performed at my elementary school when I was in 5th grade. We jammed out to Jesus Muzik.   Does Prismacolor just make the best everything? I've never used anything made by them.   It's exciting that he finally confessed that sometime in the future we will be seeing the preview for the preview for the movie.   Is that Joel Edgerton in picture 5? I think that is Joel Edgerton in picture 5.   Anyway, for some reason I think this movie will end up being pretty mediocre regardless of some great performances. Calling it now.   Oh yeah.   He's done a couple of short films in the past and some other writing work but I think that's it as a director. Really talented guy though, from what I've seen.   I didn't read on as I just bought the movie yesterday and haven't watched it yet, but if you're looking for another family drama using crime as a plot device, check out Animal Kingdom by David Michod. I watched that a week or two ago and loved it.   Perfect Day fits in the OD Scene of Trainspotting, well, perfectly.   Well that's not exactly fair as the song was written for the movie.   ...why, though?   That's it! I thought it was a Bruce Willis movie. Thanks.   Recently, either the scene where the driver/boyfriend guy talks about his Red Bull sponsorship or the scene where Wahlberg drinks a Bud Light in Transformers: Age of Extinction. Product placement so blatant that it was hilarious.   Thanks a lot. This doesn't sound too bad, and I love Denis Villenevue and Jake Gyllenhaal enough to tough it out.   **Animal Kingdom** by David Michod  An incredible Australian crime-drama. Well written and directed with some great performances and an intense story. Can't wait for The Rover, Michod's next film.   I'm incredibly arachnophobic. I tried starting it a few weeks ago but immediately had to turn it off. How prevalent are spiders throughout the movie?   Walt should have a red line to Hector and/or Gus, technically.   I wouldn't say True Detective is Harrelson's pinnacle. Did you ever see Rampart?  (Sorry.)      Pretty?   Zoolander?   It does suck that all the gay Hispanics have an easier time getting into colleges.    I fucking love Chance and this drawing is amazing (especially the hair), but those pupils are freaking me out   Can someone link to me to the album instead if this picture of Adele flipping the bird?   The Rocker with Rainn Wilson?   Mary and Max, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, and Blue Valentine.    Zodiac caused the actual case to reopen.   And dat yoga.    Black twitter. It's a whole other world.  (Also I x-posted it to /r/WTF and apparently the guy next to Kanye also did the Graduation cover, and this weird shit is supposed to be a satirical statement on Japanese media. Still tho.)    Well that's pretty cool. I love the Graduation artwork. Still, without context, ....what the fuck?         http://imgur.com/9mcHFLr  Here is Kanye West with the cum spiral statue.   Fuckin' white phosphorous, man.  	82
 This would be my daily driver, I'd still want to do a bunch of mods to push the HP over 300 for sure. Track every once in a while for fun perhaps but definitely not serious tracking or autox.   Yeah I feel you on this, I do love that god awful wing on the STi though so I would be sad not having one lol   STi is more expensive, although the WRX isn't an STi I think things like leather and push to start would be cool to have. Not to mention with the money saved I could still go crazy with all the cobb parts I want lol. Thanks for the input   Where can you find cool car themed rearview items like that? I've always been looking! Lol   I've been deciding on colours also, heavily leaning towards DGM. Looks amazing in person and is the best colour for always looking clean :)   Why can't desperate and single girls like this call my phone?    Congrats, inspirational transformation!   You gotta be kitten me! This is so damn cute :D   ohh alright, Infiniti is nice but for the price I'd much rather drive a BMW   I always thought that was RWD but I could be wrong.  	10
  Anyone remember when some people thought you were a robot in the first game because you couldn't move? Yeah that made total sense. Also back then I thought Chica was a duck because of the "beak"^totallylookslikeabill Then I noticed the feet and changed to chicken side (also the name of course)   Nah, we all know the biter was phantom fan because thE BITE NEVER HAPPENED, SCOTT CAWTHON DOESN'T EXIST, ITS ALL IN YOUR MIND, IN FNAF 1 YOU'RE A ROBOT, FOXY IS A GOOD GUY     ayy lmao   Well it's hard to believe they did that on the day they found the suit   Hi all!   the joke was just there waiting to be made.  	6
 Which country are you?   Jack Black's Lawyer   Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Seems to be working better now :)   relevant username   Anyone know why when I drag an army to a city, it opens the city screen rather than move my troops? I have to drag them like 3-4 times before it works   Context is everything   You don't really believe that do you?   dude, uncool   Fixed. Sorry, not a native speaker.   It's a joke, you twat.   I always thought the "you shall have no other gods before me" was borderline crazy girlfriend territory where she doesn't want you having any other female friends. Like, why can't I worship the christian God, have a bit of Allah on the side to cover my bases and then throw in a dash of Vishnu or some pagan deities just for the bant.   Well maybe you shouldn't be living here   Fuck me?! FUCK YOU!   What's wrong with chipped nail polish?    He's really nervous around girls when he's sober   I'm deaf in one ear so no thank you   Thank you so much!   Too long for you?  Edit: nobody understands good humour   The song is playing at 0:00 - 2:50.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb2X9v_oEHA    Don't!  tell me what to do   how is this clickbait    No way, dude. That recruit has had enough of that shit at school, he doesn't need it at the army. Fuck up, Drill Sergeant.  DOWNVOTING MEEEEEEEEEE??   Fucking hell   Well the caller said he can't die so maybe she thought he was immortal or some shit and didn't worry too much about being quick?   Haha, I clicked a random point in the video you linked and instantly hear Rythian whining about something   He didn't   :/   Work hard, play hard   You sound like an anime character. Stop fooling yourself.    That's original.  Thank you!   Gasoline evaporates extremely quickly, which quickly creates a volatile mix. It doesn't help that it's heavier than most atmosphere, so it tends to collect in pools instead of dissipating quickly.  Same!   I know plenty, and know how to practically apply it, and I apply that knowledge in my every day life.  Are you a firefighter?   You're the type of person that gets people killed, by not being prepared to handle situations as they come. Many situations won't be about your choice or what you did.  Yeah, so not my problem.    Say a car is on fire, and you need to decide how you're going to save a person out of it, will you be prepared to act?  Again, not my problem.   I have no faith in you except sheer blind luck.  wtf wie ben jij man ? wtf don't even know you stfu   Famous last words   white people   Well, my philosophy is growing innit. That's what debate is for.  And I'd consider news organisations integral to society, so BAM you get a car.   Cameraman for what sort of organisation? And yes, I'd say the majority of people need cars currently... but a lot are just lazy, you don't need to drive EVERYWHERE.   I am not a troll. I just don't censor my opinions. Think of it more as an experiment. How many redditors do you think trim down their comments to ensure they get positive karma? I'd say the majority.   I'd allow public transport in my world vision, but not that scabby gross public transport we have today. And I'd have security stationed on each bus or train or likes to deal with rabble rousers.  I'd allow access to cars for emergency service members, and government officials. And people with disabilities, such as wheelchair users (or I'd invent some wheelchair highway they can speed down). Everyone else must walk or cycle, or use the premium public transport.   yes it does dude   Anal jokes are banal jokes.   Ya got legs, use 'em   wtf bro?   woo more minecraft /s  Edit: i take it back, this was actually a great video   Car drivers are always so angry - you're destroying the environment, you don't get a right to be so mad.   Funhaus   I got gilded. The people have spoken. My word is law.   Cool! Would you like to show which pieces of dialogue were your favourite by quoting them, thus contributing to the conversation?   NECKBEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD   He's not wrong...   ... but, it's a men's profession...? Did she even read the tweet?   Wait, what?   Days and months is a man made concept.   Come again?   Re-read my comments?   Lmao, yes.   That's completely different, that is a monetary value. It is physical. Time is relevant.    Waiting for a friend when they are LATE, when I don't have any sense of TIME, and when I having nothing to DO. That's what I'm saying. Psychologically it is torturous.   Situation A (waiting on friend), you'd agree that is kind of torturous?  Situation B (trapped in car), that's like Situation B EXEMPLIFIED. I'd argue they are comparable in the sense that psychologically they are both strenuous.    You ever been waiting on a friend and they don't show for AGES, and you have no watch to check, no phone to pass the time? And it feels like time is going really slowly? That's probably what this guy was feeling, so I think saying he survived 2 months is completely fine.   It's closer to 1 month, yeah, but it may as well be 2 months. The poor guy was trapped in a car, fuck sakes, give him the benefit of the doubt.   43 days is roughly 2 months, stop being a pedant.

 Is villar available?   It's a fair trade, and you clearly don't need Grilli. That being said in a 10 man you could probably do better than peralta at SS. Who's available on waivers?   I like Hutchinson the most out of those.   Apologies for the probably confusing title. I'm referring specifically to Windstream Holdings(WIN). This stock was stead around the $8-$10 range for the past 5-6 months or so. I bought 6 shares of it at $8.60. Recently they spun off part of themselves to create a new company, CSAL. For every 5 shares of WIN, shareholders were given 1 share of CSAL. Now my concern is when I look at the WIN historical data it essentially has what the actual price per share was multiplied by 5. Is this normal practice? It seems like a completely dishonest display of historical data. The day I purchased by $8.60 shares it has the price listed at ~$49.  I'm new to this so again, apologies for the lack of terminology that probably led to a poor explanation.   Def solid, I just think he's been kinda overhyped this preseason.   New to investing, don't have a lot of money to play around with. Unable to purchase penny stocks using my online broker. That being said, a lot of this sub preaches avoiding them, interested in reasons why I shouldn't get involved.  The community in this sub is outstanding. I learn so much just by reading through comment threads- rock on.   It's a bad trade, but if you veto it you're a giant pussy.   3/10   Stop whining and deal with it, there's good arguments for both sides. Why should he be penalized for winning? Managing injuries is part of the game. And honestly if you're in a league where people are dropping Ryan Braun you have much bigger problems than the waiver format.   Definitely Duffy   Might want to set him up with a social worker afterwards, rape can be pretty traumatizing.   I like it   Yeah go for it, he could throw a gem tonight and is pretty much a lock for getting you a bunch of Ks   Awesome stuff, would love to read this on the reg.   It's a steal for you. Richards is an easily replaceable pitcher and Wong could finish top 5 at his position this year.   Oh hell yeah. That's a big win for you. He agreed to that?   I'd start him, good chance alcides dosnt play today.   SS and 3B is weak. After Sale your SP is pretty bad. Aside from those categories I think your team looks awesome. Pretty lame about the no trades, you have a lot of depth at  2B that you could probably leverage to improve elsewhere. 6/10   Not sure who you could get for him...def worth trading if you can get a steal.   The situation hasn't changed. If you're in a daily league he's totally worth rostering. As the season progresses and guys in this dodgers lineup start getting more injured and need more rest he'll get more at bats and become more valuable in weekly leagues. Just be patient. It's a unique situation he's in, unless your bench is filled with studs I'd say it's worth it.   Many thanks   Anyone watching know why Hughes was pulled?   No that's horrible. Alcantara is the definition of replaceable your basically giving a top pitching talent to move up 2 draft spots.   Billy butler   Thanks so much for your comprehensive response, some great ideas here. Think I will start checking out some movies that do this to help with the brainstorming, and will definitely experiment sandwiching the still shots in between motion.   Thanks for your reply! Any chance you could elaborate on this? Honestly not sure what any of it means.   I'm employing this strategy and am 2nd in Ks in my league. Have a few SPs that a rotate in that supplement this stat though.      Currently doing it and am 3-0. Keep in mind when one of your RPs blows it, which will happen, it's going to hurt you quite a bit. Good to anchor the staff down with a few reliable SPs. Even though you'll be punting wins you'll be winning saves every week.   Awesome! Thank you for this.   I'm a complete noob. Apologies if this is the wrong sub to post this or if I didn't articulate it well enough. Been filming around a city using a tripod, aside from fast moving clouds, a passing bird, or flags waving in the wind I'm at a loss for ideas. (Not interested in time-lapse for this in particular).  Thanks!   Good man   Fuck yeah   Even better. Honestly those guys are marginally very replaceable whereas Salvador could very likely finish the season as a top 5 catcher.   Dude take that, easily worth it      If it's espn I'd put guerrero in the slot   Who's available on ww?   I wouldn't have him on my team in a 10 man league   Definitely a tough call on this one. I'd probably stick with cueto and walker.   Avoid Young. He'll get you some home runs but he's going to platoon for the yanks. When not hitting at home his splits will be even worse. Keep in mind as the season goes on this aging yankees lineup is going to start getting tired and injured and he'll get even less protection. We're talking about a career .230 hitter it is literally a guarantee that he fades.  -yanks fan   Awesome write up!   I'd easily drop Trumbo for him.   Ahh my b   In espn/yahoo he has it from last year   Yeah I'd say Russell is probably the best bet out of the bunch. I'm not as high as other people are on him. Might be worth seeing the solid ss/2b that are struggling and try to buy low on one in a trade. If you're in an espn/yahoo league, Alex Guerrero has 2B eligibility and I think he's worth starting despite his limited at bats(the moment someone get injured in that lineup, and someone will, they'll work him into it every day)     Who else is available?   Any time you start a pitcher at Coors field you're taking on a big risk. His guy isn't an ace, someone I would keep on the bench tonight.   Take the risk and start him. Yanks just held them to 1 run they ain't that hot.   No chance would I start Heston at Colorado. Definitely start Salazar against Detroit.   Yeah this can be a very immature/frustrating community when it comes to dissenting opinions. People need to realize the philosophy in here is about constructive discussion, not just arguing. That being said, I've been checking this sub out almost every day since the season started. Would definitely recommend Fangraphs and Razzball if you don't already frequent them, content and the comments sections foster some pretty great material.   Great write up! Love country breakfast. Assuming he sustains this kind of productivity, could be worth trading away a top 1st baseman for another elite piece and put butler in the spot.    Dude it's April.    Wow, compelling mock up, I wasn't convinced until I saw this post. Well done! No idea papelbon/Perkins had that many   All fair points. Though your mistaking Mejia for Familia. Familia didn't get suspended, and mets management has committed to him for when Parnell returns.   Kinda depends who you're targeting. Familia on the mets is a WW guy, albeit by an injury. Fernando Rodney went fairly late in my drafts, along with Santiago Casilla. Ottavino in particular is a guy that terrifies me since pitching at Coors field is like being on the moon.  Def agree with you in regards to guys like kimbrel, Jansen and rosenthal that we see being taken mad early .   Good point. Personally when I'm putting closers on my team I try to maximize that opportunity. 40 saves is a big difference over 25 in the course of a season.   Holy shit who are these owners you're playing with? Easily pick up Gio and iwakuma   Trade him, rays aren't going to be in many save situations this year   Who else is available? All of those guys are solid. I'd probably order them CarrascoKeuchelArchie, though Archie having the highest ceiling.   Buy buy buy   Gotta give us some more to go on homie. Roster, who's available, scoring system, etc   Agree that it's an optimistic projection, but he definitely has the power. In 2013 he hit 11 HR in 150 at bats, you do the math.   Honestly I think you're fine streaming any of those guys for the next 6 weeks.   	64

 Exfoliation + moisturizing my upper arms have helped.  I make solid scrub bars to use but I'm sure a good loofah would work.  Some people say dry brushing helps too.   You're crazy!  This sounds delicious :D   Beautiful, but I can't imagine having to clean the little crevices if something spills.  So much work to maintain.. lol    I like #1 the best :D   Talisman!  The longest session we've ever played was 8 hours straight.  Damn you hag!!   I love playing this on my iPhone and iPad!  Most expensive app I've ever purchased ($10) but so worth it :D   Just watched Oculus.  Gotta take out the mirrors out of our house.     Sixth Sense and the first Insidious were both really scary to me, but Thailand's Shutter was freakkyyyy.  Actually Hong Kong's The Eye 2 was frightening.  That hospital elevator scene still haunts me.    Love it! Now you're like an anime character :D   Hi it's Jen  The streets of the French Quarter at night http://www.test_subject6067.com/2014/04/07/the-streets-of-the-french-quarter-at-night/  This is my personal travel photo blog with a few recipes and pictures of my other hobbies sprinkled in.  Would love to get an idea of what you guys think about my photos and description of our New Orleans trip :D  Thank you!  *edited to change the blog link to a specific blog posting.    A half up pompadour style with medium barrel curls?    I honestly have never heard of that term lol.  The things I learn while reading reddit posts hahahah.   I'm just going to ask, what's a bussy?   I love your hair!  You look beautiful :D   Everything else sounded ok until the peanut butter.  Why the peanut butter?? whyyyyy?     Our whippet only grabs things when they've already hit the floor :(  lol   Lucy thinks that she's a cat!   For me it's microwaved flax seed bread, stevia, obsessed with all the true lemon products, and cauliflower rice :D   Omg this is my blog!  Glad you love the bread too.  I eat it all the time and it makes me feel like I'm having real bread.  Ty for checking it out :D   I've actually worked as a photographer/retoucher for many years and trust me...lots and lots of retouching goes into every photo.  Lots :/   I've never been more entertained and grossed out by a single comment.  Congratulations :D   Oh my that "soup" has such translucent quality to it... *throws up   That looks pretty good!  Great job.   I don't use any sauce.  Maybe that's the key!   I do that all of the time!  Cringeeeeee....   Freshly sliced cucumbers and watermelon.  It's even better if they're nice and cold.   I have a pretty sensitive stomach, but Taco Bell never makes me sick...    I felt like my arteries were getting clogged by looking at the photos.     omg.. lol I'm so silly.  I did have a duplicate category and tag :D  TY so much guys!   Hi guys, I have a category slug that has a -2 but there isn't another category with a duplicate name.  Can anyone tell me how to change it?  Thank you!   I really like mine.  I've had it for over a month now.  No rash so far!  I think I'm going to keep mine but I am worried about the recall window as well...   Hi guys!  I'm looking to purchase one of those tv programming boxes for my parents so they could watch more chinese shows.  I've looked at Suntv, TvPad 2 and 3, and wasn't sure which ones you guys would recommend.  I don't live with them but they do have cable internet so I figured one of these boxes would be great.  Any input would be appreciated :D     Lol!   the " woe is me look "    My dog and cat would both just die of happiness :D   Reddit is really starting to make me think that incest is really common... o_O   It seems like Howard always gets bummed out about Artie since the show was sort of blamed for his suicide attempt.  I agree that the crowd would have loved it.  I just think that Artie showing up or making a video would end up being more about Artie and overshadow the other stuff that ended up happening.     He hasn't been back on the show since the suicide attempt, so I think a more serious setting would have been more appropriate.  I'm sure he sent his birthday wishes to Howard privately.   I'm glad that he wasn't at the show.  IMO it would have made the vibe of the event slightly uncomfortable.   Thank you for the link to your review.  I will check it out :D    I have a tanita scale too that I really liked.  But it recently died... :(  	41
 This going to be lost in all the responses but you asked if anyone had met someone they saved and I have. I worked an overnight shift and got a call from an older woman who had already taken a bunch of pills but didn't want to be alone when she died through out our call I could tell she was starting to fade but I was able to piece together enough information to find out where she was EMS was able to get there in time and save her. 6 months went by and I got a call from the same woman ( it is by coincidence that she connected with me and not another volunteer) she didn't know it was me either . she told me her story and said that the person she talked to saved her life and she had gone to therapy and was doing much better. It made my year and it made all the rough nights worth it.    I have a 90 minutes but you could do it as a wrap up the day after you explain the great depression . I only give them 20 minutes to build and you could have them write the letter for homework   Love the x o simulation can't wait to try this   Since you are about to do the great depression one of the things I do is collect tons of cardboard boxes break the class into "families" and have them build hoses in a hooverville . they also have to wait in the bread line for a fun sized m ms to split with their family. They also apply for jobs to try and get out of hooverville . after we clean up I have them write letters to hoover  about what they think he could do to better their situation . The kids love the simulation and it gives them insight into the frustration of the depression.   When he is yawning I stick my finger in his mouth it ruins the yawn . he gets so agitated he has now started covering his mouth with one hand and has the other ready to swat just in case   I am a teacher so I have summers off to travel ,but before that I worked as a bartender would save up during the busy season and take time off in the slow season.    My boyfriend isn't vegan but he supports my choice. He eats vegan meals I make and even cooks some of his own. He has started eating less meat since we have been together. He pretty much saves it for holidays or nice restaurants. I appreciate the changes he has made and I have never pushed him to do any of it. Vegans get a bad rap for being pushy and judgmental. I often find the best way to get someone to try going vegan is to lead by example. With all that being said it sounds like your husband has a strong aversion to you being vegan, have you two discussed this? Why does it bother him if you were  vegetation before?   Yeah he was not from the south. Its been a few years but I think he was from the UK.    geechee is a creole language it is also called Gullah it is spoken by some of  the  African-American population living on the Sea Islands and in the coastal region of the US states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and northeast Florida.   Ok so this didn't happen to me but a girl I worked with who happened to be African American , we were working at a restaurant in the historical part of charleston SC. this guy had been on a tour earlier in the day and had heard that many people of african decent still speak geechee. He demanded that his waiter speak to him in geechee she informed him that she didn't speak geechee. He told her "you don't have to be embarrassed I won't think less of you, you're black so I know you speak it". He was asked to leave, but couldn't see what the big deal was "I was just asking her to speak the way she does with her friends and family".      This had me cracking up I had never heard of willam belli before.   I was raised by my dad and learned to do make up almost exclusively through youtube , I was wondering if MUA wanted to share their favorite tutorials.   I would advice you to wait until you are in love  for the first time . if you are already dating and you like him what's a few more months to see if you fall in love. Having sex can bring up a lot emotions weather it is your first time or your hundredth . my first boyfriend in high school tried to get me to have sex when we weren't in love but I wanted to wait he  ended up cheating on me with someone who would have sex with him a month later. I was so happy I didn't have sex with him. The next guy I dated I did fall in love with and we had sex and I never regretted it. Just some food for thought as others have said take precautions if you decide to sleep with him.   Yeah that was part of it but remember she kept trying to get him to define his sexuality. I think she was on the fence and the spin the bottle game put her over the edge.   There was an episode of sex in the city where Carrie had a bi boyfriend he was portrayed realistically and in a positive way. But Carrie couldn't handle dating a bisexual and left him at a party with no explanation ( wtf )    I am a teacher and personally I would find it odd to date a former student mostly because they are so immature. But my mom was a former student at the high school my dad taught at. He never taught her but he knew her as a student they were 5 years a part and started dating a year after she graduated. Granted this was in the 70s but they got married and had 2 kids so it depends on the situation and the people.   My old roommate and I went through student teaching together I was placed at a rough inner city school he was placed at one of the best schools in the state. He had mostly honors classes I had all college prep. When we talked about our days and our lessons he seemed to be doing so much better than I was . he was having discussions about readings he had assigned and having the kids do projects and papers with little assistance from him. I was working my ass off to teach vocabulary and basic ideas. My kids were less motivated they had less support at home they had less resources. I loved my students though they did learn just not at the pace of my roommates students. When we finished I got a job at another tough school and he got a job and a suburban school were he had less honors classes he called me a lot asking for tips and pointers. Having kids who are unmotivated and disrespectful is challenging. Here are the things that work for me . 1 break everything down into 15 min chunks . teach a concept for 15 min then have them practice with it for 15 min then on to a new concept. 2 I find it is helpful to have one activity per class done as partners because it give the kids a structured break they have to finish an assignment but they can also talk. Remember that some kids lack the mental endurance to stay focused for long periods of time. 3 get to know them as people not just students. What do they do outside of school? where do they live ?who are their friends ? Tell them about you too. I tell my kids little stories from my life like how I didn't sleep the night before because my neighbors had a party. Or  that my grandma is sick and it makes me sad. I let them see me as human and because I opened up about little things they started opening up about big things. 4 get involved in extra curricular activities I coach basketball sponsor a club and facilitate an academy it gives me time with them outside the class room which is where building a strong relationship is so much easier. It will get easier just don't give up you will find what works with your kids it may just be different than what worked before.     We met at a bar and I thought he was nice and funny so I gave him my number. We had a good first date the conversation was good but I wasn't blown away or anything. Our second date I met up with him and some of his friends he was buzzed when I got there and proceeded to get real drunk. He was all over me telling me how hot I was and how cool I was and we hadn't even kissed yet and it really weirded me out. I went home and told my roommate (  a guy) that I was done with him. For some reason he talked me into going on another date with this guy and I did because he made a valid argument that everyone has slipped up and done something silly while drunk. A couple dates later he was so nice funny and smart I realized that our second date was a fluke and he was a good guy. On our 4th date he got an eyelash off my cheek and told me to make a wish then when I went to blow it off his fingers he kissed me and I was surprised at what a good kisser he was . we have been together for over a year and he makes me happy every day.    Thanks I will search it out on google   I live in a very rural area and don't have much access to vegan convenience food. My grocery store carries tofu and almond milk and that's about it. I would love to make my own vegan yoghurt, and was wondering if anyone had one that they liked that wasn't too complicated.   Where is this I teach us history and would love to take my students on a field trip here   I work at a title 1 school we hired a first year teacher this year and she is not working out for various reasons. administration is trying to get her to resign so they can hire someone from the December job fair. She is not resigning because leaving mid year looks worse than not being renewed. However talk to your admin and see if they would work with you , our administration was willing to let her resign for "health reasons". She still said no but depending on your administration they might be willing to work out a similar deal with you.   You are very attractive . you are exotic but you also have a guy next store quality.    Sometimes teaching is like planting bamboo, you plant the seed you do every thing right you water you fertilizes and you wait and nothing happens... for years. and then one day all that careing and nurturing pays off and the bamboo springs out of the ground and starts growing a foot a day. Keep at it you are having more impact than a test can measure.   Try the national suicide prevention website , or calling 211 if you are in the US they can provide referrals for all sorts of things.   Perhaps I can help with this I used to work at a suicide hotline and I now work as a high school teacher. Honestly the best thing you can do after a suicide for your students in acknowledge that it happened and that you are open to talking about it or letting kids go to guidance if they need to.  Be honest about your feelings but be careful not to glorify suicide. I talk to my students about seeking help for mental illness and let them know I won't judge them if they are having issues. I keep cards with various crisis hotlines on them at the back of my classroom and encourage students to take them. I have had a few students in the past who have reached out to me when they were in crisis and I was thankful that they felt safe enough to do that. I then made sure that they were linked up with resources like counseling or social services. Best of luck so sorry for your loss.   Omg  a I hate the hand on the head push down, it is an automatic time out and discussion about sexual boundaries. ..  Unless we are role playing then its hot.    My SO have anal sex every couple months, and here are the things that helped me: 1) you need lots lf foreplay, you need to be really horney in order for it to be enjoyable, 2) if your SO takes a while to cum make sure that he is like 80% there before he penetrates you in the beginning you probably wont want to go for more than a couple minutes, 3) let him finger your bum while you have regular sex, it takes some of the stigma away and helps you to relax. If that is enjoyable then continue on to penetration 4) Use lube and go slow once he gets in just have him stay there for a bit with out trying to pull it back right away. Have him play with your clit or nipples (perhaps bring your vibrator) to keep you aroused because it can be uncomfortable , then when you feel like your mussles have relaxed let him know it is ok for him to make small movement and then go from there. Communication is key and don't be afraid to say I want to stop now or I don't think I like this. You should never do something sexually purely for the other person. Anal isn't for everyone I enjoy it from time to time but it took some practice. Hope this is helpful.   Stuggled with ED for years , weed and therapy got me through the worst of it . If you ever need a friend my inbox is open. Keep working at it, it gets easier and when you are strong enough throw away your scale.   Bartend, I can see where they were coming from and I am sure they had other qualified candidates, but it always hurts to hear you aren't getting a job because you are trying to better yourself.   This is from the other side I was applying for a bartender postion had great references and years of experience interveiw was going great until they found out I was getting my master's degree. Said they wanted someone long term apparently the 2 years it takes to get your degree wasn't long enough.   My SO just got into pa school, I want to get him something fantastic, so what is something you love as a PA.   Haven't tried overlays , but I find highlighting and bolding words helps.me when looking at typeface for some reason.   When I was learning to read I basically just sight read everything. I knew what the word looked like to me and that works about 90%of the time , new words are were I get tripped up. Once someone points out what the word is then I can see it (ive heard this happens with people who are color blind too) the type face doesn't eliminate all the elements of dyslexia but it helps bring the word into focus, for me. I wish the best for your daughter let me know if I can answer any questions for you.  	35
 Eastern standard time    Freaking out for you bro. Idk why, but this has me very hot and sweaty   Yeah, crazy isn't it?   So my girlfriend and I just had sex and the condom broke during it and I came inside of her. She is on birth control and has been for 3 weeks (3rd week just started) and was previously on a different birth control pill for 2 months. We both lost our virginity to each other about a month ago and have already got plan B twice. Should we be worried about her getting pregnant? We are both 21 and in college and do not want a kid or kids at the moment. Thanks for any input. I'm not too worried about it, but she seems a bit shooken up.   I know this is a joke, but in my experience a movie is the perfect first date. If the two of you become the couple everyone hates in the theatre because you're talking the whole time, it's a solid sign you guys will work out.    Alec Baldwin in 30 Rock.   Damn it that almost made me start crying in the library at my school. I had to stop watching with like a minute left.       I used to feel this way about it, but I've really started to come around to it and admire looking up at it.    Whatever is Spanish for Remember Your Mother   It's getting chilly and my stomach wants some pizza. It could warm me up. Thanks.   :(   Manchester United because they were the first soccer team I ever heard of. Borussia Dortmund because Reus is my favorite player.  Bordeaux because I like using them in fifa career mode.  Roma for same reason as above. Real Madrid because I like what they're doing over there.    The last two episodes (I count the last "two" as one) always get me to tear up. Does anyone else suffer from this? It seems a bit ridiculous to cry from a show like this, but it always happens.    The only thing you can do is give up. Sounds shitty, but it's all you have left. Don't keep texting her. Cut her off. Maybe she will text you after you don't text her a few days in a row. Happened to me last year with a girl. Things were going great, then the convos got drier. Just stopped texting her.    Ain't no party like a Liz lemon party because a Liz lemon party is MANDATORY   Yeah, the 30 rock version is actually my favorite song ever right now. I love when Liz says "I've got to go, I've got to go"    Yes that's on it too   Sadly no :( one of the misses on the album   No :( sadly it doesn't have everything    Yes! That is so awesome. I'm so happy you have kidney now. I thought it was insane that the official soundtrack didn't have it. Also Liz's 99 Luftballons cover... just fantastic. Thank you!   There are 31 total tracks. It has muffin top, Tracy's short version of I will always love you, werewolf bar mitzvah, tennis night in America, Jenna's America song, midnight train to Georgia, the long play of the 30 rock theme, jenna and Danny's Christmas song, the other Christmas song where Colleen and Jack finish it. There are a bunch of smaller jingles in it too.    Until recently it never dawned on me that I might be able to buy the songs and background music of 30 Rock. I looked up 30 Rock on iTunes and there it was under albums. $12.99 and totally worth it.   Did anyone else know about this? I'll warn you all though: you may smile like an idiot when listening to the soundtrack in public.    Yes! Honestly this scene makes me so happy and almost emotional whenever I see it. It really shows how everyone in the show really is connected and loves each other in some way.    The 76ers are getting there   Nice   I feel as if this only applies to western society, but regardless I can only speak for western society. They're finding that interior happiness is being replaced by exterior happiness. People have a want for immediate pleasure now such as a high from a drug instead of prolonged pleasure such as success from something you worked hard on. People would rather buy the new shoe, new phone or car than they would buy themselves a gardening kit, a guitar or telescope. More things are available to us in this day and age, but unfortunately those things are changing what makes us happy. We need immediate happiness and closure to feel good about ourselves which of course only lasts for a little bit until something new comes out.    There are a lot of non mentally challenged people who obsess over one thing in particular as well. I don't think it's only mentally challenged people.    There's an app for that. The crossword puzzle anyways.    The time I pooped and didn't flush the toilet. My dad asked me what I would do if I saw that he didn't flush and I said I would just flush it. He then said fuck you as loud as he could to me.    I felt my stomach turn as I read that.    It's working for me! Thank you!    Does anyone have a stream where I could watch this online?   4-5. Tonight can lead to a 3 way tie for second in my division or tie me in third. Good news in both scenarios I control my destiny. I'll just need to win out. I'm on a 4 game win streak and I've had luck. Maybe my luck will continue.    I had a hangover like this once, it actually made me not be able to drink beer for a little less than a year. My body just wouldn't let me drink it. I think it's like taste aversion or something.    So after struggling for 3 months because I missed a good amount of work I'm finally caught up on my bills. I would have some money left, but in all of my excitement I got some Christmas gifts for my nephews and I've got just enough to keep myself going until I get paid again. I'm super happy, but also hungry. I would love a celebratory pizza. All I've had to eat the past 2 weeks is pasta and sauce (it's so cheap) and while I still love it, I love pizza more. I live about 10 minutes from a dominos if anyone would like to buy me a pizza. Thank you.    I think you have this, bro.   I am up 21. I have Cody Parkey. My opponent has McCoy, Maclin and the Eagles D/ST. I'm projected to win by two. I'm worried. A win here will knock my opponent out of a two way tie in second to a potential 3 way tie for second. Likely scenario is he's knocked into a 2 way for third with me. Best case is Darren Sproles and Kelvin Benjamin combine for at least 29 and I keep onto my lead. That will cause the 3 way tie in second.    I have Big Ben brown and Bryant and my god that touchdown might have saved my game   Stafford has megatron back. Simple enough. Also Mark Sanchez is still him.   Wilson. Giants secondary is weak and they like to blitz. Wilson is very good against the blitz if I remember correctly.    I'm a believer in Orton, I think he's a much better QB than he is given credit for. I think he will play a good game.   Clear your mind and go with Stafford. All you need to know is that Megatron is back!   McCown is going against the weaker defense and is a better QB.    Go with Cam. I do not like Philly's defense and Cam I think has more potential for high scoring than Joe.  	45
 Why? How?      	2
 I *literally* just bought this for $25, I'm so jealous.    Oh geeze, Inside is so brutal and visceral!   Boy Meets World, all 7 seasons.   I think it works for some, like the Hulk, due to the comic book look of them, but I think it just doesn't make sense for some others like Bourne and Jurassic Park. The comic book look just doesn't fit the style of some of these.    "You're going to go from being a **can**cer...to a **can't**cer!"   Shame is easily one of my all time favorites. It's such a fantastic and emotional film. It gets some hate from people who call it pretentious, but I don't get that. Shame tells a different story we don't ever see. It was so raw and showed just how damaging sex addiction can be to ones life. It was the film that made me fall in love with Michael Fassbender. I'll see anything with him now. And Steve McQueen is now 3 for 3.   Yeah I personally prefer it to Mud   I finished my final paper. It has a title page, an outline and then the paper complete with works cited. My question is a simple question, what order should everything be stapled in? Google doesn't help     "But quick, cause the more successful I get, ^the ^smaller ^my ^range ^becomes!"   I'm not a fan of horror movies at all. Mostly because nowadays they're so overly cliche and predictable and full of cheap scares. But I've found a few exceptions. I found 3/4 of The Conjuring great with the last quarter turning into a cliche fest. I also find The Strangers really good even though most people think its bad. Them is probably one of the best horrors I've seen along with the Descent.       I also am a huge Parks and Recs fan so I'm really excited to see great things happening for Chris Pratt.   I actually am a huge fan of Dexter and it gets quite a bit right for the most part. But just like any show or movie, it does get some wrong. I always enjoyed the scenes where Dexter was in his white room where he tested possible murder weapons on dummies.  The biggest offenders are usually action movies where lots of people get shot. That's where I find the most inaccuracies.    I've taken forensics classes at school so now whenever a movie has blood and gore, or lack of it, I automatically start judging the realism of it. I start saying things like "That's too much blood" or "The blood pattern is way off" It doesn't ruin a movie for me, but it's definitely something I notice now.    Have you ever met someone named Muhammad?  Edit:*Whoosh*    At first I thought she got whiplash and her head snapped back and hit the ground, so I thought brain trauma, but everyone here is saying snapped neck, not head crack.   Well, I mean, granted, if the webbing didn't kill her, the fall DEFINITELY would have, so I guess it doesn't matter. But I think the webbing did play a part in at least *how* she died.   I'm looking for movies that take place on a cruise ship. Are there any besides Speed 2: Cruise Control?   I love movies about vacations for some reason. What are some movies about someone or a group of people going on a vacation? Excluding the National Lampoon movies      Saw 30 Seconds to Mars and when Jared Leto came out he said he was really sick. Something to do with his throat. We could tell because he was extremely hoarse while talking, but he said the show must go on. So he ended up barely singing and when he did it sounded really off. I was kind of upset because I think he's a really good singer, but he sounded mediocre that night. However, I do commend him for performing while sick.   I think he has the capacity to be a really good actor. The dude *can* act, but he keeps picking bad roles and doesn't make the best choices in life. He was awesome in A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints. I think Shia should retire from acting for like five years. Pull a Joaquin Phoenix and just like disappear from movies and the public life, then out of nowhere, come back with a movie by a great director with a great script.   Guess it's not available for pre-order yet :(      Despite lyrics, which NIN song is your favorite based purely on the music? (Beats, rhythm, sounds, etc.)  I really love the music in The Way Out is Through and Underneath It All.    I'm a big fan of "Without you, without you everything falls apart. Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces."   If this is true that's pretty incredible   Yes these movies get thrown around a lot in this sub, but for good reason. They're great, and they *do* get an interesting reaction from people who haven't seen them before. Just because they get said a lot doesn't make them any less good. It just makes them popular, and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think the Tree of Life is pretty widely hated.   Also, all the movies I listed I own. I wasn't picking what reddit likes. I simply walked over to my dvd shelf when I saw this question and picked all the movies I own that have generated an interesting reaction from my friends and family.       I wound up seeing Under the Skin even though everyone told me to see Grand Budapest Hotel. I really really liked, maybe even loved Under the Skin. I found it to be so strange yet completely engrossing. I couldn't look away and the music was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The main reason I saw Under the Skin was because this weekend was the last weekend any theater in my town was playing it and Grand Budapest was going to stick around longer. I still plan on seeing it, but I'm glad I saw Under the Skin before it went away.    What jobs or careers would give me the opportunity to work at or travel to interesting places?   My mother, sister, cousin, and three friends. Mostly because they just don't watch a lot of movies.   Children of Men, Crank, Se7en, The Raid, Reservoir Dogs, The Chaser, No Country for Old Men, Napoleon Dynamite, Memento, Moon, The Matrix, Enter the Void, The Tree of Life, Inception and Fight Club.   These are all movies that I love showing people for the first time because they generate very interesting reactions and discussions.    Yeah I totally get that. It's not the best movie, but I think in terms of sci-fi, it's pretty original and executes its concept well without being overly complicated. But I do totally see how someone wouldn't like it. As a sci-fi I think it's good, but as a movie it's not the best.    I think it went wide release last week. And was limited the week before. Unless it went even wider release this week.   I really loved this movie. Very original and well done.   There's this crime one called [Lion and Deer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOl7S5VFYus). Takes place almost entirely in one room.   So at work tonight, after we closed, I locked the door then went to do closing duties like I'm supposed to. I then hear the door chimes jiggle quite furiously. I walk to the front and see a woman and two kids. Turns out that the deadbolt was locked but the pegs at the top and bottom weren't so the door kind of pulled open. It was after we closed so I simply told them with a smile that we were closed. She smiled and said, "Oh, sorry." Then left.   So my manager came out and asked me what happened saying that someone from the offices was mad at me for "kicking" someone out. I told my manager that I simply told her we were closed. I didn't ask her to leave or anything. She left on her own. My manager told me that even so, we can't kick them out. I know you can't kick a customer out if they came in before you closed, but I figured it was different if they came in after the store was closed.   I then come home and tell my mother what happened and she asked me if they were going to talk to me at work. I told her if they did I wasn't worried because I didn't know any better. We were closed and the registers were in the back. I then jokingly told my mother that the lady technically broke in since we were closed. My mom proceeded to take it way too seriously and started going on about how "You can't tell your managers that!" and "You don't say stuff like that. Take responsibility." We then started arguing. I was telling her that I knew that. It was just a joke. I know I can't tell my supervisors that. She was like, "Well how do I know that."   What I'm getting at is that my mom always wants me to tell her stuff but when I do she always tries too hard to read between the lines looking for some deeper meaning when there is none. Then she did something I hate. She pity apologized me. She was all like, "Sorry you're right I'm wrong." Just don't apologize at all if you don't mean it because it only makes things worse.   Then she said for me to drop it, meaning the argument. I can't! I can't leave this argument with me being the bad guy! I'm not wrong! Am I?   How would you rank it against Anderson's other films, if you could?   I'm going to a movie tomorrow by myself. These two movies are the only ones I have interest in that I haven't seen. I know they are two very different movies, but which should I see? I've heard good things about both. I really enjoy Wes Anderson films, but I also really enjoy some nice cerebral, low-key sci-fi, and I don't mind a slow paced film.  Would I have to be in a certain mood in order to enjoy Under the Skin? What are some other films like it so I can compare it to what I've seen before?   Kill List is great but so dark.    Ba ba ba, ba ba baran   Assuming that he had the same level of intelligence as me and had my memories, I'd make him do things for me because between school and work, I don't have time to do all the things I want/need to do.   I'm alright. Could be better. Could be worse. I'm kind of just...jaded. School in the morning and work in the evening everyday. Ready for summer. I'm happier than I've been in the past. I used to be depressed because I wasn't in school, unemployed, and had no love life. Now I'm two thirds there, so I'm feeling better about myself. I'm trying to get in shape so my confidence will build. I'm going to need it to start dating.  I miss my friends. They all work and have school, and are dating or engaged to someone so I'm starting to feel a little lonely.  Good things are happening though. This summer I'm starting work on my first feature film, so I'm really excited about that.  But all in all, I'm alright. A little stressed, but alright.   When it's all said and done, will I be happy with how my life turned out?   I, as the Rock, would get plastic surgery and make the Rock look like *me*, and legally change his name to *my* name so that I will always be Dwayne Johnson, even if I turn back.   Their resilience, physically, emotionally, and mentally.    Yeah, probably.   I wish girls would more often be the ones =making the first move. I hear all the time from some girls I know that no guy ever approaches them or asks them out. You don't always have to wait on the guy to make the first move.    In private I have full conversations with myself, but...I'm not talking *to* myself. I'm talking to some imaginary person. Carrying on full conversations and speaking for both sides. I also pretend I'm talking to an audience sometimes using the word "we" a lot. For example, "We are going to do this, then we will do this." And when I say "we" I'm including myself and the audience I'm talking to.   I do this often, and have done it for as long as I can remember. As far as I know It's not normal behavior.   Free Willy   Memphis  Best: People here are usually nice. Worst: This place is a hole. There's nothing interesting here.   Besides reddit? I usually binge watch a tv show on netflix. However, I often just put on my headphones, turn on a podcast, then walk around my house eating snacks.   Flirting with members of the opposite sex (or same sex).   Why do we park on the driveway, but slowly die in the living room?   Night. I'm more productive then. Mostly because it's the only time I have to do anything because I go to school and work, so my days are filled. Yeah, I can't really go anywhere at night because things start closing, but I love just laying in bed writing, browsing the internet, watching netflix, or playing games, or just walking aroung my house listening to music and podcasts.   My fondest memories and best times have been when it was just me and my three closest friends. There's no stress, no one is being ignored, it's great.   Suffering for a day. Get the hard stuff out of the way so you can enjoy life.   The ability to be invisible only when no one is looking at you.   Those metallic reflectors you put in your car windshield to keep your car from getting hot.   It'd be all the symptoms.   While I agree, it doesn't matter because the majority of people *do* use IMDB as a reference point to help them decide what's worth watching or not. So even if they get a lot wrong, they have a heavy influence.   No Country for Old Men      Wow this is fantastic work! She'll love you so much!   No the photographer doesn't have any copyright   Here's a pic of her: http://imgur.com/IQHYGho  She was wearing a white dress. And the door was a cherry wood color.  Also, here's a colored pic from the same shoot: http://imgur.com/HxJ7c2I   The photographer she hired is being super flakey. Not answering her calls, not returning her calls, and the one time she did, the photographer refused to do it because of the "artistic integrity". Help? She needs it done ASAP      What youtube channels should I be subscribed to? Big, well-known ones and small obscure ones are all welcomed!    I really love Reloaded :(   I *just* finished watching season 4 and now I really just want to watch season 5. How can I do this without torrenting?   Xbox :(   So for months I've been trying to find entertaining things to do in single player(I don't normally play multiplayer because I don't have friends). I guess it could also work in multiplayer.   Vigilante crime fighter. I mean like a real world super hero. I dress in black, wear a mask, and fight crime! Making sure I don't kill cops or innocents. This gave me hours of enjoyment! It was real fun to break up a crime or killing some gang members, then evading the police without killing them.   I guess in multiplayer this would be more fun because you could stop and fight actual players which are more interesting than NPCs.       Yeah I know all this. Money isn't the issue. It's ease of use that's the problem because, like I said, I know nothing about computers.    When I said time consuming, I meant the process of learning everything and finding the right parts. I don't have anyone to help me build a pc that I know of.  How much do high end rigs usually cost?   * What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible.   * Mostly Gaming, not multiplayer but single player on high settings, installing mods. Also maybe video editing as well.   * What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?   * $850   * When do you plan on building/buying the PC?   * Towards the end of June   * What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)   * Everything? All I have now is a laptop, so no monitor, keyboard, or mouse.   * Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?   * Tennessee, US. Closest Microcenter is like over 5 hours away.   * If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.   * None   * Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?   * Not sure. Not really planning on it.   * Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)   * None I can think of  * Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?   * None. Would be nice if there was a consistent color theme throughout, but not important. Something sleek looking like blacks, greys, and whites? LEDs would be cool, but these are luxuries, not necessary.   * Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build?   * Need Windows 7   * Extra info if required:  I don't know *anything* about computers.   Any starting points you recommend? Like you said, "It starts with just learning what everything does" and "Lots of questions, lots of googling, lots of absorbing". This is the stuff I find super intimidating and daunting as someone who knows nothing about computers.   Let's say I'm a hardcore gamer who doesn't know anything about computers. Despite whether it's worth it or not, and also as someone who doesn't have as much freetime as he'd like between school and work, how practical and realistic does building a pc seem for me?  I only ask because I don't know what to read, or when I'd have time to read. I also ask because I'd hate to buy all the parts I'd need, only to not have time to put it together.  How long was your pc building process? From finding/ordering the parts to putting it together?   Someone mentioned it in this thread and I think they made a good point. It's not the movies themselves I'm getting burned out on. It's the marketing and attention they get that I'm burned out on. Only a few superhero movies get released a year, which is still a lot more than it use to be. But there is a huge over saturation of marketing involved with them. Everyday it's another article, another picture, another clip, another trailer, another commercial, etc.  I don't think there are too many superhero films, but I *do* think there is *way* too much marketing and attention going into them. A lot more than is necessary. It's not just the marketing team either. It's also fans who post all these things as well. They're not in the wrong, but if they would just pull back on that, I think people would get less burned out. Because, again, there are only 3 of these movies a year usually, but we hear about them and see things about them almost everyday. I think *that's* the problem.    I know it's probably an obvious answer for most people, but for me it's not so obvious. I want a gaming pc, but I know nothing about computers or how they work. The task of building one seems unbelievably daunting. Even when I know what to get, putting it together and figuring it out seems beyond intimidating. Even if I did manage to put one together somehow, upgrading also seems intimidating. I don't have a lot of time for building one.  The pros of just getting a console is that it's already made. It's simple. The cons? It's less powerful and a smaller library of games.  The pros of building a pc? More powerful, more games and mods. The cons? Very time consuming and there are a lot of ways I could screw it up.  What should I do based off of what I told you about me?       The second one by a long shot. Don't get me wrong, they're both great, but the second one is just incredible. An absolute masterpiece.    Yeah I've seen it, but that's why I want the discussion thread. I want to talk about it with other people who have seen it.   I really want to discuss this film, but where's the official discussion thread? The movie is now in its wide release. We have the Nymphomaniac discussion up, but not the Raid 2?   Speaking of bumping into people renting movies, I remember when I was a kid, my mom and I went to rent movies and bumped into Steven Segal and some chick he was with. He was also apparently renting his own movies, too. I was too young to know who he was. He looked familiar because I had seen his movies, but I didn't really know who he was. My mom, on the other hand, got his autograph.   Sorry, didn't mean to sound like a jerk. The question isn't bad, it's just that it has been asked a lot. But it's not just that it has been asked to death, it's also the fact that, honestly, the last thing this sub really needs is more content geared towards super hero movies. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that 70% of things submitted here are superhero related.    This post is literally everything that is wrong with this subreddit.   I think it should be handled like James Bond. With every Bond movie with a new actor, it doesn't start with Bond's origins. It starts with Bond in the middle of some sort of mission.  I think super hero films should start doing this when they reboot. Start the next superhero reboot with the hero already a hero and in the middle of a mission. In doing this, you save yourself thirty minutes or more you'd have to spend with the origin.   Yeah I have a kit lens. I'd like to go wider though.   As for price, since I'm renting, I can be super flexible with the price. I can work it into our budget. We have like a $1500 budget but rentals really cut the cost down because we're not buying.    I have a rebel t3i and I'm about to start work on a short. What I do know is I want to use a wide angle lens. What I don't know is what to look for. I have no clue what all the numbers mean.   What are some wide angle lenses that don't produce a lot of noise and grain and have a good, clean image? Price really isn't a factor because I'd be renting the lens.   But Seth McFarlane's new western comedy seems to be very Brooks-esque.    If you think Requiem is that depressing, you should watch Martyrs. You'll probably kill yourself.  Also, I forgot to mention it, but A Moment to Remember. It's on Netflix and is about two people who fall in love, but the girl develops Alzheimer's and starts losing her memory. Man, was this an emotionally wrecking film! But I love it and it's such a great movie. You ever need a good cry, watch this.    Yeah, that's what's keeping me from watching it, but I love long movies. It's just finding the time that's the problem.  I actually have a few questions about it, if you don't mind.  Is it an epic? Like it takes place over years?  I know you said it's great, but could you tell me why?  How's the cinematography? (weird question, I know, but I'm a sucker for great cinematography.)   See, this is what I find funny. Most people say they never want to see Requiem again, but I'm the total opposite. I love this movie and have seen it numerous times. You should totally buy it because 1) It's probably cheap and 2) it's a great movie!   Curious as to why you consider Martin Scorsese the mater of dream logic cinema.   This film has been sitting in my Netflix list forever.    I feel like I dislike the Kill Bill movies every time I watch them. I really liked them a lot the first time, but every time I rewatch one, it just feels different. Like I'm enjoying it less and less each time. And I don't really know what it is about them that does this to me.  Edit: this has nothing to do with Tarantino. I love all of his movies but this only happens when I watch Kill Bill. I can watch his other movies over and over and still love them, but there's just something about the Kill Bill movies.    This gets mentioned a lot when this subject comes up, but Dear Zachary. That movie is emotionally devastating.   Another is Martyrs. This is easily one of the most depressing movies I've seen. I felt sick and ill and depressed watching it. It's seriously just a downhill slope the whole way. Never getting better, but always getting darker, more depressing, and disturbing. I own this film but never intend to watch it ever again, which is rare with me. It just...stuck with me. For days. I felt so hollow and cold after watching it.   I watched a Korean film called Marathon. Man, was this movie absolutely great.  Marathon, which is on Netflix, is the true story about a young man with Autism, raised only by his single mother, who finds solace in running. After running a bunch of 5ks, he wants to run a marathon. The whole film is his training for this marathon.   Holy crap, was this a great movie! The acting was outstanding! It's definitely a tear-jerker, but you'll be crying tears of sadness and joy. This has to be one of the sweetest, most motivating and inspirational movies I've ever seen. I felt so good afterwards. I felt like I could take on anything after watching this! I really, really love this movie. It's great. Just absolutely fantastic.  There's really not a whole lot more I can say about it other than go watch it. It's seriously worth everyone's time.   I watched this little indie film on Netflix called The Diary of Preston Plummer. The synopsis Netflix told me was basically, "Preston is a college student with no direction who meets a girl and she asks him to drive her all the way home to Florida." Now I was in a drama mood and I love road trip movies, so I was expecting a lovely, great, road trip drama where these two strangers get to know one another and fall in love.  I was kind of disappointed with what I got though. Instead of a road trip movie. I got a movie that really only took place in one location. The entire road trip was probably like, 10 seconds? This film takes place pretty much entirely in Florida. I only mention this because I believe my wrong expectations may have affected my opinion of it as a whole. Now, don't get me wrong, it was still a decent drama. Just not what I was hoping for.  What it really is, is a story about this guy, Preston, who drives this girl Kate home to Florida from somewhere in the New England area. He agrees because he's looking for adventure and doesn't really know what to do with his life. When they get to Florida, he finds out that her parents own a hotel and allow Preston to stay there for a week free of charge. During this week, Preston and Kate grow close and we learn more about the two of them. Especially Kate, whose family is hiding something about Kate's past from Preston. Preston becomes curious and starts to do some digging. But will his digging bring him and Kate closer, or push them apart?  All in all, it's a really sweet film with some good drama, acting, writing, and beautiful cinematography of Florida. But nothing particularly special or outstanding. It has like a 6 on IMDB, which seems about right. I'd probably give it a 6.5, though.   That doesn't mean anything other than I've had *this* account for a year. I've had another account and before that, I lurked.    This place is older than 3 years, though.   Like I said, that place isn't exactly the friendliest.   Eh, it was more about how once it changed, it stopped changing and never went back or moved forward, which, I know, doesn't make a lot of sense. It does sound contradictory. That wasn't the intention though.   You're totally right in every way, but the problem is, if/when I make a discussion post, I *want* discussion, but due to the whole upvote/downvote system, if people either downvote or don't vote, or just don't care, then there is *no* discussion.   Look, you're right that I *do* have to really look for the "quality" posts. That's kind of my problem. People either downvote or don't vote at all on almost any post that goes against what usually makes it to the front page. Since the content on Reddit is mostly ranked by the users, there's really no solution other than outlawing certain types of posts like it says in the mod message you linked.  True, now isn't the best time to make my criticisms right now, because the mods made that post, so the posts I'm complaining about aren't being made. But what the mods are doing now isn't a permanent solution. At least not yet anyways. In the mod post you linked, it clearly says, "So we're going to try something out for the month of April and see how you guys like it." Emphasis on "*try*". It's not permanent, but hopefully it will be.  You're right, though. I was too harsh on the mods. I'm sure it's difficult running a huge subreddit, and I do appreciate that they are trying to fix things. It was uncalled for, and I apologize to the mods.   You're right, I'm not entirely innocent. But I do feel the post I've made here that weren't successful were attempts at creating discussion topics we don't normally see. And it's not just me either. Many people have their deep, fresh, thought provoking posts either downvoted or not voted on at all. Not voting is just as harmful as downvoting. Since this website really only determines what is on the front page by upvotes, if people don't upvote new, refreshing things, we won't see them. And instead, we see super hero posts, poster posts, celebrity gossip posts, and the same generic, rehashed questions.   Well I don't really think it matters since really no one will see this post. It's been downvoted and because it's not one of the things I listed, even if it was positive, no one would upvote it because it has nothing to do with super heroes, posters, or any of the other stuff that always makes it to the front page.  So in the long run, it doesn't matter if this is what I call "dealing with it" because this post won't change a thing. For the record, I don't call this dealing with it. I call me being quiet about it for years "dealing with it". People complain about this sub all the time in the comments, but no one makes a post about it. Yeah, I went kind of harsh about it and was maybe overly sarcastic and passive-aggressive.  The way I see it, if this post was genuine and I really did love this sub and gave reasons why, I'd still get downvoted, no one would see it because, again, it's not related to super heroes or posters or whatever so it wouldn't make it to the front page, and the few people who would see it would just comment and tell me I was wrong and that it actually sucks.   Oh look at you! You're so slick!  But seriously, there rally aren't many alternatives. I love film. It's my passion. But most of the people over at truefilm are not really welcoming and are happy to tear you apart at any given moment if you sound uneducated in film.   There's casualfilm, which is a fantastic subreddit, but unfortunately there's not a lot of activity. Maybe like 3 or 4 post a week.   There really aren't a lot of alternatives. So it's either unsub and don't get any movie related stuff, or deal with it and get crappy movie related stuff. But I guess we do what we have to do?  If you know any other good movie related subs for quality content, I more than welcome you to point me in the right direction.    Seriously, I love this subreddit! When I first discovered this subreddit, it had a lot of interesting stuff and discussions. I'm glad it's not that anymore. I'm glad it's turned into what it is now! I mean, I love that everyday the front page is just super hero stuff, news and rumors for whatever big blockbuster movie coming out, celebrity gossip, or one of the same 5 questions that get asked every week!  As someone who is afraid of new things and change, it's nice to know there's always /r/movies for when you need a subreddit that doesn't change!  I'm loving that everyday I can see what new poster was released! I love all the "look at all these movies you've seen, but probably haven't" posts we've had an influx of lately!   But most of all, I'm glad that the only discussion posts making it to the front page are the same questions we see every week! That's the best part. The last thing I want is an original or thought provoking discussion on my /r/movies front page!  But, yeah, just wanted you all to know how much I love this subreddit! Whatever it is you're doing, mods, keep doing it! It's working perfectly! This is a fantastic sub because of it!   This makes me super excited for it. I'm so ready for John Woo to make a return to action movies and I can't wait to see what he does with The Expendables.   Yeah and Bad Boys 2 is a masterpiece of action. I love both of these movies.    "You guys havin a killer time?"  Also, "How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?"   Charlie's Angels. Both of them.    Yeah, make him a secret agent in a Cold War era James Bond type film.    I have a natural cowlick on the right side of my hair that makes it stick out of the side. I have yet to find an effective way of combatting it. What causes cowlicks? Is there a way to prevent it? Or fight it?  Please help!   So by flowing water do you mean waves? I know nothing about the outdoors.  Also, are there any more secluded areas where people don't generally go? Because I'm sure it will be busy this June, which is when we'd go.   Are there beaches at them? Like can I just walk up to the water? Cause I hear horseshoe lake has a lot of houses around it.    None of my family or friends know of any lakes besides the ones in Arkansas. Are those the closest ones or are there closer lakes?  Edit: Okay, new question: Which is easier to get to, Horseshoe Lake or Arkabutla Lake? Also, which is prettier?   That actually seems pretty intense   Really any place that is visually interesting or beautiful. Natural or man made.   I'm shooting a short film this summer in Memphis and I was wondering if anyone knew of some really interesting or beautiful locations. They can be either man made or nature made.    So another question: Since these are from different countries with different currencies, like amazon france, how would one pay for these?   Wow! Aren't they all pretty much region locked, though?   I hate you so much, I'm so jealous!! I really wish the US got more steel books. I wonder why we don't. Great collection by the way!      It could be worse. You could have a woman cut off your penis and throw it out the window of a moving car.    I'm trying to find someone to score a short film. I'm just not sure what subreddits to visit. Is there someone here with scoring experience or does someone know of a subreddit where I can find someone?   What would you consider good quality underwear and pants?   What do you do? Rub it on your thighs before you go to work?   I work a very active job that requires me to be mobile, but this job causes two terrible things to happen to me, sweating in my groin, which is gross, and chafing in my inner thighs from my legs rubbing together, which hurts.  Any tips on how to prevent or combat these two things?   I feel like I should be singing Christmas songs right now, I feel so jolly and generous!   I feel like its insane how people don't see a problem with changing Bond's race. He's not a racially ambiguous character. However, many times in the past when Hollywood has changed a beloved characters race, everyone was against it.   What is it about the Bond character that makes people okay with changing his race? What if they changed Superman's race or Batman's race?  I do legitimately want some discussion on this topic but I don't dare ask /r/movies because I know I won't get any discussion there.    I played ep1 but I haven't played ep2 yet. Without spoiling it, what do you mean? What's different?   Oh no I'm talking about Spring Breakers! But I did love Mud too for the record.    Man I loved this movie. It was one of my favorites of last year!    I saw Panic Room again for like the fourth time. I really love this movie. It's such a tight thriller with no fat on it. It's just under two hours and doesn't take a brake. Unlike Contracted, which takes 40 minutes for things to pick up, Panic Room takes only 15 minutes for things to pick up.   This a very solid movie. Not David Fincher's best, but it's one of my favorite Fincher movies. I'm actually shocked by how many people don't like this movie. Especially average movie goers. On IMDB it has a 6.3. Now I know IMDB isn't the judge of quality but a lot of its voters are your casual movie fans. This movie really seems like it would've been popular with a wide variety of people. It's thrilling, well directed and acted, and is shot beautifully. It's so easy to watch because the pacing is also great.   I highly recommend this to any David Fincher fans or anyone looking for a great, tight thriller.    I watched this new movie recommended to me called Contracted. It's a body horror film. I wanted to watch it because I love body horror stuff. The friend that recommended it to me said it was super knarly and disturbing. When I heard this I immediately imagined a Cronenberg-esque movie with gross special effects.   This movie was absolutely terrible. Like in just about every way. The story they tried to force in there was bland and boring. The acting was over dramatic. The writing was atrocious, and the characters were UNBELIEVABLY STUPID. I have never been so angry with characters before in my life. Nothing they said or did made any sort of sense. For example, and this isn't a spoiler, when the main character starts showing extreme physical deformities, EVERYONE asks if she's okay and she'll say,"Oh yeah I'm fine." And they all believe her. Can you not see she is seriously fucked up!!!  The only reason I wanted to see it was for some sick body horror and special effects. It didn't even deliver on those. Nothing really disturbing happens to her without spoiling it. The body horror stuff doesn't even start for 40 minutes. The first 40 minutes is literally just character set up. Which I understand because it is a movie after all, but they try to make you care for these characters by doing a terrible job forcing in love stories. I found myself not caring about anyone because they are all really dumb terrible people.   This movie is boring, very poor, and isn't worth anyone's time. It's hard to even recommend to people who like horror or body horror movies because it doesn't even do well in those departments.    This was the first band I searched for. It's gotten better about it now. Now it has two songs from Downward Spiral, but the rest are still Hesitation Marks.   Why are you even here? This is over a hundred days old.    Scarface, the original one from 1932, but I didn't willingly watch it. I had to watch it for a class. I thought it was pretty boring. Not bad, I actually thought it was pretty good. Just boring.   The oldest movie I *willingly* watched was The Good the Bad and the Ugly. I really love this movie a lot. It's what started my love of westerns, epics, and Clint Eastwood. It was also the longest movie I had seen at the time, which I thought was incredible.     It can be a true story or a work of fiction, but I really love movies that chronicle the rise and fall of characters.   Amazon most of the time. Or my local F.Y.E. I usually wait until like March to buy all the movies I want of the previous year. For example, This March of 2014, I bought every movie from 2013 that I wanted. And I'll do the same thing March 2015 for all the 2014 movies. It gives most the movies, besides November/December movies, time to drop in price so that every movie I buy isn't $25. Instead, they're more like $10-15 each, which I can feel less guilty about.   If you haven't seen it, you should most definitely see The Matrix. It's a masterpiece of action and science fiction. It had such an influence on not just sci-fi, but many other genres as well.   I think compared to most movies, The Matrix: Reloaded is actually pretty great, but compared to the first one, it's just good. The Matrix was such a masterpiece of action and sci-fi and had such a massive impact on culture that there was no way Reloaded could ever out do the first one.   But is it *good*? Like, "worth my $12" good? I am a big fan of Aronofsky, but from what I've seen of this movie, it doesn't look like an Aronofsky film. It looks like a generic action/adventure movie that could have been made by anyone. How much of an Aronofsky film is it? Because he's honestly the only reason I'd want to see it.   So my cousin is actually dating a guy who is related to your father. The funny thing is, I'm related to your mother. Small world. Fate finds a way, I guess.   That's exactly what I mean when I say he's unwilling to compromise. I was telling him just what you said and he disagreed and told me sometimes the older styles are better.   I totally get wanting to follow in the steps and try and replicate a great director, but his determination to do this makes him very cliche and "copy and paste", and gives him no identity. No custom style. And if we want our projects to get noticed and stand out, we have to *stand out* and do something different.   I probably sound like a douche talking about my friend because he *is* smart and very passionate about filmmaking.   But yeah anyways. I'm not that far from you(barely). I'm in Tennessee. Not a lot of film community here.    I like to do more darker, bleak, surreal stuff like crime stories or dramas. He's a huge Spilberg fanboy, which is fine cause he's a good director, but it's really causing us to butt heads because he wants to do more feelgood, textbook style filming, which again, is fine.   I like more modern movies and the only movies he has seen and love are pre 1990 stuff. Which in turn causes him to want to do dated and cliched stories and story beats.   It's hard to explain, but his demeanor feels very much like he "owes" the "classics" so he tries to replicate that "classic" feel which honestly doesn't really work today. It really feels like he only loves classic movies because he feels like he's obligated to because every filmmaker is only suppose to like old movies.   Anytime I bring up modern movies or modern trends and styles, he rolls his eyes and calls them inferior to the "classics".    Well I'm 7 days late but thought I'd still talk.  I'm in sort of the same situation. Filmmaker as well. However I do have at least one friend who I've been working with frequently. The problem is we are very different in our tastes and styles and he is unwilling to compromise, so we have started to hit walls when trying to come up with ideas.  I'm trying to broaden the amount of people to work with, but everyone else isn't as serious about it as I am. Everyone just wants to do it for fun, which is fine for them, but I want to make a career out of it whereas they have other careers in mind(doctor, lawyer, etc.,). So this leads to situations where I either have to work with my stubborn, uncompromising friend or work with people who goof off too much and don't care.  Too bad you and I don't live near each other(as far as I know. I'm assuming.). We seem to share the same interest.    Man, I should get Photoshop. Is it free at all? Like is there just a basic version that is free?  I frequent vgboxart.com which has tons of awesome custom movie box art and have always wanted to make/print one.   	153
 YESS!!! In school I used to lift up the back of my skirt to the fan in the summer or the heater in the winter to cool/warm my bum, it was incredible!!!   I skip the last few steps in my routine when its humid, i.e. Origins Overnight Treatment, Innisfree Green Tea Sleeping Pack  On the central line today I could bear it no longer, I brought out my facial mist from Tosowoong and doused myself in the land-of-no-AC   Oooooohhh might have to give this one a go, I don't mind a little glitter on the lower waterline but not a big fan if its on the top lash line. I'll give the Clio one a go tomorrow as I'm going swimming, so we'll see how that works out.  Do you use any liquid liners by the way?   Does the Holika Holika stay on your eyes??? *heart beats excitedly in hope*  The worst would probably be the L'Oreal Kohl one, oh LAWD. That thing is supposed to 'glide on'- it doesn't, it tugs like Ruby Woo would and then melts so fast. The Rimmel Scandaleyes in Black was almost just as bad, I wink a fair bit (I hate posing in pictures and selfies) and my right eye was a complete panda eye and the left smudged all over my 'aegyo sal'.   Also, do you use the liners on the waterline or lashline or both?   I don't usually wear a primer but the #1 was such a disappointment, I had it on my upper waterline and it smeared all over my lower lashline. Have you tried the Rimmel Scandaleyes? I had the black one in that and that was awful too.   My products came in yesterday and I thought I would do some swatches, in all honesty I applied all 3 eyeliners before showering an hour later and I really wasn't impressed with lasting power.  London is going to be sweltering the next few days so I'll put these to the test and get back to you guys.  Everything together http://imgur.com/YijCQeL  Swatches in natural light http://imgur.com/pCOFRJ2  Swatches with flash http://imgur.com/eX3APNi   I used one last night (literally just woke up and I'm checking this sub...) and it's amazing. I used to use Mario Badescu's drying lotion and then Missha's Acence Pink Spot but the MB absolutely dried out my skin and left me with huge scabs so now I have to deal with the scarring and PIH :(  The best part was they were 29 RMB so around 3 for me and $4 for 4 packs!!!    1. I first lightly steam my face with a muslin cloth folded over or microfibre cloth and then squeeze the product out and WIPE OFF. The applicator is absolute shite and if you notice, a lot of the gel ends up behind the main 'platform'.  2. Wash that gunk off yo face.  3. Rinse that gunk off and shake vigorously to get it as dry as possible.  4. Not really, although I haven't seen great results and I feel like a physical exfoliant (am using the Missha D-tox peeling gel atm) works far better.      Does the undertone lean towards yellow? I really want to try a cheaper cushion to see how I feel about the 'air puff' concept and the Innisfree ones are so light in colour    I've never tried this band but pearl cream is like a thick cream thats really rich, normally this stuff has the consistency of a gel but definitely takes a long time to absorb but I don't know with yours seeing as they're little balls. I use a different brand but pearl creams have been used in China for a REALLY long time.  I would say do use with caution though some people may react to the herbal ingredients and although there are a lot of poorly made products out there, not everything is bad and not everyone is trying to con you.    To be honest, I haven't tried the other formulation so I don't really know, the brightening one is very runny though, the essence drips down my neck so I have to have it on lying down haha. You're probably off buying them on RRS buy the box really, they probably work out to be cheaper like that anyway.  Oh RRS totally mark down the value of things so go wild next time, my $90 order was marked as $7 and Jolse marked a $30 to $7 too! I was really nervous the first time I ordered from them both but was really surprised and ecstatic when they came!   Ahhhh, sorry my mistake. Its just that I know Jolse and RRS both lower the value of the shipments, my last $90 order was written as $7, and I couldn't find any information if other stores do so too. Maybe I'll take the risk with TK or BeautyNetKorea though!   The toner and lotion sound pretty appealing! Have you seen much difference or improvement with them?   It's cause I'm in the UK and I'm really trying to avoid VAT and 'handling' charges from EMS, as far as I know, most stores apart from RRS and Jolse will use EMS   I have been refreshing RRS for 6 consecutive days trying to buy the Longer Name ampoule to surprise my mum who is soon returning from a 3 month work trip, but to no avail (does this mean its sold out?). Is there is anything you would recommend from the line excluding the FTE, targeting PIH and ageing skin?    Yeah! In the States, they're called that!! Mmmnnn, I believe that gravy is mix of fish sauce and soy sauce, mine was predominately beansprouts, velveted chicken, shredded carrots and rice vermicelli although I wasn't too keen on the chilli sauce I had      I always make this when coming home from a long trip or when I'm jet lagged and knackered, takes no longer than 10 mins and so delicious   Yeah, Chengdu is definitely more of a business hub these days and I'm confident Chengdu will have a Sasa. Personally I wouldn't buy anything in Sasa in store, there aren't really any 'exclusives' that you won't be able to get elsewhere online. I do normally buy MBD masks from Watson's though, they're around 88 RMB for me, so like 8 and about $10 if you're in the US?  I'm actually based in the UK haha, but I was born in Beijing and lived there till I was 5, and spend my summers there (will be heading home next week wooo!). I did use SAL shipping on Rakuten to avoid some cheeky EMS customs issues though  P.S. Remind him to keep hydrated, I know Chengdu is an absolute boiler of a place and personally, I can't stand the humidity and heat there, seeing as London gets to ~27 degrees max. If he gets heat rashes the Johnson's Baby Heat Rash powder (comes in a pouch like a yoghurt pouch) one is good to dust on and available at most supermarkets. My nearest 7/11 in Beijing has them too!   Same!!! On their old website, it took me so long to figure out the search function and the importance of the square brackets haha! Plus, I love their 'Sort By' function for Lowest  Highest....ahh such sweet is student life...   Sadly, I haven't tried many Japanese products but am waiting on my first Rakuten order to get my Heroine Kiss Me!  Where in China is he at the moment? The best stores to hit up would be Sasa, Watson's (a drugstore) and Mannings (another drugstore). Watson's do this great birds nest and an aloe vera mask I love- they both have loads of essence left so I just soak a paper mask in it with some warm distilled water and its so refreshing in the Beijing humidity   	22

Next twitter post will be, if trees could talk they would ask to be killed to take them out of their misery of solitude and boredom, So we should drop out of school and be carpenters and lumber jacks.   Okay so the point of getting married for me is a best friend, homemade meals, and sex at least three to five times a week. Most american women suck at cooking, pms all the time, and hate sex. Hahaha fuck that.    OH and don't forget he slaves the elves.   Can I lick nutella of her booty?   Rave.   Sorry I was kind of mad because some nigger knocked out my teeth.   I got my teeth knocked out by a nigger. What should i call a person that punches people randomly for fun. and is a ghetto black.   What's her name?   See what I mean by it is the attitude not skin color.    Nigger for your info means ignorant person.   It's not the color of the skin, it's the behavior.  	14
 True but my idea is not a cure but rather a treatment for my reoccurring mrsa infections. I get your point though.   The MRSA foundation, a California based 501 non-profit, has a website not a blog . Also don't take the word conspiracy so seriously. Most /r/conspiracy posts are not true conspiracy's but rather  is a subreddit where people can post unconventional ideas and have open minded people look at them . Think abstraction not literal.   When post cools down I will get a hold of you. It might be tomorrow.   I am a creative nut. What can I say.   No problem.   My naval education background from 2.5 years of electronics schools which are all MIT based and taught by lockheed Martin instructors gave me an educational backround which helped me come up with idea. Plus I am a strange nerd. On my spare time, I read peer reviewed scientific papers on all subjects. It's fun.Proud Veteran. Have a problem with it. Your problem.   I put a MRSA foundation web page not my youtube video on r/technology so I don't understand what you are talking about.   Tell it like it is. Proud Veteran. ProtoDong can't bully me. You are correct it is just reddit.    Ok moderater get the point go back to r/technology and leave us "crazy" people alone. Ok. Over and out   /u/ProtoDong what makes you the gatekeeper. Your job as a moderator should be too control trolling not the free flow of ideas. I have treated three MRSA infections with my idea in the presence of a retired microbiologist . Let the people decide.   Sorry moderator /u/ProtoDong  giving truth not dark triad manipulation.   That is why I use a 1000 hydroponic bulb. You are correct though on lower wattage bulbs. A 1000 watt bulb gives the necessary skin penetration.    My idea also helps lighten scar tissue which would help military IED blast victims.    Hopefully my youtube video's will go viral before the FDA shut's me down.   Good idea.    Reddit is awesome but needs new leadership. The purpose of the moderator's should be too enforce no trolling rules not to be the gatekeepers of new ideas.    Ok. What % upvote should be a veto proof %. Any suggestions.   Good one.

 My mistake, it was a typo. Thanks!  As this is my first build, are there any peripherals I would need which I wouldn't think of? (And on that note, is there a wifi card/adapter you would recommend?    I'll get one when I start overclocking in the future. Thank you!   Sorry, I'm **not** overclocking, but I might in the future. I have a huge backlog of older games to play before I start on new ones, and I'm not too picky about FPS. I'll save the OC for the future.   Thanks for your help! I just bought everything today.

Did I do anything majorly wrong? Anything I should change? I did want to get it around $600, I tried to get the best possible deals, and I'm satisfied with this build and its price. Thanks for all your help!    Haven't heard of it before now, and i'm a FE fan. thanks!   What is this game?   For free? Damn, I missed that. Hopefully it comes up again.   Is it worth it to get dragon age at this price, or should I wait?   Copy paste is magic!  Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react. Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.  Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this!  In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.  As for what the prophecies of the Messiah actually are, that was addressed elsewhere.   says you, this is not what the person that originally wrote the text believed is it?  Because the punishment for sex before marriage is zero, while adultery's is stoning. Can you give an argument aside from "well that's what you say?"   there are seven laws to match the seven virtues and seven sins  or maybe the opposite, don't you think?  these of course stem from the seven visible astral bodies common to the ancient religions  Never heard of this. Link please?  again, this is entirely your opinion and not in anyway proven fact, what the author intended is unknown and has been debated often -- you seem to be arguing from the stance that adam and eve really were the first people created and that all humanity stems from them, as you're no doubt aware this view is contentious even within modern Judaism, it's certainly not accepted by secular science.  If we're talking about the author's intent, secular science doesn't matter. If you're disputing my claim about Genesis 9:4, here's the simple proof: The text itself. Adam was given only the plants to eat, while Noah was given the animals (9:3). How is allowing you to eat animals encouraging vegetarianism? Yes, it might say vegetarianism is preferable, but eating meat is certainly allowed -- but eating blood is not.  The reality is...  I have no idea what your point is here, it seems you're just rambling.   to say you can claim with absolute authority that you know what the author of the commandments intended to convey is just sillyness(sic).  You only have one way of evaluating this, via the text. I get my claims from analysis, not just by "knowing." You want to say I'm wrong, prove me wrong.  uh, it's from the exact bit i was just talking about and how it's clearly actually intended to be a reference to the same thing mentioned in the commandment.  No, grafting is not part of the Noahide law. It is given to Jews, as "don't plant two types of seeds in a field (Lev. 19:19). It has nothing to do with Noah, or animals, or blood.  yes secular law is important because the vague notions hinted at by idealogical theologians as formed into firm sounding aphorisms are entirely meaningless - are you suggesting that the all wise god in his infinite glory decided to troll us with a set of laws with absolutely no use for no reason but to inspire us to craft sensible ones for his followers to oppose on religious grounds? [as the abolution of slavery, womens lib, civil lib and etc, etc, etc have and often still are fought against in the name of the lord?]  You sound like you have a chip on your shoulder. God gave us laws, and the tools with which to create more related to our situations. We are not yet in the Messianic age.   brings up the fascinating question of what is a false god, i guess Jesus Christ counts right?  Possibly. It is an argument.  likewise adultery, what does it mean? today we use this to mean clandestine extra-marital sex but it can, and did, mean a much more general thing including sex before marriage.  It means consensual sex when you are engaged or married to another person. Sex before marriage is not adultery.  Seven is the most absurd of course, take an example - are we to say that Martin Luther King for example did not support the rule of law but he did support justice?  Laws between society differ. Just because this is complicated doesn't mean it is absurd. You're way of interpretation isn't necessarily correct, and you're jumping to the worst possible conclusion.  number six of course is kinda bizarre, and lets be honest here you're not kidding anyone - certainly not the all knowing king of kings, if he's still about - but first let's assume your version is how it's intended,  You're not making sense, of course this is what is intended. Why do you think differently?   doesn't that fact that with only seven slots available one of them is dedicated to something so ridiculous kinda make the whole set look silly  That's only with your incorrect assumption that there are only seven slots. If this law wouldn't be there, there would only be six, and if another one needed to be tacked on, it would be 8. No cosmic force is forcing seven laws over any other number. I'm not going to go into the why of it now.  If this rule ever meant anything it's tied to Genesis 9:4  But flesh with its soul, [which is] its blood, you shall not eat' which is a pretty clear call to if not total vegetarianism at least abstaining from red meat, something likely copied from the other religions of the region and 'updated' in much the way Paul 'updates' foreskins for Christians  You are absolutely wrong. That says that you can't eat the blood of the animal, not to be vegetarian. In fact, Adam and his descendants were originally vegetarians, and only Noah and his descendants were allowed meat after the flood.   As i'm sure you're aware the traditional Jewish interpretation understands this as being a rule which even forbids the grafting of different species of fruit trees - a method of yield boosting now pretty much default the world over.  Wrong. That is from somewhere entirely different.  as for the others, is piracy theft? or is property theft? what is murder? is war murder? is poverty murder? is self-defence murder? in which case what is self-defence? is forcing your reluctant wife to sleep with you rape?  Good questions! These are things to be ironed out, don't you agree? That is what the rule of law is for.    Yeah, I don't have that kind of money to spend. :P do you have a reccomendation for a Z97 mobo under $100?

What will I be able to play with this? Can I play Skyrim on ultra at 60FPS, for example? How about some of the newer games that are just now coming out? Thank you!   That case was $65 FOUR days ago. Argh. Other recommendations have been corsair 200R/300R and the NZXT S340. What are your opinions on those?  I'm at the Boston MC, which I think has pretty much everything new in stock. But it seems like all the mAtx sold are actually *more* expensive, so I might go with the ATX instead. There are just so many options that are hard to tell apart. :/ The Z87 boards are a lot cheaper -- would there be a significant drop in performance, or another reason not to get them? I'm looking at [this one](http://www.microcenter.com/product/417392/Z87_PRO3_Socket_LGA_1150_ATX_Intel_Motherboard_-_Refurbished) in particular.   The motherboard is part of a microcenter deal of $40 off a cpu and mobo. Motherboards are more complicated than almost anything else, so I'm not exactly sure what I should get. Is there a relatively cheap unlockable mobo? Also, what is better in the long run -- Atx or mAtx?  The case was recommended to me. What is another good budget case that you know of?     Not sold at microcenter, unfortunately. I'm not passing up their $40 off a mobo deal   I wanted to keep it under $800 maximum, and preferably closer to $600.

I don't want to spend too much on the case, and I don't care too much about style. What are my best options?   How can you use the OS without using these?   For what reason?   I'm building a new PC, and I'm not sure which one to get. Both are free. Windows 7 is older, but I've heard nothing but bad news about 8. Which one would you recommend?    http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33   Yeah. Unfortunately my MC doesn't have that mobo in stock. :(   That's $70 more, not $30   shhhhh, it's a myssssstery.   Simple question: What do you do for the best price? Is it better to buy now and on Black Friday, or is it better to wait and get post-Black Friday sales?   Should I jump on sales now or wait for after Black Friday?   I building the exact same computer as you. Just know that Microcenter currently has a deal for $40 off the motherboard if you buy a 4690k!    Obviously there are exceptions to this. And having gender-neutral bathrooms shouldn't involve the removal of urinals. But why not just have one big fucking bathroom with all the stalls and urinals?  Maybe because some people are uncomfortable with it, and they would rather only have people of the same sex in the bathroom? Especially when the bathroom includes showers, for example? Should these be denied a comfortable space?   Yeah, I saw that. I JUST ordered the 600W one yesterday, so I'm seeing if I can cancel it. I'm going to micro center soon to pick up the last parts so I'll hopefully build it sometime next week. I can't wait to actually play games decently; and not just decently, but good.

I'm also thinking about switching the PSU, and I got a cheaper RAM deal. It's reassuring that we have the same build, it means I probably didn't screw up!   Are you me? I'm doing the exact same thing, except my laptop is four years old. want to compare?   This is incorrect. The hebrew word in the texts of Isaiah could be understand as either maiden or virgin but the Greek word used in the New Testament has no such ambiguity. It only means virgin. The writers of the New Testament understood the words of Isaiah to mean "virgin" and that is why the Greek word for virgin is used and not the Greek word for "maiden".  This is one of the most conceited things I have ever heard. You think your translation, written hundreds of years later, is better than the original text?    I'm getting i5 4590k, and it's the first time building a computer. Thanks for the chance!   Currently, there is a 2TB Hybrid SSD on sale for $80 on amazon.

I've never played a tomb raider game before.   Right now it's $130 on newegg. How does it compare to the one I'm getting?   Ow well. This is the first time building a computer anyway, so take my advice with a grain of salt.   If you have access to microcenter, I have a very good and cheap build I'm making.

Whereas when the mormons say "they", it means "dead members of ~~our religion~~ a random tribe from 2500 years ago, which we know because it's written in ~~a book~~ some random text who this one person translated".

I'm more interested in smooth graphics than impressive ones.  **What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**   $600-800  **When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**   Anytime in the next two months, when the best deals will be.  **What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)**   Everything aside from the OS, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  **Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**   Massachusetts, and yes.  **If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**   Probably just older ones from around the house. Would this be a problem?  **Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**   No, probably not.  **Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**  I would want a decent amount of storage so that I don't have to worry about it anytime soon, but that is all.  **Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**  No.  **Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**  No, but is there a preference for one or the other?  **Extra info or particulars:**  I'm just sick of having a bad laptop and want something decent, and that will be able to last at least a couple of years. (I can barely play Morrowind right now.) Thank you!   Open up the book and see what it says  "This says my ancestors all stood at this mountain and listened to a god. I asked my dad and said he never heard of it. Why should I listen to you?"    No, the difference is that eternity will eventually answer.   The Palestinians are saying it is tainted by prayer, not us.   Yom Kippur is just a day of concentrated repentance, and only for sins between man and God.   [This](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Yom_Kippur/In_the_Community/Prayer_Services/Confession/Confessing_Sins/Connecting_Sin_and_Repentance.shtml?p=0) is a short primer on repentance in Judaism, and [here](http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/repentance) is a deeper look into the subject.      Just google either. There is only a slight difference but I appreciate your need to be pedantic to attempt to prove your point.  Hey, you asked, I answered. It is definitely ethnic cleansing.  In any case, Israel has been a bad neighbor, they have no one to blame for any bad feelings towards them in the region but themselves.  Really? You think Israel is to blame for all the wars it has fought?   What about Ethiopian Jews?  Originally from the Levant. And even if they weren't, people can be adopted into the tribe.   Fan fiction.    Nope, not at all. Why are you equating the fruit to all sin? There are specific punishments for specific sins, and specific ways to repent for specific sins. If every sin caused death, we would all be dead long ago.  Life is about improving yourself, not about dying.   The price to pay for sinning is dying.  But this is not true.   ~~telling~~ toeing the line  FTFY     Ethnic cleansing and genocide are two distinct crimes, though they are often wrongly conflated by people who like throwing out buzzwords. And Jews are an ethnic group who share the religion Judaism.   They are also a bit of a far cry from voting on whether or not Jews should be ethnically cleansed from the region.  What do you think "return to their home countries" mean aside from ethnic cleansing?   Not Judaism!   To get your edit out of the way first, you cannot directly cause an action which is intended to give you a benefit that breaks Shabbat. It gets complicated, but this definitely falls under forbidden.  To me, yes, it is entirely indisputable that igniting a gas by way of a spark is the same thing as lighting a fire. Do you have an argument to how it is different?   Because then you would know that lighting a fire, especially in regards to a car, is not a more complicated subject. Yes, there are always deeper layers, but this is not one of them.   So why don't you learn the sources instead of criticizing it?   Yes, and everyone will agree with you (I hope). But to some, observing Judaism (the active part of being Jewish) is taking that commitment.   Not really, there is a reason it is its own movement and not a sub group. But, even so, what's your point?   Not true. If you want to say it is similar in principle, you have to prove it from the theology.   Just because it was formed out of Reform, does not mean it is comparable to reform.   I do not, personally, try to live my life in order to "fit in" with Christian society.  He didn't say that, just that it was originally founded to fit in more with Christian society, which is pretty much indisputable. Reform has changed quite a lot in the past 150 years.  In addition, you are kind of are admitting it. You are just using "modern" instead of Christian, but it has the same connotation: the mitzvot, as enumerated by the rabbis, are not something you want to totally incorporate into your life. That's fine, but it is not the same thing as Judaism was before.    A 50 year ceasefire does not mean "Openly at war" still. You sound like one of the idiots that thinks North Korea and America are suddenly just going to start shooting each other at the drop of a hat.  Do you not follow the news? That border, though quiet, has been seen a number of attacks since the last ceasefire. Israel can and will bomb Syria at the drop of a hat if it feels threatened, like transfers of long range missiles to Hezbollah.  Israel helping ISIS and other rebel groups though this conflict by bombing SAA bases has just further destabilized this conflict,   Israel has only bombed in two situations: In the case of a threat like above, or if any fire lands on Israel's side of the border. If they were bombing bases like America, you would hear about it.   You think Israel and Syria aren't at war? Wow.   Yes, and they have been at war for decades.   tell me, how is it racist?   is that supposed to be a bad thing?   There been a lot tension in Jerusalem with the Al-Aqsa Mosque and settlement.  What exactly is your view of what is happening there?   They will if they ever get control.    Something happened to cause multitudes of people to change their faiths from Judaism to Christianity against the establishment,  This didn't happen, unless by multitudes you mean "dozens." Almost all of the converts were Roman, not Jewish.   Is there any way to corroborate this? Right now all there is as evidence is one unsourced comment on the article.  	109

    On the subject of movies, **Limitless** is one of the most stupid movies ever made. A guy uses a drug to analyze the markets and practically see the future when it comes to stocks, but he needs to get money from a loan shark to open his first account.

Thanks.      [Late for School - TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateForSchool).   If you haven't clicked on the links yet, don't. Some are best left blue.   I suggest that you saute the onions first in a skillet. That will greatly improve the flavor.  If you have enough time and don't want to use skillet, you can slowcook them for several hours before starting your dish. Or, the best option, slowcook large batch on onions (6-8) with some olive oil for 8 hours on low, then divide to 4 portions and freeze. Whenever a recipe calls for onions, add it from the freezer (no need to thaw).        /r/JustUnsubbed   Plus, the survival rate in a competitive food market (like large cities and business areas) is usually among the lowest of all businesses.

They might be cheap, but spare bikes is also good. You don't need to invest in them anything but time. When you or a friend upgrade a part, take the old one to that bike. Plus you gonna free up a parking slot.    Probably. That's why I closed the gif immediately, it's one of the saddest.   ...based on true events.    How is this any different?  Because food, cloths and entertainment aren't preserved as morally equal. I'm not saying those game farms are wrong or immoral, but I can see how it's on the far side of the scale.  Also, breeding animals for food (and the questionable living conditions and slaughtering techniques) is one of the major factors of lifting people above poverty and hunger levels. Many people simply couldn't afford meat if it wasn't delivered like that. While zoos and entertainment farms mostly serve the rich. So I think that point also add to the differences between them.  Anyway, at least those animals get a chance to escape their hunters, put up a fight and die in nature.   That would work also.    Really? Who hates developers that deliver a masterpiece but delayed product? There might be pressure from management and stock holders, but hate from the people? No way.

The only challenge is to peel the squash, but other than that, easy and tasty. I also added celery and stirred all the spices in the skillet together with the peppers, I think it brings up more flavors.   #Ingredients  * 1/4 cup olive oil  * 3 onions, chopped  * 4 cloves garlic, minced  * 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped  * 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped  * 2 jalapeos, seeded and minced  * 4 15-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained  * 2 14.5-oz. cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes  * 3 tablespoons chili powder  * 2 tablespoons cumin  * 1 tablespoon dried oregano  * 4 cups butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice  * Salt and pepper   #Preparation  1. Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut onions until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; saut 1 minute. Add bell peppers and jalapeos; saut until tender, about 3 minutes. 2. Transfer pepper mixture to slow cooker. Stir in beans, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Arrange squash on top. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours.  #Cooking the rice  In a pot heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add 1 cup of rice and stir to have it all covered. After 2 minutes add boiling water or chicken broth if you prefer more flavorful rice, bring to boil again and let it cook for 10 minutes on low burner. After that, remove from the heat and set it aside undisturbed for another 10 minutes.       Not only cultural but practical. Dogs don't have enough meat, it's not that tasty (lean and hard), it's expensive to feed them and some can be useful through their entire life.    Yeah, but don't forget that insurance in mandatory by law in most areas of the world. So it will take time until they'll feel pressure to lower rates. In fact, they are in for some good years with same premiums but less accidents.    I wouldn't go far and calling it a scam. There are some unique (and shady) characteristic in the industry:  * It's one of the few industries in which you pay, sometimes years, before you get the service with a chance that you might never actually get it. The company gets to keep the money (and invest it) without actually putting it to work towards the product. * The standard procedure to get the service you paid for is to sue (either you sue the insurance company or they sue another company). * It's one of the few industries in which the most important department is the legal department. * There are lots of scams against insurance companies. It's probably the biggest victim of customers' theft. * There's an information gap in a sense that the customer usually knows more about the product than the seller (typically it's the other way around). * Some of the services are mandatory by law.   Yeah, HTPC users wouldn't mind, but the fact that it won't be available is seems on Android tablets (I use mine to watch netflix occasionally) and chromecast sucks. At least at the beginning anyway.   It says PC is okay. So HTPC users wouldn't mind. But still, blocking it out from Android tablets, consoles, chromecast is risky as hell. I guess not only that Apple paid a lot, but also HBO is very confident to launch in a narrow market.   It's a brave decision in the wrong sense of the word. PC is fine, so those with HTPC wouldn't mind. They got the price right, $14.99.       Not the same. Most of the aid to Israel is annual military funds, which Israel has to spend on American products. It's basically a corporate welfare.   China's debt are USA government bonds held by the Chinese government.  Both of those amounts aren't that significant relative to the 100% (USA total aid, USA total budget, USA total debt, Israel budget, China total assets, you name it), but they make good headlines.

I'd like to add, in addition to response you got from /u/dragontamer5788, that if you do want to use leverage, it's better to leverage the entire account. Meaning, if you hold $10K in double leverage ETF, it's better to hold $20K in the underlying ETF and use half of it as leverage from the broker.   Margin rates are extremely low now and you won't suffer from beta decay that was explained to you.  Overall, leverage ETFs are bad for long time holding periods. The last few years weren't a good example because the market didn't suffer a lot of volatility, but don't think this condition will last forever nor will you able to know in time when it changes.      3 points to think about: 1. Did you shift gears fully? Sometimes half shift causes noise. 2. Are you cross chaining (small ring to small ring or big ring to big ring)? That also can cause some noise. 3. If not half shift and not cross chaining, go to LBS to adjust the gears or do it at home if you have the tools.   Yeah, you are right, this is by no means accurate, just something to know as a general guidance. The link between training, calories and weight loss is also non linear. Meaning, training and eating to lose the 100th kg is different than the 70th kg.    Who knows these answers?  Well, you.  Who cares about these answers?  Apparently not even you.      Two options: either use [GPS](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/gps) with dedicated software or use an app if you have smartphone.

The advantage of apps are social (even if you don't like sharing stuff with friends, you can browse and discover lots of routes), nice websites and no need for another device to buy and carry. The disadvantage is that you depend on your phone and its battery. Unlike GPS devices, it probably won't last 5-6 hours unless it's new or you carry an extra portable charger.  If you want to make a bet, then Strava and Endomondo are really good for it, because you can actually challenge your friends and you can see the progress.    From 2009, interview with Larry King:   **MAHER**: Well, we've talked about it. I'm not into western medicine. That to me is a complete scare tactic. It just shows you, you can...   **KING**: You mean you don't get a -- you don't get a flu shot?   **MAHER**: A flu shot is the worst thing you can do.   **KING**: Why? MAHER: Because it's got -- it's got mercury.   **KING**: It prevents flu.   **MAHER**: It doesn't prevent. First of all, that's...   **KING**: I haven't had the flu in 25 years since I've been taking a flu shot.   **MAHER**: Well, I hate to tell you, Larry, but if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there's ten times the likelihood that you'll get Alzheimer's disease. I would stop getting your...   **KING**: What did you say?   **MAHER**: That went better in rehearsal but it was still good. Absolutely, no the defense against disease is to have a strong immune system. A flu shot just compromises your immune system.   **KING**: So you don't take any western medicine, don't take an aspirin?   **MAHER**: Never, an aspirin no. Thousands of people die from aspirin every year.  I also think that western medicine and health practice does a lot of things wrong, but flu vax isn't one of them. He's being stupid here.    I don't know, I think they went too hard on it using all the practices we all hate about business: lobbying, campaigning, lots of money.  I don't think GMO should be labeled, but I also don't see too much harm in it. Especially if virtually all food products will be labeled. It can be like ingredients. Salt isn't bad, but it's still written on the label. If someone wants to control their salt diet, he pays attention while most people don't give a fuck about that.  It's already labeled around the world in the EU and most of the developed countries. [EU: Traceability and labelling of GMOs](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l21170_en.htm).   Good job man. I say keep track of your nutrition.   Since you like riding long distances and also, if I get it correctly, want to lose weight, it's important to balance your diet. Consuming too little calories while training will increase the chances of fatigue and illness.   At your pace (20 km/h), you'll burn about 8 calories per kg per hour. So if you weight 80kg and ride 4 hours, that would be 8x80x4 = 2,560 cal. If you want to lose weight, consume 20% less, so about 500 cal less. But try not to get less than that, so you can keep healthy.  If you want to lose half a kilo per week (which is what considered an healthy diet), you would need to consume 3,500 calories less than you burn over the course of the **week**.  Obviously those numbers are just for guidelines and it depends on a lot of other factors. It can still give you general estimation.   /r/rage!   I think it backfires when those companies fight to not write GMO on the label. People don't trust businesses who try to hide things. So anti-big-businesses stand will be to immediately question GMO. This is, more than anything, a pavlovian response.   He's not 100% anti vax. He said he's anti the flu shot. He also brings some arguments about the downside of vax. However, you are still right, his argument aren't really backed by science.  I think his anti vax position is the same as others so-called rich liberal hippies, who used to think it's cool and healthy, only to wake up one morning and see who else support their ideas. At this point it's just a matter of time until they find a ladder to climb down from their stupid tree.   Nah, he withdrew that statement. He said he was libertarian when they were the only politicians that talked about weeds.   He does agree on a lot if things with Ron Paul, mostly drugs and foreign policy. So when he mentions his name he also says that.  One time the guy from Reason magazine (a libertarian outlet, sorry, I forgot his name, pretty cool and smart guy) was on the panel, and they argued a lot.    That's called a [roller](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/il/en/tacx-antares-professional-training-rollers/rp-prod31106).

So I can only imagine his fury when he found out it's just an illusion! Half a minute gone from his meaningful life.   Damn seeing people and their privileges.    You are right, I wasn't clear enough and I probably used the wrong terminology out of a hurry. Allow me to clarify.  **Economic efficiency**  If you were a young musician living in rural Wisconsin, it was almost impossible for you to get young listeners in Cleveland, Belgium, Australia, Hong Kong or Slovakia to hear your music and pay for it.  There were too many gates and too few competitive gate keepers between the artists and the consumer.  Therefor supply couldn't meet the real demand. And because of that, all the process in the middle and all the prices and compensations were distorted.   (The other way around, from Australia, Hong Kong, Slovakia, Belgium **to** USA, was almost non existent).   First you had to find a record company. Why? because printing vinyl records or compact disks is damn expensive. Distributing them is also expensive. Distributing where? to physical music stores, which also didn't exist abundantly in some markets or were under monopoly in other markets. Those stores also had limited space. How would the consumer even hear your music? The only option was radio and TV. In most of the world there were at best 2-3 variety channels, so the time you had to listen to **your** kind of music was probably 2-3 hours a week (This Top of the Pops and Radio1 in Britain, other places were even worst), that's it. So in the process you had to pass a Label, which held most of the power over you, then radio channel editor and a store manager with limited space.   That means that everything in the middle: recording, printing, distrusting, art, stores, radio and TV - all were able to manipulate prices, not based on the music, but based on inefficient market conditions.  The market for independent musicians, those who complain today about high fees from iTunes, Google or Spotify, simply didn't exist (or was very minor) just 2 decades back.  By the way, even very successful artists would have killed for 30% flat fee on their sales. Out of $10 LP or $15 CD, artists [received $2 at best](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml). Only today you have an option to independently save up $25,000 (it's expensive, but competitive and not unheard of amount), record your first album, mix the music on your computer, put it on youtube, spotify, soundcould, bandcamp, itunes, and earn net 70% of the sales. A direct connection between you and the listener. Almost no gates and no gate keepers. So you get very closely to what you worth in the world.   2 points about your quotes and 1 hard truth.  1. The artist says: shirt? No thanks. But he doesn't give any reason for that. Is selling a shirt too low for him? When it comes to music, merchandise are a way for fans to express their love and connection with the music. It's a service to fans, and one that pays back.  2. 'Apple charging 30% and not taking any risks'. That's false. Apple took huge risks in the past to get to this point today. They invested large amount of money in platform and devices way before they were common and far from being a safe bet. Technology works in a way that first you take all the risks, then, if you are one of the very few successful survivors, you get big profit and big margins.   And to the hard truth: making music isn't that special. There are tons of good artists, they all have access now to mass audience, so the competition is tough.  There's really no reason to pay for something that exists abundantly. The old market wasn't efficient because record companies created artificial scarcity.    If you are a small band, and you make good music, you are offering something that is offered by thousands more. Why would someone pay you premium for that, when the limited resource here is the time to listen to all the good music available.   My experience with ETS2: played for hours, drove between all cities, explored most roads. Still can't reverse park a truck.   How about Moneyball?  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball  *Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis'sMoneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.*   It's a nice guide. I don't think they understand what 'manipulate' means.    Bruce Willis was just 33yo in the first Die Hard.    I literally can't look at spiders in the eyes now.   I just realized that I never spoke. with. dots.   Why not? it's probably the only place where the mods actually verify and check each story.

The dog won't hate you for it. You just made him happy. But I would suggest not taking him back to that store, so the PTSD will remain contained.     I find it very helpful to avoid repetition.  But here's the thing. If you find yourself repeating, then there's something in the structure of your writing that needs changing. And if you still think that structure is fine and repeating is unavoidable, then it's important enough to keep using the same word or it will be just confusing.     I Betieve it is.   No, that's not how anarchy works. Anarchy means no single authority. It doesn't mean no rules. Can you have rules without a ruler? Anarchists think you can.   Wynn Duffy disagrees with you.    Okay, so marriage equality is a make-or-break issue for you. That's fair. But why are you surprised that other people don't see it that way? Some may think that US drone killing is far worse. Some think that imperialist foreign policy is the worst and some think taxes are the most important issue.  While there's still a lot to move forward in marriage equality, it's fair to say the gay couples are better off now than they were few years back and the **trend is likely to continue regardless of the person in office**. Other issues, not so much.   I don't see the connection. The fact that some people have free time and choose to spend it on Reddit says nothing about their goals and if they are on track with their life, as they see it.   Competence seems like the exception when it comes to all Elmore Leonard's henchmen.   I'm having a real hard time upvoting that. You aplexing asshole.       If you change the background from Carlin to some kind of religious prop, it will be fine. That's how stupid the rule is.      Things continue to change there. Many saw him as a front runner to host. Good luck to him, I enjoyed his segments, especially the semi-serious ones he did oversea.          I'm trying to do that as well, but my dog won't leave the room.      I have also i10, and I carry two bikes easily on the roof.    Right, I knew there was a better word for that, but all I could think about was this technical term from my work that kind of describes the same thing.    It's basically the same as producing 3 feature films  Probably not. As much as those episodes have high production value compared to TV, it's still not close to a film. For example, the budget of The Imitation Game was about $15M. I doubt the budget for each episode is more than $2M. I bet that post takes much less time than a film, but I couldn't find any sources to back that up.  The answer has to be with the schedule of Cumberbatch   Freeman, both very busy and popular at the moment. I'm sure Hollywood pays more than the BBC and also provides more opportunities, so we can't really blame them for their priorities.    You don't want a cycling lawyer, you want a c-y-c-l-i-n-g lawyer.      Reddit are people when you visit all the hobbies subs (my examples are /r/bicycling and similar, /r/photography, /r/Cooking and similar, /r/Jazz, /r/listentothis, /r/writing, etc. and I'm sure there are hundreds more). This is where Reddit as a community really shines.    Well, there's nothing particularly unhealthy here. When I make something similar, I don't use butter, milk, bacon or cheese. And I usually add 1 or 2 more vegetables.    Sure. Refresh, refresh, refresh, oversold.   Cereal bars usually aren't good enough because it takes time for them to digest and deliver calories to your body. Fruits and drinks are quicker and more efficient in that regard.  Overall, you should aim to consume about 150-200 calories per hour, depending on your pace. 1 banana will give you about 120 cal.  If you want to eat something more solid, like a sandwich (PB J will give you about 200 cal, depending on the bread), do it as part of a full 20-30 minutes stop.  **Basic recipe for home made drink**: mix 1/3 cup of your favorite juice (orange, apple, cranberry and such), 4 tablespoon of sugar (should be around 60g), 1/4 teaspoon of salt with water to fill up 1L. That should give you around 250 calories per Liter, which is the recommended amount.

Simmons is, and will always be, Dr. Skoda from L O.   Well, people mentioned the bike. I'll add that you gonna need to train for that distance. If you do 30km, double it to 60 (do the same route twice), and then 120km. You'll need to get used to being so long on your bikes, learn your pace, see how you handle water and food (with 30km you don't need to eat, with 100km you most certainly do, or your legs will stop working).

It's part of a national park that was sold to private owners.       we ended up having sex  Sure dude.   I'm not sure it's because 'everything is within its field'. It's more like: let's hear what that smart person has to say on this subject. He can be a well known mathematician, biologists or, god forbid, an economist.  But yeah, you are right. He probably can't add anything new to this field. Especially to a multi discipline topic like that (it's a political and cultural issue as much as physical and technological).   That person is probably very rich today.   I also like the opposite, when people upset their favorite thing isn't a thing.

In Dragon Age: Inquisition there are Focus skills and in Path of Exile there are Vaal skills. In both games you basically need to kill enemies to charge those skills (in DA:I the more you kill, the more powerful the skill becomes, up to 3 stages). When the skill is charged you can use it once, and needs to recharge it again.   Overall I think it's a good mechanic that add some depth and tactic to the game. POE is ARPG so the skill get charged quickly, but in DA:I you need to be a bit more calculated if you want it available to a boss fight.   God damn it.   /r/lewronggeneration might also like it.   I think you miss the point a little. Of course he can do it. But it's more risky. Meaning, if he does it a 100 different times, he'll fall 1-2 times and lose the stage. Hell, some of them even fall in roundabouts. Don't they know how to make a simple circle? of course they do, but it's more risky. So the question is: Is sidewalk hopping a good practice from risk/reward perspective?       Overdone.   This is why I liked living in a busy street in NYC. The UPS truck arrived around the same time every day, parked in the same spot, and it took them about 20-30 minutes to deliver all the packages. So I had plenty of time to just approach the truck with the slip they left on the door (of the building!) and get my stuff.   Thanks.

I wonder if anyone out there has any experiences in old radios and how to get them working again?  It's an old swedish model, I found information about it on this site: http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/luxor_r192b.html  I found it at my grandfather's summer house and wonder if there are any way of getting it to work?  As of now I believe the only thing missing are the two batteries.  Pictures: http://imgur.com/zhXj35a,WbkUF68  Thanks in advance.   Of course it's not going to be even. Not on elite levels where physical strength is going to be vital.   But a fucking high school match game? In that skill level there are lots of girls that could play the shit out of boys in soccer.    It's so simple. Ask the two girls: "Do you WANT to play against the boys?"  If the answer is yes. Then what's the fucking problem? It would be disrespectful not to play against them in this case.  If the answer is no, you respect them by not playing.   There sure were vikings in Sweden as well. My home town of about 50 people is said to have been the seat of one called "Hagwulf". And is still named Hagwulfsroom. With places around it called "burg hill" and "raven hill".  But most of the vikings known to have raided west were danes and norwegians since they were on the west side of the strait.   How could they not give her community service?    He's so fucking mean. I frickin' love him. If you don't appreciate the humor of him or Rudy. You will definitely hate the show. Also the London suburb accent and slang is awesome.   Yeah, he can convince voters himself. It didn't take long for me to get really interested in what he had to say. And his background and voting history reaching back to the 90's is just outstanding.   And a lot of them has donated money to "The Clinton Foundation"..   Jamies pulls off a glorious escape while Bronn does something heroic and die, dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice.   I think he's feeling even more Hurt now. If possible.. http://imgur.com/BpHmj8T   I believe he's gonna visit every state.   Nazi Zombies - Ammo cheat. There's your infinite slamfire.    Blah. Blah.

And after two hours of building and refining this is the first version that I was able to land with, without experiencing a rapid unscheduled disassembly.  I wanted to share it and I hope it inspire someone to make a better version. I'm a rookie when it comes to replicas and building stuff for fun in KSP and I know there are really talented engineers out there.    **INFERNAL ROBOTICS** is used to rotate the engines on the wings.

"It's too expensive to turn away from fossil fuels"....   Also it kills White Walkers.   The system and the economy as it is makes 99+ % of the new income go to the top wealthiest 1% of the people.  Bernie want's to raise taxes for the very rich to get funding to pay for the new infrastructure that could generate more than 10 million jobs.  As well as pay for college and healthcare.   It really is. This studio version has a translation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_UagTUwAt4  I think Miss Li is crying because she is moved by the lyrics, and also the participation of the audience that is breathtaking at Lars's concerts.   Same here. And later from 10k to about 6.   I'm sure he doesn't want to affect ordinary people with this. Have to ask him what transactions are gonna be taxed. Because I'm fairly certain only big wall street firms are the targets.     It's a 0.01 tax. It's not gonna amount to much if you don't trade in hundreds of thousands. Millions of dollars.    Yeah. 0.01 tax on sales will be a huge blow....   Yes. For the people. How will 0.5% tax on big Wall Street taxation affect you?  You will get free college education. That's how you will get affected.    Maybe because some Americans believe college tuition can be nearly "free" as in a lot of other major countries?    The money in politics.    It is your privilege in a representative democracy. If you don't vote you don't care.    He hasn't taken money from corporations or millionaires/billionaires. EVER.   And his voting record speaks for itself. He votes and introduces legislations that align with what he says.    Join in at /r/SandersForPresident    He voted against it from the start.    Someone got berned.    Alright. Interesting. Do you think he would name Warren, or is there someone else I do not know about?  In any case I think Warren will run for POTUS in 2020. And if Bernie doesn't reach all the way she can pick up the momentum his campaign is sure to get.   Swedish dude here, and I feel the same. The integrity of this man resonance across the Atlantic. I hope Swedish media will begin reporting on his politics when the debates start.   Kul med en annan svensk som tagit upp intresse fr amerikansk politik i och med Sanders.  I'd say he lines up good with the swedish Center and the Environmental Party. The American right wing is so far right we can't even see it on the political spectrum in Sweden.  Although Sanders is fighting to introduce legislations and systems that has been in place in Sweden for many, many years (public healthcare payed for by everyone through taxes, and free education tuitions)    I am pretty out of touch with American politics, but Elizabeth Warren and Bernie is on the same page more often than not.  If Bernie becomes POTUS Warren is most likely to become VP imo.   This is one of the reasons Sen. Bernard Sanders is running for president. Billionaires think they can do whatever they want.   That's the spirit..   Hopefully a loss against Hillary in the primaries will have paved enough way for Warren to run next term with a steadier ground to stand on.   No reason. But what we want is exposure and awareness. And we're not getting it from the media.   bern*   "They'll burn you alive"  "Bad way to go"   There should be more focus on his voting record, and practical results of those laws. The facts speak for themselves.    Then you should register as a democrat in the primary and vote for him so that he can get a chance to make it to the election!   If we had listened to Sanders, we might have avoided the economic crisis. Fat chance to see that headline in mainstream media?      Are we getting word out about this on other forums and subreddits and not just here on /r/sandersforpresident?      Do you think Sweden, Norway and Germany has good healthcare? They do. And that's because it's government funded and therefor directly payed by all the people in that country.  How can you say that doesn't work?    In Sweden the largest (as of 2014) political party is "The Social Democrats".  Social Democrat is a better word for the politics we adopt in contrast to the pure marxist socialism which we are not about.   To the top you go. That last bit should be the campaign slogan. He votes like he talks. And he introduces proposals to make things better.    For once abolish Citizen United which basically gives billionairs the right to donate hundreds of millions of dollars into the election process pretty much buying candidates. That is called Oligarchy. Look it up.  We are gonna have Hunger Games if this continue long enough..    I think Bernie need big names with recognizable faces to reach certain kind of people.   I have had the same thought about Elon Musk. I feel he is pretty neutral when it comes to politics though. And all his money are locked in Tesla and SpaceX   Nasa, and private space companies who are their contractors.    In the big AMA of I hope. It's got 8 million subscribers..   Should we get together and come up with some good questions?    John Oliver should take a look at him That would get more young people aware.   Sweden's biggest political party (might have gone down since the election in 2014) is called  Socialdemokraterna or "The Social Democrats".  That could be tied in with his talk of Scandinavia as an example. Also a question: What do "I note the abscence of a qourum" mean?   I sent a Swedish translation. Go Bernie.   Nice thanks..  Oh, so 150 million total makes almost 75 million who doesn't vote. I think voters was 56% or something.   Only 52% of americans vote. If he could reach hefty sum of 150 million potencial voters it would be a grand slam.  Why don't more people vote by the way?   Why don't young people vote? In Sweden 2014 85,8% went to vote.  I see now only 54% voted in America.. :(      He's running for the democrats though?   He's independent. Running for the democrats because running as independent is basically impossible.

Oh, and I wouldn't call Brown Dwarves failed stars. I would call them extremely successful planets.   Before french troops found the "Rosetta Stone" in 1799 we couldn't read egyptian hieroglyphs.  I'm a layman but I'm fairly certain there are a lot of other lost languages.   Every answer on this sub should look like yours.   Yes it's possible. There are a lot of rogue planets out there, some have formed separately and some have been flung out of their parental solar systems.   No. They don't weigh the same. No need for more explanation.   The faster it grows, the more carbon it uses.   No they don't. The atmosphere is incredibly thick and the transition between gas and liquid are slow and the change is gradual the further down you go. Most gas giants probably have a solid core though.   If you're interested in this stuff, and the universe as a whole I can highly recommend you taking 10 hours to watch [Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395695/?ref_=nv_sr_1).  And I'm fairly certain others will agree.   Interesting thought. I'm fairly certain feelings for the sexual partner weighs in somewhere.   Living on the sun compared to living in empty space with no stellar bodies "nearby" would result in 66.4 seconds difference per year if I interpret Schwarzschild metric correctly.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.   Generally species that produces a lot of offsprings at once does not care about them as much as those who produces fewer does. For natural reason.   Robb married her because he was naive. He was so obviously seduced by the Westerlings and tricked into marrying Jeyne. After which Tywin is completely certain she will not bear a child because her mother is giving her moon tea in secret.  I don't think Jeyne was aware of this and her love for Robb was probably genuine.   No one knows when it's gonna be released. Especially not Amazon.   Is there any way of watching the Sky Atlantic interviews in there when you live outside of UK?   Yeah. The argument is empty anyway. Those who circumcise do not do it because it's more hygienic. They use that argument to hide the real reason. Which is religion. And aesthetics.... Female circumcision is foreign for me. It is complete baloney.   It's not my blog. I just ran into it and thought the amount of debates was shocking.   I'm not american, that may be relevant to know. But Sweden had a 2 hour long debate tonight with all 8 party leaders. I think it shows a lot when some politicians try to answer the questions with a straight face and some will always try to steer the discussion in another direction. Debates and interviews in the states often results in party leaders making a joke when asked a serious question.   N/A doesn't mean that there were no debate. It means they didn't have a number for that.   Wow! That's awesome! I really like the style!  some critique is healthy though and I thought about two things. The horse was the only thing I noticed that wasn't great in the artistic side.   And the dialogue wasn't spot on. Try to make it sound more like speech. People doesn't speak with perfect grammar. Especially not when there's a dragon nearby.  I wanna read the next part though!  	105
 Agreed, but I think using the word 'curvy' sounds a lot nicer than 'obese'. It would be nice if everyone used curvy to describe actual body shape instead of being overweight, but it seems it's the go-to descriptor.   This reads like a Dr Suess book.

 Eyes opened.     To be fair, his wife was a tech in meth lab.  So the entire thing is likely illegal.     To be fair he was some kind of genius that previously had a meltdown and punched the president and had failed relationships in the past.   Between that and and and the the the stuttering at his pops I don't know what else would qualify him to learn computer hacking.      You should see what happens when he plays CoD with his mouse set to 10.   Pppffff as if Data is remotely coherent with his emotion and long hair chip activated.   It's a hair difficult to get to the door though....   ALL CAPS OR IT DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH!!!   Solid answer   It may have been already scheduled.  Wait until the backlog runs out.   That never stopped him.   That was a logical speculation on my part as to why they didn't try harder.

It feels like a 14 year old girl with PMS is CEO here.         what?  Did you read his post?  He wasn't going into all that...   He was speaking specifically, on their decision process of which model, out of all the ones they tried, to use.   The model they used was most scientifically accurate when compared to all the others they used. It likely had more to do with the capability of their hardware.  They didn't use super computers, like the one's scientists use, to make the fucking movie.      He didn't say it was the most scientifically accurate that the scientific community is capable of producing.      as a diver the lensing is the least difficult thing for me to understand.  Same stuff happens under water, near large objects, as the water bends around them.  An object behind can look misshaped or closer/farther....     there will be nothing left.     The fact these are gone makes me really sad.    How long until a supernova reaches earth and makes us disappear?    It's gonna be shitty when the alpha centauri decides to shit the bed/     That's a pretty fucked up looking tip.  And why is the shaft larger than the tip?    Well /u/negaduke is entiled to his opinion.  Even if it's MOSTLY wrong.  Was I obnoxious?  Sure.  was I "SUPER" obnxious.  No.    I was slightly obnoxios towards what was bitching over a situation the OP creates on his own.     Whatever.  This really isn't important.   Lol   Ur so angry   calm down.    Edit: you also said not to take things literally whilst taking what I said literally.    That's twice you're contradicting yourself.   .   Now you're just grasping at straws.   A first world problem still denotes it is a problem of that world... the first world.  Don't be mad because your original statement was  contradictory and I called you on it.   It's okay if you're doing stupid things... when someone points it out to you, you just fix it.     Calm down.  Wow.   True.  But gotta take into account that the Costner Hood came out during an economic boom and with a popular song.  Crowe hood came out during a fierce recession and with no popular songs attached.   Well if you're talking about a specific game, wouldn't you already know the range?  And if not asking about a specific game, why are you asking such a generalized question you know doesn't have a single answer to?   Sounds like it's your problem and not a world problem.        It's the difference between a single unit that changes.  On a scale 1-10 the differences between, say 8 and 9, is more huge than between 16 and 17.    You're just spreading out the percentage more.        It only works if it's set to 10 and you also have a high dpi gaming mouse with a huge polling speed.    Otherwise.... you're just a sloppy retard set to 10.   I had no plans on seeing it until I read your post here....    Incorrect.  But agree to disagree.      It's pretty clear to me that no one presented him with a warrant first....therefore he had no reason to believe his life wasn't in danger... and we do have the right to life.     It is your right to refuse entry, if not presented with a warrant first, though.....   It's also a right to be free from illegal search or seizure.   He was not openly presented with a warrant prior to their entry.   So... there's that.   Corporate bought dem is the same as a corporate bought republican.    What?  This gets said in like every single thread about Pao and reddit.   https://www.change.org/p/alexis-ohanian-to-step-down-from-reddit-board-and-administration-fire-alexis-ohanian   It's easy to get your posts to the top when there aren't any others.   I think that sort of deception is a bit harder since you have to float above the other sea of users now.   Unless they have some sort of automatic karma system that can add 5000 up votes or whatever.     Who's to know if /u/______DEADPOOL______ isnt Pao's shadow account.

Why is it taking so long for the trees to grow back?  In Washington our trees were back withing 5 to 10 years.  You can't even tell there was a fire there now.   Read the comments.  It's rich.   The problem with fixing congress is the lack of available candidates.  That coupled with gerrymandering means that fixing congress will take more than a couple of voting cycles.  Bernie is gonna need our help because congress will stonewall him for sure.     People can't just vote him into office and then walk away like they did Obama.    Pretty disappointing honestly, that Kevin Costner make a better Robin Hood movie.  This made me laugh in a manner that was more like a duck.... than anything.      We dodged a bullet on that one.  Boston Oregon doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely as Portland Oregon.   Boston Oregon feels like a donut truck exploded.     Edit.... errrmmm just noticed I made a boston and exploded joke..... to remove or not.  Hmmmm I think I'll leave it and wait for the fallout 4.      If I play scary music and look at this picture, the cat appears utterly terrified.      Well I'm gonna upvote YOUR bad attitude!     As a teen male, I would have missed the important message about drugs, and just skipped straight to the ass to ass scene; where I would have then masturbated to it and not have felt ashamed afterwards.     If I try to do that now, I feel bad until about 4:15 in the afternoon or so....     The point was that an analogy wasn't needed.  He already struck to the heart of the matter with a perfectly sound argument.      Stick a post it to your monitor that says "Brevity is the soul of wit".  Written by some dead smart dude... who wrote extremely long and boring plays.     That blue arrow is a real bitch.      No no.  What I'm saying is. Your argument was needle sharp.  Until you went with this dumb analogy.   You couldn't have made your point any sharper than you already had.   Anything else just dulled the delivery of a statement that really struck to the heart of the matter.        Fixing it, would be to just stop talking after the opening 1 or 2 sentences that expressed the point perfectly.     Is it the I-gave-up-on-the-british-accent-halfway-through-filming Kevin Costner Robin Hood, or is it Im-gonna-kill-myself-this-is-so-boring Russel Crowe Robin Hood?   I agree it was stealing.  And you argued the point well... until it was ruined by your cab driver analogy; which is where you lost me.     I'm just going to start downvoting this fucking quote, each time I see it.      In lollipop some devices will not fast charge while on.    If you have this bug, what happens when you plug the device in and then reboot?   For me it makes it work again whilst the phone is on.   But only if it's plugged in during the full restart.  Hotboot does not work only full reboot.    If you have this bug can you try rebooting with it plugged in and report if it works?  Also which model and rom are you using? (or if you're just stock)...   Thanks guys.  Edit: oh yeah and if you're running a custom kernel let me know that too. ;-)   Yeah, but they don't just shoot once and then leave if there is still killing to be done.   Good luck to him if he has a locked down USA phone.   Especially verizon... I don't even think they have root yet.     Just say no to locked carrier phones.   You get jammed into a 2 year contract and you can't take your phone with you or change it how you please.... so you pay for a phone you don't REALLY own.    Fuck that shit... plenty of third party sellers have financing options... and there's always buy now pay later with paypal.  Hell, even putting the phone on a credit card is cheaper than getting jammed into a 2 year contract and having a phone you don't own.  If you can't pull off financing because your credit is maxed or bad... then you don't need to be buying premium phones and instead paying down your debt.    If root and recovery is never achieved, the carrier and the bloatware companies continue to make money off your device even after it's fully paid and they've made back their "subsidized" loss.      Wow... gross dead sea turtle and I STILL wanna touch that guy's body.  Is he the lifeguard?   Time to go break up some marriages.       SEE!  If they wore a full burka then the acid would only get into their eyes.  So serves them right for not listening to the rules.      obligatory /s for all the complete morons.     [Now stick your dick in it; just like Dwight Emburger!](http://oddnews.co/2014/04/07/copycat-american-pie-perv-burnt/)    Our entire country is broken right now.   I'm done talking about that other stuff.  I can't really handle it because I get so mad at all the bullshit.   We can't even be honest with ourselves what the REAL numbers are.  And everyone wonders why it's all screwed up.     It is the 5th now where I am located.  This will be the 2nd 4th of July in a row that I miss out on.  Enjoy the good food and the fireworks.       No... we took those tax cuts away.    [And no the REAL unemployment rate is not 5.3%... its closer to 14%.  Because it doesn't take into account people that have accepted part time work or given up looking for work completely.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/07/05/why-the-real-unemployment-rate-is-higher-than-you-think/)    So the corporations lost their Bush Tax cuts... which didn't really matter because loopholes have them paying 0 taxes.     So they continued to enjoy a virtually tax free existance and continued to get tax money paid TO them...  All that time unemployment as been so bad for so long that the way they calculate the numbers makes it appear unemployment is going down...   But it is not.  So the trickle down economists, the GOP, most the dems, and ANY corporate backed SuperPAC candidate can kiss my ass.      This is all I have to say on this topic.   Have a nice day.   We let the chinese build one tiny island, in waters that belong to them, and look what happens.    Dead turtles.   Hope you're happy.    Edit: /s    for the idiots.   Only a naive fool would think our employment problems, after the financial collapse, has anything to do with immigration.  Especially whilst corporations are experiencing record breaking profits and enjoying a loophole tax free+tax subsidized existence.    They didn't use any of the corporate welfare we gave them to hire more people and increase wages... as they led us to believe would happen.       Thank you for your period but what's the point?      That was excessively verbose.  How's that right click+thesaurus working out for you?   Have you found that reddit readers are receptive to uncommon vocabulary usage?      I appreciate what you're trying to say here, and my fuck you're brain is massive and covered in diamond gold.       Bad for everyone.  If there's so much money that your money is worthless, how could that possibly be a good thing?   "Oh... dollars.   I've got a huge pile already.... just stick your pallet in with the others and enjoy your gum.  Thank you for shopping."      and???   you get those newsmax emails too huh?   Edit:autoincorrect and additional thought.   They aren't deciding anything.  They don't say "unemployment should be 5%" and then boom we get that.     They just make an assessment on what the economy can handle.  Believe it or not, if we had 100 percent employment that would be bad.  Too much employment causes the economy to heat up too fast.  Thus you have massive inflation because there's too much money so it's worthless.      It was under Bush but it is both democrats and republicans together that did that.      uhhh yeah... that's why.  /s    She's always on defense at this point.     That's not a campaign you can win.     Edit: Hillary is running her campaign like it was a congressional inquiry.      Sorry, we already gave your money to massive corporations in the form of free tax subsidies they don't need.     It means people get all riled up over the national debt thinking it matters in the same way your credit card debt does.    What matters more is revenue generation.  Which we are more than capable of providing.   The national debt DOES matter.  Just not in the way republican voters are taught that it does.      We're all in this together. I don't give a shit what party someone is in... we've gotta protect the power of the people.      No, I think they are acutely aware of the white-collar job sector and how the world functions.    The problem is that they desperately wanted to believe that reddit was a bastion outside of that world.

My fuck it's TGIF on television and today is all the "remember when" episodes......  edit:extra comma   Quarantine was mandatory in the sense that it was apart if the program's protocols.      Mandatory does not mean forced.     In medicine, quarantine means the patient is placed within a controlled environment.   It doesn't mean the patient is imprisoned and punished.  Quarantine can be for a number of safety reasons, but can also can be to maximize effectiveness of treatment.   Quarantine has nothing to do with with the practices you see in movies and television.       But to you, you ignorantly think it is imprisonment and punishment.    Lets be clear; the AIDS victims knew that quarantine was apart of the program.   If they didn't want to participate in the government funded program, they had the freedom to seek treatment options on their own.   But who would do that when a program exists that is free and hugely successful?     So, the informed individual walks into the government clinic, to avail of the free internationally participated medical program, that includes quarantine as a mandatory part of it's protocol.     There were no guns... and no guns had ever planned on being used. Quarantine was mandatory for those who wished to be apart of the program.  It was not mandatory that every AIDS victim reports for quarantine.  The program was benefitting people so naturally they had a high, probably near 100 percent, participation rate.  Who would pass up a comfortable stay with free food, medicine, counseling, education, and other services???   Only a fool.    But Cuba means violent oppression and quarantine means forced by men with guns!   I'm embarrassed for you.... i really am.     I don't know how many times it can be said that no one was forced, or is going to be forced,  and at no time were guns ever considered to included in this treatment program.  "Men with guns" is just irrational, doesn't exist, made up, "it could happen" nonsense that was fueled by ignorance and acceptance of propaganda.   But dude dude..... Cuba HAS TO=North Korea because Communism!   LOL.   Ugh.  He tells his story likes it's a PG-13 horror.   I hope this isn't what becomes your big break... Hopefully it's something better.

 If you include the separate category for female-on-male rape ("made to penetrate") then there were 5 times as many reported male rapes (over 8%).  Is it actually made explicit in the report whether "made to penetrate" is synonymous with 'female perpetrator' or is that your interpretation?  I'm asking since I can easily imagine both men and women raping men by forcing them to penetrate.   I liked E for long stretches of time, who I really hated on that show was Vince when he was coked up. Douche.   Got it in one. I'm Swiss!   The Van is labelled in German though.   Nice, let's get matching tattoos!  Apparently we're either super perceptive or overly suspicious. Time will tell.   So.. uh.. Am I the only one who thinks the font on the sign looks like it was photoshopped?   What???  Okay, I get that the N-word was yelled when a large part of the citizens of Duluth, MN came together and lynched three innocent black kids (and then sold [post cards](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg/300px-Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg) of the event) less than a century ago, but I was called a "fuck-up cracker" once in a traffic jam and it deeply scarred me.   I mean, those kids are dead, but I still have to live with the knowledge that I was called a pejorative name that evolved from my ancestors' slicing open the slaves' backs with whips? For Shame!   Dan mentioned Jung revisiting his youth as an adult to unpack and understand it better. Can anyone explain a bit more? What were some of his findings and what were his impressions of the experience?  This is an area of Jung I'm not too knowledgeable about, keep that in mind while I give it a shot.   Re-creating childhood memories was a strategy that C.G. Jung employed to deal with his own mid-life crisis. The whole thing started in his late thirties - a  tumultuous time for the Swiss psychiatrist, amongst other things he had just severed his connection to his erstwhile mentor Sigmund Freud (apparently not very amicably...) and he fell into a deep depression.  Now, and don't quote me on this, I think I remember reading somewhere that the whole "recreating childhood" thing started after he had a dream about his childhood play. Jung, always ready to lend significance to dreams, started to play with sand and sticks at a park on the shores of lake Zurich (about 2 miles from where I grew up, actually) on his lunch break, trying to recreate his childhood experience.   Apparently that hunting for the archetypical symbols of his childhood prompted a period of very vivid dreams where he dreamt of mythological figures who advised him on how to move forward with his life. I think he later classified that episode of his life as psychotic, but he also said that it helped him deal with his midlife crisis.   He wrote his experiences down and, over time, other therapists picked up on the idea - it's a form of therapy that is still being practiced today - I think it's called Jungian Sandplay Therapy or something like that.  This episode stands out as somewhat of an oddity in Jung's work - not the fact that it's about adults digging in sand, but rather that it's about reaching back to move forward, which is more of a Freudian approach.   In general, and I'm vastly oversimplifying a complex research field here, in the rest of his body of work, Jung wasn't about looking at the past so much.   Freud and Jung are the two most influential scholars in the field of Psychoanalysis. Freud was of the opinion that many of the conflicts people face as adults can be explained and or fixed by looking at their childhood. He though it was all about looking back.  Jung, on the other hand, looked at those same conflicts and thought they stemmed from an inability or unwillingness to reconcile with death. He was more about looking forward.  On a side note, it's not surprising that Dan likes Jung - he's a fervent Campbellian, and Joseph Campbell's Hero Journey is, for the most part, an extension of Jung's archetypes.  I like the idea of someone posting a weekly discussion thread for some of the more thought-provoking ideas that come up during the show. I say just give it a whirl and see whether people respond to it. I'll be sure to chime in if I have anything to say about that week's discussion!   Granted.   OP did say though that he had a full beer in front of him when she left, and yet he caught up with her before she could reach her room which sounds to me like he made an effort to approach her again... However, I recognize that all of this is pure speculation.  What isn't speculation is that his second approach made OP uncomfortable and that the hotel clerks found his behaviour marked enough to check in with OP.   Following the woman up to her room after you've already said your goodbyes at the bar doesn't strike me as a particularly good thing. It's misguided at best, creepy at worst.  If by the "good thing" he did you mean that that he didn't try to force her into anything after being rejected, then your bar for goodness is pretty darn low. I'd call that the basest of human decencies.   Regarding "OP is a scumbag wife": OP made it obvious that they're both married. So him trying to get some strange isn't scummy?  As for a partner having drinks with a stranger of the opposite sex, I guess that comes down to what you and your partner have agreed to. I've never found it troubling in my relationships, but I can understand why some couples put it on the "No-No" list.       The point wasn't that he got her drunk, but *that he followed her up to her room* when she left, which, understandably, made her uncomfortable.  Naturally this doesn't make him a rapist, it seems from OP's story that he took the rejection and went away. But she felt creeped out by the episode and she has a right to be. What's awesome about this story is that the hotel employees picked up on him following her and that they then made sure she was okay.   I know that, what I mean is that the caveats OP laid about his pictures carry no legal weight on their own.  You know, much in the same way as writing ALL COPYRIGHT BELONG TO SONY PICTURES in the info section of a video you have ripped from a TV show and uploaded to youtube doesn't protect you from legal ramifications.      I said very clearly, that redistributing or altering in any way is forbidden, unless I have given permission and they credit me as original artist  I don't think that's legally binding, sorry to say. Even as the original artist you don't get to say what is and isn't illegal in regards to the use of your picture.  I do hope you get credited though, OP!  	13

 I think "convertation" is bad. There is no real need for it. It is same as some fitness, vegetarion or religious people try to convert you. Something you use and is good for your purposes dont mean it is good for others. People who try to "turn" people to something are just fundamentals.

Lisksi yleens henkilill on omaan tyhns liittyvt oikeudet jotka poliisin ja puolustusvoimien tapauksissa voivat olla hyvinkin arkaluontoisia. Toisaalta tm nyt ei varmastikkaan ole oikea paikka keskustella koko aiheesta.

Check out the new sub at [r/chicagopickupsoccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagopickupsoccer/) we should have the next game posted there.    We played small-sided 3 v. 3 at Wrightwood Park. A good time, but a bigger group next time would be great.    Hey can you add this to [This Thread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/2cuasb/pickup_soccer_innear_lincoln_park_meetup_is/)  A number of us from r/chicago met up at Wrightwood Park this morning to play some small sided games. We'd like for you to join us in the near future.   u/TraptInaCommentFctry was the guy who organized today, and we'll be looking to get a bigger group together for the next one.    It's really hard for me to hate Fleury; in fact, it was really hard to get excited about the Hawks in the early 2000s. Like the writer of the blog, I was watching the Wolves win Turner Cups and Calder Cups during this era, and learning that Fleury was coming to the Hawks was exciting. True, he didn't perform; he was out of shape and on a bad team, not to mention that he was suicidal during his stay in Chicago. When the team is only good enough to win 30 games in a season, guys like Fleury, Sullivan, and heck even Kyle Calder provided rare bright spots in a dreary season.  Funny enough, I actually found an autographed copy of his book "Playing with Fire" in a used bookstore last night. The chapter on Chicago gives a great perspective on his performance here. I was laughing in the bookstore after reading Brian Sutter's quote. "Theo, you're in fucking horrible shape."     [What's that now?

My observation from this year was he was trying to mix it up with at smaller Andrew Shaw (5'10"/180) any chance he had, while he avoided Bollig like the plague until Bollig finally grabbed a hold of him at the end of the season.   Belak and Probert both left this word far too prematurely as well.    Unless you consider his habit of fighting guys smaller than him, and losing most fights an "enforcer." Seriously, watched this guy with the Chicago Wolves (AHL) years ago; he lost every fight.   However, [loved the fight with Shaw this winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-SRugYRRV0); and I gained an inkling of respect for him for [his fight with Bollig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4k_JEa8IGQ)   The [Blood Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_eagle) form of execution has to be pretty terrible.

Thank God I'm back in Chicago where people distrust politicians enough to not wear their political views on their sleeves.   As you probably know, DC is EXPENSIVE! Here you will never pay $4.35 for a damn train ride one way within the city. I'm not sure what neighborhood you live in, but the wife and I made more than $90k per year in DC and we had a mediocre 1BR apartment on the west end of Alexandria, VA for $1300/mo... and literally DIRT for a front lawn. Here, you will get a lot more for your money if you're a renter. No it isn't cheap (sales tax..ahhhh), but by DC standards it would be a breath of fresh air.   Now here are my biased opinions:   -Chicago Art Institute  National Gallery of Art/ *any* Smithsonian Museum  -Museum of Science and Industry  Smithsonian Space whatever-the-hell-it's-called museum   -Chicago lake front  National Mall  -Chicago hot dog  DC-3 (which has some damn good hot dogs)  -Deep dish pizza  $60 sushi roll or whatever people go out and eat in DC  -Mariano's   Jewel-Osco  Giant or Harris Teeter  -Chicago's grid system of roads  Than the 6 miles of traffic circles on Mass Ave that will take you 1.5 hours to drive down.  -Bears   Blackhawks  Racist Redskins or creatively named "Caps"  -Chinatown = Chinatown, but Chicago also has Korea town + Argyle Street (mini- SE Asia)... Get into Vietnamese subs!  -Wicker Park  H Street   -Have to say I haven't experienced much of the Pride celebration here in Chicago (always avoided the huge crowds), but DC Pride was pretty huge, my guess is that it stacks up.   In summary, you'll find what you're looking for here in Chicago. Move here if you can get a solid job lined up!

At least my observation is that a majority of the *dirty hits* that we've come to know (mainly the ones involving a guy on a stretcher) are coming in a post 2005 NHL.   Not to say that the 80s game wasn't full of dirty plays, just on a different level.    Instant. Classic.   DUNC! What a game!!! We're going right down to the wire.

Think you're right, but I do like the Morin suggestion; feel like he could be the sparkplug needed to get a quick goal or help set the climate for hard forechecking early on.    3 assists in the first 12 minutes. I would say he showed up; going to need Kane to keep razzling and dazzling for the next 170 minutes of the series.    Weighing in at 3500 lbs. and marketed as a "safe vehicle" (SV), I remember reading about it in "Automotive Atrocities" as a kid; also, just discovered that it is on *Time*'s  "50 Worst Cars of All Time"... but ya know, I can appreciate this lime green beast.        Have to go with the green alligator.    "The Unsolved Crime" is just downright impressive.  	61
 That's cool... I was obsessed with mine when last year I tried to grow long hair... no haircut for 8 months... Finally cut it in this Feb.. Now am trying to grow longer than last year...   It's not my favourite of all the 7 books but it is one of the first HP books I picked up in my reading life... I EXTREMELY enjoyed reading *Order of the Phoenix* and can never forget the feel I got everytime I saw that cover page when the book was waiting on my table for me.   In your flair.. "Enemies of the hair, Beware" is that a spelling mistake?? Did you mean "heir"?? Just asking.   Yeah me too..   There is only a fine line that separates confidence from over-confidence, and Dumbledore, irrespective of his magnificent magical ablities, never crossed that line for a show-off. He's an epitome of humility.    calling him "Tom" and generally not giving a fuck.   Dumbledore all along!    If there's one thing that struck me hard in the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort was with how much confidence Dumbledore entered the fight.  I just *love* it when somebody praises my favourite character.   If only I could announce 50 points to OP for this post.   this quote stinks!         Thank you for the great book names...    Earth Day special...   This one sentence can stand as an inspiration to those who are looking out for justifying their creative and artistic desires.   [Bombay is a big city in India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai)   Let's talk about the books that glorify the life of earth, its nature, its children and its unending wonders..  The books that made me realize the worth and wonder of earth are undoubtedly   * Henry David Thoreau's *Walden* and  * Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay called *Nature.*   Those two works are some of the best things I've ever read about nature.   After I read them, I truly felt the wonder of being a part of such a miraculous thing called the Mother Earth.  Please share here your favourite Earth Day reads and how they made you realize the magic of living here...   Thank you all, and have a magical day today :) :)   Goodreads is fine. Not an unliveable-without, though.    Please differentiate between TED and TEDx  Sorry about that. Will keep in mind next time. Thanks.      deep and strong...    That said, there's a huge benefit in being able to see your ideas written out in front of you in your own handwriting.   Exactly. That's what I meant when I said it was a good idea.   Hey that's a pretty good way to start up with the idea exploration stuff.. It puts a structure in your mind, thus eliminating all the time that we consume in hovering over the thoughts of where to go next..   *Organizing* - a really cool tip to write faster. Thanks :)   beautifully deep!!   sounds interesting... shall check it out..   It has already been on my reading list for this year.. Thanks for the mention :)    On the Road by Jack Kerouac  Heard a lot about this one... Will read it soon!    I found the first-person perspective gave a fascinating insight into the main character's mind as his situation worsened.  Stephen King rocks at such stuff... Thanks. I will pick it up..    oh that's a very good advice.. thanks :)   I recently read Herman Hesse's *Steppenwolf* and I was held all along by the inner voice of the protagonist. Also, Stephen King's *Hearts In Atlantis* has three different characters narrating different stories in the three novellas along the book.  What are some of your favourite books with great first person narratives??   by Max Brooks, right??      *Angels and Demons* by Dan Brown.    A bit embarrassingly  There is nothing embarrassing about keeping the child in you alive...    Stories have shaped up my life and made me what I'm today (I'm an aspiring novelist from India). I felt indebted to all those books that had shown me my true purpose in life. So, I decided to bring in such a change in the lives of many young children out there. I'm collecting the ideas to incorporate in my venture with books. My primary focus is in expanding children's reach into books, thus bringing in imagination and creativity into their lives.   Please share any other ideas that you think would be great for them to shape their fate with the help of books.  Thank you so much :)   WATCH THIS FILM BRO: [BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaag_Milkha_Bhaag)  [HERE IS ITS AWESOME TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY3qfhYPJSI)  IT'S A TRUE FUCKING STORY OF A LEGENDARY RUNNER FROM INDIA (ALSO AN OLYMPIAN). TO GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE OF THE FILM I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE HERE MY FAVOURITE SCENE:   *OPPOSITE TEAM'S COACH*: **"THIS MIGHT PROBABLY BE YOUR LIFE'S LAST RACE"**  *MILKHA SINGH*: **"I WILL RUN AS IF IT IS"**   MAKE SURE ONE CHALLENGES YOUR FUCKING BODY AND THE OTHER YOUR FUCKING MIND.  THIS MOTHERFUCKER IS ONE GODDAMN JEWEL OF AN ADVICE.      Thanks.. but that's not a grass field.. it's a pond filled with some water plants.       Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell      *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* introduced me to Neil Gaiman, But I was firstly fascinated by his Tumblr advices and his talks prior to my reading his book. He's awesome!      very cool collection.... especially Harry Potter.. huge fan..    0 down vote favorite    I've a csv file with multiple columns. I'm considering only two of them, 'Time' and 'RiseOrFall'. Both are of Factor datatype. Sample data looks like:      Time RiseOrFall       12   32     34   0       56   0     78   25     90   29     123  0     567  50  I'm trying to create a line chart in R that falls everytime 'RiseOrFall' hits 0 and rises when it's not 0. ('Time' on x-axis and 'RiseOrFall' on Y-axis)  I tried:  countFile - read.csv(file = "counts.csv", nrows = 1000)[, c ('TIME','TRPM')]  ggplot(data=countFile, aes(x=TRPM)) + geom_line()  How can this be achieved in R (possibly using ggplot2 or anything)??   I just read your comment in Gatsby's (Leonardo DiCaprio) voice :)   NOW THAT I'VE ADVISED YOU IN MY PREVIOUS COMMENT ON HOW TO WAKE UP EARLY, NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING HUGELY IMPORTANT. THNKING THAT WAKING UP EARLY WILL INSTANTLY SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS IS A GODDAMN MISFUCKINGCONCEPTION.. WAKING UP EARLY IS SURELY A GOOD THING NO DOUBT, HOWEVER IT CAN ALSO END UP GIVING YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE TIME TO DO UNPRODUCTIVE TASKS.. SO BE WARNED WHEN YOU WAKE UP AT 4AM ONE MORNING AND FIND YOURSELF DOING THE BEST PROCRASTIANTION EVER IN YOUR LIFE.. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GOTTA KEEP IN MIND.   BUT NO WORRIES THERE. I'VE GOT A SOLUTION FOR THAT AS WELL. WHEN YOU DECIDE TO WAKE UP EARLY, TAKE A NOTEBOOK THE BEFORE DAY NIGHT AND WRITE UP IN THERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THE WHOLE OF NEXT DAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOUR VALUABLE TIME IN THE MORNING FROM GETTING LOST IN THE THOUGHTS OF THINKING WHAT TO DO.  TRY THIS AND SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH OUR OTHER BROTHERS IN THE SUB IF YOU LIKE TO.  GOOD LUCK!   THERE IS ONE SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR WAKING UP EARLY.. DRINK LOTS OF WATER AT NIGHT JUST BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. THEN NOTHING FROM HEAVEN AND EARTH CAN STOP YOU FROM WAKING UP AND RUNNING TO THE BATHROOM. AND WHEN YOU DO, WHEN YOU FINISH PEEING, SPLASH SOME WATER ON YOUR FACE, ALSO BRUSH YOUR FUCKING TEETH RIGHT AWAY... AND TA DA.. **YOU WILL BE WIDE AWAKE AS FUCK!!**   great...      I love paradoxes!   Let me explain in detail why I had to come up with this post. I recently observed a pattern in my reading. I tend to read fantasy and fairy tale related books in rainy season.. I get a vague feeling inside my heart when it is cloudy or raining.. My mind immediately starts to pick the thoughts of magical realms, dark forests, curses and other fantastical stuff.   I'm not exactly sure about all of this but I guess I know when did all of this start in my life. I'm an aspiring writer. In 2013, when I was a computer science student, I faced some health issues and had to travel back home from my university. It was a journey of 2 days and all that time I was sitting beside a glass window in an AC coach, and was peering out of it. It had been raining most of the journey and so the surroundings outside were drenched, and the greenery that resulted was dark and deeply scenic. Slowly my mind started to think back into a few years and I remembered a favourite fantasy movie of mine: *Pan's Labyrinth.* The film was adorned in fantastic visuals and colour. And now the things I was looking at out of the train window were at par with those that I saw in the film. I felt  abruptly different. My mind started to wander into myriad impossible realms. I just enjoyed the feeling while it lasted.  After I reached home I was prescribed to rest for a couple of weeks until to grow hale and healthy again. So, during that time I picked some books from my shelf, one is *Words from the Myths* by Isaac Asimov, it is full of Greek and Roman mythologies, and the other one was an old edition of National Geographic Magazine with the cover story about *Grimms' Fairy Tales.* The magazine also contained some breathtaking imagery of rain forests that that pertained to other articles in the mag. All along the time I was reading those books it had been raining outside (it was monsoon time). And something about it all got implanted in my mind during that time. Ever since then, whenever the sky turns dark and gloomy with clouds I vaguely start to think of fantasy stories and fairy tales. This even inspired me to write some poetry and bring up some short story ideas during rainy season.  That's the story behind my post. Sorry I had to share it.  Do any of you too have some similar experiences where the weather and the season outside influenced what you read???    Goddamnit, OP, put the source beside a quote. ~*Napoleon Hill*    Thank you :)   [Upside Down](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374992/) is a very good science fiction/fantasy film with an innovative plot.. I would like to read such books.. Know of any??    Who needs fresh air anyway.  There is not much of it in the world anyway.   One of a kind... Too good, man.      I stay in India.. Will you be willing to send it this far??? If so, thank you so very much.    Isaac Asimov's Encyclopedia of Science and Technology from the 1960s.  I consider you to be a damn lucky person. I've been looking for Asimov's non-fiction books in every second hand bookstore that I have visited but with no good success. I only found Opus (both Opus 100   Opus 200 in one) book. I love his non-fiction.   *Opus 100* by Isaac Asimov - experiences of Asimov while writing his first 100 books.   the first table. (Table 1) with two columns (X,Y)   I'm a beginner at Statistics.. Am learning the basic concepts and graphs in Stats. Today, when I was [checking out Residual Plots](http://stattrek.com/regression/residual-analysis.aspx?tutorial=ap) I got stuck with this doubt (asked in the post title). Please help.      In [this](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/regression/intro.html) tutorial, if you see just above Table 1, the following text is written.  *The example data in Table 1 are plotted in Figure 1. You can see that there is a positive relationship between X and Y. If you were going to predict Y from X, the higher the value of X, the higher your prediction of Y. *  But the predicted Y values have decreased for two X values, (3 and 5). Then why was it mentioned as "the higher the value of X, the higher your prediction of Y" in the above paragraph???    Yes.. I meant Krakauer.. I always get confused between their names.. But yeah On The Road is also on my list..   Read his *Into The Wild* - absolutely loved it.   Ever since I'd read Thoreau's works, especially *Walden*, *Civil Disobedience* and recently, *Walking,* I started to firmly believe that Henry had lived by the values that he advocated in his lifetime.   And, Isaac Asimov is another person. He worked towards knowledge all of his life, and just take a look at what he produced in his time - immensely ingenious work.  People acting their words and beliefs.. that's something that we rarely see in the world.   After that realization, I wanted to know of those authors who walked their talk..   Can you please name some??? Would love to learn about them.   This is easily one of the most creative posts of this sub!   Mark Twain is Batman!   I upvote anything that's from Thoreau...   looks like i should give this book a try.   Oh didn't know about this.. Thank you so much...   Hey, OP, I'm 25 as well. I too sometimes feel the same way about my writing.. but that's the beauty of it, pal. You got to look at that mountain and feel overwhelmed by it, and then you gotto go ahead and start climbing. It's going to be tough, yet you have to keep up with it. Person who dislikes darkness can never know the beauty of the Moon. I don't want you to be that person; heck, I don't want anybody to be that person. Because at the core of our hearts, we're all *artists,* and artists do undergo such emotional journeys.   You can write!    Look at how you describe the ghostwriter's ability. Can you not feel that emotion coursing through your own words?  Ex-fucking-actly...!!!   Twain... Twain... he is something.. I was left speechless by the book *What Is Man?* by Mark Twain. It's a small book, (a discussion between a young boy and an old man) and sheds a lot of light on the issue that argues how we as humans can't create thoughts and ideas from nothing, how our ideas are never original and are all influenced by one thing or the other. The book is full of intellectual enlightenment...    FUCKING AWESOME!   STEPHEN KING, INTERSTELLAR, A.R.RAHMAN, EARTH, YOU...   Jaden, is that you???   I was spellbound by the way Christopher Nolan connected the climax of *Interstellar* film to a bookshelf. I seriously take it to be his tribute to the world of books. Also, the film *Into The Wild* talks of some of best books, like Thoreau's *Walden*, that had influenced Chris McCandless set out to do what he did with his life. I love the movies that do such things.  What are some of the movies that payed tribute to books that stand as influence to many people around the world??   FUCKING AWESOME PRANK, MOD!    THIS POST WAS NOT VERY MOTIVATING  THE POST IN ITSELF WAS NOT MEANT TO MOTIVATE.. IT WAS MEANT TO BRING A FUCKING LAUGH ON ALL OF OUR FACES.. AND THAT LAUGH IS WHAT SHOULD MOTIVATE OUR FUCKING HEADS AND HEARTS.   LAUGH BROTHER.. A GODDAMN HEARTFILLING LAUGH IS WHAT WE FUCKING LIVE FOR.   Are we vaguely having some superpower??? I mean, seriously...??   Something about that child coming back to life brought me so much peace.. so much.      Why do you even fucking care about that!       Not exactly cool  Sometimes that's the new cool.   OK.. that's just the Indian way of speaking English... Please don't mind.. :P   Bro... your words just boiled my blood.... especially the last one, 'iconic.'   Awesome...!!!   Typeface, font, whatever the fuck it is, it is shit...!!     IF YOU DIDN'T THEN YOU SHOULD GET KICKED IN THE BALLS THEN DO THIS WORK WHILE BEING LIT ON FIRE.  THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY ASS-MOVING WAY TO GET THINGS DONE. THANKS, BROTHER.       at /r/dreams  Didn't know about that before.. thanks mod :)    I've had experiences when my phone rings and I know who is calling before looking at the caller ID.  Yes. I too experienced this in the recent past.. This is true for some SMSs as well...    *Saving Private Ryan* all along..   Comparing car stuff with space shuttle stuff... Phew, muggles everywhere.   You can't April Fool me with this...    Critics have never been able to really appreciate Christopher Nolan.  True.. they're real hypocrites..   exactly.. it was awesome...    Is this by any chance a Fools Day prank??      [](/crying)  Thank you so much!!    This is one of the greatest quotes ever. It belongs on the front page.   I like paradoxes..   Herman Hesse is such an author who can wake up the thoughts of your life from their eternal sleep and make them bring a cup of coffee for you. Liked very much his *Siddhartha* and loved his *Steppenwolf.*     If you have no ideas, why do you want to write in the first place?   Exactly...     Don't even get me started on all the short story ideas.   Hello, brother..   Yeah will do that... I myself need to improve my writing a lot :/  which is why my critiques aren't great.. Will work in that direction as well. Thanks.   Thank you for the detailed critique.. I'm pretty new to writing fiction/stories. This is just my third one, I guess. So, all your inputs regarding my writing will be of utmost help for me. Thank you so much for pointing out where it can be bettered..    It was a very nice tale that could have been improved by writing.   I've good ideas for great stories but the execution is still a little on the lower side. I will have to work on that and I will surely do.   Thank you once again for the encouragement.    The energetic current of passing period echoed through the rusting yellow bars of the classroom's windows.  *classroom windows* would've simply sounded better.   Was it really this easy?  Was *what* really that easy?   Ducks are cowards, she explained in cool, clear English, and when you yell at them they run.  I liked that line. Hey, your writing went smooth in the paragraph above that line. Good.   By creating distance from your life, distance brought not just by physical space but also by time, you gain a lens with which to look back.  You might want to re-write that sentence in a better way. Just try once.  Overall, a connect is missing in the entire piece.. You do have a nice thought process going on in your mind, but we all need to practice more to give those thoughts a better shape. Let's do that. All the best :)    Sorry sir, I don't think I'm leeching.. I just critiqued two submissions here.. One before my submission and one after. Have been away from this sub for a while. That is all. If you still think I'm leeching, please tell me why do you think so. Thanks.   She opened the screen door and stepped out onto the porch.  A breeze rippled her black dress and the crucifix around her neck.  Her dog followed her and it stopped in the threshold.  The paragraph has been tough to read. The flow of words and the way they sounded in my mind wasn't pleasant.  Their yard was small but it had held their family happily for eight years.  *Their yard was small but it had happily held their family for eight years.* Sounds better for me.  Their lawn was covered in a canvas of red and yellow and brown and blackened leaves that heavy winds pushed into wet, huddled clumps.  No no.. something is sounding really bad about all those words.  The paragraph where he dragged the dog out was smooth read.  Well tough shit because this is hard.  I dont want to have to tell my parents about this.  Maybe it will be okay for you but not for me.  Her eyes burned again.    She twisted the rings on her fingers in futile circles.  Ok. So, many of people out there are having tough time with the commas, huh! I always thought it was just me.    She stared back across the street.  Her delicate hands curled into jagged fists.  Oh there's a female in the story! Sorry, didn't realize that all along till the pronoun came up. But hey, does that say anything to you??   such a clear kind of white, such a clear kind of blue  That just repeated twice in one sentence. May be you would want to rewrite it.  Overall, a tough read.. not smooth according to me - unfortunately didn't paint the picture that you were thinking in your mind when you were writing it. May be you might want to try a bit more.  Art is all about doing better, practicing with passion.. So, you and I got a lot of that in front of us. I wish you all the best for the new things you're going to write soon :)   English is not my native language (from India).. But I love writing in English. I like fairy tales and fantasy... So, I recently penned a short fairy tale. Please help me by destroying anything that you didn't like about the story or the writing. (Also, I'm pretty excited about using a penname for the first time in my life..)  [Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gL6hs0iBEDJKy1YoUUsVJTd_lCXPWi4Yd8_ARfPtJ7A/edit?usp=sharing) Thanks.   Maximilian Collard did not have the frame of an agile man. The rock beneath his fingers was uncomfortably angular, but he gripped it tightly anyway. The pain was a fleeting inconvenience for a climber as experienced as he. Far below, he could make out the uneven straw-padded outline of a Gryphon nest. One egg, no adults.  The opening paragraph was very good and painted a perfect picture of a rock climber or a cliff hanger.... But the rest of the thing was clumsy and not engaging much... I'm sure you can do better.. All the best :)   My friend deeply needs this at his workplace... thanks!!   Hey that's pretty helpful... thnx :)   Any idea if the entire event will be available online on Youtube or elsewhere???   (From India.) I graudated last year and have been working in IT industry since a year. I'm Comp. Sci grad. I work with an MNC, and recently I've shown interest in chatting about Analytics and Data Science related stuff with some senior management of *Business Intelligence* domain in my organization. Now when a new project in Data Science is coming up for the org, they've chosen me to work in that project. Although I feel pretty happy and pleased about that, I sometimes also feel overwhelmed by the stuff I need to learn in Data Science. I was told to improve my Statistics skills and other Data Science related skillset on an urgent basis.   So, it would be really helpful if you can provide me with a list (that doesn't scare-off a newbie) of skills that I need to develop in order to become good at Data Science.  Note: Although I'm a comp sci grad, my interest has never been towards programming and algorightms... I like Database related stuff like SQL etc. So, please also suggest me what specific programming and algo skills I might need now.  Thank you.   I too am an aspiring writer. I like synopsis of stories that one plans to write.. I myself used to write them when I develop an idea of the storyline in my mind. So, I would say that the synopsis of your story sounded very good and pretty deep sci-fi. The presence of sci-fi aspects was clearly apparent, I guess that's pretty much necessary when you're offering a glimpse into your work to a publisher. The story was good but how you wrote the book is what finally matters for the audience, and by looking at how you wrote the summary, I would assume that you wrote a pretty engaging book. So, I can only wish you all the very best.. Hoping some good news to reach you soon about your book publishing :)       Good to know that you found what you were looking for.  	122

It is the largest archipelago of China. Traditionally Zhoushan had relied heavily on its primary industry, which is fishing, given Zhoushan is the largest fishery in China. Nowadays with the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, Zhoushan's economic base has been largely diversified. Ship building and repairing, shipping, light industry, tourism and service industry grow to be the major contributors of local economic output. Consequently, many fishing villages have today become abandoned. Some of the best preserved villages are located in Gouqi Island.  The Shengsi Islands are a popular tourist destination and is still an important fishery area that attracts more than 100,000 fishermen every winter.   all photos by Zhen Xuan  source: http://zhenxuan.wap.blog.163.com/w2/blogDetail.do?hostID=zhenxuan amp;amp;blogId=fks_087064086087085075093083084071072087086070080081082071083094        source: http://blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?from=postList blogId=seobibaby currentPage=4      ez link: /r/ImaginaryMindscapes - The Art of Imagination.   source: https://www.behance.net/calredback      ez link: /r/ImaginaryMindscapes - The Art of Imagination.   source: https://www.behance.net/calredback      source: https://www.behance.net/calredback      source: http://theaugblog.blogspot.com/      source: http://theaugblog.blogspot.com/      source: https://www.behance.net/juanestebanrodriguez      https://www.artstation.com/artist/espenartman      Thank you Justsploofit for your submission!

 Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.  But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.  Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).  I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.    As stated above:  Primary purpose of this bot is used to cross-reference subs commonly associated with SJWs, in addition to finding patterns in the subs left-wing users use. Uses are for identifying concern trolls, potentially identifying alts, identifying cuckolds so that one may talk to their SOs for bulltastic times , and just fun and curiousity.  http://imgur.com/fuVqnd5   **Duggar cached website: "Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes"**  Q. What is your abortion position, and specifically, where do you stand on rape, incest, and threat to the mothers health?  A. If a woman is raped, the rapist should be executed instead of the innocent unborn baby. Adoption is an option. Many couples would love to adopt and are waiting for a baby. Abortion has been and always will be the destruction of an innocent child. Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes. The developing infant committed no crime and should be allowed to live. In the unlikely event that the life of both mother and baby would both be lost (for example, a tubal pregnancy) all should be done to save the life of the mother.  http://web.archive.org/web/20030210014933/http://www.jimbob.info/position.html   Primary purpose of this bot is used to cross-reference subs commonly associated with SJWs, in addition to finding patterns in the subs left-wing users use. Uses are for identifying concern trolls, potentially identifying alts, **identifying cuckolds so that one may talk to their SOs for bulltastic times** , and just fun and curiousity.  http://imgur.com/fuVqnd5      Maybe because they banned it first over spam, relented, then looked at what it said it's stated purpose was - which wasn't spam. Part of it's 'purpose' was to gather information to use to contact the SO's of people on it's list.  That isn't spam. That is harassment.    I was pegged by that bot. I mostly post in politics and news (sometimes star wars).  If you want to know why the bot was banned maybe you should take a look at the description the bot had and not it's function. There is a telling item in it and it's stated purpose.   Is he related to the Duggars?   **Puts on tea party/rw fundie hat**  We better give them what they want. If we don't, god won't bless the USA and will strike us down. If you don't believe us, ask our super smart members to explain to you folks where hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, droughts, etc come from - God..he is punishing us for gays.   Elect us and god will bless us again as we give Israel anything it wants, drive out the gays and immigrants, end all aid to the poor, sick, hungry, and make life hell for those in prison - just like Jeebus demanded we do!      **Puts on conservative hat**   You all need to pull yourselves up by your bootstraps. Just work harder, get two jobs! Why should I give you welfare? Don't like where you are living? Move somewhere else with better opportunities and less violence. Git r done!      How about we just quit getting in to wars in the first place. Problem solved.   And you don't get to assault citizens. Fair enough. Now let's look at what happens when either group do so.   Ah, Rick and the conservative platform: Save america from hurricanes, floods, etc - ban gays and push prayer as the solution to poverty, healthcare, everything except defense (for that, they don't put trust in god but in ammo - god can wipe out sinners/gays with 'natural' disasters but he is powerless against terrorism, russia, china, etc. Man..their god is weird).   Internet troll eh. Let me guess, he is a conservative.  *Checks article*  Yep.  *after asking for funds to "take out" the civil rights activist DeRay McKesson*         Yes. How many people speed per day? Do you want to hire enough cops to sit at every mile marker to catch them all? It is gonna cost more - and we know the conservatives in this country would only raise taxes for killing humans in other countries, so how would we pay for properly enforcing the law?   Funny, an NDN I know who is a SJW and an attorney on a rez sent this to me. If she isn't offended I'll try not to be.                              All religions are just things people made up to make themselves feel better and/or a method to control people. It's all about fear - fear satan, fear god, fear muslims, fear people not like us (color/sex/etc).  Islam and Christianity are just two branches of the same tree that peddle fear and ignorance of others to justify their actions. Cut down the tree if you ever really want to get some real peace on earth.   Demographics: Citizens with guns shooting other citizens.  Since we don't pay citizens and they don't work for us there isn't really much we can do about it other than what we already are. If the people we employ are shooting folks there is a lot more we are empowered to do about it.  Can't control everyone else, but the people who are supposed to answer to us we should be able to. Oddly enough, conservatives are the ones who most get in the way and try to shield employees who don't do their jobs properly.  People with power (guns) abuse that power and we arrest them, give them a trial, send them to jail.  People with power (cops) abuse that power and some people set up gofundme accounts to cheer them on and claim that they just shot people because they were scared (notice they never want to look at details when it isn't cops shooting people - they just look at the numbers....)   And no one else ever did either. Heck, Christians are still just some small group somewhere and never went on any conquests. Think I will book me some tickets to the new world and see those 'Indians' there. Oh wait...someone killed most of them off. Probably them evil mooslims!   I always thought chief Wiggum was up to no good.   Conservatives will believe anything, and deadbart knows just which dog whistle to blow to get them all panting and running about.         Not fully. People break the laws all day long - every time someone speeds, doesn't use a turn signal, etc they are not obeying the law.  Police have the ability to detain/arrest people and deliver them to where justice can be served - it is all part of a process. Cops are rarely at the scene of a crime when it happens (robberies, rapes, murders, etc). They are there to be called if someone sees something going wrong or survives something.     What is the role of a cop in society? They cannot protect you all of the time. They can arrest violators if they are caught in the commission of a crime. How many people are shot in the US, or stabbed, etc a year in the US?  If you believe that the cops sole job is to protect you then I don't know what to tell you.  [Justices Rule Police Do Not Have a Constitutional Duty to Protect Someone](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html)    Why do you think they do? If you're a super smart conservative your answer might be "Cause they gets free obummer phones which never existed on earth till obummer! Git r done!"  Maybe they vote mainly with a party that doesn't despise them and is filled with racists.   Oh, I dunno, you must be right. Cops exist just so we won't kill each other. That is why there is one cop to one person - so they can stand around and watch to make sure we don't shoot each other.  ROFL. Riiight. I mean, if we didn't have police departments everyone would kill each other all day long (sounds rather biblical - original sin, etc).   We have, what, about 400 cops per 100,000 people. And their job is to stop all those people from killing each other. Okey dokey.    Those guns got from the store to the street somehow.  So someone had to pass the background checks.   Wow, that's just dumb.  Especially the part " Police exist to keep pople from killing each other"  Heck, maybe the problem is all the gun owners shooting people there, eh? :)          I can understand that. I don't think I ever watched Full House (may have seen a show or two with one of my kids, the people look familiar in it). I have never seen American Idol either and lots of people seemed to think it was the bee's knees.  It's not that I don't like TV I am just picky in what I watch (Twin Peaks, Broadchurch, Doctor Who, The Wire, Mork and Mindy, and as you mentioned Air Wolf).   Now I feel old. * Shakes fist at computer* Get off my grass, and my screen!   A 'friend' of mine watched it. Said it was fun but didn't understand how she had pierced her ears.   I can see that the full retard division has shown up.  You know, the basic "If you help people it will encourage people to become homeless to get free stuff" brigade.  Right. Because people want to be homeless for a year or more and suffering just to get a cheap place to live * facepalm*   Reminds of how conservatives have been preaching that if we extend unemployment benefits people won't look for work, and then turn around and claim there aren't any jobs because of evil ole Obama. Again, thinking that people enjoy taking huge cuts in pay and having an uncertain future.  These are the same folks who yammer on about us needing to pay more money for more wars so that we can have peace. We inaded Iraq? Let's do it again! And hey, while over there let's hit up Iran too.  Maybe those countries don't want us to invade them, maybe they don't want our 'help', and maybe a lot of us don't want to spend money on more wars and killing but actually helping people here - because it isn't terrorism or Iraq that is causing the pain/suffering/death here.   Dear conservatives, stop being so damn stupid when it comes it basic crap so many other countries get right. Like health care/single payer. You want to save American lives, focus on what is actually killing them (hint: it isn't terrorism or 'laziness').   It will be like with the cops. "I thought he had a gun/wmd/etc, so I am excused for shooting him a hundred times even though there wasn't a weapon."  Basically, the bush doctrine.   LOL - only a conservative with an agenda would buy that.  Tell us, what are the actual numbers? Ohhh 70% - scary (if you can't think for yourself and watch fox).     Define "Qualified".   Yeah, but it was because... "reasons".   Only in the US do we find people not outraged by this, or at the best, questioning of it.  The pat, conservative, response is "They didn't stop, so they had it coming!" Yeah. Maybe we need to rethink how we do some police work here - but saying that, to some, means you are a flaming liberal who hates cops and wants a lawless society.   And that is, imho, a part of the problem: "Sides".  LEO's see themselves, in general, as part of a group. If you don't support them, you are against them. I was 'punished' at times when I was one because I wasn't always on the 'cop' side. But then I was young and idealistic. I saw it as a job. Others saw it as a life style choice and the teams were us and people who weren't us.   Ever watch a police chase? How many end with that may shots on unarmed citizens?  Ohhhh. I see. You think cops should just unload their weapons on unarmed people. Just let their 'animal' instincts take over. After all of those shots you still think a guy should jump on the hood of the car and keep shooting. What are they, storm troopers who can't shoot straight?  Reminds me of conservatives. They want to investigate Benghazi for years but when cops kill people here just shrug and say "They had it coming". Riiight. And if you don't see how the two connect, think about this:  4 Americans died in a hot zone and the right wants someone's head for it - someone here in the US they can blame. So much so they have had multiple investigations and don't blame the people who did it, they never talk about them, but want someone in government held accountable.  Yet, right here in the US, cops can kill unarmed people - not just in this case - and the right just shrugs and blames the people killed and backs the government.      So obey or die. Great way to run a society, pretty much the conservative/fundie mind set. Isis approved message.  Wonder how so many other countries get by without shooting and killing their citizens? Must be a mad house in the UK, Iceland, Europe, Canada.....   If this were Cleveland they would just shoot them 137 times and call it a day.   Depends. I spoke up several times on issues, which gets IA(internal affairs) involved. It made my life hell there.   Imagine a police force like being a very very partisan website when it comes to politics. Sometimes, people don't listen to reason and see anyone who doesn't agree as a threat - ala the old "you are with us or against us".  There has to be a will, not just by a few officers, but by the public and those in power, to take it serious. I was harassed by senior deputies (sgt/lt). It didn't help that I personally knew the sheriff and he had hired me in. Keep in mind, the sheriff is elected and comes and goes, and he/she has to play politics with those who have been there awhile.   Police forces are, for a big part, political entities. They won't reform themselves from within.      We have plenty of troops - all of those militias who run about protecting the border. They are just itching to shoot up something. I am sure they will be on their way there, without even being asked, any moment now.  "Hey Billy Bob, grab you gun and wake up cooter! I done loaded up our bibles, flags, and guns. We have to save America, again. This time, it's for reals. Git r done!"   Mecca? Isn't that where Pee Wee lives? http://imgur.com/G7BWuca   I don't care how it is sliced and diced, way too many shots were fired at two unarmed people in a car. The cops probably fired more bullets at that car than the entire UK police force has fired this century.  They obviously weren't even looking, just shooting - all based on a 'belief' that the people were armed. When we stop holding cops accountable we are giving them a green light to continue on this path and we will see more of it.   It is a sad day when you are more afraid of cops who carry guns than citizens that do.            Weird. I thought he was all about rights and the constitution, etc. Equal protection under the law and all that good stuff.  Do we have mandatory interracial marriage? My x was 1/4 Indian, so maybe he is on to something. I seem to recall the Lutheran church we attended at the time being forced to marry us. It was awful.  Why do the craziest people in the US mostly belong to the republican party?   And lots of Americans believe in an invisible sky daddy who wants to destroy the entire US because of those gay people.  Americans are a little funny about some things (they ignore all the other sins, of course. Cause there is really only one sin the right things about all day - and it involves sex).   Yeah, I know some people don't believe in excessive force and such. And others are fine with cops just shooting people who don't pull over (See it all the time, right? So it must be the standard procedure you endorse).   *Biden says that during the transition, he was warned not to expect any cooperation on many votes. I spoke to seven different Republican Senators, who said,*  *"Joe, Im not going to be able to help you on anything," he recalls. His informants said (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell had demanded unified resistance. The way it was characterized to me was: `For the next two years, we cant let you succeed in anything. Thats our ticket to coming back, Biden says.*    They want to see Obama fail (ala republicans/rush/etc) because if his policies succeeded it would mean that the conservative ones were wrong. So they worked against the US doing better.   They care about one thing - winning elections. And when they win they want to work to dismantle things from science to epa. Their whole philosophy is stuck in the stone ages and based on 'just pray - god will save us. Oh, and give us money for more weapons, cause we really don't believe god will save us'.  They used 9/11 to make wars, patriot act, tsa, and to consolidate more power - power which, suddenly, they think is wrong since Obama is president. Now, again - rather suddenly, they want lots of investigations into an attack. Something they didn't want much of when it came to 9/11 ("Don't criticize the president, we were attacked, real patriots would stand by him and wave flags!").   "Defend the country." Riiiight. What were we defending it from?  Was it Iraq's massive air force/navy attacking us? Ooops. Probably not. This is why conservatives side with cops - if you are scared, shoot someone and claim it was "Defense".  China and Russia are bigger threats to us than the ME, yet we didn't launch wars against them. Remember that 'cold' war? It stayed cold because more intelligent people were in charge.   So, 2 unarmed people, 130 shots fired, 2 people dead, and the cops were just doing their job.  OK. As a former leo myself I am left asking "Wonder why people have problems with cops?" and the answer seems more and more clear all the time.   I guess the lesson is - shoot all you want, just tell folks you were reasonably scared, and you have nothing to worry about. Unless, of course, you are a lowly citizen and not a government employee.      I am going to miss Ireland. According to conservatives here in the US god will be mad now. Jeebus will send storms, earthquakes, etc to punish the entire country. It will probably sink beneath the waves.   I wish we all could be smart scientists like conservative fundies and understand nature better. Word of advice, when god starts destroying Ireland, run. Don't look back, or you will turn into salt as punishment. If we hadn't kick god out of the schools more people would understand this.   I don't even really blame people who voted to authorize use of force. It was bush who used it, who kept us there, who controlled and ran the war. He was, as he might say, 'the decider'. It rests on no one's shoulders but his own.      As an independent who voted reagan and bush I find that funny.  A large part of the republican party is incompetent. From Iraq to religion to everything in between, conservatives don't tend to think for themselves anymore and are more interested in screwing over the US and playing politics than they are in actual working to better the country.  They are regressive socially, prefer corporations over their own country, want to remove just about every regulation and regress us back to the times when rivers would catch fire from pollution.                           They have already determined that there weren't stand down orders, etc and so on. Republicans care more about benghazi than they ever did 9/11 - but then, they don't really care about the US, just punishing those who aren't like them; from gays to democrats the right is still crying over their losses to Obama and work against the US for their party.  Patriotism is just a word they use to control the weak minded folks who vote for them. Wave your flag, clutch your bible, and cheer on sending troops to be injured and killed. It's what those 'patriots' do.   We'll get right on that soon as bush and cheney are behind bars. Don't hold your breath.            I am shocked they didn't shoot him 40 times, or at least beat him a lot.  Police forces are becoming (more of) an embarrassment in this country.   Um, doesn't appear to be "Live"   And she was right.               I think you summed up my own feelings quite nicely.                        Wrong. One is about people who were born a certain way, one is about people who chose to be a certain way.   It doesn't have to say anything - it is obvious from his sign.  And how does he know they are 'Mexican'? Because they don't look like him? Oh...right. The only country where people 'look' like that is Mexico.  Yeah, that screams conservative.   Let me guess. He is a conservative.   Naw, don't even recall the name - just thought it funny that someone would say that when losing an argument. It was the only thing they said that resembled being truthful/intelligent.   If not indicted, then conservatives/fox/rush/etc would all be out yelling, "See! I told you they did nothing wrong, this proves it!"  Now it will be "You can indict a ham sandwich, so this means nothing!"   Hmm, wonder if it is that guy who swore he would follow me around reddit and downvote every single thing I posted because he lost an argument with me? That would be funny :)            Yeah, not quite like Fox articles where it's all lies and a headline, which some people seem to have a need for :)   Concise, simple, and was a breaking news item (but you aren't allowed to say that in the title here). I will note, for those who may need this information, a website called "google" will assist you in learning more about something if honestly interested.  Some sarcasm in all of that, perhaps.                                                                           Funny - I wasn't talking about Obama. Typical of cons; can't read and comprehend. Try it again and let me know if you need any help.   Ah...libs. Those damn people who care about freedom for folks to marry, against silly wars, want to be able to work together to provide health care/etc for fellow humans like other countries.  Nothing like conservatives.   This isn't new. It was reported on 9/13/2012 by CNN (and presumably others).  I guess it is new to people who only cared to hear what they wanted back then and because con news sources were all whining about the video and obama not using the word 'terror' seconds after the attack.  Once more, the right got played by their own news outlets who distracted them.  Even Hillary noted it was a small group (which they were):  http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/  Elsewhere we see that there were folks saying it could have been a planned attack but no one was sure "at that point" (kind of like how folks aren't always sure a cop shooting someone was justified at that point until they investigate).  The admin also said they didn't think it was Al Qaeda, which it wasn't. And "He stressed Zawahiri's threat was only three lines in a forty something minute video tape. Given the language in the tape, analysts would tend not to have concluded an immediate attack was likely."  http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/14/in-attack-aftermath-disagreement-over-how-it-began/   LOL this is NEW??? Jeebus. On Sept 13th CNN reported on this.  Updated 11:40 AM ET, Thu September 13, 2012 http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/   Meh, Karma doesn't really translate to much. I don't like the way cops get away with crap here in the US, used to be one and hated it back then (the 80's). The right seems to worship government employees with guns - when I wish they were as critical of them as they pretend to be of some other people in power they say abuse their power.   I can have one because I used to be one - isn't that how it works?   Not an attorney, but I spent the night in a holiday express last night.   I would say, send them a link to this story on a check (in the memo) for 0.01 cents. See what happens.   Han shot first.    Orcas...the cops of the ocean.   So having all these nukes doesn't deter anyone. Good to know, we can sell em all off.   More here:  http://hosted2.ap.org/OHGAL/e1746e01b7de43cdbb5e734fc37b1408/Article_2015-05-18-US--The%20Latest%20Child%20Support-Shariah/id-18e4624e52034e62bb52f22c8ffc53e6         The official sponsor of deadbart:  http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/products/trolling-motors.jsp   Now where will I get a damned fine cup of coffee, The Lamplighter Inn (they have good pie though)?   She's just trying to be better at quitting things, like dear ole mom.         12 times that condemn 'fox' and 'deadbart' as a source for anything except pandering to mindless drones.               Image:  http://imgur.com/z8odeBr         The Image:  http://imgur.com/Ks6E1vF      And conservatives aren't liking seeing their fellow humans being allowed to be married, free, not in wars, etc. It also irks them that they can't have their own brand of isis/theocracy in power here....  See, this is easy.               Weird. I heard the only people in the US who hated cops were blacks/liberals. Looks like them responsible gun owner whites are the ones shouting to kill cops (reminds me of waco....)   Not just the cops - conservatives. If this were a group of black people doing this all we would hear about is "welfare, absent dads, crime rate amongst blacks" and so on and so on.  Then, someone would bring up "Black on Black crime" and whine like little babies about how "Black people don't get upset when citizens kill each other but do when government employees do" as though it means something (in other words, they will ask things like 'why aren't blacks protesting other blacks killing each other?' as though that is even close to an intelligent question).  Now imagine the bikers were muslims....jeeebus, it would be all over fox, every single forum on the net, with people screaming.  White folks do crime? Meh. They don't represent Christians, gun owners, or straight people. They are seen as individuals with problems.  Conservatives aren't exactly smart folks though.   I find his comment on names interesting as well. Has he heard the name 'Barack'?                  Leslie Neilsen did it better:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP7F7Uw6yP4   Maybe it works like this: God takes all the water, using his magic, from one place then drops it on another. He likes spreading the punishment around.  Conservative fundies call the above 'Science' and it is what they want taught in school.       Betting they get Agent Cooper on the case. Any witnesses see a one armed man?   Ah, typical republican. "We agree to open a public business but we shouldn't have to honor the 'public' contract part of it. 'Cause we are special, jeesbus tells us so! And if we serve gays it will make god all angry and he will kill people in the US with storms and quakes!"  Yeah, not dealing with people playing with a full deck. I expect him to say something like that. Now the good little conservatives will rush to give him a gold star or little American flag next to his name. "He respects jeebus and isn't a muslim born in kenya who ordered stand down orders in Benghazi - all of which we proved about Obama."  Good lord, why do these type of people even get votes and who would actually vote for them?   He wants it to be like that. All the cons want to do is sell fear - for more patriot act, tsa, more spending on weapons. All the while ignoring the things which actually impact people here in a negative way an harm them. From poverty to health care to just about everything else.   The American Taliban just wants to push jeebus, 'christian values', and the idea that the only problems, ever, in the US are because people are just lazy. All the while believing that companies can do no wrong, never do, and if we just remove all epa regulations companies would hire people and never, ever, harm our water supplies, air, and so on.  Not smart people - he would be a good leader for such folks.               Because republicans want to save more money to give to Israel (apparently, both Israel and God don't have their own bootstraps).  The RW believes that people need an incentive to work and that all humans on earth who get aid are just lazy, but will run out and get the jobs they claim Obama lost if you make em suffer more.  Conservative fundies aren't known for their intellect and respond  to emotion and religion (the poor should pray more and rely on Churches and god, like the right does for the defense of the US....oh wait...they spend money like drunken sailors on ways to kill people. They actually have zero faith in god.)   Now imagine much of the populace listens to fox news and believes it. 14 years after 9/11 the only thing they talk about is the benghazi episode on 9/11 where most people died, bush was a hero, etc and so on.  Between hannity, rush, levin, fox news, and the emperor I can easily see why people might discount facts and history - because some people are just dumb. Han probably listened to a rw con radio show all day while flying in the Falcon ;)  (It's a joke people)   She voted, wrongly imho, to give bush the authority to go to war.  He abused that authority. Now people want her to be responsible for what he did? Where were those people back then and up until 2008?   Yeah....no.  The US is so far behind other countries on this it isn't even funny.  I have 5 kids, with a few different ladies, over my near 50 years. Each one is different. Pregnancy and child birth are different for each person.   Conservative types tend to try to make things simple and compact based on the few. Hence why they are so regressive on things.   Which is funny - because when it comes to religion (for example) they go on 'belief' and get upset when challenged. When it comes to protestors about government (police) abuses they call everyone looters. When it comes to women having kids they think of them as simple factories and want those women back out and 'producing' again in no time.  And yeah - I agree, add matching time for mother and father. Try having a wife really sick (who, btw, died some years later because of her health issues) and being punished by the company you are working for because you took one day over the allotted 3 to care for her.  Conservatives like to make everything about their real god - money.                        	200
 Yes -- here's what a 2011 Nature study (linked in article) says: "Contrail cirrus are composed of ice crystals thatsimilarly to natural cirrusreflect solar short-wave radiation and trap outgoing long-wave radiation." Because they're so long-lived, the trapping effect outweighs the reflection effect.      NBC poll shows that most Americans--67%--support new EPA carbon emissions standards--will policymakers listen to their constituents as we head into the fall election?   Portland sets a great example of how to be a bike-friendly city!   The West's wildfires are increasing in size and the fire season is expanding along with the costs of fighting them. The most proactive way to fight fires is to fight climate change.   Not good news, especially for Pacific Northwest shellfish aquaculture, and a call for increased proactive coastal management that includes acidification.   Unlikely place to test agricultural pesticides, especially when so many of Kauai's species are listed as under the Endangered Species Act.    Hopeful news for a binding agreement in Paris.   The benefits of walkable cities extends beyond energy efficiency and economics to include community development, which contributes to higher GDP per capita in these cities.    Obama's proposal to protect 782,000 square miles not only helps Pacific bluefin tuna, but also becomes a sanctuary for marine species long into the future.

 I mean, it's no Hellcat, but I'm looking forward to getting one.    Let's not forget the upcoming Focus RS.   TIL: Your dad and brother are dummies.    lol, too easy?  Drunbs Dread?  The pro's cried so much about how hard it was, they haven't been back.  After playing there for years and years, they made some renovations to make it harder, and the pros didn't want to play there anymore.    Anyone that drives a BMW.  What the fuck is wrong with you knob gobblers?!   I always told my employees to give the customer one warning about abusive language, after that to terminate the call.  Any manager or boss that allows a customer to verbally abuse their employees is (from what I've been told)breaking the law also.  Employees do not have to put up with a hostile work environment.    Well, let's just say I won't hold my breath waiting for the PGA Tour to come back to Cog Hill.    No, I  get that.  The US open is at different locations all the time, and they go back to some of them (pebble beach), but I'm willing to bet that if this course plays as hard as it could, they'll never be back.    That's a good deal.  They giving you swag too? How about a round of golf?  I got a windbreaker and a free round.  So it worked out.    I volunteered at the BMW Championship, the last year it was at Cog Hill, and it cost me $150.  I thought it was worth it...  did you have to pay?    The pro's all cried about cog hill, and now they'll never be back there.  I'm guessing next year's open will be at some favored course again.    You're the one with reading and comprehension issues.  The masters is in charge of the masters!    You really don't understand how the PGA tour works, do you?    What part of private tournament are you having problems understanding?    Sounds like a neckbeard was trying to hit on you.    Even if the PGA didn't consider it a recognized tournament, it doesn't change the fact that it's a private event, held by a private club.  The money is what brings the players, not the PGA.   It's a private tournament on a private golf course.  Don't like it? Then organize a protest and try to stop it.  There is no sanctioning body to "correct" them.    It's a private tournament, with a big cash prize.  No one can stop it.    Stupid people shouldn't piss me off as much as they do, I mean, it's not their fault.  But stupid people really piss me off.  I'm glad to hear this story.    Wow.  Consider my mind changed.  I feel like I need to go and reread the books for a fourth time now...   The Ace?  You mean Mace?  And noooo, the man is a dunce.  Everything in the shows and books point this out.    At golfsmith, they usually do fittings for free, and they have clearance clubs for sale too.    Take lessons first.  The lessons might change your swing.  Then get fit for clubs.  It makes a difference, even for us high handicappers.    I just finished a set of lessons at golftec, and it's helped a ton.  Last year I was shooting in the high 90's, this year it's low 90's and I've shot an 88, 3 times.  I would find an instructor that used video.    My flop shot.  I see it like a gun.  I'd rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.  And if you're not careful with it, it can really hurt you or someone else.  I practice this shot 25% of the time on the range and use in maybe once every 3 rounds of play.    Check out the myprotogo app.  Frame by frame break down, and you can draw on screen.  It's free and it allows you to send the video in for tips (cost money).   No, the man is a dunce.    The show seems to have gone in so many different directions than the books, that I can't even being to guess what might happen next.  It's really cool!    I'd love to see or read that!    Damn, that's right.  And how many walked away?  2?   Lots of the head green keepers will have some dog or another.    This times a thousand.  In the books, they make this out to be one of the most epic battles of the whole war, and it happens at the end!  All the surviving bad asses from each side, squaring off. Was it 4 on 5 or 5 on 5?   I heard a saying once, "try to make something idiot proof, and God will just make a better idiot".   Read and play cards.    I know that, but I've also seen plenty of things that shouldn't work, but do. And things that should work, but don't.  I've worked in retail, management, food/service industry, product design/engineering, and in automotive repair and restoration.  I've seen some shit.   I practice my flop shot a ton.  But I see it like having a gun.  You hope you don't have to use it, but when you need it, it's a good thing to have.    I did and I've found it to be true.     Have more confidence and ask out more chicks.    Worst. Feature. Ever.    You can't put a square peg in a round hole, but you can put a round peg in a square hole.    There are no shortcuts.    She's a keeper.   Your girlfriend seems nice enough too...   This needs to be a top comment.    Take a drive out to the burbs.  Better courses, better value, and some of the Rangers care.    Reading this just made me so angry.  I hate "parents" like that.  I've found the best solution is to say something the very first time the child does something inappropriate.  And I don't say it to the kid, I turn to the parent and firmly say "do you mind controlling your child?  This action/ behavior is not allowed here for safety/insurance/privacy/corporate policy."  If they say shit or let it continue I call a manager over.  When I was a manager, this is what I trained people to say, and if I got called over, I informed them that if said behavior was not corrected, that they could take their business someplace else.    Correct sequence is where the lag comes from.  From the top, the swing should start with the feet, then legs, then hips, then shoulder, then arms, then last being the hands and club.  This is "lag", and is probably the hardest thing in golf to get right.   Since the golf swing starts with the hands and arms in the backswing, it's hard for us amateurs to not start the downswing with the hands and arms too.    This is the most correct answer.  The giant club face helps, but also hurts, same as the long shaft.  Mistakes get compounded and amplified.   It's also part mental.    You should try taking what feels like half a swing and a slower speed.  Just try to deliver the club face back square to the target.   My set up - 50 deg gap wedge, 54 sand, 58 lob.  Plus what ever deg the standard pitching wedge is, which comes before the gap.    The bounce matters more than the deg.  My 58 doesn't have any bounce, so I can open it up and use it for flop shots from the fairway.   I use my 54 that has bounce, and I just open the club face for short shots or leave it closed for longer ones.    Super bowl results.      Sex and golf.    Sweet story and all, and glad you had a little bright on your day...  And before I sound like a jerk, let me just say that I've worked all sorts of retail and food service, and I'm always polite, but COME ON.  You chit chatted 20 min away, while the line built up?   Nothing drives me more crazy than this.  Look, I'll smile and nod, but I got places I want to be, that aren't in line, waiting to give you my money.  Can you please make sure to just move the line along.   Once again, sorry for being an ass, but I just want to pay for my shit and go, not listen to the two of you chat the day away.    It hasn't been an issue for me, but I'm not racing it on a track or doing many U turns...  	53

 Well ghost, I will surely look into it. I looked up a few earlier that were anywhere from $60 to $180 per appointment. At this point, if it'll help me help her, money won't be a problem. How do I go about looking for one of these in my area? Google, psychotherapy in city, state?   All of the advice is definitely helping. She has been working since 8:00 this morning though so I haven't been able to contact her. She was going to get off late Sunday and our plans were just to have me stay over at her place. We made these plans last night after she changed like this. It was only last Sunday when she was over, smiling, and we were perfectly fine. And she doesn't lie well, so I would know if she was hiding something. Is changing that fast common? And is there a possibility she'll have a mood swing back to happiness?   Thank you Star. I probably won't see her for awhile because of the distance and her work schedule assuming she cancels the recent plans we made. Will it be detrimental if I spend too long away? It's not my choice. I just can't drop in unannounced because she's almost always at work.   Okay. I texted her asking if the plans we made Sunday are still on. Should I not be giving her the option to say no? I don't want to push her too hard.   That lifts my spirit actually, the last thing you said, assuming you're right about it. She has the kind of depression that she feels like a burden on others though, especially me, and doesn't want me around. Do I push her to allow me to spend time with her like you said? Or is that a bad idea?   I hate to say this, but I probably can't afford it. I've thought of doing this though. I want to be able to understand so I can help if she ever does turn to me again. Are therapists relatively inexpensive? I will do just about anything right now to be of any help to her.   I'll take your advice, no matter how hard it will be for me, to leave her be as long as she needs. We actually don't live together, she lives about 35 minutes from me, so I can't really be close to her right now. I myself feel helpless since I'm so far away, and the only mode to speak with her is via text, since she can't be on the phone at work and she doesn't have a computer.   Is it common that people can't? I know it's only been a few days but it's still very scary for me. She thinks she just needs to be alone but won't listen when I tell her it's her depression saying that, and I want to be there for her.   **TL:DR: My girlfriend was diagnosed by a therapist with depression, and she is trying to push me away. I read that that was one of the symptoms and I need to stop her from doing that. What should I do?**  My girlfriend just started seeing a therapist (she has been to one session, her therapist was sick so she had to cancel the second) and she was already diagnosed with depression on the first visit. It's extremely frustrating for me right now because she is trying to push me away and isolate herself because she thinks she is just going to bring me down. I'm afraid she will push me away until she thinks I won't want her back no matter what I say.  I don't know what to do... Should I just be patient with her and hope the therapy sessions work? We were very serious about our relationship , and not three days ago everything was perfect. She all of a sudden snapped one day and completely locked up. She lives a bit away from me so I don't get to see her as often as either of us would like, but it's mostly because of her work schedule. She works way too much, so much that she pretty much works dawn to dusk six days a week and she doesn't have to, and it hurts her sleeping schedule.  She is at the point where she already won't listen to me because she thinks things are hopeless and just wants to give up. She isn't normally like this. She is usually the happiest person in the world, bringing immense joy to anyone around her. I'm worried about her well-being. I need to know if I should just be patient and let her do what she needs to do, or if I should prevent herself from pushing away the people in her life who care about her. I'm at a loss. Please, someone help me.   My subconscious is an evil genius. I wish that were true. And you're probably right. Oh well!   I know.. I'm stupid... But there were only 4 other players on the map and I figured most were in Elektro or Cherno so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. I haven't quite figured out where the more trafficked areas are yet.   When I first fired it, I thought, this should be called the dinner bell, not the enfield. But for some reason when I was on the ground and shot a zombie none of the others came running. I think it was a glitch at first :\   I managed to reach the Chernarus International Airfield about an hour ago, armed with a crossbow and two bolts. After killing a couple of zombies and two of them unfortunately falling on top of the bolts, I was left without those precious arrows I love so much. With a useless weapon, I decided to discard it in the bushes and grab my ax.  I spent a good amount of time searching the ENTIRE airfield. Not a building was left unchecked. The first weapon I found was an AKS Kobra, which was great, but I *really* wanted a silenced weapon. So I left it be, and continued to the other end of the airfield. After finding about 6 AKs and AKMs, a shotgun or two, and about 3 G17s, I decided to make my way back to the AKS with a Kobra. After reaching the spot where I had originally found it, I discovered I had somehow managed to completely overlook an M14 AIM lying in the same building. Tears rolled down my face. I still feel new to the game, and this was the greatest thing I could have found.  I leave the building (I assume was the barracks) and head to the tall hangar building. I climb the ladder to the very top most point and decide to try out my rifle. I snipe quite a few zombies, amazed at the accuracy of the weapon, only to hear grunts like I was hurt. I thought, there is no way a zombie could have gotten me. I was surrounded for sure, but I know I was at a safe distance from them up the ladder I had climbed. The glitchy polygons were getting annoying, so I disconnected and reconnected from the server. Don't know what I thought that would help, but at least the zombies were gone.  I head down to the roof below and look over the edge to see a survivors body. Those were the grunts I heard. I felt so bad. He had an AK on him and perhaps he was saving his own life by not shooting me in the middle of a zombie-infested airfield, but it seemed more like he was hoping I would befriend him and fight alongside him. My jubilation at finding a rifle and practicing with it brought the hordes around him, before he could climb the ladder, and he was murdered right under my nose without me knowing. I could have helped him. I had plenty of cooked steaks, bandages, painkillers, and some morphine I found in the Elektro hospital. I did not want his sacrifice to go to waste, so I grabbed the GPS off his body, left the rest in case he came back, and headed into the forest to take a break.  **TL;DR: I got you killed at the NW airfield for firing my new rifle and I'm very sorry. I took your GPS. I get lost easily... Sorry again.**    What happened here? I'd like to know the answer if anyone can still give it   I laughed when I don't feel like being happy. haha, thanks korn!   So much vacuuming... That's all I've been doing for awhile. I'll probably nuke it with some bug bomb like you said. It's just such a hassle. I hate these things.   Thanks for the advice, I'll probably try that. Will it work the same if they're bed bugs? Or do I need to do something different?   Girlfriend found a stray cat on the side of the highway and we took it in, killed the fleas on it but not before it was too late. I'm not getting bitten but she wakes up with bites every time. Any way to kill the fleas in the mattress? If the only way is through professional help, I'll do it.    I picked up camo, put it on, then decided I shouldn't have grabbed it from this guys tent, so I put it back. I still looked like I was wearing it. Is that one of the bugs?   I was just playing in a server for about an hour in Elektro, and decided I wanted to go find a new server. When I load back up, I load in Cap Golova with the starting inventory. What happened?   This is a great reply! I appreciate the information. I'm looking forward to the new additions to the game   Thanks man! I'm new to the game, so it's nice to know this kind of thing!   Care to explain?   It's wild how DayZ does that to people, but I completely understand. I was very frustrated when I posted this. I'll still play, because the gathering of resources and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing, we just had an unfortunate situation where my buddy had something to do IRL, so we had to hurry through main towns to the rendezvous. It won't happen again.   I started 4 days ago. My fear of zombies is so great I was too crippled to play the first three days. Those first moments consisted of me finding a hatchet, but being too afraid to approach a zombie. Being too afraid to enter the woods. Being too afraid to enter towns. Basically, the coast was my sanctuary. By the fourth day, I found myself on the far West side of the island, near Zelenogorsk, with one fellow survivor.  After 30 minutes of running towards the north western edge of Zelenogorsk to find a lake that we were told would be there, I happen across a truck. This truck belonged to no one. It was spawned, missing two tires, no engine, and an empty fuel tank and damaged hull. We spend the next two hours moving back and forth between Zelenogorsk, the lumber yard, and the location of our truck, finding the necessary materials to repair the vehicle. When we finally finish, I'm armed with an Enfield, he a shotgun, and our truck houses our high quantities of sodas, cans of food, and essentials, like bandages. It also held our M4A3 and a CZ 550. This truck was sanctuary. We made the decision to rendezvous with two other friendlies at the far Northeastern edge of the map, where they had no vehicle and wanted to be transported.  After 2.5 long hours, we hop in our truck and begin the arduous, treacherous journey. After successfully navigating all the way to the final town on the map just before our destination, we're ambushed, the driver dies instantly, and I smash my face into the dash when the truck crashes, killing me.  It literally destroys any chance of me enjoying this game knowing that, no matter what you do, everyone on DayZ is evil. After playing for so long, being at 12,000 blood, to die in a split second, it will never seem worth it. I thoroughly enjoy this game, but why can't anyone work for their own things? There are plenty of vehicles on the map. We spent hours fixing up our old truck. Whoever that was in Krasnostav today, on server US 1832, I will never stop playing until you are dead.   It might depend on the material. Calc 3 for me was literally the 3D version of Calc 2, minus the series stuff. Two was by far the hardest, but it was nothing compared to Linear Algebra..   I snipe a lot, and it's sometimes easier with the ACOG because there isn't a very large scope sway like with the powered optics.   I meant hoards of zombies, sorry about that. And stepppes, there's no need to be an asshole here, I'm stating what I would like in a game, my opinion. That's why it's an opinion. Don't talk to me about looking stupid when you can't even type sentences properly.  	28

 Cheers, ill check it out    Awesome thanks mate   Trying to find a reputable supplier who may still have Sony VTC4's in stock, can anyone point me in the right direction?  If not can anyone recommend an adequate substitute?     Cheers   [Looks familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh-FZcydhy0)    Yeh I just fall short of 38 hours a week but the shift allowances more than make up for it.    The shift work sucks, going from day shift to nights then back again. Also working weekends sucks. But its worth it with a little boy on the way ill have plenty of time to spend with him.    Again it depends on the trade, I'm a fitter and turner working in maintenance. Im on a 12 hour rotating shift roster (days/nights). Rostered on for 12 days a month. Pretty good money (between 80k-110k depending on overtime) with plenty of time off. Can't complain.    death by snu snu    Last sunday while I was working night shift we had a pretty big lightning storm pass over Melbourne. Now I love watching storms, so I thought id climb to the top of the highest point of the factory which is basically a big tank used to store recirculated water from the plant.   So here I am, relaxing and enjoying the view for about half an hour when I look around and realise the reason I have such an awesome view is because im at the highest point in a 2 km radius.   Yep, sitting on top of a huge metal frame thats supporting this tank, in a fucking lightning storm.   Now i don't exactly know,  but that could be considered pretty fucking stupid.    Ah k yeh i know where you mean, theres a better one in the back left hand corner of emu bottem, part of the same creek just further up. Its nice and private. Pretty chill area.    the one at the back of emu bottem reserve?    http://www.gofundme.com/flrd1k   This is my mum, she has not been dealt the greatest cards in life. Although she worked her arse off as a single parent working her way through university while raising 3 kids.   Her passion in life was nursing and was on her way to becoming a midwife. It was all taken away from her due to a debilitating injury at work that left her unable to go on with her career. After the accident and unavoidable surgeries that followed, she was left with a difficult battle with depression and other medical issues that really impacted negatively on her way of life.   Now because of her previous qualifications (which are now usless to her) she is unable to qualify for government funding or assistance to help pay for a course to be able to return to work and generally improve her life.   She was always worked so hard and selflessly for my siblings and I and I just want her to be able to do that. So please, if you could take a minute to have a look and help an amazing person out of a shitty situation.   Thanks   Im with me partner who is 20 weeks pregnant, no sure that will be too fun for her haha   	13
 Jews   I agree it's tough to imagine. I see it as a trickle-up effect. Which actually has a better chance of working than trickle-down, because trickle-down has failed miserably.   The issue with that is, we already DO have enough resources for everyone. Ownership is what fucks it up for 90% of the world.   What do you call a man with no arms and no legs floating in a pool? Bob.   Good idea, actually. Do that for a year and report back.   I just watched a documentary on Stress. Baboons, after being observed for 30+ years, went from being a serious, violent hierarchical group to being a communal group with little violence after the highest males were killed off by disease. And this continued for generations and was resilient to change because every time an unfamiliar male baboon came into the group and tried to dominate things, the group basically neutralized him and he became part of the commune.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, let's remove (that is, strip them of position) all the most powerful people in our society and watch the world flourish.   Thanks for the comment. It was a casual match.   Love it  	8
 Flathud blue version, he said it in his Jag video. Trust me I'm not fooling you.   "Oh great and powerful one, I request that you present me with 300 Disco Beat Down unusuals."   Assuming they turn into ham and the only thing that remains of the person was the shape, no.   There's a truck near my house that says "HALE" on it, there's also a street named 'Market GR'. Also there are places you can buy the Fourth Doctor's Scarf which is what the Chronoscarf looks like.   Ironically this is in New Zealand and not Australia.   Walking into something to kill you is allowed, you could add in a rule where being dominated means you can choose your own weapon or something.   [You can take League, I'll take the scrap] (http://i.imgur.com/okJiStT.png)   Selling TF2 items over PayPal for a profit is illegal because you're making profit using what Valve created. ^^/s   He's on his second account.

Of course I changed my email minutes before getting it and can't trade for 5 days :[]   I'd send you phishing link and gift wrap it to me, duh.   Stocket Launcher is great though, and changing servers can be done if you need to   Wow, I've never gotten a Scraptip before, Thank you 3   fuck outta here   You could give your one to the other person then autobuy another.   Imagine a whole server agreeing to this though, after a while everyone would be using the same items, I want a whole server to do this and I'll run around SOASing everything.   He posted this 50 times. I got 50 notifications saying "This asshole has left a comment on your profile" and had to delete them 1 by 1 for like 20 minutes.   Very simple premise, start with whatever you want, but the moment you get killed you must switch to that class and only use the weapon that killed you.   Did you just get killed by the Eyelander? You Now are forced into the Eyelander until you die, at which point you switch to whatever killed you.      You are allowed to use items that aren't in the same equip slot, for example the Tide Turner/Wee Booties or a Soldier backpack.      Have fun letting Rockets kill you so you can use rockets.      Also you should use the Auto Buy thing from scrap.tf before you do this, just to make sure you can use all the items you need.   There are literally 60 left.   Because a) Easy profit and b) Some people are so rich they don't care about .66, I wish I was that cool.      Then put it in my hands, I'll never headshot anything.   Get a Hale's Own Machina then put the part on later, the part counts starting from when you got it.   I was on a 24 hour Dustbowl server and I ubered out the gate. My Soldier jumped away and left me ubered at spawn doing nothing, a Spy is blocking me so I throw the uber to him and he wipes out the Heavy I was in a call with and 3 other players. The spy gave me a 5 ref for being a cool guy.   Omg dude you use the :] face too? This is amazing I thought I was alone!   It doesn't add to the conversation as a whole, but it does add to 'Sir or ma'am'. I personally downvoted that comment but can understand why it would be upvoted.   [I'm sure you can do something with this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps)   This makes me not want to ever pop, that idle fully charged sound is too good!   It was probably an autoban that you can appeal on their website, assuming they have one.   People don't like seeing 'Upvoted!' comments, they don't add to the conversation much.   [/r/wehavetoomanytf2subwaysandwichespleasestopmakingtf2subs] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)   Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like?   Wait so if I put like an Australium RL on the market and it doesn't sell for a long time I can get the message of finding it ingame?   Make like a tree and *fuck off.*   Farming kills isn't that bad, considering that you did have 6,000 kills, it's morally not that bad.   Sorry about your items and all, but why do account hijackers take such stupid items sometimes? I've been hacked before and they took like 4 ref worth of uniques and a strange weapon while all my cosmetics were safe. This dude took most of the cool stuff and... A unique Degreaser? And two backgrounds?      Anyway the Amby is pretty good if you're a good aimer, I'm more a fan of using the Enforcer because Kritzkrieg is disgusting on that. 144 crits? Forget about it, more than I ever needed.   There was a 50/50 chance of this being dumb and enjoyable.   Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty2Hotty would Super Sayin Fuse together and win everything.   Wait the Usos are his kids? Yo I had no idea. I think I just stopped caring about Rikishi by 30%   Is this why I found pictures of Pennywise when I searched for Scotty2Hotty Worm Gifs? Because there's a new IT film?   Stinkface will always be better than Mr Socko, anyone can bring out their dirty jizz rag, it takes a real man to sit on another man's face.    That's [Scotty2Hotty] (http://i.imgur.com/6C8xW.gif)   [W O R M] (http://i.imgur.com/AL5mliA.png)   I don't get it either, restriction weapons sound like Halloween exclusive weapons.      Spy. I hate Spy but he looks so good, very classy.   Heavy looks like my cat.   WOOOO!   Thank you.      Tony Stark?   I clicked because I wanted to know what it is.   George W. Bush wanting something that is basically a conspiracy itself? *Seems legitimate*   Personally I've never been a fan of the black paint, Tinge is so much better. The black paint looks like there is nothing there. Tinge however I like because it looks so crisp and clean.   This HUD is pretty, give me it now.   spy :]   Sorry about the 'Thanks!' spam, I'm just a really nice guy in real life and I say thanks to everything, so it kinda melted into tf2. If there were a 'Sorry' bind you'd hear me say that more than anything.   To be fair, 2Fort Snipers are pretty bad anyway. I wanted to play the game on the bridge not the respawn screen.   What an odd request that is, if KonKitty doesn't sell you them I can get you some.   I'd assume that like 4 of the downvotes are disagreements, the rest are people jumping on the bandwagon of downvoting op because everyone else is. It happens all the time, it's pretty much the reason contest mode exists.   *hey guys there is a 0 at the end of mine there is also a 6*   I'd rather see bitching than people trying to make puns that match my name, that usually has discussion linked to it.   I use Zataoichi anyway so I hardly ever need a Medic, it's also great to hear "DUDE WHAT THE HELL!?" whenever possible.   I charge off a cliff if someone Quick-Fixes me and I'm Demo. It's fun.   "If the Buff Banner got nerfed..." Doesn't look like a pun set up at first glance, it appears to be a discussion of sorts, I expected something about MvM to be a hot topic for that thread, but no, it's a pun.   "Scout seems to enjoy break dancing. You could say..." does seem like a pun after reading it, but I originally saw it as a possible discussion on many things, from an SFM of Scout breakdancing to a mod to make every class dance.   Knowing how many puns are on this sub, I saw "Why don't snipers use jarate all that often?" and assumed it was a pun.   "The Medic knew taping together his broken mug wasn't the best idea... " is the only one I knew for a fact was a pun instantly.   These aren't always optional to click or not click with the knowledge of them being puns.   It's better to have them there than have them here. The puns are killing this sub they can go beat a dead horse all day.   Oh boy do I have some   Kicked for Racism (I called the admin a moron and apparently that's a racial slur.)   Kicked for using bitch weapons (Direct Hit)   Kicked for Pubstomping (I like using Kritz, sue me)   Kicked for hacking (Dindu nuffin)   Kicked for hacking ("Become satisfactory, obtain hehehecube")   Kicked for hacking ("Dude this sniper... Hackey McGee over there.)   Short Circuit is the only one of those that is a *hard* counter.  Spycicle is easy to deal with, just keep wm1ing for two seconds and you'll probably find it, Pyro isn't even the only counter, Soldier's splash can reveal a cloaked Spy.   DDS just means you need to wait for a second to shoot them, Sniper isn't the hard counter to Sniper, it's Spy.   Amby.   Who cares what he said, there's too many puns to hear what was said. Please return to /r/tf2dadjokes    I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror!   I can tell you what I'm saying, I'm saying Happy Cakeday.   If we can have everything by this guy added, that would be great.       On the bright side, I can get easy karma from nsfw subs. You don't get downvoted there, it's great.   It makes Projectiles useless. Demoman gets fully shutdown by a good Pyro. Soldier with Gunboats is screwed, Engineer can be stopped if he's Rescue Wrangler. It's a part of the game that with skill counters any skilled or unskilled players, spend 20 hours practising Airblast and you just stopped Soldiers and Demos from touching you.   As a Red Medic, suck it nerd lol red 4 life   [](#flair "request")    The problem with that is, you'd need to give damage falloff to the stock, which it does kind of need, but it would change Demo drastically if he wasn't a direct pills only kind of guy. If there was an added Grenade Launcher with +projectile speed and -something I would use the hell out of it, I like hitting shots more than killing, it just feels better.   To quote my Key Pad 5 bind; "Fuck people who airblast"   Also RS has like no skill required, it's somehow easier than wm1.   Unless it's a Gunslinger/Kritz, I put my Team Shine/Flames on a vintage Kritz because I don't have 28 keys to throw around.   Kill me now.   I'm so sorry for you, somebody showed me a pro ks unique bersaw and I cried.   I agree with you, but it may be a problem.   Whether it be 'Sappers now recharge like in MvM' or 'RD_Asteroid removed' or even 'Sniper and Spy removed due to complaints about being annoying', what patch notes would be perfect for you and what would make you switch to CS:GO?   Red Tape Recorder, You've got a disorder.   Some of these Medics... HELLO, NURSE!   You just really suck.   Rated comment.

 it a utter shit show that i'm surprised is still on the air   so you went into the designated smoking area and complain you smelled of smoke when you went home?   a large majority of people both young and old don't like the greens it's been this way for a long time   people would switch the tv off if they did that lots of people don't like the greens   as i said if a kid is being unreasonably loud and they can't control it they should leave it's as simple as that.. that's the respectful thing to do they can easily feed the kid at home if they cannot control it in public  other people shouldn't have dining experiences ruined because some little brat won't keep quite  it's not that people hate kids it's that people are sick of parents that allow kids to continue being loud or often run around the restaurant or whatever..      if you are unable to quite the kid down you should leave as to not disturb everyone else around you that's the respectful thing to do  other people should not have to put up with a loud child no matter the age of it      what the woman did might of been a little harsh but lets admit it we've all thought about doing it when a parent just lets the kid squeal and scream in a public place because they are too stupid or lazy to control them  when i was a kid if i did what this woman's kids did i would of been in trouble because my parents knew how to control us and respected the people around us.  really sick of the parents that just allow kids to run around screaming in public and make excuses like they are finding their voice or we where all kids once.. those excuses just mean they are bad parents that can't control their kids     i hate to say it but i'm getting sick of hearing about gay marriage now.. every fucking article/news report etc etc almost every day of the week   does the majority want change though?  still a lot of people who are against gay marriage    imo the last time we had a hung parliament and ALP needed to make deals with the greens etc is what made people hate the greens   The job cuts were always going to happen email has taken over for the vast majority of people I cant even remember the last letter I sent or received that wasn't a bill or something  Parcels are what everyone uses auspost for now   Maybe America should finish one war before starting another   it higher than most people earn some miners are on 150 or more   this kids attitude lately has been getting on my nerves he just can't take any criticism from anyone  he probably still thinks he wasn't at fault for the crash either   making pokie machines "plain packaging" would do nothing to stop people gambling just like making cigarettes plain packaging did nothing to stop people smoking   the new logo looks far better anyway, they were kind of asking for it with the old one regardless of how pathetic is it pursue them for it..

still be losing money as costs would be the same  just because a CEO has money in the bank doesn't mean they have to run the company at a loss that would just lead to workers getting fired in the long run when they lose more and more money   mining isn't as profitable as it was years ago even she has lost billions.. a small pay cut so workers can keep the job is not greedy they could of easily sacked them instead  it's the same of any other business no matter how big or small if they are not making money workers are the first to go or take pay cuts   Ricciardo is overrated imo due to last year  yes he beat vettel but his wins came from Mercedes having issues and safety cars   considering these people would be on good pay anyway (some would be on 100k+) a slight cut to a wage is better than losing the job   practically every country in the world that has freedom can do what you just listed   i expected to see stupid comments like this   i don't even have the game but just because you are not having issues doesn't mean other people are not  besides no PC game should have a fps cap even if you can edit a file to change it   i think they know a lot of people don't like the future crap and will make a ww2 COD to gain back people who probably won't buy black ops 3 or ghosts 2      i knew Ferrari would go after bottas the sooner they get rid of kimi the better  don't get me wrong kimi was a great driver he just doesn't have it anymore   there is always a way just look at china etc   if they are cutting career mode out of the game this year they are likely never going to put it back into the game unless there is outrage from the fans   they need to take a break from super hero movies over the last decade there has been WAY too many   it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.  sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.  the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.  then you have broadcasting which in many areas is no longer on free to air tv and attending races costs an arm and a leg and probably a liver as well   they can't many businesses and people use them all the time for legal reasons  they can't seem to grasp that VPN's are not just used by people wanting to pirate   fair use probably comes into play with other sites regarding copyright on most of the stuff they post  when you just take a pay porn video and upload it for free it breaches it   don't be so sure about that labor isn't in a good place and the greens won't ever be elected as a large majority of people still hate them   people already know they'll just have incentive to sign up for the VPN's   it will be easily for them to block sites like pornhub etc as many of it's users upload videos from subscription sites   i'm not a homeowner but you'll be hard pressed to find a home owner who would be happy to see the value of houses drop and they don't have to be rich to think like that   actually a large majority of people are.. labor is self destructing and people still avoid the greens like the plague so don't be surprised if they win the next election   living in that hellhole he'll be used to explosions   it's more the potential for him to go lone wolf like monis did   the fact he's threaten to kill people in the past and the courts went easy on him  he clearly supports ISIS  man monis did similar things and they screwed up by not keeping a eye on him letting 2 people die when he finally decided to kill   Queensland Liberal and panel member Steve Ciobo was unapologetic, saying he believed the only reason Mr Mallah was acquitted of terrorism was that the terrorist offences "weren't retrospective in application", and that he would be glad to see Mr Mallah sent out of the country.  so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring  he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society  if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis         good hope they didn't die instantly for the pain they've caused people   foxtel can celebrate all it wants it's a few years away from falling apart   good luck getting people to vote for the greens  a lot of people hate liberal and labor but still won't vote for them   they are not going to give up areas that people live on it just won't happen     this is why i believe the word racist is starting to really lose it's meaning and impact now  it's thrown around like candy even if someone is just criticising someone without bringing up anything about race    this is the 2nd time he's lost control of the car since the upgrade in Canada  is he struggling with the new engine upgrades or just unlucky?      that's about all they will get no way in hell they'll get back any areas we live in  and honestly who would be willing to give up their home/suburb etc to the aboriginals  lots of people pretend to care but are more than willing to continue living here     	54
    The eyes made me weak and quiver. Oh lord!   All day. Everyday. Mmmmf..   My brother is his doppelgnger. He's had people approaching him asking his for photographs and autographs. He just goes with it (for the women) but he says it can be very tiring.   I would find so many things wrong with my place just to keep them around.   I never realized this... My brain...   He*   No. He got caught somewhere under my house and we couldn't get to him. We would let him play outside (as long as someone was always with him) and my dad was outside with him, left him out, went to find him and he went under the house. We had no way of getting him out. We died under my house. I was 11 and cried for three days.   What's a kd   I miss my ferret. I know Pedro is in a better place though.   I'm just saying. Doesn't really look like her.   You sure that's actually her? Because it doesn't look anything like her facially.    I don't believe in prayer. And I'm pro choice. Yeah, no rally or prayer meeting for me. I just don't like people messing with my state. If you want to leave the state, by all means leave, you won't be missed. I don't go around bad mouthing where you live so don't do it to where I live. But thanks for stereotyping me with the people who are no doubt the majority. I just wanted to let the original guy who insulted the state and moved away that he wouldn't be missed. That's all. I could care less about what's said or thought about me on here, just that I'm not the typical Texan. By all means bring your down votes. I give no shits about it.   Do I give a fuck? Lets check the board. Show me "Do I give a fuck?" [X] Ooo looks like I don't.   We don't miss you here. 3   I enjoyed this   Lucky guys..   What if I told you that icon says 73 on everyone's phone   It's a stock pile of bacon for a burger restaurant. It was on Food Network.    Milo and Elijah Peters are twins that like to have sex with each other bareback. The top is one of them, so I'm pretty confident the bottom is his twin.   Adalia Rose?   It's a small juvenile sunfish. It may be small but definitely a sunfish.   But he said  I'm not annoying anymore lol    The black obe. obe   Compactors?   The song that plays when she locks eyes with the different people and the screen goes red?   His company has a new line of shoes. He doesn't, because he's dead.   [He died in 2010.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen)   Someone bought Hostess. News is that twinkies will be back on shelves sometime this summer.   That's really cool! I love all the little things in Tarentino movies. I just finished rewatching this and started Vol. 2 for the hundreth something time.  * **the shoe says "fuck u" on the bottom of it**   Good for her, good for her Fantastic handwriting too   So I wasn't the only one who thought he looked familiar.   I'd rather support this thing than Adalia Rose. He looks like ~~Chunk~~ Sloth from the Goonies. I fucking loved that movie. The way they chained ~~Chunk~~ Sloth up. Brilliant.   One of my favorites said "shaving the excess skin off your foot and using it as parmesan on pasta - justgirlythings"   I was wondering when the typical "post my alarm system panel because it says fap on it" post would appear. Have seen it in a couple weeks.   It kind of looks like America   Actually, I would say the same top three! I know Detox will definitely get in there. I like Ivy and I do agree, I hate the way they say her name. I liked Coco at first. Then she let Alyssa being there get to her so badly and now all she does is play the victim. Alyssa has gotten over it (except for having little digs at Coco every now and then, which is understandable to me being in the competition setting. People are going to try and put you down.) I would like Coco even better if she didn't have that attitude. Roxxxy is all body and face. No substance in my own opinion. But as far as top three, Detox, Alyssa and Alaska are the best predicted for it. I would want either Detox or Alaska to win though. But, if Alyssa gets that $100,000 maybe she could fix that overbite!   I think these top 7 all have something they're talented at. Obviously for Jinx and Alaksa it's comedy, Alyssa is a dancer, and they all display it well. Even though I'm disappointed with what she's done so far, Detox is really talented. She is a great performer in her own right, but I know she can do better than what she's given us on the show.   No one this season has any talent whatsoever? If that's your opninion then so be it.   You really haven't seen much of her work outside of the show, have you? She's brilliant and every bit as talented as Sharon. Yes she and Sharon do the same style of drag and they think a lot alike, but that is a bullshit answer as to why she got onto the show. I don't disagree that Sharon had some doing with it, but nevertheless Alaska is earning her keep. She needs to change it up like Michelle said this past week and that she's getting predictable. They said the same thing about Sharon. Sharon is all about spook, Alaska does more "glam". They're both unconventional. Alaska is doing a great job.   I only down voted this because you were lazy and used "ur" instead of just typing out the word itself. Sorry.   Most of the major universities in Texas have quidditch teams. Not weird or wtf.   This is a picture of the site where JFK was assassinated. They made a movie starting Kevin Cotner exploiting the conspiracy theory of there being a second gunman who delivered the fatal head shot. In the movie, Costner kept replaying the footage in court, narrating JFK's movements in response to the head shot, that he moved "back and to the left."   Don't worry OP. I know what you're referring too. I don't agree with the second gunman theory myself after studying it so much and physically going to the assassination site, but I know.   I'm gonna go ahead and say boat?   This is genius.  *thank you for enriching my life with this image*   Seen it in Galveston, Corpus, South Padre and Port Aransas. I've seen it so much, it lost its wtf value.   Stu from Sean Cody. What a hottie!   This guy is a convicted child molestor if I'm correct. So maybe he hides children's underwear?   I think it was originally posted in r/wtf a few weeks ago. I commented on it saying "Paint me like one of your white girls"   My fancy is tickled. Thank you   I third it   You must really like downvotes   Bad form OP   I love eggs, but eggs with the orange faces of human babies are better   I am going to call that he pulls a reverse Micheal Jackson and turns into a black woman, instead of a white woman.   I bet it's bigger on the inside   :O Justin's butt I'm dead   "diva antics"  Love it   These seasonings are really good. You can put that shit on everything.   Above any girl up there, Willam is my absolute favorite, hands down.    Boy or girl, I would submit to anything Raven wanted me to do.   I saw it, noticed it, saw who was wearing it, moved on. I'm not a fan of Alyssa.   Him and David Tennant (10th doctor)   *their   Yes!...they know..it's a multi pass...   I would do anything to have sex with Jake Bass. He's one of my favorite porn stars.   Dealing with religious friends is tricky. If they love and care for you, the fact you're gay shouldn't be a big deal to them. You're still the same person, you just decided to share an aspect of your personality and life with them you hold value to. If they have issues with it because of their religious beliefs, they should have enough sense to look past it. If they don't, I wouldn't say they really cared for you. But don't take it offensively. They're missing out on amazing opportunity to know someone who is courageous, strong and just brilliant. I've had really religious friends who have beliefs against homosexuality look past it because of the relationship we have and for who I am. Hang in there. I never really believed it when people said it gets better, but now I can say that it gets unbelievably better. I became so much closer to my friends and my life is looking up. I was so low. I have nothing to look forward to but the top of the hill. I hope this helps. Good luck and love yourself.   Darn! Oh well. Thanks for letting me know though!   Source perhaps?   If this isn't a repost then I don't know what is   It's riddled with Doctor Who references. I've only had one person respond and know what it all means. Nice fellow. He just stopped messaging me one day. Don't know why. I always watch what I say. It happens a lot. Maybe I'm not saying the right thing? I would have no clue since I've only ever had one real relationship.   When I came out to my brother in November all he said was "About time you told me! I was wondering when you were going to do that." I told him because he was the only person with me when my ex broke up with me, via text. It was so great to tell him! Made me and my brother so close.   I try to make it as honest and fun to read as possible. After three years of going out to places to meet guys, and the same amount of time on dating sites, I've only had one boyfriend. It lasted for a good seven months. I've been single for nearly 5 months now so I need to get back into it.   I just joined that site a few days ago. I'm hoping all goes well. It's my third dating site. I don't do well in real life.   Not eligible for the Darwin Award.   Imagine having them both at the sme time..   OP can you give the video? Thanks   I thinks it's sad there are people like that.   Didn't look like her to me  	79
 I had some extra cash, so I got the bundle of all the stamps,plus 1 more. Was it worth me jumping around the servers with a giant hat and having everyone ask wtf is that? A little. I wouldn't do it again. But I am a supporter of all the maps now, so there's that I guess.    Ugh, the Cherry Blossom Festival is the worst. Tons of people and vendors to look at trees. They're pretty enough, but I don't see the appeal to hang out in huge crowds for something you can see at  times when the crowds aren't there.   I believe Adblock will let ads play if the sponsor pays them. Pretty shitty of them, really.   I got the [Philateler](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Philateler) for a day. Same premise, but for buying the most stamps in TF2 for the day. Rolls around at 7 pm CST. I played the hell out of TF2 that day, it's actually a pretty cool, HUGE hat.   Reboot? It's an ongoing series...    If the PS3 won't play .mkv files (or other ones for that matter) it will transcode them (convert them on the fly). This, however, slows down your streaming speed as it uses much more processing power, and you can end up having to wait every once in a while on your buffer to fill back up as you try to watch it. The better option is to convert your video file with something like Handbrake to a format your PS3 will play, and use that file on Plex.   What about Friday Night Videos? I think they came out around the same time.   I remember the first time we rented a VCR and a couple movies. Movies without editing or commercials at home was absolutely awesome.   I can't count the number of times I woke up to either the beeeeeeeeep of the off-the-air signal or white noise.   Searching the couch cushions for the TV Guide was a national pastime.   Back in my day, we spun a dial on the phone corded to the wall to make a call, our long-distance calls were kept to a minimum because they cost so much, we had 4 networks on TV and the only cartoons were on Saturday mornings, we didn't need seat belts or insurance to drive around, our electronic entertainment was playing our albums at 78, our sandbox games were erector sets and legos, all our food was prepared on the stove and in the oven, and our doors were never locked.     We had 2 channels each for NBC, CBS, and ABC, one on VHF and one on UHF. Doubled the variety of shows between the soaps and prime time.   I think I broke my brain a little trying to read this.   WiFiKill, but I'm a dick, so.   It's all about how you present yourself.    lol I can't believe all my searching around didn't pop this up.    Imagine the time it's taking to develop this amazing skill, the painstaking hours upon days upon years to be this good.   But if you want real karma, snap a quick pic of your kitten.   Reddit appreciation.   [Internet Speed Meter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.internet.speed.meter.lite) shows your data speed at all times. I'm addicted to seeing how fast I'm transferring any type of data as it's happening.   Yeah, that's the one I wasn't quite sure about. I've only just started rewatching them in this order (after a good year of watching any of them at all) and haven't gotten that far yet. I only put it first because it was aired a year earlier, but included it in season 5 since the production code is for 5. Should Halloween be watched after What Color? I don't remember if it showed any links between the 2.    I grabbed some from [IconArchive](http://www.iconarchive.com/category/movie-icons.html). Lots of goodies there.   Yeah, I just did it a week ago, and the db edits survived an update as well.   I think I read about the IOS thing, I don't believe anyone had a solution for it.   NOTE: This won't work for IOS clients as The_Dogg pointed out. I'm using a Windows client and it works fine. It should work fine for Linux as well (If you're using Linux, you probably have the know-how to edit the steps to work for you.)  This took some Google-Fu to get right. I took info from a couple of articles and forum posts. No one had everything right for me (I'm using Win 8), but all the pieces were there. This pops up whatever icons I wish on my Rokus. I have maybe a dozen libraries, and when I'm scrolling through them I couldn't see the names of them or tell them apart except for the type and the library I'm about to select. So here's what to do...     Get your icons ready. I made mine 240 x 240 .png images, and they work great. Put them in a folder on the same drive as your Plex server (I keep an icon folder for such things.)    Shut down your Plex server. I missed this one my first time through and it really didn't like it.    If you don't have [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?icn=tabz) then get it, and install the [SQLite Manager plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/). If you have an alternate way and the know-how to edit SQLite DB files, all the better, and you'll have the knowledge to deviate from the next steps as needed.    Find your file com.plexapp.plugins.library.db. Mine is in C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-in Support\Databases\     Make a copy and put it somewhere safe. Backup, backup, backup should always be your mantra whenever you start fiddling with stuff. Always.    Go into your tools menu in Firefox, and select the SQLite Manager.    Select "Database" at the top, then "Connect Database". Change file type (right above the Open and Cancel buttons) to "All Files", navigate to the folder containing your com.plexapp.plugins.library.db file, and open the file.    In the left pane, select "library_sections". In the right pane, select the "Browse   Search" tab. You should now see all your libraries with their accompanying info.    Either highlight the library you wish to edit and hit the "Edit" button, or simply double click on the library. You'll see all the fields in a separate window. It helps to drag and expand the window.    Field 9. user_thumb_url ( varchar(255) ) is the field to edit. Some folks said they could simply put in the url of an image and it'll load, but it never did for me.    Put the file directory and name in. My icons are in C:\Users\username\Icons\ so with an icon image named KidsMovies.png I use this format...    **file:///Users/username/Icons/KidsMovies.png**   (Note the 3 / characters after file:, 2 of them is an escape character so it has to be nulled as I've been led to believe.)    Press "OK", "OK" again, then "Cancel" to back out of that window, choose another library, and repeat. When you're  completely done hit "Database" at the top again, then "Close Database".    That's it. I had to reboot my Roku, but it works great, and flipping through the libraries is much nicer. Why this isn't an option in Plex, I have no idea. Doesn't seem like it would be hard to implement an option to edit the db within the server itself, but I'm not a programmer.    Hope this helps someone!  edited: note   Futurama was my first experience with having to change things manually in Plex, took me a while to figure out how to get the specials to show. Now I am breezing through them pretty quick. Copy/paste from TVDB for stuff. The season covers won't show up since Plex is having issues trying to load data, so more Google-Fu for covers and paint.net to trim them up. I just put the specials in with the regular season episodes for correct chronological viewing.   Almost done with season 2 now...   I wanted this too, so I figured it out with some research after finding no list out there anywhere. [I posted the list here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/2uvfbo/correct_viewing_order_of_the_venture_bros/)   I have them on Plex, which follows the airing order according to TVDB, so I'm in the midst of manually changing everything in Plex. Fun, fun, fun.   I was reading the wiki, and read that CN aired the first 3 seasons  out of order, and the production codes were out of order as well. I never did find a list, but Wiki says that the DVDs were released with the correct order. After some Google image searching I found the back covers of them and made my own list. So here it is...

Says the person who must go in and comment on the comment on cats.    I've been told a couple of times you only need 5 or 6 for good streaming, but I really don't know for sure.    Co-inventor of the high/low five.    By doing on to the most have.    I've had this too. I assumed the buffer was empty and that skipping back was just an alternative to freezing the screen while it reloaded a bit.    Yeah, but it works well, and simplifies things.    So did you get your info?   And another learns the value of backups the hard way.    Yeah, that got me at first too. What I missed was the folder title, not just the episode titles.   Change them to what? I have this issue, and have to change every episode. I use Filebot to name them as Doctor Who (2005), the folder name is... oooooh. Doctor Who. Damn. Ok, good advice :)  edit: Changed the folder name to Doctor Who (2005) and it got everything right. Nice catch, thnx.   [Also, check this app out.](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/04/29/new-app-nandroid-manager-gives-rooted-users-full-control-of-their-nandroid-backups/)   I'm looking at my Titanium Backup Pro backups now, and see the following...   Accounts   Application Widgets   Bluetooth Pairings   Call Log   Country, Language, Time zone   Messages (SMS   MMS)   Wallpaper   Wi-Fi Access Points    With a custom recovery (which I'm assuming you have installed) you can do a nandroid backup, which includes absolutely everything. I remember some time ago (I haven't needed to fiddle around with flashing for quite some time) that there was an app or something that pulled data out of your nandroid so you could just restore what you wanted out of it, though I don't recall the name. It's on XDA somewhere (which really should be your first stop on all things Android.) TB also will pull apps + data from nandroids, but I'm not sure about other info.  As far as a backup that you don't need root to backup and restore app data (and possibly other things, you'll have to research it) as well as just the apps, Helium can do that.  I am, however, at least a year out of the loop. I used to wipe and flash my phones almost daily just playing around, but between TB, Helium, and my nandroids, I had most everything covered.  edited: more stuff   Dear God, don't hide that! Women love the idea of taking a virgin almost as much as men.   Did you consider just synching them to Google Drive or something?    I have to admit I have no idea who you're talking about.    Mine was downvoted into oblivion. I learned right off the bat that the reddiquette is a pipe dream, and that valid comments with merit which don't follow the popular mindset are utterly skullfucked to death. So I simply stopped commenting or even reading opinion pieces, and stick to questions asking for help with stuff (Android as an example) or interesting news and other junk like that. I just have different options than too many redditors, and how they handle honest debate is a too disheartening to be a part off.   Dying over and over. Gotta mess with one's mind.   Yay! More happy for me!   Oooo, no, I installed Fast a couple years ago and hadn't felt the need to try a different app, probably because I only check my Facebook once every couple months. But I'll dl it and see what it's like, thnx for the tip.      Plus, this is the internet. "Best ever" doesn't even come close to applying here.   This is Reddit, where /r/trees is a default subreddit. You think you're going to get non-biased answers to this question here?   Yeah, you can wipe cache, there are plenty of good apps that will do this for you, but if your phone is usually laggy, cache probably isn't the problem. If you really want to help your phone, delete apps that you don't use. Then look at the big ones, and see what options you have for those. I don't use the official Facebook app myself, I use Fast for Facebook. There are good alternatives to lots of the large apps. But too many apps, or crappy ones that intrude into places they really don't need to be, are one of the biggest lag problems. If your phone is especially old and long out of warranty, CyanogenMod ROM or the like can really help alot, but unless you know what you're doing, rooting and installing a custom ROM takes real time and research. It's something you don't want to do until you understand all the ins and outs.   100% wrong. Factory reset will wipe apps, accounts, contacts, etc. Cache is just a chunk of memory where data is kept by various apps for quick access. Your dalvik cache can even by wiped without losing your apps. You lose nothing by wiping cache.   Cigarettes. Nuff said.   Same boat here. I usually bring up I don't like them in my life, and go from there.   I'm pretty sure he was asking about opinions about relationships, not whether drugs are moral or not.   Well, since they aren't real, I'll just go with magic.   I've had this happen a couple times, didn't get our drops either time.   PUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH ON THE CURB!   I pay mine online monthly, choose auto-refill for the discount, then cancel it a couple days later. Been doing it for almost a year.   She was a dead fish. I mean, as soon as things heated up, it was like I hit a switch and she lost the ability to move. It felt like I was raping someone I slipped a roofie to. After a month, I couldn't take it. Way too creepy.   I got a bonus out of it though. I can say I had anal with a high school math teacher.  	62
 Good for you! I do math for a living.  Perhaps your anger comes from having political opinions that differ greatly from fact.  That would just eat away at a person of reason.  Relax and just let the science in.  Trust me, you'll sleep better!   That's a very short list.  The list of attacks by Islamists in America is much larger and from a smaller population.  Bayes Theorem says Islamists are more violent than the Tea Party.     I'm awaiting your criticisms of Barrack and Michelle Obama taking separate Christmas vacations to Hawaii and Colorado requiring double the security staff and taxpayer expense.  George Bush stated he chose to stay in DC during Xmas so the hundreds of support and security staff could be with their families.  The Obamas? Not so much.   Please show me where Tea Party members have committed any acts of violence.      Sorry you can't tolerate a different viewpoint.   Another sob story from Michelle.   She was so oppressed she had to settle for a Princeton education.      I'm sure he's traumatized. /s   Maybe you could ignore the post or respond intelligently instead of attacking the source.  Truth does not have a karma rating.   There are those here that have no problem with govt intimidation given it comes from Obama.  The IRS targeting political dissidents for example.   As usual, the liberals of Reddit do not wish to discuss the content of the article, only to attack the source and mock opposing viewpoints like good little Stalinists.   That's a convenient way to dismiss a viewpoint that doesn't coincide with your own.  Have a great day Stalin!      Yeah, let's ban different viewpoints! /s      Even Obama is embarrassed of this clown.   The Democrat Motto: Wahhhh!  It's just not fair!   This entire thread demonstrates the mantra of the American left:  Tolerance for those who agree with me.   Now we have Matt Damon.   Given the -100 karma is among naive Redditors who are still shitting high school food, I'll take that as a compliment.      Factual reason has been voted to the top and gilded?  Signing off before I'm disappointed again.   Lack of condemnation is condonation.   Reddit /r/politics: All for fighting against NSA spying unless a conservative is leading the charge.   Sanders wants to attack capitalism. Paul wants to attack an over reaching government.  I believe the latter is a greater threat to liberty.      The biggest mainstream fallacy in modern times is that evil does not exist any more.   The terrorists appreciate the sympathy from the Islamic apologists in /r/politics. They will slaughter you last.   You're right!  I've edited the original post.   We've had a terrorist attack on our citizens on our own soil and not a peep from the President.      Sadly you are fighting the mathematics of demographics.  Get your burkhas while they're cheap.   Just because you personally have a belief doesn't mean it should be federal legislation.  Edited: This applies to everyone.   Britain is already lost.  Europe will almost entirely fail to Islamists within a century.   To all the downvoters: Who will defend your rights when they are denied?      Funny you have no criticisms of the Islamists that wish to force their way of life upon you.  They are murdering innocents as we speak.   Are you scared?   But let's get back to those intolerant Christians.  /s         Amazon rarely makes mistakes.  This is one of them.   There is a large swathe of Americans that support tyranny if it advances their agenda.  They think problems are solved with more and more and more federal government spending, power and programs.      Liberals literally cannot wipe their privates without a government program.   Just think, Obama wants to prevent employers from discriminating based on criminal history.   This is called anecdotal evidence and holds no merit whatsoever in forming an opinion one way or the other.     Because people like Barack "If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. Period." Hussein Obama are still taken seriously.   At least when someone's kids burn alive because Ms. Wax is unable to  perform physically, the parents can comfort their anguish by knowing the NY Fire Department celebrates diversity.   And the politically correct fascist mob backs down.  In a free country one would be able to decide who to sell their property to.      Federal control of our schools is a colossal failure.  Disband the Department of Education.         "The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."  -Barack Hussein Obama   And this is why you are part of the 97% of America that would never physically resist fascism.   In before the gargling of Muslim semen by the naive Reddit 'intelligentsia'.      Maybe if they shot a black man with a criminal record Obama would help.    But centralized economic and social control is great!  Just ask a Democrat!      'The claim is just as bogus now'  The article has actual accounts of businesses closing as a direct result of the minimum wage hike.  Facts are your kryptonite aren't they?   This is insight that reveals a truth the American left does not understand: You can't control market forces and human nature through legislation.    When one business closes, another opens - happens everyday.  In this case, the new business opening will be in a different, more business friendly state.   Democrats have yet to understand that prosperity does not come from thin air.  It is created by business.  This wage hike, as many of us already know, will crush 100's of small businesses and increase unemployment.        I'm sure he's 'such a good boy' too!!   He is most likely a loser that can't get anyone his own age.   After the witness being killed in Ferguson, I'm not surprised he's changing his story.   Being told to "let them loot" by the mayor is not a ground level tactic, but a policy.         I'm so glad the mayor gave these poor, disadvantaged youths 'room to destroy'.    /s      I wonder how many Redditors would support the stand down if their houses were being burned or heads being stomped.      Democrats.   Guess who she voted for?   Baltimore:Democrat controlled since 1967.  Poverty and dependence?  Yes we can!   Facts are kryptonite to Democrats.   But he was such a good boy!!!   There he goes again, lecturing us instead of inspiring and leading.  Amateur since day one.   /r/politics: Condoning Democrat crimes since 2005.      A glimpse into how our federal masters are living.      We just need to spread the wealth around a little more and Baltimore will flourish!   /s            Don't text and drive!   They might as well let the players drink beer also.  	92
    i just picked up a Gstar TL3.  needs some beating before it flies understable like TL.   I have one of these shirts having grown up in FDL.      I purchased the Weber Genesis in Green of Amazon a couple months ago.  It was delivered for free to my backyard (I helped the driver).

 [Meta] could we get dates next to the issues so we know which ones are current?   After numerous setbacks, the Great Wall of Liechtenstein is halfway to completion! Only the actual structure is halfway complete, the defenses and enforcements will take longer. The wall is expected to be completed in February of 2030. For now, the parts of the country that remain wall-less will be defended by a sturdy white picket fence. That is all.  Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein /u/test_subject7429   This year was rather in eventful for Liechtenstein.  Our eternal leader unveiled his joint project with France, the AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicle. This vehicle can be exported to any country willing to pay and only France and Liechtenstein hold the rights to manufacture them.  Second and lastly, Hchste Kaiser offered refuge to monsoon victims and offered supplies and refuge to all involved in the Argentina conflict.  This has been Hchste Kaiser's Word 2022. Tune in next year for your only yearly choice in national news.  Next: TV Static with Hchste Kaiser   Looks great, man!   Perfect. They'll arrive in 2 months.   Liechtenstein can build you AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicles for $600,000 each.   Then I assume we nominate/vote for new members. Though I don't know about anything since the chairman stepped down.   It's for the security council. Everyone can be in the alliance permanently, but the Sec Council has 3 permanent seats that have been voted on and 4 temporary ones that we vote on periodically..   Liechtenstein would be honored to participate in this event.   Liechtenstein is deploying Spectres and SHIT squads all over the effected areas to help with rescue and relief efforts. We are also willing to take on a limited number of refugees and cooperate with other countries for more complicated relief operations. Finally, we'll be sending food, water, and medical supplies with the squads.   Liechtenstein will send a team of scientists and $500 million in support of this project.   The permanent seats are already filled though. And they're, you know, permanent.   Alright, then. We've sent all available scientists to help complete the project.   Liechtenstein would be willing to send scientists if not for a seat on the council then simply for the advancement of technology.   It was good, man   You can expect them in a month.   They should arrive within a month.   You should get them in a month.   You can expect them within the month.   The Hchste Kaiser had a chuckle.   Hchste Kaiser congratulates you on your coming to power and has sent you a 9x6 painting of himself. Stare at my beauty.   Liechtenstein is present and votes to officially recognize all proposed nations excluding Indonesia.  I would also like to propose that we discuss how to respond to various countries' (Iceland and Indonesia to name two) manufacturing of chemical weapons.   Today, Liechtenstein and France are proud to reveal the newest addition to their arsenal of military vehicles, the AT-23 Spectre. These lightly armored vehicles are capable of conquering even the roughest of terrain at a moderate speed in any weather. With brand new tire, shock, and suspension technology, this vehicle can go through much rougher terrain for longer periods of time than the older models. This vehicle will be able to hold up to 7 people, can support weapons attachments to the top of the vehicle, and is prepped for all environments. Liechtenstein is currently ready to mass produce and export to any country with any specifications. Average price per unit will be ~US$600,000. Currently only Liechtenstein and France hold the rights to build the AT-23 Spectre.   Aye for all four.   Sweet   Liechtenstein welcomes you to power and has sent you an invitation to he a guest judge on Liechtenstein's Next Top Model. Judge my women.   Question: as a normal member do I still have the ability to vote? Or is that just Security Council?   Liechtenstein congratulates your coming to power by sending you a jar of Hchste Kaiser's Own Raspberry Jam.  Spread it on your women.   I was ecstatic when I was able to find Liechtenstein!   To clarify, Liechtenstein is willing to take refugees from either side.   OK, thank you for clearing that up.   Due to lack of information, Hchste Kaiser has decided to refrain from armed participation in this conflict.  We are willing to take on refugees, but only a limited amount due to the size of our nation.  We will also be willing to deliver supplies to different countries depending on their standing with Liechtenstein. Besides that, Liechtenstein is taking no sides and will not participate in the actual fighting in this conflict.    [Meta] Seriously, though, I have no idea what's going on or how this all started.   You will receive a formal invitation before the next season begins.      Oh, sweet! Thanks!      Welcome to your yearly programming of Hchste Kaiser's Word 2021! We're your new news team!  To start things off, the reason why we're here. At the beginning of the year, our great leader personally executed the previous mess team upon finding evidence that they were leaking confidential information to the terrorist organization that was attacking the country and other nations. He ended the executions stating that betrayal will never be tolerated.  On a lighter note, Liechtenstein announced the plans for its very own car company this year! So far all we know is that Kaiserwagen will be selling all over the world and will include cars of all types.  Next, the terrorist organization that had been attacking innocent civilians and government facilities has finally been out down. A defector informed The government of the organization's location and, upon further investigation, SHIT squads were sent in and all terrorists were either killed or captured. The next month after questioning, all captured members were personally executed by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429. The organization's leader was never named.  Continuing military news, the government revealed its intentions to design and mass produce a new military all terrain vehicle. The vehicle is being designed in collaboration between Loechtenstein and France and is expected to begin mass production within this next year. Designs have yet to be released.  On a much sadder note, our great leader revealed that he had, until recently, forgotten his own title. And then, to add insult to injury, Hchste Kaiser offered diplomatic relations to a leader that was no longer in power. The whole country joined our great leader to wallow in depression for a few days.  Well, that wraps it up for Hchste Kaiser's Word, your only choice in Liechtenstein news. Tune in next year.  Next: Hchste Kaiser Dancing With the Stars   Hchste Kaiser greatly appreciates the company.   News travels to Liechtenstein very slowly. Hchste Kaiser has retired to his home and has once again, begun binge eating ice cream and Taco Bell. He invites all of the country to join him in his embarrassment.   Despite the controversy that the seizing of power has caused, we believe that the instant decision to declare war on your nation is a very rash decision. Therefore, Liechtenstein would like to extend its congratulations and hopes that, upon the reopening of the borders, Luxembourg would be willing to peacefully negotiate trade relations amongst other things with the people of Liechtenstein.  Hopefully,  Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429  Meta Edit: Shit.   Hchste Kaiser commends this decision from the AI.   ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   Given Liechtentein and France's relations in the past, we'd be honored to join the ACE.   Devil and God's artwork is a photo by Nicholas Prior if you're interested.   As a welcome gift, Hchste Kaiser has sent you a minivan. Fill it with children.   Oh you! *blush*   [meta] well now I'm all excited to get home and do this. I hope my subpar drawing skills will be enough!   The Hchste Kaiser has just discovered that he has been spelling his own title wrong for years. He is currently in a fit of embarrassed depression, binge eating nothing but fast food and ice cream and watching Liechtenstein's Next Top Model.   [Meta] Exactly   Originally the time frame was to try and go into the mass production phase within one or two years (if that's realistic enough), but with your help it may be even faster.   [meta] I'm planning on drawing something up when I get home later.   Liechtenstein accepts the offer. The investment and scientists will most certainly help speed up the research and prototype processes and help us move into the mass production phase much quicker. And of course, in exchange for the help, France gains the right to mass produce them on their own.   [meta] Mine is more of a Humvee than an AFV. Only like 1,000,000x cooler.    Excellent. We'll inform you as soon as your vehicles have been prepared.    We're planning on the vehicles to be lightly armored, most likely able to carry six people (maybe multiple sizes), able to support light weapons attachments, and we're researching new tire, shock, and suspension technology that can last longer and withstand rougher terrain. These vehicles can be painted however the receiving government sees fit and will arrive ready for operations.   ~signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   Liechtenstein actually just announced its intentions to create a new all terrain vehicle for their own military. We'd be willing to export to you once production begins.   Liechtenstein has sent a German shepherd as a congratulatory gift for your coming to power. Pet him or offend me.   Starting next month Kaiserwagen will begin designing and producing all terrain vehicles for Loechtenstein's military. We hope for a lightly armored vehicle that can hold at least six men and support attachable firearms. These vehicles will, in theory, be able to maneuver Liechtenstein's mountainous terrain much easier than our current vehicles. Along with the vehicles, Kaiserwagen will be researching a new form of tire that will be more durable and last much longer in the rough terrain. Liechtenstein is accepting help with designs and has plans to export to anyone that inquires.   Good. Let our positive relations begin.   This is nothing new. Hchste Kaiser has personally executed many prisoners. Mostly those that have made personal threats or attacks on him.   Today, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 personally executed every captured member of the terrorist organization that had formerly been attacking innocents for well over a year. After the capture of their leader and the disbanding of the group, they were kept away from the public and questioned for just over a month. Early this morning, a verdict was reached and it was announced that they were all to be executed. At noon, all men, looking battered and beaten, were lined up and, one by one, shot by our eternal leader. The final execution was that of the organization's leader. His name was never released to the public. Hchste Kaiser explained right after executing the man that his name will never be public knowledge because, "He did not deserve the satisfaction of a legacy."   Hchste Kaiser welcomes you and has sent you a basket of many breads. Enjoy its wheaty goodness.   Hchste Kaiser despises the color yellow.   Liechtenstein is interested in joining.   What's the difference between small front overlap and moderate front overlap?   It is with great joy that I personally announce the end of the never-named terrorist group that attacked facilities and civilians all over the country. With the help of a defector from the group, we located their base of operations and SHIT squads were immediately sent in. The group was found to be much smaller then we had anticipated, just over 50 members.   SHIT squads were met with gunfire upon entry and the majority of the group was killed in the ensuing firefight. The remaing 17 members, the still-anonymous leader included, were captured and taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation. Once questioning is through, punishment will be dispatched posthaste. Terrorism and betrayal to the nation won't nor will it ever be tolerated and the punishments these men receive will be just and deserved.  I personally invite all citizens of our great nation to celebrate with me. On this momentous day, a group of murderers was put to an end. Finally, we can rest and our country can return to the prosperity it knew before.  ~Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   Liechtenstein commends you for the way you think.   Hchste Kaiser has sent an annoyingly large bouquet of flowers as congratulations for your coming to power. Smell them or insult me.   Ok, I gotcha. I hope that's just as fun for you as being a country!   Well color me confused.   [Meta] So are you Madagascar again?   Hchste Kaiser has sent a pig in congratulations for your coming into power. Eat it.   Liechtenstein is authoritarian and capitalist.   Liechtenstein is interested in joining the alliance because it is against socialism. If its government ever becomes an issue, we are willing to leave.   For f***ing yourself or authoritarianism?   Hchste Kaiser has sent finger foods as congratulations for you (finally) coming to power. Eat them or hurt my feelings.   Hchste Kaiser has sent an assorted cheese platter as congratulations for you coming to power. Eat it or become my enemy.   Hchste Kaiser kindly tells your alliance to go f*** itself.    Sith Lord of Korriban is best lord of Korriban   How does the alliance feel towards authoritarianism?   Highest GDP per person, broOOoOOo   You don't got nothin' bro. Just silly accents.   NEW ENGLAND SUUUUUUCKS!!!   Hchste Kaiser is forever thankful of your gift. I will raise them as my own and train them to be my heirs upon my extremely unlikely death. We hope this means positive negotiations far into the future between our two great nations.   Go kick his ass and tell him that Madagascar is nothing without a leader   Kaiserwagen's catalogue will include all kinds of cars from the consumer minivan to super cars designed by the country's top engineers that will soon be available for purchase by people all over the world. Hchste Kaiser has given the company his blessing and hopes for its success in the long run.   Do it. You'll be immune to all diseases forever!!   What will happen to Baobabia now?   Mine was already there. Sorry, I just felt bad for not filling mine out yet.   Hchste Kaiser has sent a fruit bouquet as a congratulatory gift. Eat it or offend me.   You just reminded me that I need to fill mine out. I'll do that soon.  	91

       But we can say things like:  Here are reasons A, B, and C to go vegan. You will be in good company too! Former Vice President Al Gore and Senator Cory Booker are vegan. Google searches for the term vegan have risen sharply in the past few years. Even athletes like 9-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis has adopted a vegan diet. The mainstream is rapidly acknowledging the importance of choosing a compassionate, vegan lifestyle.   I'm not suggesting we say, "go vegan because it is normal." That clearly won't work.  I'm suggesting we still use logical arguments to advocate veganism, but also make it more palatable to people by reassuring them that they are making a decision that is normal.   The eggs that you eat are not fertilized so there is no need to worry about any baby chickens inside the eggs.  However, there are baby chickens dying in another sense. Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.  The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).  The story for dairy is much the same as with eggs. Cows only give significant amounts of milk for a period of time after birth, so they are repeatedly impregnated to keep up the milk production. The males do not produce milk, so they are separated from their mothers shortly after birth. Cows suffer greatly when separated from their young. [Here you can see a video of a mother cow crying for her calf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBnZPJJ2QG4). The male calves will be slaughtered and sold as veal.  Once again the milk production of dairy cows also drops off after a few years. As shown in the image above, they will also be sent to slaughter at a fraction of their natural life span.   You're right that whether or not something is seen as normal or weird is not a valid reason to determine whether that behavior is ethical, but these factors do play a role in whether people are willing to seriously consider the idea of veganism.                                  Would you be willing to collect some water samples before you leave?   I like the numbered pockets   Wow, this looks a lot like /u/VeganNoodliness' [submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/SummerScavengerHunt/comments/38z3a7/22_a_game_where_points_are_awarded_for_tossing/).   Except this submission, importantly, has bean bags and says it is a bean bag toss game.   Yeah, I would downvote that guy's lousy submissions while begrudgingly giving him points.   Why does this child look like it is about to cry? What did you do?      [The United States is considering new dietary recommendations along those lines](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/19/eating-a-lot-of-meat-is-hurting-the-environment-and-you-should-stop-top-u-s-nutritional-panel-says/).   Look at my comment you responded to again. I did not cite Harvard as a source.   Yes, I did read the whole thing. Did you read the position paper of the American Dietetic Association yet?  EDIT: Also, how do you think the conclusion "The risks of feeding this excess protein don't seem to apply here" supports your claim that there is "growing evidence that meat is necessary for infant development?" The conclusion as written supports that idea that meat won't necessarily have a negative impact on infant health.   That is not a study I referenced. Are you sure this was supposed to be a response to me?  I am citing the position papers that the world's largest dietetic organizations have published on the subject of vegetarian and vegan diets. They have looked through all of the research on the subject to derive their conclusions citing hundreds of pieces of evidence to support their position. A handful of cherry-picked studies cannot refute these position papers.   **Objective:** We examined the effect of protein from meat as **complementary foods** on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants.  **Design:** This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants (56 mo old from the Denver, CO, metro area) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats (Meat group; n = 14) or infant cereal (Cereal group; n = 28) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo.   It says there that the pureed meats and infant cereal were complementary to the breast feeding the infants were receiving. Did you read that and think that the mothers were eating pureed meats and infant cereal?  Also, something else you may have missed when you (didn't carefully) read these studies:  **Background:** High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity, which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy.  The study is stating that the excess weight and fat that infants gain from consuming dairy formula is a bad thing after the first few months (which is what this study was looking at).   [The law prevents much more than just taking samples on private property](http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/news/data-trespass-wyomings-fancy-name-for-ag-gag/). It has essentially stopped the collection of water pollution information in the state.   There is not growing evidence. You cited a handful of individual studies that were not looking at vegetarian or vegan diets as a whole.  For example your first study has a sample size of 14 infants fed meat and 28 infants fed cereal. It concluded that their meat diet had more protein than the cereal diet therefore the protein contributed to more growth. If they had fed a higher protein non-meat food, then they would expect the non-meat food to contribute to more growth.   Compare that to the American Dietetic Association's position paper that cites over 200 studies to support their position. My sources are reputable experts in the dietary field that have conducted reviews of all the literature. It is not some study that you or I are trying to take out of context to support our position. Can you find a similarly reputable organization that has reviewed all of the literature and come to a conclusion that supports your position?   A substantial number of animals in slaughterhouses are not stunned properly by the captive bolt guns that are commonly used, and continue down the kill lines fully conscious.   Many meat eaters also eat Halal or Kosher meats as well as chickens that are killed without any stunning, but simply have their necks slit and are allowed to painfully bleed out while fully conscious.   Another fairly common technique is controlled atmospheric killing. [Here you can see footage of that process from Australia's largest pig slaughterhouse](https://youtu.be/KArL5YjaL5U?t=1h23m13s).  Speaking hypothetically, if someone kills one animal to send a message, and in turn convinces others to change their behavior enough to save 10 animals from suffering in ways like that shown in the footage above, would you consider their action justified?   There is overwhelming consensus that meat is not necessary for a healthy diet.  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients.

Lian dropped down from the roof adjacent to us, her cat ears twitching. Her long black hair made my abnormally pale skin flush and I felt my canines begin to extend.   "Damian, you're fangs!" Lian gasped, her tail twitching. "They're extending! That means-"   "Yes, you and Lian must get to the Summer School for Half-Bloods and Magical Creatures (tm)!" mom shouted, branishing a shotgun. "I'll cover you two while you make a run for the bus run by Hermes!" I swallowed a sob. "Mom, you can't make me go!" Lian grabbed my hand and pulled me across the street, out of the alleyway and into the biggest kiss of my life. Our lips mashed together and I felt our tongue's battle in each other's mouths, like my sword fighting championships I'd won the past. We disentangled ourselves from each other and gasped.   "I love you." Lian said, her skin flush and red. I nodded. "I know, but I'm a vampire demigod who rides dragons, we can't be together." I said, looking away. Lian giggled. "I'm a 300 year old cat-girl who can fly and breath fire. We were made for one another." I smiled and grew my vampire wings, taking Lian into my arms. We flew off into the night and never looked back.      Hey Redditors,  My friends and I are working on a series revolving around Dragon Riders, and we were wondering if we can find any good places for information about the subject that isn't related to 'Eragon' or the 'How to train your dragon' bullshit. Thanks, any input is appreciated!    Magicwise, I don't want them to be too powerful in regards to magic. I was thinking about going the Sir Pratchett route and making them overstuffed idiots, but then I turned to you guys. Politically, they function like the American senate.   Hey Redditors,  I'm working on the government for my world, and I'm wondering what a mageocracy is and how it can work without the wizards and mages being too powerful.    Well, Dark Elves are friendly in my setting, but maybe 'The Lodge' could be run by an evil faction, like A.I.M. in Marvel comics.    Dude, totally. Everytime I sit down to watch the show, I'm distracted.   Aquaman has never looked so sexy   Hey Redditors,   I need some help coming up with some names for two magic labratories in my setting. One is run by Dark Elves and is more about designing and testing military tech (crossbows, elemental staves, swords, ect.), and the other is run by several different races and devoted to studying magical anomalies and new species of magic animals and plants.   Thanks!       Log 2  "Greetings from Jupiter harvest station 34. This Risich Dorun, the drone mantinance worker. Today was uneventful but drone 17 stopped transmitting earlier. I don't really know why, but I've sent a few tow pods to bring it back. Aside from that, Martyn my corgi has been perfectly adorable! If your watching this mom, thanks! I've got to go now, coffee break and then back to drone control!"  Log 4   "Hey viewers. Drone 17 came back today, but something is wrong with the video card. I ran the imaging though the computer and- well- it's weird. It shows the usual swirling gas clouds of Jupiter, but in one frame, for a millisecond, there's this shape in the clouds; like a tendril of something reaching towards the camera, but in the other frames it's gone. I've called my boss, La Runa and shown her the footage,but she doesn't believe me. Then again, it is a little far fetched. I'm going to send a few more E.Y.E. drones to the area and go to bed."

Dear listeners, something just slammed against my ship. Martyn is now barking like mad and I can hear the crunch of metal as whatever horror is outside.

I- "  End of log        I've had some ideas on how the mutants were born. I might write them someday.   Hey Redditors, I've been working on a science fiction universe for several years (middle school-college) and I'm finally ready to talk about the technology. The universe has a 'space western' theme to it, with a dash of modern tech (think Borderlands, but with updated computers ). Humans have colonized various planets in a new galaxy, but megacorperations are the governing force further out. I had the idea  to make 3D printing like a vending machine. The megacorps set up these house sized printers with scanners that can scan and then print out parts to vehicles and then assemble them with robotic arms. That's all I have time to write now, but feel free to suggest anything in the comments!  Thanks for reading!      The strength of the spell depends on the skill of the caster, willpower of the target and can only effect living targets, not intimate objects or the undead. You do stay sentient as the animal, but your clothing will either be left behind after the transformation or if the caster is strong enough.   Alright, the elements mentioned in the second paragraph are subtypes of the original four. And science is a big theme in the universe as a whole, and there is actually an explanation for 'ice' being a seperate type from 'water'. I have also decided to add 'classes' of elementalists.   1. Animators. These elementalists have the ability to form and manipulate their element into a 'golem' or construct to fight for or with them.  2. Pulverizers. These elementalists can use their element to devestating effect in combat by forming fists or smashing constructs to hit at a close range.  3. Sharp shooters. These elementalists can focus their element into a consentrated blast and attack from afar, dealing precision damage.  4. Blasters. These elementalists use their elements to strike hard and fast, causing collateral damage.  5. Protectors. These elementalists use their element to form shields or spheres of protection.    For mass, I was thinking that the extra mass is shunted to another dimension. However, clothes and weapons aren't changed, it's only the person who is transformed.   Hey Redditors,  I'm working on a mage character(he's deliberatly terrible at magic; think Rincewind but with extreme self estem issues), and a friend of mine suggested that the only spell he knows should be a polymorph spell. Any examples I can draw from? And how does polymorph magic work in your settings?   Water and ice 'elementalists' need to get the water from somewhere in the enviroment. Air elementalists can use surrounding air, Fire elementalists need some sort of lighter or firestarter to use their abilities, but once they ignite something they can control the fire. Earth elementalists can control amounts of rock, soil ect, but they need to be in contact with it. And as for the other elements I have in mind heres a list  Lighting, toxic chemicals, light, darkness, ice, crystal, plants/wood, certain types of metals, sound and the aforementioned radiation. In the story itself, there are five 'ultimate' elements that are just legends. Gravity, time, space and void.     I'm a English student currently at a community college and about to transfer to UNT. I have a part time job as a dishwasher that's helping me write by giving me time to think about plots and characters.    How do you do it?   Hey Redditors,  Working on a new series based in a future world. Humanity has branched out across the galaxy and some people and alien species developed elemental abilities. I need help finding cool ways to show off various abilities, like using fire to light lanterns, radiation to melt metal ect.    Thanks! However, I have another book in the works, so this one is a few years away.   The Civil War is still going on, but the war is because of the aforementioned artifact pieces. And race is still a major issue and the older generation is insanely racist.      Utility magic is more like energy that's used in everyday life. For example utility magic can be bottled and used to power a lantern. A mutant's magic is random and is more like a superpower and control is dependent on the skill of the user. They are born with a natural connection to magic, like speedsters and the Speed Force.   Dragons can fly and are similar to elephants in that they understand their owners and tend not to fly away. However, some dragons are fitted with a collar that prevents them from wandering off by generating a magic containment field if they go too far. And yes, for the most part dragons are domesticated, but some species can't be tamed and remain wild.     Hey reddit users, I was walking home from school today and I just got an idea for a novel, I want to throw it out there and see what everyone's reaction is. So, it's set in Old West America, around the 18 hundreds. Dragons are real and are commonly used for various reasons. The larger ones,(the size of elephants) are used as pack animals for settlers. The medium sized ones (about the size of a cow or horse) are used for transport and mail carrying. And then there are small dragons, around the size of a lap dog or cat, are used for companionship. Magic is used in place of electricity and is only just being used for utility proposes around the time of the story. Artifacts holding mystical properties are rare and are valued to the point of small turf wars breaking out for one, no matter what it can do. People can also be born with magic abilities, but they're essentially like Mutants, hated and feared. Slavery was abolished a century before normal and as a result interracial marriage is becoming popular, despite the previous generation being against the practice. However, the civil war has broken out over a two piece powerful artifact found on the North and South border. Since both sides want the whole artifact for themselves, war broke out. In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a young man named Ezekiel. He was the son of a Native American woman and a African American man, but was orphaned due to an outbreak of a mystery illness that almost killed him. Now, at 19, Ezekiel and a few other orphans from his hometown join the Pony Express. Aside from delivering letters, Ezekiel wants to find out more about the mystery illness that killed his family. He gets his opportunity when his dragon becomes sick and he's forced to stay in a small western town called Griffin Gulch.   Thanks!   I stood before the kitchen entrance, hands gripping my coffee mug. 'Hang in there' said the kitten on the wall adjacent from me. I cast a fleeting glance at my cubicle, my only solid rock in this turbulent office. Then I locked eyes with Annie. As beautiful as a elven princess and fair as a summer's day. I felt a tear slid down my cheek. I might not come back from this. I mouthed the words 'I love you' and entered the unholy realm of foodstuffs.   I saw the object of my prize and moved as quickly as my weary legs could take me towards the Machine of Coffee, a lantern of hope and power in a bleak and grey world. I slid my kitten mug under the spout and pressed the 'pour' button. Annie's fair visage passed by the doorway and I looked away from my prize for a second. A second too late, as the overweight, foul smelling Orc known as Pam the devourer. She slapped my mug out from the Machine with a fat paw and slid her own thermos in it's stead. Rage built within me as I picked up my mug and bashed it against hers. It became a battle of mugs as neither of us were going to let this sweet, brown nectar of the gods go. Then Mark of Accounting came in, a white box of doughnuts in his hands. My eyes narrowed. A new foe had entered the battle. This means war.         Dude, so proud of you!   When I was a little boy, I always got 'vibes' from people, especially those I'm close to, like my mother. I sometimes would mimic those emotions without any form of control. As a result, I became with drawn and read books to try and block out arguments or strong emotions. Animals also loved me and still do, but I never quite got along with other kids. Then I met a girl in High School who told me about aura readings. I was smitten with her, and over three years we learned about ESP abilities. I suspected that I was and empath, but I never got proof until today.   Hey Redditors,  Is there anyway I can subtly alter people's emotions by emitting an aura that matches it? And how can I see someone's aura?  	33
 Okay, thank you!   Did you have to take out all of your jewelry or were non metal materials acceptable and did you need to have dermals removed prior to having a lap preformed?   Okay, so I'm also getting an IUD at the same time as the lap and I'm really really nervous.   So, I'm wondering what the worse parts I need to prepare for are and mostly I'm wondering what people who have been through both think in general...     Cervix area, pelvic area but very deep... I've been tested for everything... Pee, blood, ultrasound... In the process of being diagnosed but my doctor is pretty confident... I'm trying to get a lap done.  Use enough lube for sure. And it hurts almost every time. It's like the worst lottery ever... Less deep positions hurt less obviously but pretty much every one but missionary kills me... And even then, still not pain free    Okay, I can work with difficult and my hair is fine and straight so I'm expecting my dreads to be thin    I'm looking for any tips, tricks, methods, etc to help with pain during/after sex as its a huge problem for me right now and I haven't gotten into a gyn yet...I'm on Toradol which helps my general pain but sex pain is still horrendous.   (Its high up, sharp, throbbing/aching, persistent pain at the top.)    Is a small flea comb for a dog, metal teeth that are close together and short/fine, suitable for back combing new dreads? (The teeth are about 2 cms long and less than a mm apart)   As someone who recently discovered their own bisexuality I'd say its most likely him learning about himself...Its more about discovery and exploring himself and his sexuality...I wouldn't worry that he isn't watching straight porn...  In fact I've found porn to cause trouble in relationships no matter what kind it is...  I'd definitely say that him being bi isn't going to make him cheat on you, it just means that he is attracted to people regardless of gender. He's still the exact same man you've always been with...  May I recommend you head over to r/bisexual for more advice if you  want more opinions of people who have good perspective on this.   Also, its rather intrusive to go through his history...That's private and I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it either...Being bisexual isn't a reason to distrust someone   Yeah, I still live with them so I think I'll hold off...   And I have no idea its honestly just been that way my whole life...   Thank you! If you ever feel the need to talk I'm here too!    Thank you so much for the advice!! I think you're right, I'm going to keep taking it very very slow! I think its a really big deal that even my boyfriend knows.   I really appreciate the advice, it seems like the most realistic perspective I've heard so far for me.   I actually have a bi friend and talked about her before it was even a thing for me and it didn't go very well..  My mom said it was probably just a phase and that she would figure that out after high school...That right now she is just being selfish so that she has more people to date. That she hates when people say they're bi...Like can't they just pick one or the other...Its greedy and they're just trying to be promiscuous and trendy. Because it is more accepted people think they are when they're really not.  My dad is quietly judgmental. But, I think he would ultimately accept me for who I am...Its honestly mostly my mom.    I've only told my boyfriend and my two best friends and I'm really really not sure how to tell the rest of the world yet so I thought I'd start with reddit.  I'm 20 and female I've only started openly identifying this year, by this I mean identifying as bi at all...  I'm mostly scared of what people will think, I was raised in a family that had the belief that gay and straight is okay but bi is wrong and greedy and slutty...So, obviously I still worry about what my family, friends, and strangers will say when I tell them.   Also, still dealing with how I myself feel about it because of this too...  Just wondering how you all coped with coming out and the consequences of it...with friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, family, etc.   Also, I don't use any hair products like gel or hairspray at all!! Does wonders too   I use a shampoo bar from knotty boy "for dreads" even though my hair isn't dreaded, its natural and amazing. And it makes my hair and scalp feel amazing...As well as soft for my hair...Its completely free of sulfates and silicones as well as any other nasties...  I ordered it off their site and it was around $8 plus shipping which was around $9 to Canada...Its lasted me over 3 months though and I've barely made a dent in it.    Thanks! I'm definitely going to look into this!    Unfortunately I live in Canada and its very very hard to get a card here...and I'm not 'fully diagnosed' yet.. But I really appreciate the input, I've been wondering if it would be a good option...I smoke recreationally and even that helps a bit.      Looking for more natural remedies to my pain which is daily and terrible...Naproxen didn't even take away all of it...  Or perphaps a better drug to take...Naproxen did screwy things with my stomach until I switched to Vimovo and its been reeking havoc on my memory for months.    Update: we broke up... But I'm already regretting the decision...   He's also still adjusting to me being bi because I only came out to him two months ago if that...  It probably does take some getting used to, and most days he's okay with it and actually encouraging.   	20
 For starters just last year he destroyed Gaza's only power plant. [source](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/gaza-power-plant-destroyed-israeli-airstrike-100-palestinians-dead) and destroyed At least 134 factories with reported losses of at least $70 million, Which combined with their attacks in 2012 and 2008 has crippled the economy. [source](http://mondoweiss.net/2014/08/destroying-rebuild-disarms)  Dont forget he has a history of bombing dairy farms which children depend on. [source](http://electronicintifada.net/content/israel-destroys-gaza-dairy-second-time/8766) and also hospitals [source](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/gaza-crisis-unsc-and-obama-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-live-updates) and even schools where people where taking shelter [source](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/israel-air-strike-un-school-gaza-rafah).  So ask me again if I think someone who is crippling an economy, taking land, destroying power plants, hospitals and schools, even taking away formula from babes is trying to wipe people off the map.  Edit* Plus [here](http://www.sott.net/article/283603-Netanyahu-caught-on-tape-in-2001-Dont-worry-about-the-Americans-we-easily-maneuver-them-This-is-how-I-deliberately-sabotaged-the-Oslo-Accords-We-plan-to-strike-Palestinians-several-times-so-hard-the-pain-will-be-unbearable) is  Netanyahu caught on tape in 2001: 'Don't worry about the Americans, we easily maneuver them' - 'This is how I deliberately sabotaged the Oslo Accords' - 'We plan to strike Palestinians several times, so hard the pain will be unbearable'.    And he is getting it.  If the American government took the $15-$20 billion it gives Israel every year and put it into a savings account for the 4.5 million babies born p/yr, every American would receive $8,000-$10,500 upon turning 18 years old.   Since the state was founded we have given their military a total of $121 billion.   In 2013, the Israeli GDP was $291.3 billion. But yet they still need us to foot the bill for his continued genocide.   And that is not to mention the loads of cash being used to buy US politicians, back room deals and everything else. So like I said fuck him and his Zionist bullshit.  Sources [here](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/18/some-of-israel-s-top-defenders-say-it-s-time-to-end-u-s-aid.html) and [here](http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/07/17/how-much-does-israel-cost-the-average-american/) .   Fuck this Zionist cockbag.   He is doing everything he can to kill Palestinians, uses our (US) money and weapons to do so, and then uses his Zionist AIPAC buddies to lobby/control US Government and foreign policy.   "By the way Iran (for the past 20 years) is once again 1 year away from having nukes. Don't you remember the holocaust? It will happen again unless you give us more money and weapons. We are gods chosen people and it is your duty as a Christan nation to support us." - Netanyahu every time he opens his mouth.  Fuck him and fuck his warmongering bullshit.

"We are confident that if we keep throwing money at politicans we will be able to stick our dick back in the customers ass in no time"  FTFY   This is a perfect opportunity for gamestop to save some face and make some changes to their policy. All of those games could of went to Child's Play.   For those not in the know, here is a little about Child's Play from their [site](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/).   "Since 2003, weve set up and organized Childs Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 70 hospitals worldwide. Over the years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise millions of dollars.  Childs Play works in two ways. With the help of hospital staff, we set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. By clicking on a hospital location on our map, you can view that hospitals wish list and send a gift.  Childs Play also receives cash donations throughout the year. With those cash donations, we purchase new consoles, peripherals, games, and more for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow for children to enjoy age-appropriate entertainment, interact with their peers, friends, and family, and can provide vital distraction from an otherwise generally unpleasant experience."  It's a solid charity that helps children and brings the gift of gaming to those who need it during a difficult time. This could do amazing things for Gamestop PR wise. It honestly makes since and why Gamestop isn't already doing this is beyond me.     12 year olds dude.   We know.   And my old computer can't run it without have a stroke. Well fuck.         That's the point. Cop says he is going to arrest the dog. He has to let the dog out of the car to do so. When he opens the car door the dog "attempted" to attack him. Which put the cop "in fear for his life". So then Mr. Porkchops here gets to shoot the dog and get off on not only the murder of an animal but any and all repercussions.       Drake the type of nigga who wipes his ass and flushes the toilet after he farts.   That was my thought on it. Something as rare as that should have something amazing with it.     Im all for the gays getting married. Because if they ever get divorced its not gonna be messy, since the gays are a very clean people.

Run a headline like this, immediately drum up support for intervention. Run a headline that the United States destroys a civilian building and kills hundreds, it only drums up excuses at best.  I guess senseless murder is only evil when it's the other people doing it.     Uh huh.  	5
 Throughout the whole thing, I was trying to find some hidden meaning in what the old guy was connecting to her story. Like the Fibonacci sequence, or the fly fishing, but it hurt my brain too much lol   Nymphomaniac Vol. 1   Nymphomaniac Vol. 2  On Netflix. Has Shia LeBeouf. Watched it with 3 other guys and 2 girls. If it weren't for the fact that we constantly made fun of the overall strangeness, it would have been near impossible to sit through. The ending of Vol. 2 made me question humanity.   I cringed.   How did you acquire that position? I have a lot of free time, and would love to be making extra money rather than just playing copious amounts of video games.   Yeah, I read OP's story. Thought, 'Well, that wasn't smart dude. Definitely fucked up.' And then read the comments and saw this shitstorm of hate just berating the poor dude. He understands it was not the right choice, why the fuck must everyone start insulting him in every way possible?  	5

The scary thing is though Apple honestly believe they are **above** the law. And they have friends in very very high places....      What the fuck?  (_)   Unfortunately the NZ public have just put up a rod for our own back by not adequately backing alternatives. (Not helped of course by extremely piss poor launch campaigns. Here's looking at you Wheedle.)         What browser do you use? A lot of websites have iPhone optimised versions that significantly lowers the bandwidth.

I obviously realise there are many which are looking to the future already with smarter more ecologically friendly farms, and I salute those making an effort.    TradeMe is flawed anyway, and run by some seriously childish fuckwits.  For instance this was swept under the rug very quickly when it happened last year..

He needs to repeat this to himself each morning:  **Sometimes it's better to shut up and look stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.**   Good point. I had forgotten that little attention seeking outburst.      Honestly had no idea (but I don't watch that shit anyway) he was being "exploited". So i googled his name and xfactor only this news article comes up, so I kinda have to ask now after this has gone viral, who's exploiting who?    Rude.    Failing to see why it's the staff's responsibility to keep track of a grown man.   I'm sure the Interislander is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn't. The only way I can see to stop this happening is to ensure you hold a ticket of sorts which is stamped and crossed off vs a passenger list when you leave. (I haven't use the service but presume this isn't happening.) so while they could enact such a measure valid travelers would be severely inconvenienced by this.  And further more, by the time it reaches the destination, chances are (if he disembarked early enough) he'll be swept far out to sea.  I understand the Widow is pissed off and wants to blame someone, but at what point do we have to say shit, there's no point blaming the company as any measures taken to avoid such accidents are just pointless given if someone ultimately wants to kill themselves they will circumnavigate any measures put in place.      Some people need more copper in their diet. For this person, it would be wrapped around lead.   Cider also works!

Find one of your best local drop to bring over, should make it quarantine in your stowed luggage?                It's pretty appalling, there's zero evidence of any scientific investigation that the Antarctic can sustain this method of fishing whatsoever, and may ultimately decimate the krill population in these areas for decades.  Of course this isn't known for certain, but there is a balance, between krill population and predators, and humans are proposing to severely disrupt that balance for what? Animal food and omega3 tablets? Awesome.   I agree the Comcom are partly to blame here for allowing them to do this, Orion are being greedy fucks to begin with, and lying to the Comcom didn't help - they argued the increase was needed to pay for Quake damaged infrastructure, taking on more debt to pay out a $80M dividend I would take at odds to propping up the infrastructure? Hence my frustration at Orion, not the Comcom.   They do, but they didn't request the price rise, Orion did. I took your comment like it was the comcom who set the price independent from Orion.   Sorry you're wrong there, see TVNZ article from 2013: [Orion New Zealand Ltd has asked the Commerce Commission if it can increase its prices by 15% or around $8.50 per month for an average customer.](http://tvnz.co.nz/business-news/orion-proposes-power-price-hike-5533171) The ComCom did however strike this down and proposed a smaller 8.4% instead.   No, I did not make myself clear -  quite the opposite I wonder if they had pay deducted for not getting through a set amount?   As your comment is apt - the general attitude is at odds with their pay rate.   Judging the way things were run by the arrogant fucktards paid by EQC (who by the way were paid like $75 **per hour**) I'd bet my left nut there was a financial incentive (or penalty) for getting through as many houses as quick as possible.   Family friends had a run in with this cuntbag, he had a smug fucking "I am God" attitude. Didn't even look at the fucking house, take measurements, just eyeballed it and said the infamous "This isn't earthquake damage!" Made them feel like criminal just for lodging a claim. They appealed and got their own engineer to take a look. In limbo last I heard.  From my understanding, this is the guy they bring in to browbeat people into submission. Fucking sheer arrogance personified.  Honestly hope he burns in hell for the shit he's put the chch through.   Eh?      Treating the justice system like a pick and mix isn't how it's to be used.

Try a mates battery? (if possible?)  Try scratching your battery contacts with a sharp knife/pin?    A few things:  Glass screen protector is a must.  Buy a usb 3 cable as (at least for me) it didn't come with one in the box, which literally defies the point of having it..  To save battery life don't forget to disable "Samsung push service" and disable "auto update" in the Samsung app store, or it will reinstall itself.  Um.. If you're not used to using an amoled screen, I use Reddit sync with the specifically designed amoled theme (it's quite dark) which saves a considerable amount of battery life.  That's all for now off the top of my head. Enjoy your new device!    That is the true tragedy indeed.  Edit: did more research, and realized I was ignorant myself. Edited comment.   Disrespectful cuntbags. How fucking arrogant could you be? Fuck.   They have no idea what so ever how hard life was for these soldiers, who were young, and died horribly. They deserve significantly more respect than this.  Send these fucktards to the front line in Afghanistan, no bullet proof vests, a full clip and the shirt on their back.  Then let them come back once they realize what respect for your fallen countrymen actually means.   Yar, when the red tide's a flowing, we go around to Brown's bay.

They do 'random' audits to ensure you don't owe them money. However the biased fuckbags can and will fuck you over first chance they get.  For instance I was told a wee while back I had been audited (I can't recall exact years, but it was something like..) 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005. I didn't owe them anything so was squeaky clean. Oh, they didn't audit 2003 because they owed me about $500 for that year.   Yeah, pretty much.    Edit - as /u/TouchMyselfAtNight said!

They left a camera alone, respecting ops property. Gotta give them some wicked credit for that!    Next time start with this!     That's putting it quite bluntly, but yeah, I suppose you're right.   I understand that - but firing him would imply the company have no need for his role/have replaced him already, thus rendering the 4.7M sheer profit from his death. Which was further more hasten by their firing him to begin with. Very fucked up.   I more mean nowadays it requires more disclosure at least.             Thanks bud.

In fact every cellphone I've ever come across since 2010 comes precharged to around 60%.       [Source: Li-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  * Charging every night will not ruin your battery life. The key word here is **ruin**. Unable to find any conclusive proof however. Your battery will charge to 100% and then the charger will switch off, and your phone will discharge over many hours to a preset level before the charger will flick back on and take it back up to 100%. As the source indicates, these 'microcharges' can be performed thousands of times with negligible impact to the battery capacity.       [Source: See Table 2 which indicates charging 10% can be done thousands of times](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)  * Extra reading: However as evidence has [found it is best to have your device off and remove it once charged.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  * Charge your phone in Offline mode (or ultra-battery saving mode if you have it) will significantly speed up charge time. Really handy if you don't have a lot of time and just need a quick boost.       [Source](http://www.instructables.com/id/Will-An-iPhone-Charge-Faster-On-Airplane-Mode/)  * If you've forgotten your charger, but have your cable at a hotel chances are the TV will have a USB port you can use in a pinch. (Or if there are limited power outlets and you have multiple devices to charge at once)      [Source](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/07/charge-your-usb-gadgets-through-the-tv-in-your-hotel-room-when-travelling/)  * Try to avoid excessive heat unnecessarily. For instance never leave your phone in the sun on your dashboard, or by a window. Batteries really don't like being hot for very long. Once or twice is ok, but don't go making a habit of it.       [Source: "Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat.." Table3](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)  * If your phone has a tendency to randomly shut down, there is a chance your battery contacts have become too bad and need to be scratched. I've seen cellphones that wouldn't charge or turn on at all come to life immediately after lightly scratching the contacts with a sharp pin or knife.      [Source: actually my own experiences working for 3 years in a consumer electronics store.]  * Modern smartphones feed usually as fast as the charger can give it. As a result if you're hunting for a charger look for a higher amperage.      [Source: "Increasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much...A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent." ](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  That's all I can think of for now, there is a lot of misinformation out there and thought /r/Android could be a trustworthy place for others to be confident about their battery usage.   That explains why Ilam road was so damn quiet at lunch!   Better camera API.    I hope not too..      This was 5 years ago, when they actually had some shred of decency.   This was 5 years ago!          Between 2 and 3 percent (quick Google) are allergic to milk. You reckon they would alienate their buyers just to satisfy a potential 2 or 3 percent?             I see what you did there.   As I'll keep repeating in all these threads - our distances are deceptive. Add a good 1hr to most Google estimates for trips.  It's a stunner of a road to take, prepare with warm clothes should you get stuck, but as pointed out a decent frost in the shadows of those hills can make even a light rain or mist turn to black ice really quickly.  Make sure your spare is pumped up and ready to go should you come off the road/get a flat. Look at hiring some chains, but it is only May so you should be fine.  If you have the time, take the longest route you can, as I said the drive is just beautiful.  Prepare to take breaks, agree before hand to only drive from X to X before the other person takes over.   If you don't know the road, as it can be windy pull over and let the locals pass, they ~~might~~ will ride your ass if you're too slow.  And finally look for any waterfalls along the route, they can take an extra half hour to get to a random waterfall somewhere but it will stick with you for the rest of your trip!   *edit* FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PREPARE TO PUT YOUR CHAINS ON BEFORE YOU LEAVE! If you have to put chains on and you've never used them - it can take 30 minutes + the first time. That was in the garage at home. Fuck doing it for the first time ever in the snow, and then trusting your life to them.....   Red and black - Crusader colours. :)   First thing I disable. Plus books, games.. Etc. All that bloatware bullshit. They're clever buggers though, you also need to go into the Samsung App store and untick "automatically update my apps" as that will just reinstall it!

(I work at an nz energy provider, but don't dabble too much in this side of things very often and enjoy it when I get to.)   They way I see it is they went to the cheapest lower bidder and got burnt after having them hand made in Chch for many years with no problems at all.    No, which is ridiculous they 'create' a tenuous link between the two and report them as if they've found then smoking gun when some nutjob goes and kills someone!   Indeed.    I understand $35 million dollars is a significant investment, so while I can empathetic, I'm struggling to muster sympathy.  They are as you point out following the "rules" but ironicaly I believe it's the current rules set by the media companies in regards to contracts and agreement prices for set television shows (to ensure they get the best price possible) that is actually working heavily against the on-sellers like Lightbox etc.   I get the uneasy feeling the media companies themselves I'm sure don't want to see a Spotify-like company crop up as that might be seen as devaluing their product (E.g. Television shows) however much they actually make.   You can't really argue against them (such is the profit driven Hollywood Corporations attitude) which makes acquiring the TV shows and charging a reasonable price almost impossible as I'm sure they place certain strict caveats against how much you can charge/how you can provide the content via DRM etc.  However having been just a mere fly on the wall viewing geographic paywalls slowly disintegrating for a few years now you have to wonder why their research didn't better understand the current market trends, and look at successful content providers such as Spotify or Netflix and working with/against the DRM restrictions to provide a middle ground that meet the demands of the consumers with the requirements of the corporations you're buying the product from.  I will happily admit it's admirable of them to be attempting to penetrate the pirate ridden waters of on-line media, I just feel this article justify their position to be somewhat farcical.   What a complete bullshit article. Your product is only ever as good as someone wants to pay for it.   You simply cannot come to the party late, holding stale produce and complain when noone buys it.  Where was Lightbox 3 years ago? That was when the market was waking up to the fact we are no longer a captive market, around the same time as Adidas [basically made a sign with a giant middle finger and said FUCK YOU NZ](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/5410579/Adidas-stands-by-All-Blacks-jersey-price) you will pay what I fucking you tell you to pay by setting their RRP at a substantial rate above anywhere else in the world.  No, enough is enough. The internet has no geographical barriers, you can no longer justify business models that charge more simply because the IP comes from a different country.   And then when you do compete with the free and open available of content internet in this day you better bring the big guns.  Take for instance Spotify, they very carefully judged their audience and have an advertising supported, and a pay-as-you-go business model. The key reason they have survived and thrived for so long is they are smart about it. They don't limit your listening to certain tracks for Free customers or paid, they limit the functionality instead.  Why lightbox etc are still insisting on the archaic model of limiting content (and relatively speaking very out of date content at that!) to buying customers only is just beyond me.   You can't justify an aging business model with "Well the current system sucks, so I'm not going to change" cause that's just bullshit.  You can't sell water in a rainforest. We are no longer the captive market they love to price gouge off.  Companies are attempting to justify an increase in price just because they want someone to pay that much.      Actually [our oceans are fucked.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification)    But why do video games cop it so often when in reality there's no scientific evidence an otherwise healthy person who plays videos games has the tendency to go murder someone..

Who is the real winner with these contracts?      No, he just carries around a big "free manure" sign. /s     	131
 Yes   From all the bad batches I keep hearing about from here and there, I'm sure as fuck not venturing out and trying a new vendor anytime soon lol. I'm content enough as it is, even if some people say it's mediocre (which I don't think it is), at least I know what I'm getting.    I don't mind the taste, I just dislike the texture of a finely ground powder. I like my kratom coarse. Luckily my recent kilo is some of the coarsest I've had lol.   Floppycock syndrome.   Yeah, I find it strange that people think a find grind is a selling point lol.   That's how you know it's good.   You have a trust fund? Can I have some money? I give a great handjob.    I prefer coarse kratom. I find it easier for toss and wash. I could see why somebody who makes tea would like the finely ground variety, though.   I'm the same way, I can take all the red veins I want, and I can take green Bali, but any other green and any white veins make me feel like shit.. along with Maeng Da, too. I'm so envious of people that can take a white or green vein and catch a good energy buzz before work. I'm always falling asleep on my fuckin way to work. Lol. I would like to take just Bali in the mornings but more than a couple grams of it gives me fuckin nausea.    TIL red vein kratom is also known as Maeng Da, and you have to ingest twenty grams of it to get any effects.   It stopped happening to me ever since I quit doing somersaults.   Knotted Johnson.       http://www.lovebryan.com/friends/brunt/data/upimages/hippiespenismold.jpg   No problem.   Yeah I got it today, I took it with 2 g of green Bali and 2 g of red vein Thai. I wasn't impressed lol.   Drug of choice   What   You should have said "HEY. I DON'T COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND TELL YOU HOW TO TICKLE BONERS."   I don't like guides that try to get me to buy stuff.   Yeah, he obviously has some deep-seated issues. I attempted to skim through all his drivel and I'm pretty sure he's on probation and he lives in Florida where kratom might be outlawed soon. He'll have to come to terms with his own drug dependence soon and he's afraid, so he's lashing out. Hey, this armchair psychology stuff is pretty fun. I can almost see why he does it. Wait... no... no, I can't. He's just a stupid asshole. Yes. That's it.    Lol I know man. I commented in your defense on that thread. The sad thing is, he's not just a troll, he actually believes the things he's saying. I think he may be mentally retarded.   Yeah, everybody else is deluded. It's not just you or anything.    SWIM knows exactly how it is.   Oh shit. I forgot all about Opiophile. I was more of a Bluelight man myself.   Dude. There was a couple times I made the mistake of browsing the "dope porn"  over at /r/opiates. I was ready to hit the fucking darknet. That was almost as bad as seeing it in person. If I didn't have kratom, it would have been over.   So he chooses to be on kratom instead of hard drugs, and you say he's doing the wrong thing... yet you're forced to resort to kratom because you aren't allowed to do hard drugs, and you think you're doing the right thing? That's definitely backwards junkie mentality if I've ever seen it. You're just a fiend doing whatever substances you can get away with. Admitting you're a junkie doesn't make your actions better than his. Stop glorifying yourself.   Idk why the fuck you didn't take a picture of it man.    You obviously have a way with words.   Toss and wash. Is there any other way?'   I feel sharper on kratom, especially compared to opiates. On opiates I spend the majority of my time with my face resting in a bowl of ice cream.    Yeah. Apparently that note is 40 percent of your purchase, so you're gonna wanna go ahead and make sure you get that. I know I personally can't even enjoy kratom if I don't have a short note to read while I'm taking it.    I don't know. Call Bill Nye. Keep slurping soggy kratom water if that's what you want to do.    Yeah but HS doesn't send you a hand written note like MS does. I've been told that's an important thing to look for in a vendor.   But HS costs half as much as MS does. You must be lying.   No. You didn't get nausea the second time because you took (less than) 4g. The 7g dose was too much for your first time.    So definitely mix it with some Green Bali or some shit then? I suppose I was figuring on maybe a g of RVS with 2 G of Bali along with the 2 G of RVT/GS. Not real sure why i ordered it. I coulda got an extra long BBQ burger at Burger King. Them things are outta control.   VaginaHen66   Yeah it certainly doesn't seem like a good idea to use it daily, I guess I just had $7.50 burning a hole in my pocket. Lol. I look forward to giving it a shot though.   I do not experience this.... on a somewhat related note, does anybody else sneeze when they get horny?   I don't think "Long story short" means what you think it means.   In the snow. And we liked it.   You gotta wake up pretty early in the mother fuckin morning to get one past old TheMaddLib.   You crawled 10 blocks? Literally?   Everybody is different. I stopped for 10 days, about an 18 gram a day habit, and I only slept an hour a night for the first 7 days.... definitely not "slight insomnia" for me. Fuck that shit. Fuck it in its stupid asshole.    Alright I'm gonna have to give that a shot. I prefer mixing reds with greens so I would imagine it's the way to go.   IDK if I can stretch my pisshole wide enough to fit 2 grams up there.   Alright, so we all know extracts can fuck up your tolerance. I don't have much experience with extracts, I got some several years ago but I was shooting dope daily and therefore I never really felt it when I took it. Well, today I was on HS ordering some of my usual Green Bali and the Red Vein Thai/Gold Standard extract caught my eye, so I decided to order 2 grams of it. Does anybody have any experience with that product specifically from HS? How was it? My usual dose is around 5-6 grams, should I just take the whole 2 grams?  Is one dose of this extract going to fuck my tolerance up all that bad? Thanks in advance.   This never happened. I appreciate the effort you guys put into your site, though.   Dude. Those photos are pretty sweet. I like how they call one room a "drying facility", and all it's just a shelf with leaves hanging off of it and then the floor is just covered with them. lol.   Oh. I think my Ma did her thesis on it in college.   Thanks man. Interesting stuff. I like the idea of taking it as a daily potentiator. I've never really tried anything to potentiate other than grapefruit juice. I may give it a shot. Lowering tolerance a bit couldn't hurt either.   I read somewhere that a regular diet of tube steak helps your daily kratom doses just slide down your throat.   When I take too much and raise my tolerance, I just continue taking it at my same usual dose. The first and second day might not be as strong but it's always back to normal by the third day. I dunno if I'm just lucky in that aspect or what.   I would like to see those links please. Thanks.   Put it into a different container and just use a spoon to dip into it, rather than pouring it out.   Same here, drinking sucks. Kratom is wayyyy better.   You need to go to the hospital immediately.    Yeah that's pretty gangster.    Boy, I must be some sort of retard. I thought you meant send the kratom to a lab. I tried imagining your buddy sending a cooler full of urine specimens in with a sack of kratom tucked into it. Ha.   Yeah, like, he's gotta be a big shot, stretchin buttholes all throughout the land.   How much does it cost? I dunno the first thing about sending something into the lab like that.   Lol that's around my ceiling for the day, divided into three doses. I was being sorta sarcastic, I just thought it's funny Because it's not that much but sounds like a lot because you asked about milligrams instead of grams lol. There's a lot of people that take a lot more than that.   This guide sucks   I just wanted to let you know that I take 18000 milligrams a day. Don't act like you're not impressed.   It's the "The" part of the name that really does it for me. The Butthole Man. It's got a sick ring to it.    Yeah man they're fucked   "The Butthole Man" would be a great name for a porn star.   	66
       lucius fox is in the game         seriously what's the point in adding the solid gold jet? Why pay $10,000,000 for a jet when you can go and steal one from the airport and fly it around for FREE?  Rockstar should only add NEW things and not rehashed exsisting stuff.   That being said what stuff should be added in your opinion?    looks awesome!            Everyone always asks who should play Bond next (I think Henry Cavill) but not too many people ask who the next villain should be. So that's what I'm asking.  I'm thinking Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor (he was rumored for Bond 24) and Idris Elba would be good ones. (Yes i would prefer Elba as a villain rather than Bond himself).   Who are you guys thinking of?     	12

 i dont see anything wrong with this idea in principle, but i think it really depends strongly on what this guy wants/would want. If he WANTS a relationship but just doesnt want to take these steps, or doesnt have time or whatever, then it could be a really nice favour for him that he would appreciate. If not, he might not be too happy about it, right? Theres the risk of him feeling insulted or that you are overstepping your boundaries or soemthing like that.  i don tknow if this is something you'd want to ask him about first? like you can still take care of the whole thing for him just let him give you the okay first? OR if you definitely know that he would appreciate it without talking, then i dont see a problem with it and pleasantly surprising him with a few potential women who want to meet him. really, i think it all depends on this guys personal reaction to the idea.   i think a big difference between leaving a narcissist versus leaving a cancer victim is that a narcissist is generally capable to taking care of themselves ( even if they want you to believe they aren't); you are not leaving them to suffer and/or die, whereas by staying with them you are in fact suffering yourself.   also, at a certain point (and i think this is true when you are trying to help anyone) you have to let your own self-preservation kick in. If something is causing more harm to you than help to them, sometimes you have to save yourself instead. You cant let someone drag you down and ruin your life simply out of guilt for leaving them. You wouldnt allow a drug addicted or abusive partner ruin your own happiness for the sake of theirs, ESPECIALLY (when it comes to narcissists) nothing you do seems to even make them happy. I feel the comparison is stronger between nFamily and abusive partners than between n's and those who are suffering from illness or injuries.   There can always be some overlap; not every cancer patient has a heart of gold and sometimes sick people are abusive too, but in general i think the key difference is that you might hate caring for a cancer patient or invalid but you at least know you are helping them even if they dont appreciate it. but you are not helping or saving a narcissist by staying with them (and probably CANT help them anyway because its not that kind of illness i feel); you are only hurting yourself and letting them drag you down with them and ruining your own life for their sake. When you get to a point where you can realize that its either you or them, you have to choose you, because you are just as important as anyone else and deserve the chance to have a happy life just as much as anyone else.  edit: some words   i totally understand feeling regret over things from the past, even if it doesnt seem completely reasonable or worthy of regret. i usually refer to it as getting stuck in my head; stuck in a vicious cycle of bad memories, and it OFTEN happens when im trying to go to sleep. but it can happen anywhere and i think there is a way to force yourself out of that cycle, using willpower, and distracting yourself, and also learning to be fully HONEST with yourself about accepting the things you cant change, and cutting yourself some slack. anxiety makes it easy for you to be honest about your negative aspects, its a skill tht you CAN aquire to learn to be honest about your positive aspects, and to learn to be kind to yourself.   when im in bed having a panic attack over shit from highschool or family or whenever the hell long ago i like to just try to CLEAR MY MIND and focus on thinking NOTHING. sometimes by mentally repeating a word like "clearrrrrrr" (like a personal 'ommm") or a phrase like "just keep swimming" over and over (this one is good if im walking somewhere cuz its a rhythm) and if i notice myself thinking anything other than that i force myself to go back to my repetition; like meditating, and i will do this anywhere i need to; rushing to work, on the subway, in crowds etc. sometimes you just need something to stop the train of negativity in your head. again, its not something that is necesarily easy you need to practice it like a skill but it DOES get easier. and it works no matter what kind of anxiety im feeling; regret about the past, fear of the future, social situations, whatever. the meditation-style response has become very helpful for me.  i believe in you, its going to be ok 3   i think its normal and i think she will grow out of it to a certain degree, although sometimes they stay pretty chatty. i would just talk to her back; when my cat starts getting chatty i have a convo with him until he gets tired of it. Also, make sure she nots trying to tell you something: dirty litter, out of food or water, toy is stuck somewhere, could be anything you never know but my cat has definitely done things like that and tried to communicate about something specific.  beyond that in terms of advice; maybe earplugs? just try to be understanding and kind and not take out your frustrations even tho its annoying its not her fault she doesnt know shes being a brat! you could call her a brat though, thats fine :)      Awesome!    ok thats pretty funny.   oh my GOD it all makes so much sense now! thank you! and i see now that the "parent" comment was right there all along..  wow. just wow.   can and WILL  keep that in mind folks; no matter how hot you think you are now; wait 20 years and everyone looked ridiculous.  edit: spellings  	9
       here's my guess - nothing   I agree. Could've easily put Hill William or collected works vol 1 on here, but didn't want my list completely dominated by him   Couldn't narrow it down to less than three.   * *The Devil All the Time* by Donald Ray Pollock - southern, gritty, plain awesome  * *Crapalachia* by Scott Mcclanahan - incredible story telling about growing up in West Virginia. Funny and sentimental. Nothing else is like it  * *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball - dystopian novel with poetry like prose and touches of Kafka and David Lynch   I think the survey might have been skewed a little by giving the 5 most popular choices and a write in. I think people will just rather be lazy and opt to pick from their favorite of the five that they've read (often the only one they've read of the five, in some cases), rather than choose to write something in and throw away their vote, as the likelihood of a write in winning is slim.  I haven't read enough books published in 2014 to deem something "the best", but I liked  * *Silence Once Begun* by Jesse Ball * *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer * *Nobody is Ever Missing* by Catherine Lacy * *Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel * *The Absolution of Roberto Acestes Laing* by Nicholas Rombes * *Half a King* by Joe Abercrombie   Sanderson, Stephen king, the martian, etc... popularity over quality   Typical reddit list      That's the joke   http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2tqy4c/i_read_ulysses_and_you_can_too_beginners_guide/   I'm usually very against buying Early Access games, but not sure I can resist buying this next week. Is the EA more or less fully fleshed out? (Missing levels, bosses, etc?) Would I be better off waiting for an official release or buying into the hype now?  Also, any ideas on what pricing will be?   who cares, jodorowsky can do anything he wants to do in my eyes    And Terry Pratchett publishes a book every year, even still, and he's suffering from Alzheimer's. His books, if anything, are much higher quality.  Says you? I'll take ASOIAF anyday over Pratchett...   I'd rather him take his time than just pump out multiple works of questionable quality every year - like certain fantasy writers that will remain unnamed.   yeah, the gamergate comparison was both weird and insulting.   Where does the article mention a book being misogynistic because it had no men in it? Oh right, nowhere.   Maybe they thought stuff like *Post Office* was misogynistic by the way Bukowski just casually describes how he rapes a woman on his route like it was no big deal? Or maybe you're right - fucking hypocritical feminist bitches!   Looks like someone didn't read the article, since that point of view wasn't expressed in the slightest.      People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles.   Flannery O'Connor   This interview kind of sucks but Ball is one of my favorite authors. Extremely excited for his new book.      Every other week. Inter library loan is the shit   Lol get some perspective there chief      What are a few of your all time favorite books?  What are a few of your favorite books released in the past couple of years?                     Flannery O'Connor  Carson mccullers  Margaret Atwood  Donna Tartt  Ursula leguin  Cj cherryh  Etc         You are   There is a percentage done indicator   r/fantasy      200-250 pgs   One of my favorite books   The plotlessness/static characters are there, but it's a short read. I'm no DD expert but you still see a lot of his trademarks here - lots of weird quirky characters, lot of characters going off about philosophy, life, war, etc. It's an interesting novel where he compares football to nuclear war. Not his best but you probably won't regret reading it   It's basically showcasing what he would go on to do later - you can tell it's early work. That said, it was still pretty good, some great passages peppered throughout the book.   No   American psycho is great, a classic  Crash didn't do all that much for me, pretty boring. Lots of semen on steering wheels   *End Zone* by Don Delillo   I agree, but they are different. The movie is about Danny, and the book is about Jack   Cut down on tv and video games. You probably have plenty of time you could read, you just choose not to   Sometimes you just don't get a particular author, or it's the wrong time in your life to read a book.  As an aside Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut's most hyped (and still quite good) but not his best work, IMO               I've played civ 4/5 and fallen enchantress :lh , so I'm mostly familiar with the concepts of this game. I wasn't sure how to go about cities/districts though. should i rush new cities? How many cities should I be aiming to build and how quickly? When should I build a district over a settler?  Thanks so much         I guess you don't like movies or TV much either then?      no it is not ok stop doing it immediately      hurrrrrr   two dollar radio is the shit!            Arbitrary list  A feast of snakes by harry crews  Post office by Charles bukowski  Of mice and men by John Steinbeck  Animal farm by George orwell  1984 by George orwell  The road by Cormac mccarthy  No country for old men by Cormac mccarthy  Crapalachia by Scott mcclanahan  Rontel by Sam pink  Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury  Samedi the deafness by Jesse ball  The curfew by Jesse ball  The Easter parade by Richard Yates  The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt  Dune by Frank herbert  Everything that rises must converge by Flannery O'Connor  A good man is hard to find by Flannery O'Connor  Breakfast of Champions by kurt vonnegut  Cat's cradle by kurt vonnegut  A song of ice and fire series by George r r Martin  Elric of melnibone by Michael moorcock  A clockwork orange by Anthony burgess  The devil all the time by Donald ray pollock  High rise by jg ballard  The third bear by Jeff vandermeer        This book was great, highly recommend            Elric   I enjoyed it. The writing is good and I felt it offered a somewhat unique take on the post-apocalyptic genre - probably the most positive, from the many I've read   "Help I haven't read a book since first grade"         Fantasy/YA is like junk food - pretty enjoyable and not something you want to completely cut out of your life, but you wouldn't want to solely subsist on it and it doesn't quite compare to fine dining      they're skippable past the first            Cult classic is different than classic   Lol   Yes, agreed   I think taste is far less important than being open minded and adventurous with what you read      It doesn't take rating into account though (unless you specifically scroll to the "will i like this book" section and press the button)   get an ereader so you can instantly look up words. or read easier books   I loved *High Rise*   I read 70+ books last year with a 3 and a 1 year old. I'd read a lot more without kids, but finding time is still pretty easy. Bring a book with you to read in the 10 minute breaks in your day - getting there a little early to pick up kids from school, etc. Cut back on TV/video games.               *Silence Once Begun*, like everything Jesse Ball writes, is excellent. Not my favorite of his, but still one of my favorite books released this year.  *Annihilation* is great, bound to be a weird fiction classic. The other two books of the trilogy were not the same quality in my opinion, but the first is a fine stand alone.  *Station Eleven* was an enjoyable read. Great prose mixed with storylines that feel human make it somewhat unique in the overused post apocalyptic genre.  Did not like *Dept. of Speculation*, despite garnering lots of praise.     learn braille         in the POV chapters of a 13 year old girl   who upvotes this crap      nope   Wait a week or two and there will be a ton of "most anticipated 2015" lists. Pretty sure themillions.com does it every year at least   http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2qnrv4/i_received_raising_steam_as_a_christmas_present/      When you don't give a shit about any of the three games, you just pick anything so you can get a card. It isn't surprising   "unpopular opinion"   It's weekend warrior high rarity draft. First pick is guaranteed legendary and 2-5 are guaranteed heroics.   This is a great book. However if you are more than half way through and don't like it, why do you need us to tell you to stop reading it   try *tigerman* by nick harkaway   can you play 2 without playing 1?   I do not like the "no politics allowed" rule. Some things relating to books are inherently politically charged, and are important things to discuss. I understand mods trying to keep things civil, but I can't get behind banning all talk of it outright.   god, who fucking cares   *Half the World* by Joe Abercrombie   what a douche   the goldfinch and elliot smith   It's incredibly obvious when someone times you out maliciously, and when someone needs to leave quickly. Unless all of these damn babies know when I have on-board lethal next turn...            I am the only guy in my book club. I don't mind it. Part of the reason I joined a book club was to read things I wouldn't otherwise read. This has definitely been the case, and while I haven't liked everything, I've read quite a few good books in this way.  Sadly, I think book clubs are looked at as more of a female thing - unless they are specifically SF/Fantasy or geek themed, they are looked at as feminine.  Just shrug your shoulders and enjoy it. They are fun, and one of the few times I get to actually talk about books with others.      I guess you'll be picking me up this weekend to take the 45 minute drive into the city then?   I don't live in the city, so Barnes and Noble, yes. There is an indie bookstore near me, but it smells musty and awful, selection is pretty bare, and the pricing is very high.   Still going through Ballard's stuff, so far it's very hit or miss for me. I really enjoyed *High Rise* though   Bookstores are a pain in the ass to be honest. 50 percent of the floor space is taken up by e-readers, toys, board games, candles, cafes, etc. If I go in looking for anything remotely obscure, 9 times out of ten they won't have it, and I'm left wondering why I didn't just get the ebook, or get it from inter-library loan.   [r/im14andthisisfunny](http://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny)               I would think as an author, you would know the two are correlated. Guess not  	132
 Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. I was introduced to the series with the nearly equally amazing Oblivion.  I went back and tried to play Morrowind a couple of times. I hate that game. I hate everything about it. I don't think there's a single aspect I experienced that wasn't done better in Oblivion and Skyrim.  But hey, some people like swinging a sword and having it miss the enemy right in front of them 7 times out of 10, and that's cool, it's not for me though.   A solid minute of people screaming. Wish I hadn't watched that.   Well, they asked a question. So the question mark is justified. And the answer to the question is likely to make a lot of people very excited, so I'd say the exclamation mark is also warranted.    you can't instill a conscience or a moral compass in a creature that wasn't born with one  WAT? You realise most rational people acknowledge that their "moral compass" is attained by reason and empathy right? Babies aren't born with the knowledge that killing someone is wrong, that's why children have to be taught right from wrong.   Well. I eat meat, but it's far from being purely for survival purposes. I could easily survive as a vegetarian, but I choose to eat delicious meat.  Should I face harsh punishment for this?   Is it really a sneak attack if everyone was expecting some Fallout news sometime this year?   This shit. This shit right here is literally the very reason I will NEVER give google or youtube my phone number, no matter how many times they ask and how much they claim it's for security.   I thought it was Christmas, Easter, and New Year. I guess the patriotic salute would suggest the 4th of July.   Freezing a snowman seems kind of redundant.   Jesus. Let this thing die already.   And it only took 10,000 attempts.   Can't you just turn the notifications off? I mean, seems like a standard feature.   You don't need a "decent team". Just buy three silver packs and use those cards until you can with the 3rd bracket.   Congrats. You got the button equivalent of entering a royal rumble last.   Great callback. I like your style.   Auditions to find a 4th member for Blue Man Group weren't going well.   Or the ones that don't seem to have any meaning. Unless I'm missing something there's one between Sub-Zero and Kung Lao that just, doesn't make much sense (I'm probably missing something).  Kung Lao: A dead man walks.  Sub-Zero: You will feel the chill of winter.  Kung Lao: You have met your demise.  WAT?     Yeah, he's gay dude.   I like Sub-Zero's badass statement to Jason:  "Kombat me, fool!"   Boy is she barking up the wrong staff.   They didn't cripple Sub-Zero, I can now breathe again.      My friends drag raced their adder and entity and the entity won repeatedly. This is fully tuned with all the mods installed of course.    That may be the case, but it's still embarrassingly small for the task. The major releases on PS4 average at around 25GB, some are even 50GB! And they're mandatory installs.  Then on top of that there's updates, DLC, "free" indie games, shared pictures and videos. It all adds up.  I've had the PS4 for 2 years and I've had to delete stuff to make room for new games twice, that's appalling IMO. I never once reached the capacity of my Xbox 360 or my PS3 320GB HDDs.   It's my favourite car in the game. I love the way it looks, the way it sounds, and the way it drives. It's got enough grip to be able to control it, but enough slide so you can have fun with it. And although it's not quite as fast as say, a Zentorno or a Turismo it can hold it's own against those cars, and it's a fraction of the cost.  Love it.   Yup. I made a rare misspelling, and I really couldn't be bothered to correct it. Glad you sill knew what I meant.    My plan worked.    My mistake. I read it as unattractive. Now I see that word isn't in the title, and so my post makes no sense. Damn, got to be more careful in the future.   It sure is.   [SOURCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN8ElLOO8Jk)   I'm not sure I understand the message. Care to elaborate? This seems like the kind of thing I want to understand before I talk about it.   Teach me.   An SSD? I'm not made of airports!  But your claim that the machine will take any HDD that's 7.5mm in height intrigues me and I wish to subscribe to your news letter. Since I've had to clear space on my 500GB HDD twice in the two years I've had the system I might have to look into this.   Were you 12 when you worked at Game?   OP's mum.   We saw this guy on the front page a couple of days ago. Except he was tea-bagging a Spartan.   this just makes it look less ugly.  Less ugly? Than what? A lepor?   How to make your pS4 look like it's got a hideous cyst in one easy step.  Seriously though, I always said the paltry 500gb HDD the PS4 shipped with was embarrassingly small, surely a ploy to get the sales of Sony's HDDs up.   It used to mean something. People used to want it because it shows great timing to wait for it to hit red and then get it.  But for the last couple of weeks it's been so fucking easy to get red it defeats the point. There's no challenge, no risk. Hence red is now the third most common flair.  I'm glad I got my orange flair because I had good timing, anyone with a red flair is just seen as someone who waited until it was impossible miss getting it.   Genius.   I agree with everything you just said, have for a long time. But my question remains. I guess that's the "Greater Good" response in a nutshell. In order for me to agree with you about the problem of evil I first must make the assumption that god follows the laws of logic. and I'm not sure if I can make that assumption. This is why I can't say for sure that he doesn't exist.   Edit: I've just done some reading over at Foxhole atheist regarding greater good theodicies and I have come to this conclusion. If the god of the bible is bound by the laws of logic (and until demonstrated otherwise we have to assume  that he is) then no, he cannot possibly exist.  I guess I'm an agnostic atheist or a gnostic atheist depending on the god in question. Thanks for the education ;)  Have an imaginary internet point that does not exist.   I guess.  Have a nice day, man.   Fair enough, assuming the god of the bible has the same morality most of us do, which it seems he doesn't.  Can we be sure that what we consider to be evil is the same as what god would consider evil? If god is the supposed author of morality could it be possible that if he does exist, we simply don't see that what he allows to happen is ultimately "good"? God's plan/mysterious ways etc etc.   I can't believe I'm actually arguing for the plausibility of the existence of god.  I feel dirty.        That way I don't know if a God exists, that makes me an agnostic  An agnostic atheist, like me. Agnostic and atheist aren't mutually exclusive. You can have agnostic theists and gnostic atheists.  You don't know if an invisible fairy exists You don't know if an invisible mammoth exists. You don't know if an invisible whatever exists. Should we have names like 'agnostic' for all of these ?  Nope, because the belief in any of those doesn't have real world consequences like believing in a god does. There are laws in various countries around the world that are religiously based, or religiously inspired.  I don't see any fairy laws dictating what people can and can't do.   Nothing can break them.  People who believe in a god would beg to differ.  Believing in God is scientific ignorance  Of course it is, and yet billions of people still believe.   I guess we're talking about the god of the bible. You speak of negative claims and how they don't need to have any kind of backing up. What would you say to "There's isn't not a god"? Or what if someone said "The sun did not rise this morning"? I'd ask them to back up that negative claim.  It's reasonable to make a negative claim without evidence until there IS evidence for the positive claim  Is that not just absence of evidence though? We don't know he does exist, therefore he doesn't.   Yes it does. But claiming "God does not exist" as a fact is just as folly as saying "God exists", because you can't (currently) prove either one to be true.   There's a difference between not believing a claim, and proposing a counter claim.  I don't believe that there's an invisible fairy dancing on your back, but it's possible to feel your back and tell there's no fairy there. If you then say it's intangible and I have no way of detecting it, I can say I don't believe there's a fairy on your back, but I can't prove there isn't, and so I can't truthfully say that there is literally no dancing fairy on your back, because I can't possibly know that for sure because of the characteristics of the fairy in question i.e. it's undetectable.  The same goes for god. If you say "There is no god", the burden of proof is then on you to prove that your claim is true.  God breaks the laws of physics  How do you know for a fact that there exists no being in existence that can break the laws of physics? Can you prove no such being exists? If you can I'd love to hear it. If you can't, then you can't truthfully claim no such being exists.  and has zero evidence of him existing  [Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)     Well. Someone made a claim, that claim is "God exists."  Have you been convinced that the claim is true? If not, you don't believe. If you've been presented with a claim, the fact that you don't give it any thought doesn't change the fact that you either believe it to be true, or don't believe it.  I agree that right now we can't prove either way whether a god exists or not, but the discussion is still worth having because religion is a large part of many countries, and often can have tangible effects on laws and people under those laws.  You don't have to disprove god to not believe he exists, you simply have to remain unconvinced of the statement's truth. Which I am.   OP didn't ask if you knew god existed or not, they asked if you believe.  Agnosticism/gnosticism address what you know (or claim to know). Atheism/theism address what you believe.    That would be illogical.  How so?    It makes me wonder what kind of loving God would allow that.  Have you read the Bible? The stuff god supposedly allows is entirely abhorrent. I don't why anyone would want to worship a morally bankrupt fiend like that.   There is no God.  Unfortunately you just made a claim, can you back it up with evidence? Reasonably the best anyone can say is "I don't think there is a god." Outright saying "There is no good" places the burden of proof onto you, and if you can be sure there's no god then you must have some pretty compelling evidence.  I'm an atheist by the way.   I don't believe for a very simple reason.  Every single claim that a god exists that has ever been posited by anyone in all history has failed to meet it's [burden of proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof).  Every, single, one.   Apostrophes are simple, right?   Tron Legacy - Daftpunk.  Imagine a classical score but with an electronic flavour. Great soundtrack to a film that is at the very least a visual feast.   Aren't Steam and GoG the major players in PC gaming? Competition is good for the consumer. You take away Steam's main rival and they've got no reason to keep prices low.            God bless you 7V3N. I was about to go down the road of getting software and learnging to do it the proper way, with pictures and shit.  You just saved me so much time. Great tip.   Conglaturation. You have somehow simultaneously ruined this and made it better for me forever.   Goro's not a mutant. But don't forget, Johnny can throw green fireballs and do shadow kicks, he's superhuman already.   Now that must have felt awesome.    How many times do I have to explain this? I'm not saying the video is shit. I'm not saying the video is boring, or unwanted, or lame, or anything like that.  All I am doing (read this next bit carefully because it's the most important part) is disputing OP's claim that this clip took a staggering amount of coordination.  How is this hard to understand? I liked the video. It's cool and amusing, no-one's disputing the quality of the video. I'm disputing the claim OP made as to how difficult this was to pull off.  Perhaps we have differing definitions of the word staggering. My point has been made as clearly as I can possibly make it.   The reason I stuck with the GM was because the unbreakable was utterly useless in jumping opponents, in the ice clone will freeze a jumping attack enemy, plus you can still move while its out.    I don't think you can. Unless there's a mod that allows you to make all NPC's give the finger.    I'm not in an organised crew, nor do I have any friends who still play the game. I also don't have the rockstar director so it would be hard for me to replicate it. This still doesn't mean it takes a staggering amount of coordination. Any half serious crew could manage it with minimal effort.    Very good video. Glad to see people uploading videos that actually teach us stuff instead of merely showing us.    I started by using the unbreakable variation because it looked the coolest, and no-one uses it. Some guy was watching my stream/coaching me and he said is benefit greatly from making the switch to GM variation. I've never looked back.   Shame his only costume flair is that dull medallion. I miss the ice mask :(   Why not? If the shop is open its open. Obviously people who get in at the last minute and then take their time need a kick up the arse, but if they're quick and speedy I see no problem with it.    I'm not saying it isn't cool and amusing, it is. I'm just saying it likely didn't require a staggering amount of coordination.    Why does it look like is was taken in the 70's?   Not if they're friends/a crew. It would be incredibly easy. If it's randoms then yeah it would be tricky, but I have no doubt that these players are friends and/or part of the same crew, in which case it's not impressive in the least.   Genuine miracles.  lol.   Is it really stunning though? All they had to do was have one guy say: "OK guys. Let's all look left and give the middle finger for about 5 seconds."  Seems like it would have taken a very small amount of coordination to me.   It's a disaster movie... and you thought it was going to be good?   Seriously? I wait weeks for the challenge to appear and it's only here for a fucking day? I'm really struggling to think of reasons to keep playing at this point. So much bullshit going on all the time.   I just looked to see what I did to unlock him, apparently you get him for reaching rank 50 with a faction.  This is strange because I've reach rank 50 with 3 factions so far, and it took this long to unlock him? Weird.  Yes if paired with possessed kenshi  What makes the pairing so good?  Edit: Disregard. Just looked at Kenshi's passive.      It's simple. They're a cheating scumbag.   Question. How do you make such a smooth running gif? I've only ever used online gif makers and they suck.   It's like they're purposefully trying to bury the franchise.   Watch it in 240p for that extra 80's feel.   I can totally believe it. If "Yummy Mummy" is in the dictionary, anything can be.   Still, I just re-watched the trailer (hence the door smashing comment) and it seems pretty true to the gameplay of the final product. It's especially impressive given game trailers of recent years.  Wait, did I just imply that 2012 wasn't a recent year? whatever, you know what I mean ;)   I loved Dishonored. I've started Deus Ex HR 3 times now and never gotten past the first 30 minutes. It just doesn't grab me.  And it's so fucking yellow.   Could you blast doors to smithereens with your hand powers? I don't remember.   25 seconds in, I already laughed and added this to my favourites.   KUNG FURY has been released for free on YouTube!  You say this like I'm supposed to know what this Kung Fury is.  Edit: Please, hold your downvotes. I've started watching Kung Fury and it's fucking amazing. How had I not heard of this until today? It's the most 80's thing I've seen, and I was born in 1985.   I approve of this comment.    True. But then what? I can't attack them while ducking a full screen away.   Did I make a mistake? Is this not laiden with puns? Where else would I post it but a thread titled /r/ fucking punny you cunt.   I don't.   Good advice. Thanks.   The Jacqui spamming machine gun move is hard to beat with out a teleport move, at least that's in my experience.    You know what they're going to do every single time, and you can beat it easily  As Sub Zero I always have trouble with Full Auto Jacqui machine gun spammers. Sure I can slide, but I need to make it perfect to avoid all the bullets, and that's hard. Sure I can use an EX slide, but then they go right back to spamming. The only way round this that I've found is to duck then quickly step forward and duck again, inching my way towards them. I guess it unnerves them into trying something else and then FFFFFWWOOOOOOOSSHSHHH! slide.  Edit: Downvoted for sharing my experience. Wow, this subreddit continues to display itself as the most hostile one I've been subbed to thus far.   How cute, they're small.   I don't look for reasons to be upset, the reasons find me.   Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet. When I'm sitting on the Lil Jon like a Big Boi you might mistake me for an Ol' Dirty Bastard, but fear not, that's just the Ice-T treating my bladder like a Flo-Rida, making me need to take a Wiz... Khalifa.  Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.  I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.  50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."  I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."  And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.  Iggy Azalea.    but you could've went in expecting a little more because of the amount of hype around it.  The same can be said about anything people praise. It's nearly impossible to hear everyone raving about something and not build up some expectations in your mind.   I've seen different bosses have different sized health bars. I'm assuming they have millions of HP and everyone has to fight as much as they can to collectively drain the health bar before the invasion is over.  That's how it seems to me.   He was a character on Noel Edmond's House Party. I'm assuming you're not from Britain, it was a pretty big Saturday (or Sunday) night show over here back in the 90's. Everyone loved it.  Sometimes Mr Blobby would show up and basically harass Noel, much to the audience's amusement. Looking back on it though, my parents must have fucking hated every second the pink freak was on TV, but us kids loved it.  Just watch this episode I just found and you'll see what we had to put up with on the weekend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leSGbxejtvw   Whenever I'm in a fast car and the cops are doing their keeping up bullshit I just look behind me, throw a sticky bomb out the window, and solve the problem.   Because I find the whole thing to be ridiculous. It's ludacris.   I know how you feel. I think the whole concept is ridiculous anyway.  "Look at how much money I have! Look at all the women I paid to be in my video! HUr durr!"  Seriously, who's impressed by the showing off rappers do?   I wholeheartedly and unabashedly LOL at everyone who was waiting expecting to be rewarded.  Should have pressed the button you fools.   But what about the hype of literally every person who's seen it? I've heard nothing but "It's the best action movie in years!" from everyone.   'twas all the rage when I was a kid. He hails from Crinkley Bottom. I'm not making this up.   Me too. I was all like "Wow, it's cool seeing so much of Outworld. This whole war between Kotal Khan and Mileena is going to be... welp, rebellion's over."   [Mr Blobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XutaTTNihe0)   Arkham Origins rated games? That'll not make Rocksteady happy.   People still have trouble with raven? Get her below 50% health and hit her with a super move.  Literally problem solved.   I'm willing to do something 99% of my console gaming brethren are too afraid to do.  Acknowledge that PC is objectively the superior gaming platform.   Don't let me go belly up!   They finally pulled their fingers out and released challenge mode? I might have to start playing again. Frankly I'm amazed at how quickly I got bored of this game considering I played Injustice almost every day for nearly two years.   I remember when this game first came out and everyone was equating the cops with Ed-209 from Robocop, on account of how dangerous they were compared to the cops in GTAIV.  Now we're all accustomed to their ways it's gotten pretty easy to make them look foolish/take them down without issue. Good job OP. You showed those fucks who owns the streets!   TIL welling up equates to breaking down, if OP is to be believed.   It's funny. When I initially started going for the trophy I thought it was insanely hard. It's cool to see so many different tactics being employed to achieve the same goal.   Sorry if this is old news or there's better known ways of landing hits on the invasion bosses. I just found a tactic that worked for me and wanted to share it with people who might be having trouble, like I was.      Yes. Everyone. James himself even said people say he looks like House.    People who can do this have my respect. I'm a pretty decent pilot in GTA, and I've never successfully flown upside down through a tunnel.   And I've tried.    I've been told by several people that the price of building a PC in the UK is much higher than for US gamers. If I want to play games at 4K I'm looking at around 700, more than double a PS4's cost.    Oh yeah, that thing. Thanks for clarifying.    What?   Not everyone wants/likes/can afford to play in PC. It's all well and good claiming PC gaming is cheaper in the long run but there's still the hurdle of the steep entry fee.   But I guess this all moo because we'll never know.    What is this? r/nocontext   It's fine. You just have to be careful. You can turn on the spot if you're careful.   The game's been out for nearly 2 years and you learned this today?    If we eliminated that, we would have the same amount of gamers with better systems  Or you would have fewer gamers. You can't possibly state one way or the other.   I may be late, but 141 people enjoyed the post. And I never said Kotal wasn't a better character, I enjoy listening to him talk.   [It's a Simpsons quote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlMwc1c0HRQ)   You know much of Outworld.    To be fair though, people are fucking idiots.   Hmm. Your ideas intrigue me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.   Upvoted for Herperlarp.   You'll forgive me if I haven't thought about Ogre for many years and so he wasn't at the forfront of my memory.   I find that sort of thing seems to be pretty frowned upon in /r/mortalkombat   A lot of people seem really hostile in this subreddit, at least in my experience.   I understand. Outworld law states that the offending party be subjected to hanging their head in shame for no less than 15 seconds.   **hangs head in shame**   I though he was a sun/blood God.    I wouldn't be surprised if they were both based on than.    Thanks! Stan Lee once said every comic is somebody's first time reading one. I think the same can be said for most posts to reddit.   He's "The God of Fighting". He's pretty powerful.   I get that many people do. I was just saying that I don't. I know nothing about Dota 2, that's probably why I didn't recognise him. Thanks for the clarification.   Just noticed the spelling mistake in the title. Sorry guys.   I have no idea who that is.   But that isn't even Ogre's final form!   Well it's the first time I've seen it posted to reddit. Sorry for lacking the ability to see every post made to the MK subreddit.   Takeda isn't exactly my main. And I dropped a few combos here I shouldn't have, but it's still pretty tricky to go two rounds without being hit at all, even blocking.  Sorry I'm not MLG like yourself.      Are these comics canon with the games?      Nice. Loving the Noob rep also.   I just spotted the time played. I'm pretty sure I've played more than 2 horus and 50 minutes lol. Unless that's 2 days and 50 hours.   Yeah. I once went to bed and woke up with a higher rank, that's why I'm not sure how accurate the rank is.      Username checks out.   Of course. I keep forgetting games on PC are much cheaper.   Good to know, thanks.   Don't worry. You won't be seeing that kind of post from me again lol.   Yeah sorry for my snarky reply earlier. A little understandable given your comment but my attitude wasn't necessary. I had a quick scan of your past comments to see if you're a dick but it looks like you're a decent guy, that's why I feel bad for being an ass to you earlier.   Cool. Thanks for clarifying.   Ok. Sorry to be dragging down the community by asking a question. I'll be sure to delete this post so I avoid making this subreddit go to shit any more than it supposedly has.  Note to self. Don't ever ask the Reddit MK community a question ever again. They apparently hate that shit.   Telling me to block everything the enemy throws at me is much easier than actually blocking everything.   Thanks for the tips. I main Sub-Zero so I usually slide in after the minion instead of running.  Also, fuzzy block?   No. I understand the benefit of knowing one's enemy. I'm just saying that if I'm going to learn a character I might as well use them.   If all they do is teleport then yeah, easy. The people I fight do much more than teleport.   And you clearly haven't read the comments. If you had you'd have seen that this issue has been remedied. I should probably delete this post then shouldn't I?   I do use the blocking mechanic. But there's this other mechanic called mix-ups. They kinda make it hard to block sometimes. And once you're hit, that's it, 34% of your life bar, gone, because a little tap to the foot opened you up.   There's no way I'd put the time and effort into learning a character and then just not use them.   Yeah man. I rarely lol when I'm alone. It's usually just the huff of air out the nostrils.  But I lol'd twice during this and thought, that's redditworthy.      Thanks. That mouse looks awesome. Lights for some reason!   Just thought of a question. I looked at a review video for the monitor and it seems a little, small. I'm used to gaming on a TV that I think is pushing the 48 inch range. I could always buy a bigger monitor later, but is hooking the PC up to my TV a viable option? People always tell me it's a thing you can do but when I hook my laptop up to the TV the picture quality seems to drop.   Thanks for the info. I read that I don't want a weak CPU because it can slow down the GPU, is this much of an issue?  Also I keep hearing the term benchmark but don't know what that is in terms of computing.    Yeah I suppose if I learned his moves of be better equipped to fight him. I've just been avoiding learning him because everyone uses him and I don't want to add to that. And if I know him I have to use him, that's the law.    Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe.   Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe.   Oh yeah. I always forget about the online fees since I've been paying them for so long.   Ah yes. I see the rule you mean now. This is how much of a noob I am. I assumed /r/buildapcforme was where people would literally build a pc to the specs you ask for, and /r/buildapc was where people suggested builds for you. Now I know.   Here's the new post for you to follow if you wish.  http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/36uuvt/absolute_noob_finally_making_the_jump_from/   **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**  I want to play games that look better than on my PS4 (Witcher 3, GTAV, that sort of thing). Ultra settings would be nice but I have no idea how expensive that is, so high would suffice if the cost is over my budget. I'd also like to do some light video editing and rendering using Sony Vegas.  **What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**   700  **When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**   I don't know when I'll be buying. I'm looking to get an idea of what I'll be buying since I know nothing about the innards of PCs.  **What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)**   This will be from scratch so I guess I'd need a tower, OS, one monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. Not sure what else I'd need.  **Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**   England.  **If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**   None.  **Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**   I have no idea. I guess so. I thought everyone overclocked gaming PCs.  **Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**  "RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL" I don't know what any of that is. I'd like an SSD but they're mega expensive. I'd need at least 2TB of storage for all the games I reckon.  **Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**  Not yet. Just trying to get an idea of what I need.   **Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**  I guess I'll need windows. I've got 8.1 on my laptop but I much preferred 7, that metro stuff is just annoying. Is there a benefit to using older versions?  **Extra info or particulars:**  I am a noob. Please remember this when saying things like "Radeon 9500 GTX" and "i7 quad core".   The second rule I see is:  No facilitating piracy, linking to pirated software or tools to pirate software  I guess there's more than 1 set of rules? But yeah, I'm going to post this over at /r/buildapcforme as suggested by another redditor.     I'm going to post it in /r/buildapcforme because someone suggested it would be better off there. I'll give you the link once I've posted it.   Cool. Thanks for letting me know. I'll post it there.   Let's assume the PC version ran just as well as the console versions. What would be the advantage of getting the PC version? I know the advantage to PC versions of most games (better graphics, higher framerate, mods etc) but since MKX looks great on consoles and runs at 60fps, what's the advantage to the PC version?   That's strange. I never say things like Dat Ass because I think it's dumb. But I see so many top comments saying dat ass I figured it was something people enjoyed reading. But of course. I made the mistake of thinking reddit makes sense, so when I say it, downvotes, when other people say it, upvotes.  Fuck reddit sometimes.    Cool. Me too.    Which Soul Calibur game was Kratos in? I only know of:  Soul Calibur 2: Xbox = Spawn PS2 = Heihachi Gamecube = Link  and Soul Calibur 4.  PS3 = Darth Vader Xbox 360 = Yoda  and Soul Calibur V  All versions = Ezio.    I just play wired for a bit.  Nothing like a bit of retro gaming lol.   Yeah, sorry for my dickish comment. I've become everything I used to hate about reddit lol.   That's terrible.   When you put it like that, it does seem kind of oxymoronic. I was just angry when I started the post and chilled out near the end.   Fair enough.   Yup. She became a gamer around the time she bought an Xbox 360 in 2010 ish. She keeps surprising me. She owns a Five Finger Death Punch Album... she's 55. She loves playing games like Skyrim, Fallout, and most recently, X-Com Enemy Unknown and she just finished Deus Ex Human Revolution.  It's cool.   Noice!   I'm sure the Xbox One controllers do have a great life span. I know the Xbox 360 did, but then again the tradeoff was that you had to buy batteries and keep swapping them out when they need charging. With my PS4  I have a dock that holds two controllers. When one gets low on power I simply turn it off, place it down, pick up the other one and keep playing. I will agree that the battery life on the PS4 controllers is embarrassingly short, but 4 hours is doing it a disservice.   It's almost as if the stuff bundled with collector's editions of games is cheap tat!  I remember when my Mum opened her collector's edition of Elder Scrolls Online and pulled out the statue of Molag Bal. A statue we'd assumed would have been made from metal given the price of the fucking package.  NOPE.  It was cheap as fuck plastic. I've heard the same from people with other collector's editions. This is why I don't buy collector's editions. Mostly because I don't want the shit that comes with them, I just want the game, but partly because I've been nothing but underwhelmed with what I've seen so far.  Did anyone get the collector's edition of Black Ops with the RC-XD? Or the CE of Modern Warfare 2 with the night vision goggles? what was the build quality like on those?

 5 magical words:  "Get off of my land".  Reach for your belt.  They'll leave.         They can't recognise "if I say the wrong thing, she's going to pull over, and I'm going to get beat, and have to blame my bloody nose on "I wasn't wearing a seatbelt and a deer jumped out, so my GF stopped rapidly, and I smashed against the window" is abusive?  What the fuck?  And just a look will send you into shaking and trembling and cowering in the corner of the cab at 60 MPH to get away from her if she decides to hit you?  And she does the "mom count to 3" Really?  Then she thinks you were prank calling her the night before, so she beats you almost senseless when you're crying and begging her to stop, and your man cousin pulls her off because you're getting your ass kicked, and crying?  You can't recognize that as abusive?  What the hell is wrong with you?  **EDIT:** Yes, I know, /r/oddlyspecific  It got bad enough, that in my Senior year, I always had a tape recorder and video recorder on me.  That was more effective than the knive I've carried since age 10.  She did catch me a couple of times without my backpack though.  Those days weren't good. :(   That seems like as good of an explanation of any, but I still don't get it.  Why not "FTW", and just stay out of relationships because "you know" it's going to end bad, so why bother even trying?   Pretty much.  Or people who are oddly attracted to people who remind them of HS bullies, and want to get in thier pants.  I don't get it.  Let's see, "I used to be beat as a kid, so I want to re-enact it as an adult"  What?  Why?      Eternal Life.  Mormons are lucky to get 1 conversion a year.   Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Heart. With these elements combined, we create CAPTAIN PLANET!  Captain planet, he's our hero! Gonna take pollution down to zero.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpXM9bj-WPU   Good point.  But you're talking to a dude who watched all 13 video tapes of the fraud Kent Hovind, because I wanted to see what bullshit that the YEC crowd believes.    Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Heart. With these elements combined, we create CAPTAIN PLANET!  Captain planet, he's our hero! Gonna take pollution down to zero.   Baldur rose from the dead.  http://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/the-aesir-gods-and-goddesses/baldur/   Yes, it is.  But if you want to see the bullshit they spew, it's one of the "best" documentaries to watch.  Yes, it's FOS, but it gives you an idea where they are coming from.   Then he said "ow."   AC/DC has a metal song called "[thunderstruck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM)".  Norse Mythology 3:  Christianity 2.      Thor promised to get rid of the Ice Giants.  You don't see any around, do you?  Norse Mythology 2, Christians 1.               What's it say for if you put up an aerial?   By that logic, I could have "faith" in The Enterprise Project, and believe that NASA is really suppressing evidence of ancient martian civilisations.  Yes, there's more evidence for that than of any god.   Why believe in what you have no direct and reproducible evidence for though?  I "believe" in what can be tested and confirmed.  My stance on God is about that as Glesie 581D having sapient species, (or any species of life at all).  Could there be?  Sure.  But sine we can't observe, monitor, or test for it, and it has no affect on anything, it's a mute point whether god or aliens exist.  The undetectable is indistinguishable from the non-existent.   Then what created god?  If you say "god always existed", then why can't that exact same argument apply to the universe its self?  As far as "where you go when you die", Most people get entombed in the Earth, others are cremated, and others are left to rot in the woods.  "you" go nowhere.  You simply stop existing.     The Mohu Leaf didn't do shit for me, but a cheapo RCA antenna gets me 6 channels.  Have you looked up your TV Fool report?   Autofellatio.   Or, you know, resurrect 1953.  Put up a fucking antenna.  If you want go go back to the radio, 1927.  This is the Citizen's Broadcast system:  We keep an eye on America.  CBS was the first to color TV in 1953, and lost out to RCA, (NBC).  Fuck National Broadcast Company!    Fair enough. :)  [I smoke Two Joints.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsv4Lb7EQs)   Nope, I smoke dope maybe once a year.  MJ has basically nothing to do with anything.  The longest I've spent high is a week back in 2005.  I wass **VERY** baked then.  I decided to stop because I was just too damned high.  I "took a break" lasting over 4 years because "I can't do this anymore".  I was so damned high, that I just had to stop because I couldn't know what was real or not, so I put the bong down, and "back to life, back to realty" was the hit song that 5 days of sobering up.     Do you like it when your daddy touches you, and says "it's god's will"?   Ask my SIL about how much I blab when I'm high.  The last time I smoked dope, I was blabbing away for 8 hours, and wouldn't shut up.  I got hit twice because I wouldn't shut the hell up.  I can't even recall what the hell I was talking about, but I woke up with a sore head, and an inflamed cheek because I wouldn't shut the fuck up.   There's a difference between the Catholics and the Pentecostals/Mormoms/Baptists.  Catholics, you have to go to, Mormons they seek you out like they are on a mission.  I guess that's why the call them missionaries,   You mean like the modern Catholics?  Well, if you want to see what they're about, go to church and ask the Father questions.  He'll be more than happy to talk to you if you want.  I don't like Mormons, the Baptists, and Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses because of the active indoctrination involved.  But if you go seek out the knowledge yourself out of curiosity, (or whatever), then more power to you.  You walked in there, you are free to walk away.   Try and sell a sober 30 year old man on religion.  Whether it's Mormonism, or Zoroastrianism will make no difference.  The man will spot it for the bullshit that it is, and might fuck with the 19 year old kids trying to sell the religion for a while, but eventually, he's going to tell them to fuck off and get of of his land.   For the same reason you're so gullible.   Religion/faith = Belief in something without any evidence to prove it.  Whether it's fung shui, or Christianity, or "healing crystals", matter not.   I respect the Mafia and the Hell's Angels because of "influence", and I can prove that they exist.  A simple call on my telephone will prove it.  They exist, and sell drugs, guns, and ride motorbikes.  They also kill people, but if you don't fuck with them, the most you'll see them is driving down the road and lie to your wife "I guess there's a harley convention in town" while you know exactly while there's so many motorbikes on the road.  Also, Hitler was FAR from conquering the world.  HE fucked up by having a 3 front fight, and allying with Japan.  Getting attacked by England, USSR, USA, France, never goes well for you.   But if everything is "god's will", how can humans have free will?  Similarly, if humans have free will, how can anything be "god's plan"?   Yeah!  Bronze age goat herders who lived in caves and huts have all the answers to life!  What's your shirt made out of BTW?  Can I see your bat that is a bird?   History shows that "conversion at the point of a sword" is the most effective.  Look at the Christianization of Europe 1200 years ago, or Islam today.  "Convert or die" is very effective.   N/P, the instant they shut up about their god(s), and stop blabbing how I'm going to hell because I am a human and am using the brain that "god gave me".   Yeah, an "all seeing, all knowing and all caring" being made Adam an Eve, and forbid humans to eat of the tree of knowledge.  That flies about as well as a Led Zepplin.  Oh wait, worse.  That was actually a very successful band.  Tell me again why God allowed 9/11 to happen?    Not always [Yes, there are atheists in foxholes](http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/).   Sure you can.  Old code.  "Don't look for shit and fuck with people, but defend yourself".  Easy.   There is no such thing as a "democrat child", or a "republican child".  Why are there "muslim children", and "Christian children", and "Catholic Children?  If you can't back up your claim with evidence, your ideas deserve no respect.    I'll shut up about atheism, the instant that the religious shut up about their god.            Hey, gotta recruit and train!  The NFL drafts just happened.   You mean "recruits people", so they give them more money, and provide no tangible benefit in return?   Would you respect the idea that all the space jews stole the Moon money, and that's why the Lunar race had to sell off it's atmosphere?  Of course not.  No evidence for that ridiculous claim.  Religion is no different.  Why can't you respect my "belief" that the space jews did steal all the moon money?   They were likely indoctrinated as children.      http://i.imgur.com/GoJIYGJ.jpg   There are no religious dead people.   Only when I smoke dope, then I can't stop talking. :)   There's a difference between offering a service that can be used as needed, (hey you know where they are), for people in genuine need of such services; versus selling "You're a horrible person, and deserve to not only die in a fire, but burn for all of eternity. but if you accept insert god or godhead here, you get to go to heaven after you die!  Yeah your life sucks, but the afterlife will be so much better!"  **EDIT:**  "Addiction counseling" is a sham designed to get people into the religion of AA.  Instead of 12 steps, (only which the first one has anything to do with insert drug, there should be two steps.    * Step 1:  "Stop doing drugs".   * Step 2:  See step 1.   Sorry kids, God was busy with the 49ers this weekend.  http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6214/6297575351_68f9265f38.jpg   And people who want their football team to win.  Pray for the Panthers!  No!  The Seahawks!  No, the 49ers!  No, the Dolphins!      and HBO is cheaper.  That's only $17.99/mo.  About 1% of most people's income.      Light refraction.   No daddy!  Not my bum bum bum!  "shhh billy let your daddy do his job"  gags you with his hand, and silently pumps away  "you like that billy, don't you"  forces your head to make the "yes" motion, and goes faster and puts a cowboy hat on your head  "WOO"  Slaps your ass with the side of his pillock and gives you a mushroom print on your ass, then kisses you on the cheek, and goes even faster pumping away  "WOO!"  You just got raped by Rick Flair, and he's your dad. :D   (conehead 1)  Which cardinal direction is "left"  We are from france.  (conehead 2) Align the map with the sun.  "left" is west.  Look at your timepiece on your wrist to align.  (conehead 1)  Mmm, Left is west.  Leftists are on the west coast and Rightists on the East coast.  Middle is Nebraska.   Duckspeak is doubleplusgood.  We must trust the government.  The daily 5 minute hate of Emmanuel Goldstein teaches us this.  WE LOVE BIG BROTHER!   Yes, several times.  I live only 78 miles south of that city.  I'm in Pullman WA.      She worked for the NAACP in Spokane WA.   My living room TV is a Viszio, and it works plenty fine.  My upstairs TV is an "old" Daewoo from 2002, (analog only), hooked up to a iView 3500STBII, and it works actually better than my flatscreen for OTA.   http://i.imgur.com/rsKzvPa.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/rsKzvPa.jpg         Somebody who stays up all night wondering if there is a dog.   Yes, they are.  But what do you get if you cross an agnostic, a dyslexic, and an insomniac?    Somebody who stays up all night wondering if there is a dog.            God is a reverse of Dog.  (hold a mirror up the screen if you doubt it).   I've only done it with text on IM, and intro'ed songs to people on FB. I know how to introduce a song, and start up a playlist, but I think I sound strange even on a PA system at walmart. (where I used to work). I have no idea how I sound recorded, it's been over 25 years since I've taped myself. (I was a kid with a tape recorder).  I've DXed for about half of my life, and can build AM and FM reception antennas with no problems.  I used to use a CB in the grain truck when I was growing up, (and a couple of times after I became an adult to report emergencies using channels 3 and 9)  Other than that, I have no experience on the air.  All I know about it is "don't cuss, and ID yourself every 15 minutes of broadcast, and you can't play music on CB frequencies".  I don't think terrestrial radio is ever going to die.  Sat radio is about $10/mo, and not worth it IMHO. AM/FM is free, and you might have a lot of crappy stations, but you do get a couple of good ones that are worth listening to.  I want to work for a classic rock station.  I don't think I would do too well in a pop music station.  "and here's some more teeny-bopper crap for the 11 year olds".  Yeah, I don't think that would fly too well.  Give me Led Zeppelin, Twisted Sister, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and Iron Maiden. Hell, throw in some AC/DC and Metallica for good measure. :)  I would rock their socks off. :)  I know I couldn't be the AM Radio KQQQ morning news guy, (I can't talk that long), but on 100.5FM, I could do it, (but I would have to watch my mouth so I don't get fined by the FCC).   I've only done it with text on IM, and intro'ed songs to people on FB.  I know *how* to introduce a song, and start up a playlist, but I think I sound strange even on a PA system at walmart.  (where I used to work). I have no idea how I sound recorded, it's been over 25 years since I've taped myself.  (I was a kid with a tape recorder).   A mirror         A hundred milion gallons?  Do you own a private reservoir?  How the hell did you get that much water?   But to answer your question:  Never.  It's private property.  Either buy it, or fuck off.   Instantly vaporised, riding the Atomic bomb on the way to impact. Just like the dude in the movie "Dr. Strangelove"/  No pain.  You're alive one nanosecond, the next, you just don't exist anymore.   In their mouth.  Auto-Blumpkin is all the rage these days, eh?   To take a piss while taking a shit.   A mirror.   The issue I have, is what the hell do I tie off to?  There's nothing up there to tie off on, and I'm a single man, so I can't exactly bailey myself.  I don't really feel like falling 40 feet to my death.   Well, got the compass.  Now I just have to figure out how to get up there.  Is paracord strong enough to keep me from falling to my death if I slip?  I know it's 550# test, but F=MA.  From my math, I could fall half a meter before the cord snaps, (with no air resistance).  I know the TV of a human is around 192 km/h (with air resistance, or there would be no TV).  Here's a picture of the front of my house:  http://i.imgur.com/TPQEY8d.png   Well, I just got permission from my LL to install an antenna on the roof if I want.  Now I just have to figure out how the hell to get up there.  I called walmart, they won't rent out the manlift that they have.  Sun Rental will, but it's 100 per day.  A 35 foot ladder is $60/day.  But for that price, I could just buy one.  How safe would it be to get up on the roof without a ladder, by just going out the window, and tying off with paracord?  Speaking of which, I need to go buy a compass, so I have degree measurements.   It makes no difference whether 1 person has 99 dollars, and the rest have 1 between them.  GDP is GDP.  And yes, I know what GDP is.  Gross Domestic Product.  The sum total of the economy.  Who cares if the other 99 people are worse off?  If they want more of that money, they should get a job from the dude who has the money.  Like the saying goes.  "He who has the gold, makes the rules".  And no, I didn't get it from Faux News, (I don't even know what channel it's on), or Limbaugh.  I stopped listening to that blowhard back in 2005.  I got that conclusion from the OWS crowd where they want to "eat the rich", and "spread the wealth around".  They're complaining about being poor, but they have iPhones, and Macbook Airs.  Yeah, "poor".  My white ass.  If they're poor and can afford that shit, (more likely their parents bought it for them), then the Pope is middle-class.  The OWS crowd should be forcibly removed for the squatters and vagrants that they are.  Fortunately, I live in a city where we still enforce the vagrancy laws.   Yeah, a rocket mount.  The track would just slow it down.  But what if somebody fit a rocket car with super slick skis?  Would that even work?  And if so, what would stop them from taking off like an aeroplane?   Here's my [TV Fool](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3d82301db3f4775e).  I actually can pick up K40EE and KLEW.   Here you go:  Direct from MS; [build 10130](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso).   Well, that explains why I can sometimes DX radio stations as far away as Nebraska, and picking up KGO at night isn't exactly hard.  Hell, I can pick it up with my walkman, and no large ferrite antenna.         A) Money is money.  "equal distribution" makes no sense.  Why should a walmart greeter make as much as a doctor?  Are you that daft?  Fuck.  Cripples and idiots can be a walmart greeter.  B)  Yes, American politics are fucking dumb.  No argument there.  We have a 2 party system.  Like it or not, reality is what it is.  No amount of dreaming, or jerking off in your bed at night to fantasize about the Constitution or Green party will make any difference.   Have you tried upgrading from an ISO?  On my desktop, I'm on build 10135.   I've wondered this too. Back in the 90's when I only had antenna service, I actually hoped for shitty weather because that was the only time I could pick up Fox. I missed the finale of ST:V because we had good weather that day. I was pissed off for 2 weeks.  Anyhow, from what I remember from TV DX magazine, bad weather is often accompanied by low atmospheric pressure and low(er) surface temperatures. This allows the TV signal to bounce off of the ionosphere, and come to your antenna.   To test this hypothesis, you could go out with your garden hose and spray your antenna. Try it both at night, and during the day at the height of heat. That will see if water has anything to do with your reception.   Yep. That's right. I actually have that entire series stored on my computer.  Hell, I have enough media that I could run a TV station if I had a transmission tower. (And if I could legally set up an NTSC broadcast).   The 100 people having 100 dollars are exactly as rich as the 10 people having 100 dollars. Wealth isn't increased or decreased because of how many people that have it.  And how am I wrong about the Democratic party? That basically is their stance. They feed off of jealousy and envy.   He did in 1990. Well, to his childhood home. Then he went to Vietnam, and saved his brother from getting killed by that VC chick.   Having a job. Both hand and blow.   Quantum Leap.      I could have, but when I lived 16 miles from the nearest town with over a thousand people, and 4.6 miles outside of a town with only 120 people, (and have to go to school on a bus trip taking over an hour), it's kind of impossible.    You have work to do on the ranch, and have no time to "blow" before school.  After school, you feed the animals, so cleanup around the ranch, and watch TV.  I could have if I wanted, but I honestly had no time for trivial pursuits in social engagement.  How has it affected me?  Well, I finally got really high and got laid at 27 years old.  I got her pregnant so we got married.  We had a son.  2 years later in 2012, she wanted another kid.  I fucked her without a condom and got her pregnant.  Wife left, kids lost.  Reality sucks.  I'm never dating again, and I'm 32 years old.  It's simply not worth my time to ever try dating again.   Can you imagine it launched today?  What would Sam Beckett do on 9/11, or 7/7?  How would he have handled the massive power out in NE during 2003?  How about the killing of Princess Diana in 97?  The fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union?  The OKC bombing?  The Y2K transition, when that was the last time humans weren't in space at all?  Don't forget about Iran Contra, and the Panamanian conflict.  Iraq because of oil, 10 years later, back to Iraq.  Color TV, and NTSC transition.  Antennas die, and resurrected again.  People getting off of cable, and putting up aerials and watching videos online.  14.4Kbps, 33.6Kbps, 56K, BROADBAND!  C-band satellite, Ku-satellite, Wild feeds, DBS, Cable, back to antenna again!  Planes wrecked, monuments destroyed, war again. "Depends on that the meaning of "is" is".  Entitlists, unemployment, economy died, economy "revived".  Housing collapse, market rebuilding, economy is still stagnant.  We didn't start the fire! It was always burning, Since the world's been turning. We didn't start the fire. No we didn't light it, But we tried to fight it!  OK, before I become Billy Joel and start writing Lyrics for "We Didn't Start the Fire, (2015)", I'll stop now. :D   A 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe.  It cost all of $100, and was a POS, but it was **MY** POS.  As far as recommendations?  Something large.  More mass will protect you.  Look at 70's impalas, and Lincoln Town Cars.   Had friends to hang out at the river and go fishing with.  Also, jump off of Granite Point.   Quantum Leap.   The only advice I have is if you move to a location where you cannot receive service (clear view of the southern sky), then they'll let you out without any consequences.  Much like how to get out of a cellphone contract.  Or, wait until they send you a "user member agreement" update, and disagree with a clause.  You have 30 days to bail without any consequences.  **TL;DR:**  Move to where you can't get service; or review the revised member agreement when you get one in the mail, and find something to disagree with.   Fuck per capita.  GDP is what matters.  "Everybody is Equal" in the congo, where they have to burn buffalo and Elephant dung to cook their food.  Equality isn't a virtue, it's a pox on the development of a modern society.  Liberals want to make "everybody equal" by bringing everyone down to the lowest common denominator, instead of raising up the poor to be comfortable.  "be successful, but not too much", should be the democratic party's slogan.  At least then they would be honest.   I have no problem with infrastructure maintenance and improvements.  We have to keep the lights on, the water flowing, trash service running, and the roads passable.  Funding of education is also needed, as an educated populace is crucial to maintaining a free society.    Lack of education leads to Somalia and Afghanistan.  I have no problems with spending money on education, but quite a lot of that money is wasted on overhead and union dues, and paying lawyers.  It should be going to the children's direct benefit, not the NEA and SEIU.   "going to shit"  Yeah, that's why we have the highest GDP on the entire planet. Even the Chinese can't hold a candle to us.   Why should I care about people who I will never see, or hear from beyond commercials on TV begging for money, or on the news about the earthquake about destroyed buildings and impassable roads?  It doesn't affect me, so it's not my concern.   You're the one that thinks you're liberal utopia doesn't allow cousin marriages.  Here's news to you:  They do.  In NJ, incest has actually been decriminalized between consenting adults.   How do I mount the pole to the roof?  Back in the 90's, I just turned my room into a giant antenna, and that worked fine.  But I'm not sure that will even work with the new ATSC standard.  I've never really set up a rooftop aerial before.   All children are bums.  They contribute nothing to the economy, and are economic drains on society.   I don't give a shit about other people.  I'm not them, and I won't ever meet them.  Why should I care about starving kids in Nepal, and wrecked houses?  I'm not there.  It doesn't affect me, (and never will).   Oh, and the "progressive" states, are where cousin marriage is legal.  You can marry your first cousin in NY, MA, NJ, MD, CO, and CA. (and other states)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States_by_state   I rock out, watch TV, smoke pot, and drink beer in my off time.  It's cheap entertainment.   Yes, like this lady.  Gotta get your Obama Phone!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpAOwJvTOio   Have fun being "worldly", and crying over TV commercials about starving kids in Nepal saying "so sad", but not doing a damned thing to change it.   I actually grew up upper-middle income.  My father was making upwards of $75000 a year in the 90's.  I make less than $20,000 a year, and honestly doubt I'll make anywhere close to what my father made, (let alone adjusted for inflation).  Dreams and fantasies are useless.  They are like masturbation.  They make you feel good, but accomplish nothing.   Yeah, a real world where people want their obama phones.  If you can't afford a phone (really?  for $8/mo, you can get 250m a month with unlimited texting), maybe you shouldn't have one.  Use payphones, or get a landline.  Cellular phones are a luxury, and not needed.   No shit.  I was 8 at the time.  It was funded by my parents.   Of course the national leaders (and the uber rich), get a higher standard of care than joe blow off of the street.  They have the money to afford it, so they can buy it.  Just like in a car, you can buy the $0.50 sparkplugs, and no-name oil, or you can buy the $7 (each spark plugs coated in platinum, with "triple fire technology", and synthetic oil.  With more money, comes more choice in what you can afford.    Should everybody be forced to drive a 18 year old truck that leaks coolant, just because I do?  Or should I be able to get a Jaguar becaus some rich people buy them?  Of course not.  There is a different vehicle and different levels of services for people of different income levels.  Healthcare isn't much different.  I did watch the video, and he stated his points well.  However, he neglected the one reason that US healthcare is more expensive.  Namely, R D costs, and the patent system.  In countries such as the UK or Australia, the government holds the exclusive patent rights to the medications and medical technology, and it is shared immediately.  In the USA, there is a 7 year patent, and generics are prohibited during that time.  If it was a work related activity, that meets the requirements in WA to qualify as "work search".  However, when you are unemployed, there is no such thing as "vacation days".  Sure, you can sit on your ass on the weekend, but you are expected to make an active search for work.  When I was a maintenance man, I had vacation time, but never used it.  I had over 168 hours of banked up vacation time that I refused to use.  Upon separation of employment, I got a "free" month of pay in addition to unemployment.  I don't believe in taking vacations.  And if I was a "captain of industry" like you seem to like that term, I would be smoking Cuban cigars on my yacht, and have a runabout in my yacht so I could make it to shore.  My "runabout" would be a 32 foot boat, and I would have a skip on that if I wanted to go into an area where there are no docks.  That would be a "captain of industry".  We actually have no "trade" schools within 31 miles.  The one 50 miles away, (WWCC), churns out nurses, and CNA's and tech support people.  Nothing else is offered.  I could cross state lines and pay $8000/semester, but incurring $32,000 of debt just to get a $30,000 job still is a wash at best.  There is no point to getting a degree that doesn't pay off in a maximum of 2 years, (and be debt free).    he strange thing is, the one school, (LCSC), that I could attend a trade school to be a diesel technician, or a welder, or a plumber, (or whatever), is actually closer to me (28 miles), than the nearest in-state  trade school.  After that, it's a 78 mile one way trip to SFCC.  Can you tell I live basically in the middle of nowhere?  Trade schools do have their place, as they teach practical skills that generate income.  However, the "general studies", or "Major in philosophy, minor in Arabic" degrees are completely useless.  Being "well rounded" doesn't matter for shit if you get several tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and work at starbucks or drive a taxi.  That was just a waste of money.  They would have been economically better off if they had just never went to school in the first place.  [Have Degree?  Will Drive Cab!](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-06-25/why-are-so-many-college-graduates-driving-taxis-)     I was born in 1983.  I remember that conflict.  We crushed them within 3 weeks, they torched the oil wells, and fled back into Iraq.  We stopped half way to Baghdad, because GHWB pulled out.  That was pointless.  We should have just crushed Soddomy Insane back in 91.   In Europe, there is a benefit to being multi-lingual.  But in the USA, there's really no point.  There aren't many mexicans in Whitman County, and the Chinese people mostly keep to themselves.  English is the primary language of the USA, and there really is no need to know any other language beyond English.   That was in the 80's.  I was thinking more along the lines of the bombing of 10 downing street in 1991.  Such a peaceful country, the UK.  Oh, don't forget about the Protestant/Catholic conflicts.   "Worst performing"  Yeah, right.  DPRK and Cuba beg to differ.  Where do all the world leaders come to get advanced medical care?  Oh, that's right.  The USA.  They don't go to France or Indonesia.  Also, I did it exactly once because I needed food.  I hardly made a living at it.  And one hour for $50 of food is almost like I got paid to sit through the rambling nonsense of the preacher.  "food from god"  Yeah, right.  it's food from people who saw fit to donate to a cause that they supported, (feeding the needy).  "God" had nothing to do with it, any more than he does with the turds coming out of a cow's asshole while it eats on the range.  And if you were traveling the world, you weren't exactly "available for work each and every day", were you?  That is a requirement to collect unemployment.  You also have to make a minimum of 3 contacts per week, and actively look for work.  I'm fully aware of WA State requirements for collecting unemployment insurance.  Once again, I spent one hour there, and got "paid" for my time by food.  Pretty good deal.  Considering I can live easily on less than $100/mo by myself, and with my wife and daughter, I can keep it under $150/mo.  It's not exactly hard to eat on a tight budget, but eating out is a luxury that only happens about once a season.  (just like it used to be when I grew up).  Define "learn something useful".  If you mean Medieval History of Europe, or XXX studies, or philosophy, I consider those useless pursuits.  If it's not a tangible skill, I have no interest in learning it.  If it can't generate income, there is no purpose to learning it.  I do not care about "being well rounded".  I care about putting money in my pocket, and nothing else.  Also, the last I checked, school doesn't pay you to be there.  Internships are full of shit, and an excuse for free labor.     The last war we explicitly fought for oil was Iraq in the early 90's, after Soddomy Insane invaded Kuwait.   Also, we don't get most of our oil from the ME.  We get it from USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and then Saudi Arabia.    However, because we are now fracking, we could cut out Saudi oil, and it wouldn't really affect us.  In case you haven't checked, the world petroleum market is an international commodity.  You likely get fuel from Saudi Arabia too.  As far as domestic oil production, yes it is.  Maybe you've heard of Standard Oil?  They were broken up in 1911.  We now have Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Tesoro, etc.  All private industries.   Nope, we didn't directly fund them.  We directly funded the Mujahadeen which later became the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  We wanted to fuck with the USSR, and didn't really give a shit about the UK.   And I don't have the time for the Clinton/Sanders supporters.  Hillary is about as transparent as the walls of my house, and Sanders is a self-admitted socialist.  Democrats claim they want you to be successful, just not "too successful".  If Bill Gates wanted to pile up all his money, and create the world's biggest bonfire, he could.  If he wants to blow it on penny candy, or hookers and blow, he can.  He earned the money, he can do whatever he likes with it.  It's his money, not yours.   No shit we spend the most on education.  You can thank the NEA for that.  So obviously the solution isn't "throw more money at it".  I honestly think we should adopt Germany's way of doing it.  Have an academic track, and a blue-collar track.  Homogenized ANYTHING never works.    People learn differently, and should be targeted with a curriculum that suits them, not what the NEA says everybody needs.  What use does a future plumber or welder have for French or Japanese?  Similarly, what use does a future accountant have for shop classes?  This is one lesson from Europe that the USA should take.  The Germans do it better, so we should do what China is so famous for, and copy them.  And fifth grade?  I could easily pass that.  Unless being multi-lingual is a requirement.  But if the classes were taught in English, not a problem.   Five times more?  Yeah right.  $20 for a checkup?  Sure, if it was 1995.  Here in the 21st century, we have to pay for services rendered.  If you think about it, a doctor's visit is actually still cheaper than going to an auto dealer and having your vehicle worked on for one hour.  Per flat rate hour, it's $160 to have a technician look at your vehicle.  Just want them to pull the codes? (takes all of 30 seconds), That'll be $80.  Minimum billable rate is a half hour.  And if you're unemployed and think you're "too good" for any work, you're a damned leech, and deserve no support.  If you can't find work, that's one thing, but if you turn down an offer of work, you're obviously not that needy, so you should get no support from society.  Back then, I would have shoveled shit if I had to.  I ended up going to work for a dealership as a lot jockey.  It's not glorious work by any means, but money is money.   Yes, it is.  Look at the former DDR, USSR, and today's DPRK.  All "working to communism".  Government control of everything.   Yes, by the fuel tax.  $0.18 federal tax, and $0.25 state tax.  Anybody who buys fuel pays for the roads.  They don't pull that money out of thin air, it's from fuel taxes.  The last I checked, fuel isn't free or subsidised.  Just because you pillocks in Europe pay asinine fuel taxes that make your fuel cost over $6/ga, doesn't mean that you have a better transportation network.  Outside of China, we have the largest developed road network in the world.   How's the IRA doing these days?  10 Downing Street been bombed lately?   On STATE and COUNTY roads, not the federal road network.  If it wasn't for JIT delivery, the interstate system could disappear right now, and I wouldn't notice a bit of difference.    Petroleum is bought at the fuel station, (which is a privately owned business), shipped in large tanker trucks (also a private business), after being refined from oil, (also a private business), that was extracted from the ground by a large oil company, (also a private business).  Who's safety standards is my vehicle in compliance with?  Likely nobody's  It's a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer LT.  I know for a fact it wouldn't pass emissions.  But WA state doesn't have emissions checks outside of King and Spokane county.  Hell, I run a straight pipe.  I cut out the catalytic converter 5 years ago.  Education isn't "free".  Somebody is paying for it.  In the USA for K-12, it's the land owners that pay for the "free" education of primary and secondary school.  If you're poor enough, you can even make a little bit of money with the Pell grant system if you attend a community college.    You won't be out a damned dime, all books would be covered, and you'll even make a little bit of money on top of that.  University is expensive.  About $25,000 a year for instate tuition, plus all the fees.  That's unreasonable, and the only way somebody could afford that without debt is to be independently wealthy, (or have connections).  And enrolling in school with a bunch of teens and 20 somethings is right in the list of my priorities the day after WWIII happens, and we bomb each other with dildos made out of silly putty.  College is completly useless at the community college level here.  I could get a degree in "customer service" for $12000, which would qualify me to .... work retail.  Yay.  Or you know, I can just go work retail, and skip all the debt and unneeded expenses.  Dropping 12k to get a 17.5k/year job.  Yeah, that's a good investment.  NOT.  Whoop de fucking doo, you're an engineer, and have more money than god.  I never will.  I've long given up on dreaming.  Dreaming happens when you sleep, and it isn't real.  People who still "dream" as adults have too much time on their hands, and need to get back to reality.  Life is what it is, and no amount of fantasizing of hoping or wishing will change it.  And for your information, I only went once back in 2010, and haven't went back yet.  (I have no need to).  In addition to giving them a whole truck load after that one time, I'll still occasionally buy a few extra things at IGA, and put them in the buggies that are set up for donations.  I've been there, and know how much it sucks, so if I can make somebody's day a little bit less sucky because I put in a flat of chilli, good.  It's not like it's expensive.  For $12, they get 15 cans.   Healthcare should have minimum standards as set by the CDC, (and they are), but beyond that, only emergent care should be subsidised.  For a regular checkup, pay the damned bill.  It's only $100.  I don't even remember the last time I even saw a doctor.  Yes, I make little enough that I do qualify for medicaid, but I don't even bother using it.  I really have no reason to see a doctor even once a year.  The church specifically isn't the best arbiter of where resources should go, but private charities are better than government largess.  Remember NOLA?  Who were the first trucks to deliver supplies there?  Was it Red Cross, or the national gaurd?  Nope.  It was Walmart.  They sent trucks in with batteries, potable water, propane tanks, tarps, etc.  All free.  Regarding articles:  Here you go:  http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/04/10/lesson-for-april-15-why-government-cant-replace-charity/  I've never heard a thing called Jesus syndrome, and no, there is no virtue in suffering.  It should be a temporary thing, (if it exists), not a lifestyle.  Hard times come, and hard times go.  But if they come and stay, the problem isn't with the system, it's with you.  If a person thinks they are "above" a job while unemployed, they have some twisted sense of reality.  Do whatever it takes to keep the lights on.  Dreams are for children, and reality takes the driver's seat once you're an adult.  Yes, socialism, is government control of the economy, while the corporation is worker-owned.  Communism is where the government owns and controls everything. from how many bolts will be made in XXX factory, to how many potatoes will be harvested that year, and who will receive those potatoes.  How's your Trabant running these days?  Did you just get your ration of Rondo today?   I drove there, and called them up to see what the hours of the food bank were, (I saw a flier on a pole, so I took the number, and called to verify).  I don't hardly ever use federal highways.  I travel on state/county/city roads almost exclusively.  I was last on the interstate last January.  Hell, the nearest interstate is over 75 miles north of me.  I've only done it once, (can't shoot a wheat field to get bread).  But yes, I did repay them back many times over.  I got maybe $50 worth of food, but once I went back to work, I loaded up my truck and gave them back $258 worth of food.  Unlike the government, where whatever they give you was compulsory taken from somebody else. private charities are willingly donated to.    I'm 32 years old, and I'm willing to bet you're an early 20 something who think that the government is the best solution to all of society's ills.  If that were the case, the USSR would have never failed, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep people out, (like we do with Mexico), instead of people in.  Yeah, you probably got in free because you either greased some palms, or had connections.  I wouldn't go to school even if it were free.  I would only do it if it were free, all books were paid for, and I got paid at least $19,000 a year to attend.  That's never going to happen, so I'll never attend.  It's not worth it.  I could personally give a shit less about unions.  Join one if you want.  However, mandatory union membership should not exist anywhere.   There's a difference between knowing that what I do online is tracable by my ISP, (and even then, I could use a VPN if I wanted), versus the passive media of TV.  I don't really want my TV, and some goons at TWC or DirectTV seeing my bum and pillock because I'm too lazy to put on pants.   I bet you couldn't even pass a US citizenship test.  If you can't pass the test, you don't deserve the right to vote.  If you have no understanding of how the government operates, you deserve no say in how the nation is run.   If you're perpetually reliant on the government to sustain your daily life, that is effectively no different than a minor child being reliant on his parents to live.   I paid them back easily once I got a job.  I got maybe $50 in foodsuffs from them, but once I was back to work, I loaded up my truck, and drove over there with $258 worth of food. I boggled thier mind when I told them I have a donation, and I'm going to need help to unload it.  They were pleasantly surprised when they asked what I wished to donate, and told them "Everything in the truck"  That's the difference between private charities and government entities.  What the government gives out to somebody, they have forcibly taken from somebody else.  When a private charity gives out goods, those goods were willingly given to that charity without threat of force.    Government should not be in the charity business, it should be left to the private sector.  They are more efficient, and know where resources are needed.  If the government were better at resource utilization, the USSR would have never fell, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep the west out, and not the East in.   What's that going to do?  I know "non-realtime communications".  But hell, I can do that now with reddit, and email.  non-realtime broadcasting would make no sense.  It's sent over the air, and goes to the TV.  To "time shift", I have this magical thing invented in the 70's called a "VCR".  (well, my VCR is from 1994).   You're a bleeding heart liberal that runs off of emotion, and uses no logic in consideration of who you cast your ballot for.  Feelings are your sole guide in life, and if somebody questions why you voted for a person, you probably resort to "you're a wacist"..   "I didn't smoke that much pot!  I'm a frying pan!"   I've actually toyed with this idea. " God: The parent who isn't there for adults who's parents weren't there". I've noticed that the most fervent believers have had either abusive parents, or absent parents who didn't give a shit about their kids. They had no father to seek solace in, so they seek solace in the feelings that their idealistic invisible sky daddy initiates when thought about. It's sad.    I primarily use my phone for mobile internet access.  I would be perfectly fine at $0.45/min of calling time, and $0.50/text.  I'm on the phone maybe 20 min a month, and send maybe 2 texts a month.  If I had unlimited internet, I honestly wouldn't care what voice/text service I had.   He didn't?  News to me!  Let's publish it!  HEY EVERYBODY!  SHERLOCK NEvER TOOK A DUMP! :D    Brave New World is an apt comparison.  All the information is there for anybody who wants it, but most people are fine being Betas and Gammas, and don't want to read.  Soma and LOLcats are their obsession.  Don't forget the Touchy-Feelies over on /r/politics!  You want to read and be informed?  You must be a fag or something.  Wow, reality has become a dystopian novel. :(   My bedroom TV is from 2002, and it doesn't even have a ATSC tuner in it.  I have it plugged direct into the wall, going through a QAM converter box to pick up digital channels.  I WON'T rent a cable box.  I don't want the CATV company seeing what I watch on my own private line.  Fuck targeted advertising.  If the day ever comes where I can't just plug in the line, and do a channel scan, I'm dumping CATV.  I've already started hooking up my "new" antenna.  I just have to figure out how to build a YAGI.   I'm not a Luddite.  I don't fear technology is going to put me out of work, (I'll do anything), nor am I technologically adverse.  I just don't like GPS, cameras, or mics.  (unless I'm taping something).  Yes, I still use my VCR.  My laptop is outdated enough, (Eee PC 1000HD), that Windows XP fully updated takes about 45 minutes to boot.  Windows 7 took 20 minutes.    I completely got rid of Windows on it back in 2011, and replaced it with Debian running LXDE as the DE.  I have WINE 1.7 installed, so I CAN run Win32 programs if I really want to.  I haven't found a need to yet.  I'm thinking about swapping out my HDD for a SSD to make it boot faster, but it works fine for me.  I run Debian Sid.  I run Windows 10 on my desktop, but as far as portability and performance are concerned, Windows can go blow goats.   32 earth years as humans measure time.   My laptop is from 2009, and has no camera.  My phone is a SGSI, and has no front facing camera.  My truck is from 1997, and has the second year of OBDII diagnostics.  No GPS at all.  I don't even own a gaming platform The last one I even used was the SNES, back in 1994.   Can you now cram a half a loaf of bread into a pill? Are you a blue whale?   Round wheels are outdated. Replace them with tracks.   I refuse to buy one.  My cell phone is a SGS I.  No front camera.  When I did have my SGS III, I put black tape over the front lens.  I don't want a front facing camera.   [YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT!  FOR YOUR RIGHT! TO PAAAAAAARTY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk)   My laptop is from 2009, and I don't use webcams or mics.  I won't buy a laptop with a webcam or mic already installed. My desktop doesn't have a mic or a webcam, and I don't want one either.  Regarding my phone.  I'm on it so little that I'd be fine with a PDA with internet-only service, and calling rates at $0.45/min.  I don't even text that much.  Maybe 2 messages a month.   IN SOVIET RUSSIA... TV WATCHES YOU! (Hmm, smart TV's in the USA. Hits a little bit close to home eh?) The TeleScreen out of 1984 is here, and PEOPLE CLAMOR TO BUY ONE!! It was supposed to be a warning, not a "I want this" book! :( It's already bad enough that we have the "TV Walls" directly out of Fahrenheit 451, and the earbuds as described in that novel. Yes, I like my earbuds as much as the next dude, but when the TV watches YOU, technology has gone too far. I will never own a smart TV. I'd rather smash my TV with a hammer than buy that shit.      A train traveling through the DDR is carrying Stalin, Krushchev, and Breznev through the Urals. It breaks down.  Stalin lines up the crew of the train, the local villagers, and the passengers, and shoots every 5th person.  Krushchev lines up the survivors and gives them a rousing speech about how much better Soviet trains will run in 7 years.  Breznev sits back down, pulls the blind shut, bounces up and down in his seat, and pretends the train is still running.  The DDR politburo votes themselves out of office because the train won't run.  :D   [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/41208764?reviews_limit=9 ) for 3% solution.  Want 90%?

I think it's around $5/lb.    **EDIT:** You probably need clearance from BATFE and the FBI too.  And you thought gasoline was expensive?   Pure H2O2 is around $40/ga.

So you're saying the blowhard His Highness Jessie Jackson **does** represent all black people?   The LD50 is 2g/KG.  a 4.5 OZ chug would kill 50% of people weighing 150LBS.  http://avogadro.chem.iastate.edu/MSDS/H2O2_30pct.htm   Post offices:  Where you get mail.  Post Roads:  Roads used to transport the mail.  See *Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States* (1833).  http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_7s7.html   Nobody represents anybody except for themselves.  Just like that windbag Jessie Jackson doesn't represent black people.   Yes, a couple of times I've had to go to the church food bank just to keep food on the table, (I had meat from the deer, but nothing else).  I'll sit through a sermon to get bread and chilli, and 1 can of soda, and pinto beans.  It's humiliating, but if it keeps my wife and daughter fed, I'll do it.  It sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do to keep food on the table.  Yes, I would much rather be independent, and get off of assistance as fast as possible, but being unemployed for 7 months not knowing how to keep the lights on, or where your next meal is coming from kind of sucks.  Actually, it sucks a lot.  I didn't have to worry about losing my place, because I paid a year ahead.  I got CATV because I have cable tools.  I wasn't ballsy enough to fuck with the electric box.  That shit can, (and will), kill you, (if you don't burn alive first).  Temporary stop-gap measures are one thing, (that's why safety nets exist, to keep you from falling to your metaphorical death), but it's a net, not a damned hammock.  I gave up my daughter for adoption later, because I reasoned "if I can't even feed myself without resorting to poaching and begging churches, how the hell am I going to feed a kid?  I can't even afford diapers for her, and she's using my old shirts."  I went on a 15 mile walk that day, and almost didn't come back home.  I was thinking one thing that day.  "Head south".  Where I was going?  I have no clue beyond "south". I got a ride back to town with the county sheriff.  My wife called me in, and the sheriff convinced me to get in his rig so he could take me back home.   I got no problems with the income tax, I fully expect to support the DOD with my dollars, (hey, I live here too, and if the Russians invade, the USMC and Navy are the first line of defence).  But to support old fuckers who live off of the dole on SSI who contribute nothing to the economy, (and never will again).  Fuck that shit.  Also "sin tax" is full of shit too.    Where you came to the fight defending liberals.  Since you defend them, you are one.   Well, you did self ID as a liberal.  That makes you a Communist, Socialist, Green, or Democrat.  And since all of these parties have no chance in hell, I'm willing to bet you vote Democratic.   The US Constitution actually explicitly authorises "Post offices and Post Roads".  (Article I, section 8).  It's not an "either-or" proposition.  It's "within the confines of the constitution" proposition.  Also, the Federal government only pays for the US road network, and Interstate system.  County roads are paid by the county, city roads by the city, and state routes by the state.  The Federal government really has very little say in the road infrastructure.   Depends on what taxes.   Actually, I would expect people raised by parents who can't keep to a simple buget to be more advantaged.  They saw what not living within your income will do.  (power shut off, loss of cable TV, having to sell drugs just to make ends meet, eviction, etc).  That is a good lesson on what **NOT** to do.    Yes, there is a difference between taking SNAP in a temporary situation, and making a lifesyle out of it.  If you need it temporarily because you honestly can't afford to feed your family, or if you "poach" a deer for nothing but the meat, (I didn't see anything).  Shit happens, and a temporary helping hand (or a blind eye), can work wonders.  But if you make a lifestyle choice out of being a welfare queen, then you should be thrown out on the streets, and have all your benefits cut for life.  I've been within 12 hours of having my utilities cut, and I went hat in hand to CAC for emergency electricity assistance.  I've got it once.  I was literally looking at having my power cut in the middle of January, and Project Share through Avista kept my lights on.  That was the most embarrassing day of my life.  I shot a whitetail deer that year to keep my family fed, and I didn't have a license.  I did it out of need, not want.  (it was out of season anyways, so I couldn't have gotten a licence even if I wanted to).  But then again, if I could afford the hunting license, I wouldn't be illegally harvesting game, would I?  Yes, sometimes times can get tough, and people do need a helping hand, but if you make it a lifestyle, you're a fucking mooch, and should be thrown out on your ass.  BTW, I don't have my parents to rely on.  My dad died in 2010.  My mom is too busy traveling the country to CA and AZ outrunning the cold.  I have my step-mom.  I've only called her once, and that was when I stupidly parked in a neighbor's parking spot and got a $500 tow bill for one day.  I owe her that money back, and I fully intend to repay her, (whenever I can scare up the $380 that I have remaining).   http://i.imgur.com/INyH3O5.jpg               Then you have SSI, and SSDI in case of an intractable severe mental of physical illness.  Those are special cases.  I was thinking more along of the welfare queens who crank out children so they can get TANF and food stamps, and section 8 housing, and Medicaid.  They don't work because they don't want to, not because they physically cannot.  If you had shitty parents, it's time to grow up and learn to make your own way in the world.    I grew up upper-middle income, and at 32 years old, I make less than $20,000 a year.  Hell, the most I ever made was $10/hr in 2008.  Adjusted for inflation, that's $11.12/hr in today's dollars.  I honestly don't think I'll ever earn $80,000 a year, or even $24000 a year, (adjusted for inflation).  Still, there is value in independence, and not having your ass pampered by the "all knowing and all caring government".   I know about the Demon-craptastic party, and that's enough for me.    No more than you liberals wanting Uncle Sam to be your daddy. while remaining a perpetual dependent child.   The desire to be free to do as I like, so long as I don't harm anybody else.  Also, I view government dependence as a negative thing.  You're an adult, rely on yourself; not the government.   Two men walk into a bar, and the bartender asks "What'll you have?"

AKA:  Cougar.   Looks like a Puma to me.   Yes, most of the time.  They mostly want to be left alone, and are human adverse.  They only wander into human territory if they are extremely hungry, and intend to get meat wherever they can.  On the ranch, they'll attack your livestock.  But if you shoot at it, (well, in front of it), it'll run.  Pumas are also known as a mountain lion, or a cougar.  	200

Sheeeesh   I saw that the first time I saw the trailer.   Prisoners (2013)   Nightcrawler (2014). Both star Jake Gyllenhaal and both were my favorite movies of the year that that came out. I feel like I have similar tastes to you in movies! Nightcrawler is on Netflix, check it out!   What is he talking about??? Margot Robbie is FINEEEEE   Yea, you lost me when you mentioned the Star Wars prequels. I really hope 'The Force Awakens' furthers the plot with some more fun senate meetings!   I liked them too, but since the fanboy-dom died down in me since my viewing I can objectively look back and say they weren't up to par with some of their good movies. Ant-Man was good though. Just go into it like its a fun heist movie and you'll be pleased.   Same boat. Atleast it wasn't the flop everyone was expecting or the travesty that Ironman 2, Ironman 3, and Captain America 1 were.

 Knowing the value of a dollar. I'm by no means rich, or a trust fund baby. But my family has provided for me, I don't ask for too much to begin with. We live comfortably but I think I still take a lot for granted like education, food, and housing from the parental units.   My great x3 grandma was an Eisenhower. Her sister was Dwight Eisenhower's grandma. Blood relatives to Dwight Eisenhower b-otch.   I've always personally thought that it would be Leonardo Da Vinci. He had himself immersed in so many different fields and abilities that he would have accomplished a lot.   Wots...uh the deal and mudmen are the best moments of the album for me   I've had the same exact thought, except with religions. Not too be too antagonizing, just a thought I've had   Tom Hanks   Concerts, not talking about the thrash metal ones where people are literally throwing themselves at each other on purpose (This is definitely seems harmful). I'm talking about any concert where there is standing room in the front and people just try to crowd to the front. The amount of dehydration that occurs in conjunction with any drugs/alcohol can make people faint and get trampled on. I'm sure this seems pretty harmful, but you'd be surprised.

Estimates are bull shit.   My roommates and I usually run an electric bill of about $120. That's a lot for us, but ya'know being in college up all hours of the night + computers + appliances, it's not hard to believe we spend that much. However, this month, the electric company charged us $240, which truly surprised all of us. So basically, my roommate called up the power company, and after some circular logic and avoiding an answer. Our bill turned out to be a more reasonable $130. How can they over charge $110 without even caring? Should be a law or something in place?   EDIT: is it the style of the meter that's outdated or just the meter? Because our apartment complex is brand new.   Oh god my girlfriend has these   cheers dude   I really follow along with twitch, so any good streamers will be watched by me, thanks homie.

EDIT:  sorry computer users, I just want the good Ol days  EDIT 2: I didn't restart the game after the reset   Ahhhh, thanks for the clarification. Still awesome in it's own right.   Hmm I haven't given Piper it's credit. I've only listened to it a handful and never knew about the literary influences on it. Maybe I'll have to read the book and get back to the album.   After the discussion about Amused To Death the other day on here. It got me thinking about what the general fans in /r/pinkfloyd like to read. Because Amused To Death is a nod to [Neil Postman's Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) "Amusing Ourselves To Death" which talks about the books "1984" and "A Brave New World" and his conjecture about which is happening to society. Also Pink Floyd's Animals album is largely influenced by [Animal Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) by George Orwell. So there are two distinct albums that are directly influenced by literature. So I'm assuming that since PF is intertwined with literature, so must their fan base. What are some of your guy's favorite books?   Listened to this album today actually! Great album, I think my least favorite is What God Wants Pt. 1. I get the full message of the song, I just think he kinda belabors the point, and the song becomes static.   I was in middle school when school of Rock came out. Jack Black tells the girl singer to go listen to this song to learn more and appreciate music. My first pink Floyd song I ever heard. The rest is history.   The Division Bell is my go-to studying album. Such an effortless album to listen through, I love it.   When?   Yep I was in a very similar situation, and I was angry too. But I took my menial existence as a freedom to do what I loved. Not freedom to say whatever the hell I want and make people feel like shit. Too much /r/atheism is about pointing out christians in society and getting a hard-on about how pathetic they are. That's not what I am or ever will be about.   /r/atheism, I personally would identify as an atheist, but I wouldn't identify as an arrogant ass hole   I love this song, gotta give this album another spin   I personally like it more than The Wall and Meddle. I like echoes more than anything on obscured by clouds. But I think OBC as a complete project is better than Meddle.   This song and mudmen are my favorite from the album. These two songs back to back are so gnarly   Some parts of AHMS can definitely compete with Echoes, I love the choir in harmony with Rick's playing. There are some parts I dislike with both songs, but Echoes is easily the more powerhouse song. Echoes's story is just flat out beautiful.  EDIT: I just listened to it again and holy hell... anyone else think 17:50 to 18:00 sounds similar to Echoes?   OP edited wiki page?   It used to be dogs, but Sheep is my favorite now. It's so fun to listen to with Rogers vocals blending into the synthesizers.

The message of the song changes, but the sound can be static. Still a powerful song though   I've tried browsing around the Internet but I need something in more layman terms.   Parts VI-IX in Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd   Jude Law's cereal   Ya really fucked up the title on this one OP. And you make it seem like there's a contingent of people actively telling people not to draft. Is this a real thing? Also I'm against it because I don't want an asshole tailgating me and then reading a text and knocking me into the median.   Pink Floyd were one of the starters of Prog Rock, along with King Crimson. Listen to Pink Floyd, they are so much more than a stoner band and a T-shirt with the dark side of the moon album cover that the skateboarder in your 9th grade gym class used to wear. If ya need anywhere to start ask me or /r/pinkfloyd has an awesome and open community   Newspapers and bookstores are in the same boat in my opinion. They'll still be around for years to come, but in decreasing physics copies as the digital age takes over. Newspaper companies will still write articles as much as ever, it'll probably just be mainly people reading on their iPhone14's   Skylar White from Breaking Bad.

But you can?   No worries man haha   I see where you're coming from and I totally agree. I'm not the first to say this either but we live in a society where everyone gets a gold medal and no one finishes last. We don't have that American grit anymore. There's a difference between grit/toughness and rubbing people the wrong way. Unfortunately people get rubbed the wrong way and everyone has to take sensitivity classes. I've been harassed, not to the scale that many others have, but I've always just taken it on the chin, because they're just words.   I mean I'm not particularly offended by it, I just know that this would not be recreated in today's society, and figured it'd give an interesting/almost humorous look into history. It's obviously a caricature of what a stereotypical Japanese citizen/soldier would look like. And it calls them a "Jap" which is considered a racial slur. Again, I'm not personally offended, just explaining.         That's awesome! I never noticed that, I love how much detail the writers put into this show. It seems like I could learn something new from an episode each time I watch it.   I'm pretty sure that Eddie Van Halen's son, Wolfgang (I think that's his name), is the bassist for the band now. I know he used to be touring with his dad.   Pink Floyd - Animals   Tread lightly      The Mirror by John Frusciante (He's the guitarist for Red Hot Chili Peppers) I've never read an actual meaning for this song but I always took it as a reflection of yourself and the ability to grow as a human  [The Mirror by John Frusciante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Th9fMCNH9Q)   The Mirror being one of my favorite songs   im your uncle   Enjoy your boner shock, you damn inbred    well I'm a damn fool   F me -.- haha   TL;DR anyone?

That's a shame, and I'm sorry to hear that. Luckily they haven't had that negative effect on me    I haven't run into those people, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It makes sense though   Ok   I can see that, I'm one of the people that thought it was stoner wanna-be's that listened to them. Then I gave them a real look and realized that pink Floyd is beyond all that and I don't associate my fandom with drugs at all  	91
 This would be a legitimately awesome remake.   Ahhhh my face hurts!   Upvote not only for a good idea, but for a horticultural username!   Ooo!  Details please!   I dream of such a meeting.   Beautiful color!  What do you guys do together?   I need to photoshop a fake book cover for this title. My horse trainer is obsessed with those books too, so she would die laughing!    I must tell her this!  She looks no where near her age, and I think it's awesome.  I hope I have those genes!   Oh dear God.   Awwwww...that is so cute!  I'll have to see if my horse likes strawberries, I never thought to give him those.  He's a carrot man all the way.   Oof, I will not.  He's a gelding, so he'd probably get really sexually frustrated.   She will love you for saying that. :)   Reddit ALL THE PONIES!     Now I have to look that up.  I've never heard it.  Maybe it'll be my horse's new jam.  Right now he's really into LMFAO's "Party Rock Anthem" (seriously, he boogies to it).   Of course!  I'm sure they love you too, especially my horse -- he loves EVERYONE.     Cute!  Horses are much more "tuned in" to what is going on than people think.     I see a Halloween costume in his future...   I try to spend a lot of time with him in his stall at horse shows so he doesn't get bored.  My mom and I were hanging out in there and talking about when our friends were riding later in the day, so she pulled the horse show schedule out of her purse and started to look over it.  He came over and stuck his face right in it and was like, "what is that!?!?!?!".  She laughed and she started "showing" him which competitions our friends were in and when they would happen.  Usually he is very busy and squirms all over, but he just stood there staring and listening and wanted her to talk more.  Really, he loves attention, so he likes lots of things: stories, toys, going for walks, neck scratches, etc.  He just likes to be with people. :)      That face...I know it all too well.   Take my upvote!  For I, too, have a dog named Apollo.  http://i.imgur.com/1E77X.jpg   Puppy = pony.  Socks = legwraps.  But really though, AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!      How is this not on the front page?  This is the epitome of AWWWWWW.   Upvotes for rats!     OH the ears!  The ears are too cute!   I see countless ads advertising a horse that is a "3 year old philly".  Like the cream cheese?      He is perfect!  And I love his facial hair. :)    Dear God, she's only 9 and she's already cooler than I will ever be.   I still have my old iBook G4, which I would loan you happily, but it's 8 or 9 years old, and not exactly the sleek wonder that my MacBook Pro is.  It does, however, show how well these computers age.  I only had to get a new computer because the G4 couldn't handle some of the software I needed for grad school.     Mr. Tastee was my favorite, and am still, to this day, fascinated by the mystery man in the swirly head.  Even my username is inspired by him!  Was the guy that played Tastee also in other roles on the show?  Or did he only play that one character?  I've always wondered what he looked like, but I'm not sure if seeing the face of Tastee would make my childhood or ruin it.    Also, do you know why season three of Pete and Pete never got released on DVD?  Where seasons 1 and 2 not selling as well as they had hoped?  Seems like there are a lot of Redditors...errr...people who would rush out to buy season 3.  Edit:  Just found [this](http://www.redbubble.com/people/meganlara/works/8098367-mr-tastees-blue-tornado-bars) online.  Commence purchasing.   Whoever made this suggestion was CORRECT!  Nice foreguns. :)   He really is.  It's too bad, because that subreddit has more followers, and is updated more often.  I still check it out, but just can't post.  Does anyone know if there's something you can do about mods like that?  Is there any sort of place where you can say, "this mod is out of control?"  I feel like so many people are treated unfairly by him.  If you look at his comment history it can be downright cruel.  I'd love to report his actions, but don't know who to contact.   Wishing a speedy recovery to your boy!  My horse has a talent for banging himself up doing normal things (lunging, trying to take his blanket off, being turned out), so I know the fear when you get that call.   AH HAHAHAHA!  This is hilarious.  Now I'm mad at myself for not taking a picture like this.  So many missed opportunities.  Yeah, you guys are right about the mod on r/horses.  I got banned because I asked him to rephrase one of the subreddit's rules (it was poorly worded and people would get confused and inadvertantly violate it).  Let's make it a better party over here on r/Equestrian!   Is it one by Adam Turman?  He has this one: http://adamturman.blogspot.com/2008/04/new-stuff-march-08.html   She is so beautiful!  That's pretty unusual to have blue eyes surrounded by dark skin/hair, isn't it?     You are very attractive (even though you have the toots).   And people say dogs can't smile. :)  Too cute!!!   Please fix the rule then about for sale items.  It currently reads: "All items, services for sale and blog articles should be posted in the proper reddit post linked to from the right sidebar."  There is no "for sale" category on the sidebar.  In fact, there are not categories at all on the sidebar.  Just make the rule "no items/horses for sale".   Hehe...Dennis Hopper.      Are you familiar with the phenomenon of "visual snow"?  If so, do you think this is something that will be researched and potentially cured, or since it is benign, do you think I'll just have to live with it forever?  I've had it all my life, and it makes my night vision poor to the point that I sometimes wonder if I should have a restricted driver's license.      I work with Morgans.  As for tapping the back legs, we don't ask them to move the back legs, simply move the front ones and stretch out their back legs.  If you mare moves her front legs forward, and the centers the weight of her body on her front legs, her back legs will stretch out.  I don't think Morgans park out differently than TWHs, do they?  Here is a parked out Morgan:http://randstables.com/files/2012/02/BoogieNE.jpg  You can see that he is putting most of his weight on his front legs.   The way my trainers have done it in the past is through patience and repetition.  First you have to teach her how to do it in hand, and then you can move up to doing it under saddle (for the line-up).  Halter your mare and take her out.  You could even do it in cross ties if you want, to make your life easier.  Take a whip, or even the handle of a broom, and gently tap on the back of one of her front legs, saying "down".  "Down" will be your command for parking out.  Then when she moves her foot, lots of praise!!!  Now do the other one, saying "down".  More praise!!!!!!!  Carrots!!!!!  Sometimes horses have problems lining their feet up straight when they are learning to park out.  I've seen my trainers grab the top of the horse's withers and rock them back and forth, to unbalance the horse just a bit and get them to square up their feet.    Once she does it on the ground with you saying "down", and maybe just tapping a tiny bit or not at all, try it under saddle.  Find a long whip and pretend like you are in the lineup at a show.  Tell her "down", and lean over to tap her legs with the whip.  She'll probably put two and two together after a few tries.  In a show, you won't want to tap her legs with the whip, but you can tap her on the shoulder and tell her "down", and that is a refinement of the command.  Most of our horses park out when they are told "down", and many of them park out automatically when they come into the middle of the ring to stand.    I hope this makes sense and I hope it helps!  It should be a fun exercise for you and your mare -- you get to learn together!  Good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.    Classes at breed shows get big and it's often important to stand out.  The judge may love your horse, but if your horse doesn't have distinctive markings you may get lots in a sea of navy hunt coats!  I show my Morgan in the Hunter Pleasure division, and have one light green coat and one tan/gold coat.  I wear them with dark shirts, and wear the tan coat with dark brown breeches.  I also wear a conservative belt, and sparkly stock pins and number pins.  Some bling is totally ok!  It would look crazy in the H/J circuit, but at a breed show it's very typical.  For reference, here are a few photos to give you an idea:  Tan coat on my gelding: http://i.imgur.com/mDkbs.jpg Green coat on my mare: http://i.imgur.com/DwQf9.jpg Green coat on my gelding (a bit washed out by the flash): http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg  Hope this helps, and may you have blue ribbon rides!      What is he crossed with?  He looks like a purebred Morgan to me!   This needs to go on my wall!    I'm here for you in this difficult time.   I love plants, so I've volunteered at the Como Conservatory in St. Paul, and I now work at Noerenberg Gardens.  While I have a paid position, many people there are volunteers.    Also, go to volunteermatch.org.  You can search for volunteer positions by interest and location.  It's pretty awesome.   My boyfriend and I have lived in Minnetonka for a few years and love it.  You're right, there ARE lots of great trails and parks here.  We take out dog all sorts of places and go hiking and swimming.  I'll have to look up some details for you as far as things to do, but there is no shortage!  PM me if you like.  Maybe we can meet up sometime.   Double the sodium!   Haha, the saddle *does* have some shape to it.  It's not like my saddleseat saddle!  Here is a picture of a Wotan, though I feel like mine may be a bit more shallow.  It's a great saddle if you're looking for an all-purpose close contact type.  http://www.countrytack.com/used_saddles/wotan_left.JPG   I personally have a Stubben Wotan I bought off ebay.  It was only $350, and in amazing condition.  Not sure what you like as far as cushion/support, but I love the Wotan because there is no padding on the seat or knee roll areas, and the knee roll is very small.  Also, the saddle is fairly flat, which fits my horse well and is what I like to ride in, but won't work if your horse has high withers.    Maybe you like a squishy saddle...if you do, the Wotan is NOT for you, but I do love mine!   :)  Also, I use it for riding at home and showing, and it is a great all around saddle.     HECK YES!  My friend and I were watching this one day now that we are older, and agree that he is dreamy (especially in the 3rd movie) even though is a cartoon dog.     I had that one!  Now I want to know where it is.  Personally, I still use my Power Rangers insulated lunch box at work (I'm 26).  Also, your username is wonderful and I envy it.    	56
                oh, sorry, i didnt recognize you, you look different than from when i'm on my knees going down on a girl   like i said, i know plenty of girls who still have a functioning penis, and who regularly use it. One thing's for sure, you will NEVER lack for partners. it's amazing how many propositions i get on OKCupid. Trans girls are at the top of a lot of people's fuck bucket list. hell, when i came out, all my gay AND lesbian friends wanted to sleep with me. it was hilarious.   i'm a 42 year old adult trans girl lesbian who shared so many of his fears that as a result ran so far deep into the closet that i was eating pussy in Narnia.         it's complicated, i dont mind having a penis, i just dont like using it for sex (dysphoria is a bitch). i never felt they were the right bits to be on a girl, so i always had an aversion to penetrative sex. add to that, i lean more asexual now and you pretty much get a penis that doesnt work anymore.                               went for the hormones, yes. but i still have the naughty bits, lots of girls do. i know several who love using it. for me, because i'm asexual, i really have no attachment to the parts one way or another. i just dont want to risk the surgery. maybe that will change, but for now, i'm happy the way i am.   and when it comes to my partners(i'm poly) i'll rock the strap-on and fuck them seven ways from sunday.       i've known some trans people who have changed orientation. i used to get off on forced fem and tgirl porn. once i transitioned, i drifted towards the asexual side of the spectrum. my attraction tho, didnt change, i was definitely still into girls.   also, as a girl, orgasms are WAY better. (jes sayin)         you know, for the longest time, i tried to convince myself i was a straight crossdresser, that dressing was my fetish. but that urge wasnt just an urge to dress up, it was an urge to be female. dressing kinda scratched the urge, and for the longest time it was enough, until it started to become more  insistent as i got older, and then it became this NEED to be a girl.  So i transitioned, pretty much because i didnt really have a choice anymore. i had to become who i knew i was   i dunno how the thread devolved into a discussion about Intelligent Design, but.... people ACTUALLY believe that? like, REAL people actually believe in I.D.?      maybe if you had previously read up on that particular area, i dont think it's widely known outside that particular area of specialization tho   dont forget Santorum, Steve King, Huckabee, Scott Lively, Glenn Beck, O'Rielly, et al   well, that's easy, Romney advocated "self-deportation" a term that was minted back in the 90's as satire, but what the GOP took as an actual position.  Donald Trump is currently saying that Mexicans are rapists.  most of the base of the republican party is white, and they dont like the NON-white people all that much      because Science sometimes has to catch up with common sense. we KNOW we do it, Science gives us the reasons WHY we do it.  twas always thus, and always thus shall be   i found it relevant considering Walker's position on immigration, which, coincidentally, reflects the position of the GOP in general towards the 12 million illegal immigrants in the country.      that's probably the most succinct breakdown i've read so far       i'm kinda late to this thread, but here are my thoughts.  1) if it's not bleeding too bad, monitor it for awhile and if it still doesnt improve, go to the ER/urgent care(or equivalent) and get treatment for it there.  2) make an appointment with a therapist. please. i dont know the reasons behind your attempt, but i know you were prolly in a really dark place. it's one that a lot of us recognize from past experiences. but the spiral doesnt always have to lead downwards, you have to find a way to change that path. please, please, PLEASE make an appointment with a therapist.                  apparently, slightly more than half of the people who showed up to vote   you're human, and a unique one at that. gender exists on a really broad spectrum, and we spend a lot of time figuring out where the hell we land on it. took me dang near 40 years before i acknowledged that i was a girl. i've known since i was 7, but denial is a helluva thing. i was stuck so far deep in the closet that i was munching carpet in Narnia.  dont let society dictate what you can and cannot do. now that's not to say that there wont be consequences, depending on where you live, being creative in your gender presentation might encourage some backlash. but to be true to yourself is the only way to be happy.   yeeeeeeeeeeeeeup  it is either a glorious thing, or a horrendous thing.... i havent quite figured out which it is going to be   you're welcome! it was a very interesting read for me too.      ;-)      YES, WE KNOW... BUT WHY ARE WE SHOUTING??!!   outstanding use of the word "corpulent"   Then go on blockers, it'll give you time to figure out if you are trans or not. the only one who can answer that question is you. and blockers just push puberty off for a little while longer. that way you can try life as a girl if you want, to see if it IS what you want. not everyone who goes on blockers transitions. but they're all happy that it gave them time to sort things out.  i say go for it. get yourself an appointment with a therapist, and an endo, and get on blockers as quickly as you can. buy yourself some time to figure it out.  *edit: i accident a word   exactly   hell, i moved countries to transition, and it STILL took me til i darned near hit 40 before i came out. we do what we have to do.       and so you are!  ;-)  i post on /r/transspace if you want the news   on a side note, i see i'm not the only one who comes back to check on other girls    why is it scary? to find out who you really are? that's the whole point in life, is it not?   you can come over to /r/asktransgender if you had questions   ha, i came out two weeks after my 39th. i figured i had to do it before i hit 40            sometimes the fever has to get worse before it breaks   plenty of us start off here, you're not the first, nor will you be the last. And it's never too late, i came out at 39. Come on over to /r/asktransgender, you might find a few answers there.   pssst, that's the whole point. the more we talk, the longer he sticks around. this is great. i didnt think the GOP could look any worse.... i was wrong                           but..... free weed!!!!                hmmm, maybe i should change that. i do try and comment in the threads as much as i can. it's kind ahard right now cuz i JUST started a new job, but i should be commenting more as i settle in.   But as far as this sub goes, we're all trying to moderate it in as fair a manner as we can. and we all discuss everything before we do it. That's why this was stickied, because we all wanted to get input from everyone.  i'm really sad to see anyone go, because this sub exists to help all us transies, both new and old.                              so you're saying there's a chance it was.....                                       yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup         i know, i know  i really shouldnt post from my phone. i'm also asian, so my shame knows no bounds.   heya Chel!   i'll allow it ;-)   no, but there's really no good reason to deny people the right to marry more than one person                                                      It's been 34 years since the New York Times frontpaged a story on "Homo Cancer"..... It seems forever in internet time, but it really wasnt all that long ago.                                                                                                                                                            psssst, the frothy one                             	189
 Simple luck. I haven't found one in ages, used to find so many.   "I don't think he can see us, push me over man"   They don't understand the FPS:Entities ratio.   Sound Bug   Zombies walk though doors/walls heaps for me.   Not really relevant. Post this to the Dxtory subreddit.   But the coast is where you will find all the friendly freshies, because sceaming friendly gets you a one way ticket to the coast.   The first two questions have a simple answer: The ARMA II engine. Base building will never be like that, because of a simple thing... Leg breaking.   I want that feature so badly.   In the video you see it dosen't stick to the ground, it just floats at bits, so it would do that. Or it would just not let you place it there at all.   I wish we could get bipods for some weapons, and we could move furniture to where we want, I would have a big table near a window with a gun with a bipod set up, so if I need to I could go and snipe some guys.   I wish people would read what it says when you hover your mouse over the downvote button...   I would choose a house, put cans in the kitchen, if you could open the fridge and close it, that's where all of my cans and canteens would be. I would have a room in the back of the house for my Armory. Also of course I would have a room where there is a bed and in the closet I would have multiple types of clothes such as: Hunting Clothes, Ghillie suits for scouting, etc.    Can you imagine how cool people could make screenshots?   And we're only in 0.53, there seems like there is so much to come.   I really wish we could board up houses. That would make me play DayZ 24/7.   This could mean they are working on Base Building!   *The feels*   Please leave it in Devs.   Throw away your current phone, take out the SIM card, squash/break it. Buy a new one, get a new SIM. Move FAR AWAY. It is not the best outcome, but it is the safest.  	20
    I didn't say that, etzhadaat did. You, however, said that no one, and thus no Republican, has ever said that, when quite clearly there were some who did say this.   All I ever hear from Republicans is that we should let the poor die because they haven't earned our hand-outs.  No one has ever said that. Ever.  I guess you didn't catch the Republican primary debates this year. The audience cheered and shouted "yes, yes" when the moderator said "do you think people without health insurance should just be allowed to die?"   What is "Darwinism" supposed to be--a complete worldview that is somehow built on the scientific theory of evoluton?  In the mind of conservative Christians, yes, that's what it is. Is that what scientists actually believe? No, but the article was about how this group perceives science, not how science actually operates.         It's free on iTunes, at least it was. But yeah, well worth the six bucks - Carlin is awesome.   Cool I will with-hold my skepticism. There have just been too many false claims in the field for me to put too much hope in any one company. Quantum computing was starting to seem like the cold fusion of the computing world. If they really have made some breakthroughs, that would be epic.   Here's what I've heard from some people who are "in the know" (or at least plausibly claim to be):  Far from being "material," our universe is actually a very dense form of spiritual power. The point is to compress it to a level that it basically ignites, sort of like nuclear fusion. Consciousness appearing at the "material" level is the spark of that ignition.         The CIA also invested millions in psychic "remote viewing." D-wave has always smelled scammy to me - they've been promising huge breakthroughs for over five years now with nothing to show for it.   IIRC from a documentary on the subject, this was tried and it didn't work. The algorithms came back with the result that the text was most likely gibberish and there was no code hidden within it. A lot of historians think the manuscript is a hoax (though an old hoax) that was cooked up by some "alchemist" as a secret text and then sold to a gullible nobleman for a tidy sum. Not everyone accepts that conclusion though.   To be fair this is only the O'Reilly/Limbaugh wing and Romney and Ryan saying this. The rest of the GOP is telling them to shut the hell up because they known they need some minority votes to win in the future.  On the other hand, that wing of the party really is the Republican Id. Others in the party share those sentiments they just are too smart to express them openly.   I think you are confusing Susan Rice with Condi Rice?                        Especially since today it's a Federal Reserve note, and Jackson hated Central Banks.   Self-repairing concrete today, self-repairing body parts tomorrow.            It's hard to create a traditional "it was really x" fan theory about a movie that was so deliberately allegorical to begin with, but I'd like to see people try...                  In other words, stimulus prematurely withdrawn can be worse than no stimulus at all.    The CIA secretly funded magazines and TV shows in Europe during the Cold War, including Commentary (which is still around, and is now cheerleading for a war on Iran.)  The Bush Admin. had some right-wing radio talk-show hosts on the payroll, especially those who they thought could get them votes in the black community (didn't work.)   Barney is a future version of Nelson who stole Professor Frink's time machine and returned to the present to warn his childhood self against becoming an alcoholic.  Unfortunately, this whole episode took place while Barney was blackout drunk so he doesn't remember where he's from or what his mission was.   Possibly. I know they had at least one event at the Nuwabian compound, a barbeque or something. I'm no expert on the subject, I just know there is some kind of link. The wikipedia article lists a ton of other acts that were associated with the Nuwabians, most of which were a surprise to me. It seems like Scientology they make an effort to recruit celebrities into the ranks.   True. They are about the same level of dangerous. I'd give the edge to NOI though -  they have political influence in several cities including Philly and Oakland. I don't know of any city council members going to speak at Scientology centers.   The NOI teaches that the Earth and Moon were once the same  That's a very common occult/fringe religion belief. I have no idea where it originated (medieval alchemy, maybe?) but it shows up all over the the place.   That's the only thing you found that was weird?   The rappers OutKast are/were loosely associated with the Nuwabians, though I don't think they are official members.   You can see references to Nuwabian beliefs in the videos for [ATLiens] (http://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-18086078/outkast_atliens_official_music_video/) - ancient Egypt - and [Elevators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptPj6K_jJQ) - blacks coming from/returning to another planet.   NOI has assassinated people, including ex-member Malcolm X      Nooo, I meant the equivalence of the Halting Problem and Goldbach has not been proven. I repeated it in the hopes that someone would be familiar with the issue.   I'm not saying that's correct, just that someone had mentioned it. I guess you could think of checking each even number as a yes/no question? Not sure what the basis for the comment was, I don't think the poster ever elaborated.   Now *that* would be a supremely interesting number - the first number that is not a sum of two primes...   Does group theory help at all with these kinds of problems? I don't know much about Goldbach - though I once read a comment here that in the opinion of many it is equivalent to the Halting Problem and thus unsolvable (though this hasn't been proven either.)   A shame I think, no?  Did anyone else read this in a Russian accent?   United Airlines was union-owned for a while. Unfortunately, it was a bunch of *different* unions and they fought amongst themselves more than they had fought the previous ownership.  Unions don't necessarily represent the pure working class. There are middle-class unions and even business-owner unions. In countries like Venezuela some unions are conservative and oppose the Socialist government. In Poland the trade union Solidarity was a big part in bringing down the Communist government.  This is part of why Communists such as Lenin are not necessarily big fans of unions. Lenin criticized "trade union consciousness" as just another form of bourgeois thinking.      Public funding was cut drastically at the state and local level. The federal cuts are coming, especially if Romney wins.      Bull. They didn't "get it wrong," they did what they always do: Protect the banks, socialize their losses, cut public spending, privatize public assets, and then say "oops" when economies collapse and promise to do it better next time.   Mexico, Asia and now Europe have been subjected to "the treatment."  Wanna guess who's next?      Now they might be, that wasn't true before the current leftist government came to power.   The policy of the Brazilian government encouraging agricultural development, logging and road-building in the Amazon is well-known.    prepared by the hash-slinging slasher?   Don't see why not   The point is, why does the government not only let them do this, but encourage them to do so. GDP-driven calculations are probably part of the decision-making process.      Brazilians cutting down the rainforest for cropland that will be exhausted in five years anyway because of poor soil quality.   Enough so that future generations can have the same benefits from HS sports that they enjoyed.    Almost all pro sports players played high school sports. Of course, only a small fraction of HS sports players become pros. However, a pro player would be silly to say "HS sports did nothing for me, I don't think I should have to pay any school tax."   In general, those decisions which increase economic growth in the short run by depleting non-renewable resources.   But Spongebob is also incredibly friendly and warm to people, a trait not characteristic to autistic people.  That varies. Some autistic children are actually overly friendly, want to talk with strangers   trust them instantly.   That is correct, but political decisions are taken on the basis of GDP being a good measure of economic value, that is the problem.   And if you're looking to measure the value of open source software its contribution to GDP is just about the least exact measure.  I think that was his point, that economics needs to broaden its definition of value beyond GDP.  Someone who walks or bikes somewhere instead of drives is at least preserving value (if not creating it), by reserving the gasoline for someone who may have no choice but to drive (a disabled person, for example.)         True, I forgot to specify, stock-based soups, not cream-based ones.   Yep.   Seems traceable only back to a NewsMax "journalist." I don't consider that a credible source though presumably you do.    More teen pregnancy in red states is probably more a function of poverty than religiosity, though I'm sure the latter contributes as well. Condoms are a sin and you can't buy them in town, but come Friday after the football game, that sex is a sin as well can get forgotten for a while.   You can have a Christian-inspired socialism, as exists in South America. Not all socialists are Marxists.   You mean that quiz designed by a Libertarian to make anyone who's not a Libertarian look like a Stalinist?    What do I not understand about Adlai Stevenson?  The "yellow dog" Democrats at the time - mainly southerners who would rather vote for a "yellow dog" than a Republican. Stevenson was pretty "yellow" in their eyes - he was a northern intellectual, but they voted for him anyway because of the D by his name.    Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist...  That's oversimplified. As a younger man he did think that the "characters" of the races were too different from one another for them to live together in peace, and the best solution was for the slaves to be freed and emigrate to a climate more suited to their culture, like the Caribbean. I think he mentioned Haiti as an example of a successful black Republic being formed in that region.  Also, that was the Lincoln of 1845. The Lincoln of 1865 had come to see the long view of history, and supported not only emancipation but voting rights and the right to hold public office for blacks who owned property or who had served in the military - which is what got him shot by Booth.    Any source on those Johnson quotes?    Even if so, it would be interesting. The movement seems to be falling apart right now, with so many high-level defections and even heretical offshoots appearing that claim to be the original Hubbardism! There are even rumors Cruise is leaving.   I should specify: Not a leader or a PR person, just an ordinary member, preferably one who's been in the organization a number of years and spent a good deal of money on the courses.   If I remember correctly, Bush campaigned on letting younger people opt out of the system altogether, and letting everyone, even those already retired, put their money in 401(k)-style accounts that they could choose to place with mutual fund companies like Fidelity. This is why Gore kept hounding him on the "lockbox" that he was so mocked for. As for the actual bill that got introduced, I don't know if it was that radical in its final version.  At least as it has been reported in the media, Ryan's plan involves replacing Medicare with $6000 vouchers (the per-person cap) with which people could buy private insurance. The government would still subsidize insurance for the elderly, but would no longer guarantee it. Again, this would be phased in, with people over 55 allowed to stay in "traditional" Medicare.    Even Ron Paul's budget preserved SS and medicare.   It envisioned phasing them out, as does Paul Ryan's budget, at least for Medicare, and Bush II tried to privatize SS. I don't think there's as much of a gap between the old and the new Right as you think - they're still fighting the New Deal.   how is the modern right progressive? Because it supports foreign interventions? Other than that I don't see too much difference ideologically between the "old" and "new" right.    well McCarthy went down in flames once he started questioning Eisenhower and the Army, but it launched Nixon's political career, and Bobby Kennedy's, though the right-wingness of either of them later in their lives is debatable to say the least.  I thought you meant the Right in general. For the old Taft wing, you have a point.       last gasp? could've fooled me   Salads aren't actually that great, especially with the stuff most people put on them. Soups and stews have the lowest ratio, dried breads and grains (crackers and chips), and nuts have the highest.   expanding them back to what they were before - card check was legal once - albeit a very long time ago   Not entirely true, especially in the Senate. Witness what happened to card check.   Plenty of Dems have tangled with public sector unions. Rendell, Emmanuel, Fenty... I could go on.   Not really. Foods with a low calorie/volume ratio will fill you up before you can really overeat to an extent that would make you obese.   That was part of the hypocrisy pointed out in the article: You can't make an argument for regulating sex choices unless you're also in favor of regulating food choices.     Half of the "organic" aisle at my local supermarket is chips and other junk food.    Good explanation, thanks. It makes sense they would not want to appear to be giving in to a "Red Scare" given the time period and the memories of the 50's.  To ask a a follow-up question, how in the world did Trotskyists gain positions of power in the local unions to begin with? Your typical American union would laugh them out of the hall, unless they felt like beating them to a pulp instead. Were/are things different in the UK?   I never understood why the leadership tolerated the Trotskyites in the Labor Party at all. In the US, where you can join a party automatically when you renew your driver's license, it's hard to keep figures like David Duke or Pat Buchanan out,  but I always thought party membership in the UK was more tightly controlled.               The mods will nuke it sooner or later... too bad because under the inane comments there's some good ones.   There are some nutty billionaires trying to do this. Peter Thiel wants to create a giant floating cruise ship/city-state/tax haven for Libertarians only that will sail around the world spreading the gospel of liberty or something.   I think the whole thing will degenerate into an argument about whether or not lifeboats are a collectivist monstrosity, and end with a colossal legal battle concerning homestead rights in the buffet line, but I wish him well.   I know this was a username joke, but I'm sure there are plenty of people who were with you until the "elimination of inferior humans" part.   It's hard for us to admit, but the continued fascination today with Nazis (and to a more limited extent Communists) points to a very deep human political need for exactly those things: Vision, will, strength, beauty...     Most US debt is held internally as well, though not by citizens. It is held by the Fed and the Social Security Administration. China only holds about 13% of our debt, and Japan a similar amount.   Oh my god, how does he even fit into his uniform? Those are the biggest non-bodybuilder arms I've ever seen!   I see a lazy, freeloading baby trying to steal cookies that someone else worked for. /s         Works for whole numbers too.   **TL;DR** summary:  Many people don't work because the cost of commuting, suitable clothing, child care, and the like comes to nearly everything they would earn, if not more. Raising their taxes would only increase the disincentives to work.            Certain people of an occult persuasion believe the Earth and the sun formed "one body" in relatively recent times (like 10,000 years ago, not 4.5 billion).  This "plasma formations" theory might be a variant on that belief.   Let's go with the subtle satire explanation... less embarassing...      I agree, to me there's no difference between the two belief systems, but the fact that the Mormons aren't in the majority but are trying to "fit in" these days make them downplay these doctrines, and plus, as I just demonstrated, it's real real easy to make them sound like a UFO cult. I'm surprised South Park hasn't done them yet.   It used to be better known, but the LDS today downplays these teachings in an attempt to be more "mainstream" (mainstream as defined by religious right - Republican, etc.)  They don't exactly want it widely known that [Mitt Romney is a Bishop a church that believes God is an alien from the Planet Kolob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob).   Interesting stuff. [I gave you a bestof](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/103utg/mormonmuse_explains_mormon_theology_in_detail/)      That starship captain looks like a pretty classic Nazi. Better than Tarkin in the Aryan department, that's for sure. Besides, even the ultimate baddie in Star Wars, Vader, was humanized at the end.                  Nixon would be considered a liberal Democrat today, I agree. But boy oh boy did he have a dark side.       I combined my responses to your two messages here. In case I got too wordy for you I put the **TL;DR** main points of my argument in bold.  .   Holding a belief, just because famous people held, is in general poor form. It is no defense for that belief.  As a non-expert, I am unfortunately reliant on the opinions of these "famous people." Alas, these vary greatly, from transcendentalists like Gdel to straight materialists like Krauss, and every shade in between, so I attempt to find among their views those that seem the most consistent, and which accord most closely with my own phenomenological experience. I admit the possibility that I have failed in this task.  .   don't know any experts (I.e people who study consciousness and have a grasp of quantum mechanics... Note these are very few) that hold your view.   Who are some people you know whom you feel have a grasp of both cogsci and QM? I would be interested to read the opinions of these dual experts. Penrose I think comes closest, but you're obviously not a fan.  You are quite right that the debate has mainly been a few adventuresome QM experts saying their field has implications for consciousness, and neuroscientists disagreeing with them (although *philosophers of mind* are sometimes a different story, and are occasionally more receptive to the views of these physicists.)  .   A notorious example is David Bohm and his holonomic brain theory.   I am not a fan of Bohm. I don't even think his ideas are even coherent, let alone correct.  That the lenses in our eyes somehow keep us from seeing the holographic universe? It sounds like the ravings of a schizophrenic...  .   In general, there is nothing wrong with being a dualist  Ugh, I disagree. Trying to formulate one fundamental ontology for existence is difficult enough, let alone two. I am not a dualist, at least not in the "two original substances, matter and mind" sense of the word. I don't think you can be a dualist without ultimately falling into the absurdities of Descartes and/or Leibniz. I do think though that a non-formal element is entailed by the existence of the physical world (see below.)  .  How would quantum computing be anti-formalist? How do you think we study quantum computing? It is an extremely formal field.   **I will address QM in general here, as I get to its computing aspect below: QM is extremely formal, perhaps the most formal theory ever devised, but precisely in being so it "heightens the contradictions" of formalism. It resorts to such things as negative probabilities, objects that are both waves and particles at the same time, and, as I learned from your article link, probabilities that don't add up to 1 and that violate the sure-thing principle.**  **This sort of thing, to me, points to the fact that we are trying to study a non-formal aspect of reality with formalist tools, and, however successful the mathematics has been, at root logical incoherence is the result. I will perhaps further irritate you and name-drop the ultimate famous person here and say the Einstein had similar criticisms of the ultimate logical validity of QM.**  .   To me it sounds that by non-formalist, you mean non-physicalist.  Not exactly. My philosophy is closer to people like Tarski and Gdel who wrote on the limitations of formal logic. I would consider them to be anti-Formalists under my definition, though usually this term is not applied to them by historians of philosophy (they reserve it for woolier figures like William James...).   [And before you say Gdel wasn't a physicalist, I would disagree. To me Platonists are the ultimate physicalists. I won't elaborate more here as we'd go down a very long side-path.]  .   I would also distinguish between a *non*-formalist (someone like Meillassoux who thinks the Universe is a "hyper-chaos" that only *appears* sensible) and an anti-formalist (someone like me who thinks that there is more to the Universe than formal processes.)   .   For me the physical universe is very real, it is not just the dream of a butterfly or some such nonsense, but, by the very virtue of its being real, it contains a non-formal, though not necessarily non-physical, element, that is, something that can *never be explained* by a formal system. Note that this does not mean the element is mystical or supernatural in any way.   .   **To me it is no coincidence that QM and consciousness both seem to produce a "decoherence" of logical discourse - it is very difficult to talk about either of them using ordinary logical principles, a sign that they both belong to the non-formal aspect of reality. Do they share any connection beyond a connection of type? My intuition is that they do - and that the vast computing power promised by Quantum Computing and the vast apprehensive ability possessed by consciousness are signs of this link.**  .   Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.  Where do I get these weird ideas? Well, I see an unnamed but important line of thought in philosophy passing from Hegel to the post-Incompleteness generation of mathematicians, and then through figures like Heidegger and Lacan to modern thinkers such as Badiou (though I don't share the latter's politics.) I've come to think of this as the "anti-Formalist" line of thought, though that's my own term for it, nothing official. If you are not familiar with any of these writers, they hold that each entity contains a gap, a "not-all" within itself that not only allows for but *insists* that something radically "Other" must emerge from within.  .   So yes, I've outed myself as one of those damn Continental-philosophy fanboys, the kind of dupe who you probably think would have been fooled by the Sokal Hoax had I not been in grade school at the time. Do with me as you will!  .   Their ideas on consciousness were very naive and motivated not by a psychological problem but by the physics/philosophy problem of measurement in quantum mechanics.   I am interested on your views on the measurement problem. Do you think it can be resolved (or dissolved as Wittgenstein would say) without a reference to consciousness, either on a human or a cosmic level? If so, how? [You might be interested in this article](http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/print/138). It is close to my views though I wouldn't use the term "God" as it's too historically freighted.  .   The reason I would like to see this is because I'd've never seen an intelligent defense of quantum mysticism and I would really like to see one.   You won't get one from me - I'm not a quantum mystic, at least if by that you mean the belief that, say, entanglement means people can have psychic powers, or things of that sort. I am open-minded towards the paranormal, though not a believer. I like to say I don't want to be so open-minded that my brain falls out!      Interesting links, I will check them out. I'd heard of the first idea but not the second.   I am not an expert in these fields, but my opinion is not just "empty statements," as it is informed by and resembles that of some people who are experts. If I'm going to expend the time conversing with you I do expect some civility on your part.   I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.  You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true.   You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.  Fundamentally I am an "anti-Formalist" when it comes to consciousness, meaning I think that somehow (whether through QM or Platonic Forms, or some other mechanism), consciousness exists at least in part outside the formal, "billiard-ball" world of classical physics.  Oh, and the fact is I have read what you've read, we just disagree. I don't claim to be an expert, but when the experts disagree, the layman is allowed his opinion.     Well, to Penrose you would also have to add the even more formidable name of Schrdinger, who theorized on this issue in his "What is Life?"   As for Gdel I guess this will get me in an even deeper hole with you, but I do indeed think there is a link between the Incompleteness Theorems (there's more than one) and consciousness as well. Of course, Gdel himself believed this, but then, Gdel wasn't a brain scientist and he went crazy, etc. etc. (You can tell I've had this argument before.)  Anyway. I'm not saying microtubules are what links QM effects to consciousness, it could be some other mechanism. Recently some solid links between QM and biology have been found, for example [in the navigational systems of birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3725). It's not consciousness - yet - but it does show a link between the biological and quantum worlds.   I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive.   I have not read much technical literature and I realize popular articles on the subject can be sensationalistic or misinformed. However I still think there **might** be a connection between quantum states and consciousness, and there are some well-informed experts (Penrose, for example) who believe so as well. Do I have definite proof? No - that's why I used the word "believe" instead of "know" or "can prove."     Haha, very civil reply. Anyway, ignoring your nastiness, my hypothesis is that the ability to process information and yet be in observation of the same process simultaneously, which seems to be an ability of human consciousness, might also be a characteristic of these sorts of computers. If quantum computers are possible, being able to calculate in super-position states might grant them this ability.   Are any of those episodes online? I stopped listening to C2C once it got so political but I'd love to hear Dr. Taff interviewed.      Flying ants do exist - maybe you caught one.   How complicated would it be to switch to ECC from RSA?   It wasn't him, it was one of his followers. According to legend, the follower was killed for his discovery since it went against the Pythagorean belief in the sanctity of whole-number ratios.  According to another, more cool legend, the follower was killed not because he made the discovery but because he *talked about it publicly*, revealing esoteric knowledge that was only meant for the Pythagorean elite.  In addition to being mathematicians, the Pythagoreans were also a religious cult. Imagine a cross between the MIT Pure Math faculty and Scientology.   See [here](http://www.mpg.de/5925490/meta-consciousness-brain)   Chalmers sees consciousness as a Cartesian theater when he talks about consciousness is "presented" to him, as if he were a member of the audience watching his senses take the stage. He questions why processes are "accompanied" by experience, as if experience is an extra effort of theatricality for his enjoyment.  But isn't this exactly the case? That the conscious perception of a color is somehow different from say, how a computer would analyze visual wavelengths seems undeniable. Do you believe that a computer sees the color blue just as you do, that it has the same experience? I don't.  This element of theatricality, of presentation, is *precisely* the hard problem. Even if it is an illusion, it seems that this illusion could not arise except from a *prior ground of theatricality* that already exists!  Where I might differ from the Clarmers position is I think computers, probably quantum computers, will someday begin to have these presentations. That will be quite the interesting day.      Bad statistics... the US is coming off a much higher base of education than most of these other countries. Percentage growth in this sort of context *must* level out over time (you can't have more than 100% of people getting higher degrees than their parents).   a favorable deal for the union means higher taxes or less gov't services  Not necessarily less services if a good deal attracts better employees or helps to reduce turnover.   That's a shame your local is so messed up.   AFT or NEA?   Some students live in chaotic homes, have to take care of their siblings, etc. Yet both are graded on the same rubric?  Eh, not really. Almost all teachers, myself included, will give a lot of breaks and extra help to kids we know are having trouble at home.    Haha well I am the young guard - believe me most locals are looking for people. I agree about the PR.   A student can choose how much to study and how much to pay attention in class. A teacher cannot choose his or her students or force them to study. That is the difference.   From my experience most union locals are desperate for people to fill executive positions and often have to beg people to run. Yes it's more work but you can't complain if you don't get involved.   That's funny, the gist of the article was exactly the opposite, that MWI is the only thing that can save physicalism. What is your thinking on that argument?      Israel is held to a different standard because it came into existence as a *modern* Western-supported state, and, in part because of the pressure of modern Western morality, it didn't kick out or kill *all* of the people in the conquered land, though it did plenty of killing, don't kid yourself.  Had Israel been established and expanded in the 19th Century, like the US, and killed, ghettoized or expelled most of the Arabs, as the US did with the Indians, there would be no big debate.  That being said, the rich Arab oil states could easily pay to resettle the Palestinians - say in the Hejaz - but have chosen not to as that would be "giving in" to Israel . The Palestinians I have a lot of sympathy for. Both Israel and their Arab adversaries, though, not so much.

[Next time someone asks if you're a god, you say YES!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4I4OCgVAv8)   Lee repeats the story himself, but I don't know of any independent confirmation. It sounds like the sort of grandiose story he would tell about himself.   They didn't think much of Japan militarily. It was a huge shock when Singapore fell. The British Navy removed a lot of fleet elements from Asia to reinforce the homeland. This might have been necessary, but they also didn't think it would be that big of a deal and that the forces they left behind would easily defeat the Japanese.  When the British blew the bridges into Singapore, legend has it that a man asked the future leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, what the sound was.  Lee replied: "That's the sound of the end of the British Empire."   I doubt he was. Usually however there was a picture of his invention with a black slave working with it. This is how this misconception got started. I believed it in elementary school too.   Actually it does, it's more malleable and platable than most other metals. And many people prefer how it looks to silver and platinum. That doesn't necessarily translation to monetary value though, platinum has often traded higher than gold per ounce.   Talk about stuff people were taught wrong in school... the gold standard had not been honored domestically since FDR. Only foreign drawers were allowed to exchange Federal Reserve notes for gold into the 70's, and this was only because basically no one did.   When the French and Swiss governments decided to express displeasure with Nixon's inflationary policy and redeem all their notes for gold, Nixon and the Fed said "screw you" and closed the international gold window as well.   It had nothing to do with economic growth and insufficient amounts of gold being dug up.  See here: [Nixon Shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock)   Britain was already fighting in both wars, I don't think this holds up.   No, in most states further education is a state requirement, often at your own expense. Imagine continuing to pay for college classes or pile on more debt while making $30K per year.  You do get a pay raise for attaining higher degrees, but it's often not enough to make up for the additional cost of classes, and because you're trying to cram in summer and weekend courses, it can often take 10+ years to get a further degree.    In my opinion the content knowledge is usually easier to acquire than the teaching skills. It's ironic that it's very hard to teach people how to teach, even though in aggregate it's just a bunch of simple skills and habits.   Are you... the *Amish Avenger* ??      1.)

I have always been a fan of the "Yoda was in on it" theory - he knew what was going to happen, but let it take place because the Jedi Order and the Republic had become too corrupt and complacent.  I have been banned from speaking of this theory within my Yoda-loving household... but I still have my doubts about our little green friend.    The party should bring back the old slogan from the FDR days: "If you want to live like a Republican, vote for the Democrat."      some of his contemporaries held the materialist position we now associate with modernism, and the Buddha explicitly rejected it.   I still think it's fascinating that there were materialist-atheists in 400 BC. One would be inclined to assume that these were just "strawman" positions people pinned on their opponents, but no, we actually have texts from these groups! Similar ideas show up in Greece not too long afterwards.      Hm, yeah that is strange. Were there any substances imbibed at this festival?      That's not too impressive. A lot of HR departments use the same set of tests on prospective hires. I took the same stupid computer psychology test at least five times.   The new age, pseudo spiritualism that is often saddled on it.  Do you distinguish that from traditional belief in the Siddhis, or is it all superstitious accretion to you?  I'm ambivalent - some mediators I respect have claimed supernatural experiences, but I can't bring myself to totally buy it. It's easy to enter into a dreamlike state when you're in meditation. I've yet to see anyone levitate, in other words, and that Discovery Channel "documentary" doesn't count.   Sort of... but to a materialist suicide is annihilation, whereas the idea that Nirvana is annihilation is classified as a wrong view.  Suicide = Nirvana in the absence of rebirth is a false implication.   The final goal of Buddhism is Nirvana which only makes sense as opposed to Samsara which is the circle of perpetual birth-and-death.   What about the view that Nirvana and Samsara are just different attitudes or reactions towards the same reality? Hippie talk and not real Buddhism, some say. I'm not so sure.  In fact, Nirvana is absolute bliss, and is not like nothingness or blackness at all.   But bliss is still a sensation, and Nirvana is supposed to be super-sensate. Not trying to split hairs but I think it's an important distinction.     I'm not sure about the first picture, but the second looks pretty accurate.     	186

The entire reason the right came back in 2010 is because the left began to move, well, left. It was an almost Newtonian response to the agenda of the President.  I think the evidence says the opposite.   Democratic turnout is known to be low during non-Presidential elections, so there's that, but it doesn't account for the particularly low D turnout that year.  *That lack of enthusiasm* is the real story.  It's not that people turned against the Ds.  No one was for them anymore.  And in fact, in the South, it was the Blue Dogs who tacked right trying to placate conservatives who were most thoroughly wiped out.  That at least is something we have to be thankful for.  Good riddance to them and their malign impact on the party.  The fallacy of median voter theory is that there is a middle to appeal to.  There is not.  [The public is more divided than ever.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/ )  What does exist is a difference in enthusiasm.  Republicans with their constant irrational appeals to fear have a reliable strategy for turning out a dwindling base.  Democrats squander their natural advantage, constantly alienate theirs, and take their failures as reasons to move further right, even as public policy choices lie far to the left on issue after issue.  It's hard to find a one stop shop for data on this, but try googling around yourself.  Look for polls where Americans are assessed for their views on actual public policy issues, not on party preference.   Here are some from the first page when googling "poll american public policy preferences":  * [This summary](http://theprogressivecynic.com/2014/05/02/is-the-usa-center-right-an-issue-by-issue-breakdown/ ) shows that on issue after issue, Americans are progressive.     * They want spending for entitlements and the poor over deficit reduction, left and right both want the wealth distribution to be more equal than it actually is, even as they both underestimate how unequal it actually is.    * They support increasing taxes on the wealthy by large margins.    * 71% support increasing the minimum wage.  * vast majorities approve of labor unions  * a plurality think we spend too much on defense  * a decisive majority is positioned to the left on voting rights  * a vast majority wants to legalize marijuana    The list goes on and on and.  You should read it.  * University of Oregon and Yale studies show Americans are far to the left of law makers on climate change: http://cires.colorado.edu/websites/science-policy/students/envs_4800/leiserowitz_2006.pdf http://www.climatechangecommunication.org/images/files/Climate_Change_in_the_American_Mind.pdf  * Macarthur Foundation: On incarceration people are far left of law makers http://www.macfound.org/media/article_pdfs/CCLPPOLLINGFINAL.PDF   Milquetoast Democrats like Mondale and Dukakis haven't been able to articulate the issues that public cares about because they've sliced and diced it into tiny issues.  Republicans have a simple marketing message based in fear, religion and nationalism.  Democrats could, but don't articulate what the public actually cares about: economic fairness.  They've followed clueless consultants like Bob Shrum right off the cliff.    The fact is, that the Democrats have been on the defensive since they abandoned their post as the champions of economic justice.  Until they get back to their traditional stance, the contempt of the public for them and for government in general will only increase - and it will be well deserved.   How can I take this guy seriously?  Anyone who opens with a hot headed ad hominem attack is just begging for eyes to roll.   Just what we need  another economist with ZERO real work experience. The latest economist destined to destroy the world in the same manner as Karl Marx is Thomas Piketty and his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century that is destined to perhaps kill more people than Marx ever did.  He follows with a  sequence of untestable claims and red baiting that seems like an audition for Fox rather than a serious critique.  This bit made me laugh (emphasis in the original):    Piketty is only focused on the disparity between rich and poor. He too sees this as evil rather than trying to figure out **HOW** the economy functions. Piketty is off on a quest to control the world and place even more of our rights, privileges, and immunities into the hands of guess who - **government**!   Sorry, but this essay is written for true believers.  It's not going to convince anyone else.  For example:   Piketty claims the current level of rising wealth inequality imperils the very future of capitalism. He claims he has proved it with his book  *good one*!   That is an argument?  And then he offers this sequence of non-sequitors in support:   He totally fails to even comprehend **HOW** the global economy functions or that John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) in the end admitted his ideas were wrong and that he had hoped that Adam Smiths **Invisible Hand** would save Britain. Here is a picture of Keynes at Bretton Woods discussing how to save the world with government intervention speaking to Roosevelts **Henry Morgenthau, Jr.** (1891- 1967)  Secretary of the Treasury.   Sheesh.  Four paragraphs in and all I've got is apoplectic drivel.  I honestly can't waste my time going any further.  If you can summarize the argument and point to a chart, I'd be happy to look, but this writing is self-discrediting.  It's like the author is on a crusade to portray himself as a biased ideologue.    Serious criticisms, please.    So does including that data invalidate his findings? And how so?  I'd like to see the analysis.    I'd love to hear some substantial criticisms, but  glib responses only serve to make me skeptical of the anti-Piketty crowd.   USA #1,  folks!   Link?   The Consulting by RPM review claims "the most obvious problem with Piketty's book is that he wants to make workers poorer, just so long as it will hurt rich capitalists even more."  Seriously?  The author's opinion about what the Piketty's motives are is "most obvious problem"?  The author have spent enough time sneering about progressives and invoking Marx to let us know they've got their ideological fur up.  That they lead with this as their top criticism certainly hints that there's no there there.    Specifically, both Reisman and Consulting by RPM seem to completely ignore Piketty's main finding: that Capitalism in its normal state leads to a situation where inherited wealth accumulates more quickly than earned wealth, and that after a brief anomolous period, we are now going back to that.  This is the same situation that existed in fin de siecle France - classes became fixed, and merit was not rewarded.  When this is true, the road to wealth starts by being born into it, and it becomes difficult to impossible to change your economic standing through work.  To point to the cool toys that capitalism produces while overlooking the loss of class mobility as the ConsultingByRPM piece does, is not to different from  saying "let them eat cake".    Finally, the "bombshell blunder" that they report from Chris Giles of FT has been thorough and humiliatingly debunked.  And finally, invoking the far out of mainstream and explicitly anti-empirical Austrians really lays the cards out for all to see. These guys are another bunch of unhappy Libertarian ideologues.  There have got to be better critiques than these.   I tried reading the Reisman blog. I couldn't understand whether his specific technical criticisms have merit or not.  He's obviously deeply opposed to Piketty ideologically - he complains about Piketty referencing Marx too much and von Mises, Rothbard et al. too little, for example. He is so hot headed, it's sometimes hard to tell whether there is a valid technical criticism or whether he's just objecting to the conclusions:   The depths of Pikettys ignorance are such that he believes that capital accumulation not only does not raise real wages but reduces them, by allegedly increasing the share of national income that goes to profits and correspondingly reducing the share that goes to wages, while the overall total of what is produced remains unchanged or increases only very modestly, and then not by virtue of any contribution to production made by capital  He does provide a reference for this, but it's to a file on his local machine, not on the web, so it's impossible to validate. Honestly, it's so hard to get through paragraphs that are filled with this kind of name calling and so poorly supported.  If you're going to call someone an idiot, you better demonstrate this without any doubt, or you risk eroding your own credibility.  Why doesn't he show where Piketty makes the claims he says he does, so we can make up our own mind about it?  Why doesn't he show the mathematics and the specific results that demonstrate Piketty is wrong? Reisman just comes off as an unhappy ideologue.     Ok, that's a start.  Median voter theory is conventional wisdom.  And the Democrats have accepted it without question -- and without test -- for 40 years.  As a result, they've fielded increasingly right wing candidates.  While they've  negotiated themselves to the right of Nixon, Republicans have steadily pushed the Overton window to the right.    At the same time, these theories *completely* discount actual polling preferences of the American public for the middle.  Healthcare is a good example where poll after poll has shown overwhelming support for both  the public option and outright socialism in the form of universal care.   Yet, we effectively have two right wing parties.  Is it a surprise that American's opinion of Congress is the lowest it has ever been?  How do the politics of one of America's most popular presidents ever (FDR) fit in today?  Had Republicans followed the median voter theory scolds, we would have a much more liberal country today.  Instead, Democats did, and rightist policies have won.   This is what a leader looks like, folks.  We need her or someone like her in 2016, not that carpetbagger from Arkansas.   It equally emphasizes that people are pissed off, and of those pissed off people, some are crazy.

A huge problem with the Bond franchise is keeping it fresh.  Every iteration, you have to avoid it being a cookie cutter operation.  You're basically on the hook for delivering a similar set of tropes:  Go to HQ, chat with Money Penny, Meet with Q, Go on Mission, Meet Girl, Banter with Villain, Go to Villains Layer, Kill villain, Pan out while kissing the girl.    People howled when blond, blue-eyed Craig was scheduled to take the lead.  The style of Casino Royale totally broke our expectations and shocked us a bit.  The style of Bond, brutal, blue eyed and *coarse* --- not a gentleman at all --- was unexpected, and woke us up.  It was a completely different kind of charisma that carried the show.  And that's why it worked, why it was the one of the best Bonds in decades.  A black bond, especially with an actor with Elba's presence,  opens up a whole new set of possibilities.  There's a whole new style and totally new kinds of interactions that can be explored.  What does it mean when the world's top secret agent is a black guy?  Totally different dynamic.  I'm dying to see what they do with this.      Hilary   the Left need to make these conciliatory gestures  To paraphrase one of our Presidents, there's smart conciliation and stupid conciliation.

She's signaling as clear as any Democrat ever can that she's going to slavishly follow Wall Street's commands.               Gotta love the "But, all our leaders are war criminals"  argument.

That is a dense paper.  How the WaPo author derived that claim is not obvious to me.      The full text I summarized:   In perhaps the starkest illustration, economists from Harvard University and the University of Chicago wrote in a recent paper that every dollar a worker earns in a research field spills over to make the economy $5 better off. Every dollar a similar worker earns in finance comes with a drain, making the economy 60 cents worse off.   **Submission Statement**  Covers recent studies from economists at Harvard, U Chicago et al. on the damage over financialization is doing to our economy.  Instead of being a generalized lament, the article describes some specific measures that demonstrate the point.  For instance, unlike other fields, where technological advancement has led to a decrease in fees, in finance, the opposite has happened.        Finally a proper use of all caps.  Strunk   fucking White right here.   There you go again.   Name calling, the favorite "argument" of the right.    "Far left"... as considered from the perspective of people who are far right.   T'would be satisfying to see him outed and scrutinized.   I think you misread pemulis's comment.     Goddamit, will this lady please run for President already!     Every time I see "SF" I think, oh ... my fair city... ?      I think describing her as a visionary on inequality only captures a narrow part of why she's important.  Ultimately, Warren is articulating the short-comings of Capitalism itself, and that, arguably is the most critical issue of all today.  In contrast, Gore's focus on climate change is merely narrow and technical, for instance.  Warren's broad critique of a system which is incorrectly calculating value, unfairly distributing resources and harm is an umbrella that includes almost all the other issues that are confronting us.   Climate change, for example, is a problem of markets not taking into account externalities.  Even police brutality becomes part of the conversation because it is one side of the story of unequal application of justice --- Warren has pointed out how the budget of the rich peoples' police (i.e., Wall Street regulators) was cut, and has talked about how DoJ is viciously prosecuting drug crimes.  It's a short step to also talk about police brutality.  Campaign finance reform is another - rich people are bending the system to their will.    Warren is tying all the big issues together through by articulating the critical flaw of neoliberalism, which has been the policy of Ds and Rs for the past 40 years.  A system which rewards ownership (by respecting only property rights) does the expected--- it doles out rewards to property owners and pain to the poor.  And that touches climate, justice, financial regulation, foreign policy (though I'm disturbed by her statements on Israel), education, health care and social security --- in short, the whole body of politics.  Democrats have been a slew of mumblers (and I include Gore, whom I have a lot of respect for) --- who've failed to articulate an over arching theme.  Yet, it's been so simple.  They've just been scared to go there because they all bought into the Washington wisdom that you have to unquestioningly worship markets to be "serious".  I think this is why, whether they know it or not, so many people now feel that Warren must be President.       That being said, is it justifiable to shut down the entire federal government in protest? Particularly if it comes from the Democratic party, I think that only further legitimates the notion that the government can and should be shuttered in a symbolic protest against a provision that the majority of Congress agrees with.  I resonated with Taibbi's fit of pique, and didn't think too deeply about this.  But your analysis is insightful and hard to disagree with.    The problem, clearly, is Obama and all Blue Dogs.  Perhaps the right action is for progressives to break ranks and start speaking in a clear independent voice, as Warren has.      I guess the question is: can Warren open that window back up?  I haven't seen a politician who is so *needed* in over a decade.  Gore was a terrible politician, but a visionary on key issues - internet and climate change.  Warren is a visionary on inequality and is appearing to be a formidable personality.  So, yes, I think there's hope.   But what's the point of that?  That's another open ended statement like the first that just throws vague cold water on Warren without adding anything actionable to the conversation.  *Of course* we should focus on actions, so what?  We should also brush our teeth.  And to respond to the specific point, speeches are how politics gets done, and particularly, how populist politics gets done.  Without speeches, all you have are a bunch of insiders doing back-room deals.  Excitement around populist positioning is what gives a politician power to push that position inside the back rooms --- for example in the DPCC, to which she was recently appointed.  Let's keep the discussion specific.  "Warren needs to do ___, ___ and ___.  She said ___, ___ and ___, but didn't do anything.  This is more of the same."  Would be a better starting point.   I.e., "Don't trust politicians!"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide_(language):   A bromide is a phrase or platitude that, having been employed excessively, suggests insincerity or a lack of originality in the speaker     I have friends who were fans of his.  One actually went to meet him at his office when he was in Congress a couple of years after his speech at Kerry's convention.  Obama wasn't really a household name at that time, obviously.    I remember him being excited about some Senator who, he averred, was "onto something good".  The Obama bumper stickers soon followed.  I distinctly recall the sense of disappointment when I found out it was the "One America" speech guy.  That prattle was the toast of Washington, a tone deaf feel good paean that was blind to the radicalism emerging on the right, and which, idiotically, urged compromise.  In this way, his critics are right, he is like Chamberlain.  Obama has done real damage - not only are the inattentive (like ban-chali) now reflexively cynical and disillusioned, he shifted partisan Democratic politics rightward at a time when the country was ready for an FDR, and the base craved one.  In this way, he is not unlike the idol he repeatedly praised, Ronald Reagan.  While the Gipper nudged the American middle to the right, Obama led blind Democratic partisans off the cliff as they defended him on bailouts for banks, torpedoing the public option behind closed doors, whistle blower prosecutions, domestic spying, and lack of accountability for torture and war crimes.  The numb-skulls who were too dense to see the signals back in 2012 and now worry about Warren are only proving that cognitive deficits can manifest recurrently in fresh forms.      It's not an analogy - it's a parody.  The original argument is a sloppy bromide, suitable for a dive bar drunk, but now popular amongst jilted Obama supporters -  but they only have themselves to blame.  They were obtuse last time around, and they think wisdom is being obtuse in the opposite direction this time around.    Anyone who thought Obama was a progressive in the primaries was seriously not paying attention.    1. He voted for telecom immunity  2. He threw progressive Joe Lamont under the bus and supported Joe Lieberman  3. He explicitly said supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive  4. He repeatedly praised Reagan  5. His speech  at Kerry's DNC ("One America") was milquetoast idiocy that called for compromise and triangulation.  Honestly, progressives who got  excited about this nonsense deserved to be disappointed.   Let's try paying attention this time.  Obama != Warren.     Hitler also made speeches that got a lot of hype.  Therefore Warren is like Hitler too.   Meh - people laughed that at the idea  a black guy named Hussein could ever in a million years win the Presidency, especially after 9/11.   The lesson of Obama is look carefully at candidates' actions, not just their fine words.  I thought it was obvious in the primaries - Obama embraced Joe Lieberman and threw a great progressive, Joe Lamont, under the bus, then went on to support telecom immunity.  I didn't understand why no one wanted to talk about that back then.    We need to take a very close look at candidates, and demand fighters.  Obama, to me, seemed terrible tone-deaf and the absolutely wrong choice even as early as his speech at Kerry's nominating convention.  There is not a Republican America and a Democratic America, there is one America, he told us.  This was delusional feel good nonsense for the progressives that bought in.  For those who were awake, it already hinted at his politics of triangulation, which is to say, someone whose strategy is to placate his supporters while rewarding them with right wing policies.  And now we have Mrs. "Hard Choices".  As a wise man once said, Fool me once... can't... get fooled again!    I call bullshit.  Not only does that seem false - most liberals are pissed about Obama's anti-constitutional militarism and triangulating neoliberalism --  it is demonstrably false.  Just do a search:  What gets upvoted when you search for ["Obama drones"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+drone+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all) or ["Obama torture"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+torture+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all ) ?  If we assume a liberal bias of the politics subreddit and that upvotes confer agreement (both generally accepted ideas) we find that liberals are promoting news articles which are sharply critical of the President on both of these issues.    For example here are the Obama drone links sorted by "relevance" and "all time". 14 of the top 15 are unambiguously negative in their commentary on the President.   Only one (#8) is ambiguous.  None are positive.  A quick check of the posters submission streams will confirm that they are liberals.  1. House Democrats demand Obama release full legal basis for drone strikes  2.

Why do liberals not attack Obama for perpetuating Bush's foreign policy?   12. Nobel Prize winner Malala told Obama U.S. drone attacks fuel terrorism.  13. Right wingers gloating about Obama on Fox News: "He's a born-again neocon. We've got the drones, we've got military tribunals, we've got Gitmo, we're bombing Libya. People who voted for Obama got 4 more years of Bush." -   14. What happened to the anti-war left?   15. Noam Chomsky: Obama Is Running Biggest Terrorist Operation That Exists... People have a reaction when they lose a loved one to an American drone strike. They dont say, Fine, I dont care if my cousin was murdered. They become what we call terrorists.  **EDIT** More support that this is liberal opinion: the sources are all center left to left. TruthDig, RawStory, The Atlantic, Vice, Al Jazeera, Daily Beast, NYTimes.   Typical right winger spouting false equivalency bullshit.  See my response in this thread.   Conservatives are, in essence, profoundly anti-American.           But Democrats, generally speaking, aren't arguing *for* torture.  They are (some of them) only deluded in thinking their leader is anti-torture.  Separate issue.   Even worse is people saying that it shouldn't matter because all Presidents are then guilty.  Normally, one should take this as an indictment of government policy, but some people think it's an excuse.  It's an indication of how corrupt the public's ethics and discourse have become since 9/11.   No question, but it's worth reviewing Reagan's statements on the matter to see how far we've drifted in our public debate.         **Submission Statement**  Torture apologists on the right have tried to obscure the commitments of United States to prosecute torture.  Who better than their most holy saint to explain it to them?  This is Reagan's message to the Senate advocating ratification of the "Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment", which he notes was agreed to *unanimously* by the international community.  The Convention was ratified by the US Senate in 1994.             The US is a signatory to the Geneva conventions which are a direct result of the Nuremberg trials.    You can execute nearly every US president if you apply the Nuremberg laws.  Speaks volumes about US policy, doesn't it.      Please read the words of the US prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Justice Robert Jackson of SCOTUS:  ["And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment."](http://www.roberthjackson.org/the-man/speeches-articles/speeches/speeches-by-robert-h-jackson/opening-statement-before-the-international-military-tribunal/ )   **Submission Statement**  The opening statement of Justice Robert Jackson of the SCOTUS at the Nuremberg Trials.  Of great relevance is the emphasis he puts on the equal application of the laws not only on Germany and Japan, but also on the victors, the United States, Britain and other axis powers.        **Submission Statement**  An important article that's worth a read for those who've been following the torture debate.  While the idea of accountability for these crimes has long seemed like a naive hope held by human rights advocates and parts of the left, this article explains that serious consideration is being given to the concept in international legal circles.      **Submission Statement**  An in-depth discussion of the historical, philosophical origins of the legal tradition of "Rule of Law" and what it means.  This is discussion from last year, but seems particularly relevant in light of the recent torture revelations and the stories about grand juries failing to bring indictments against police officers.             Thanks for the links.  That's helpful.   Undoubtedly they will ignore.  And agree that the Nobel Peace Prize winner is on the hook too.   So you're arguing that no one should attempt to hold anyone responsible for war crimes... because everyone is guilty?  How is that different from the argument that we shouldn't enforce any laws because police are corrupt?    But the UN has a fair amount to answer for as well especially with African peacekeeping operations where blue helmets have done their fair share of rape, pillaging, torture and failure to prevent genocide.   I haven't heard that before. Do you have links?  Are you arguing that (1) American war crimes should go unpunished, or are you saying that (2) there's no organization that has the moral authority to do it, or that (3) it is politically impractical, therefore will never happen?  I just flat out disagree with (1) - a completely immoral idea.  I don't really understand (2) --- one could have argued that the Dresden bombings and Hiroshima/Nagasaki obviated the allies' right to judge their enemies, for instance.  So I don't buy what you're advocating in (2).  However,  the prediction in (3) seems plausible.  Powerful elites are rarely held accountable, so that would be par for the course.    Pardoning them continues a terrible precedent, one that began with the pardon of Richard Nixon, and which has metastasized into a full-fledged dual-tier system of justice.  People at the bottom are viciously punished  for relatively minor offenses (including being killed as part of "normal" law enforcement activity), while elites, guilty of massive war and financial crimes, go free.      I don't think it absolves them --- we didn't use that reasoning for Germans and Japanese.        They are advocating going after both the officials who ordered and the people who acted on the orders.   I can't wait until someone responds to this kind of bullshit (on TV) with "We don't hate America. We hate *you*. Because you represent the opposite of all the true values of this country."      Appropriate handle.   It's quite a trick they're pulling -- appearing to condemn torture, while having worked consistently to prevent this from coming to light, and undermining any form of accountability.     Not a matter of disagreement.  Everyone must be equally accountable under the law.   Clever of W and Dick to opt out before their crime spree.    Said every fascist everywhere.   Good idea, let's compare ourselves to religious extremist terrorists.  Oh wait, that describes the Republican party, doesn't it?   Thanks.  I think my point is that the conversation begins with us as citizens - not to fall into the nationalistic realpolitik that the Sunday shows want us to buy into. Partisans (on both sides, though the right bears more guilt) want to shield their leaders from prosecution.  This is a kind of imperial and authoritarian politics which is directly at odds with the revolutionary principles which have guided us up until recent decades.      I simply mean to say that the U.S.'s contribution to the world through the UN is the only reason the UN has stayed quasi-relevant at best.   I don't disagree with that.  Our elected leaders may think that because "they" fund the UN, they should not be accountable.  My point is that the citizens of the US fund the UN, not our elected leaders.  The question is whether we, as citizens of the US, want a policy whereby our military and elected officials may not be held unaccountable for war crimes by anyone.  That is the politics of authoritarianism, and directly counters basic American ideals.   The enforcement of UN policies when referencing the actions of individual nations have been, since the existence of the UN, slanted with national interests from the accusing parties.   Isn't this exactly the point of the UN? A place where international disputes can be settled peacefully and with the agreement of the world community?   Not to mention the UN ignoring multiple instances of genocide and torture throughout the world giving less and less reason for the US or any member nation to submit themselves to ICC prosecution.  Could you give examples of this?  The first thing that comes to mind is ignoring what happened in Rwanda.  The current example that comes to mind is Palestine, and before that, Nicaragua's CIA-funded death squads, and East Timor.  Apart from Rwanda, in all of these cases the US was directly involved or shielding a client state from accountability.  In the Rwandan case, the US (under Clinton) and its allies put pressure on the UN to ignore the warning signals.  Regarding the ICC, Bush and Cheney opted out at the beginning of their term, and conveniently  before embarking on a spree of war crimes. So I'm not sure what you mean when you say     It's time for the U.S. to stop playing with the UN   That is already the case.  The US and its clients commit atrocities and are not held accountable.    I'm also confused by the idea that the US "should just acknowledge that world affairs are not black and white".  I can only infer that this means we should continue our policy of committing and supporting war crimes and justifying it by any means necessary in the UN - when that suits us.  Obviously, I strongly disagree.       "Don't police the policemen!", said all wingnuts everywhere.                One of my favorite films.   Mine too :).   I thought the Barry Lyndon voice over had a quite different character than what one finds in Nolan -- there's a very wry kind of observation going on constantly.  The voice itself is a character that more serves the purpose of highlighting the absurd humor of the proceedings than being a blunt expositor of plot and emotion as in Nolan.   The sound mix was deliberate - I think there's a video of him talking about it somewhere - or see [here](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/interstellar-sound-christopher-nolan ).  The effect he was going after was the experience of being in those situations -- where the human voice is merely part of the soundscape, another sound effect.  Hitchcock used this technique very deliberately  when critical pieces of exposition were being delivered.  The effect was to cause the audience to pay greater attention - to lean in to observe a critical moment.  In Interstellar, the frustration of not hearing voice helps us experience the chaos, the overwhelming power of the phenomena that the astronauts experience.   So we should support deception because "it's a blog".           For the record, I don't think history will be kind to him, and he'll deserve it.  His legacy is one of failing to hold criminals accountable --- the architects of torture and war crimes from the Bush era, as well as those on Wall Street.  His presidency will be compared unfavorably with FDR's.  He will be seen as having failed to seize the opportunities in a pivotal moment, choosing instead to extend the authoritarian and neoliberal policies of his predecessors.  He will be seen as ushering in an era of deep and unrelenting pessimism when he could have articulated a new direction forward.      Reiterating findings is perfectly fine - I'm objecting to the title.  It's a cheesy marketing  trick.  The author had some old article about group psych kicking around, added a couple of flimsy lines about Ferguson, and pasted this title on it.  This is both lazy and deceptive.   Why?  That's the message of Republicans at both the state and national levels.   You obviously didn't listen to Sen. Rockefeller's testimony at the hearings.   Seems like the title is link bait for a fairly general article on basic findings of group psychology.      Where is it?     I note with some exasperation, by the way, that he feels the need to throw some imprecations regarding the financial industry into an article about an issue that has nothing to do with it.   Let me defend him.  I think his insight is quite apropos.  There is a mounting frustration that the entire game is rigged.  People on the bottom get treated brutally for tiny infractions, while elites get away with crimes.  That certainly is part of the cultural zeitgeist.     In Berkeley and Oakland, a large number of the demonstrators are self-identified Occupy activists. It's a very short leap for these people to connect the same dots that Taibbi has. The original target of Occupy was Wall Street, which activists argued were essentially stealing from the public, but which the government was unwilling to police.  Now, these same people are out on the streets angry that powerless people are over-policed.  That is Taibbi's argument in a nutshell.  In the original protests, the police, were largely perceived as preserving public order, though there was a sense, because of their occassional overzealousness that they stood on the side of the "elite criminals of Wall Street" (i.e., from the perspective of the activists).  Yet, that role was only incidental.  As a result of the Ferguson/Garner protests, police themselves are now the issue.  So, in the eyes of the protesters, they have gone from being an instrument protecting elite criminals to themselves being criminals themselves in need of policing.    That is what Taibbi is talking about.  Those activists on the ground are starting to see the police themselves as illegitimate.  That is a sea change.  I think you'll agree that in this light, the stats you cite (from 2011, no less) aren't really in scope here.  This is a question of what will happen at the next demonstration, now that police themselves are seen as part of the problem.   And in fact, [recent polls support the argument that, amongst minorities at least, confidence has been lost](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-shows-deep-racial-divide-confidence-law-enforcement-n263041 ):    And while 72 percent of the public and 79 percent of whites say that they have "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of confidence that police in their community will not use excessive force on suspects, just 43 percent of black Americans say the same.  Conservatives are unlikely to see things this way because it doesn't fit their narrative, but their opinions don't matter in this.  A powerful anger is brewing which inequities and injustices will continue to feed, meaning that there will be more protests.  What will happen at the next one and the next one after that now that those protesters see the police as illegitimate?         "Reagan bankrupted the Soviet Union" is conservative propaganda that originates from the same crowd that sold us the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction:  http://open.salon.com/blog/paul_j_orourke/2009/01/17/losing_the_cold_warthe_true_story_of_why_the_ussr_fell  The real explanation is more boring, but has the benefit of being believable: the Soviets couldn't produce enough grain so relied on oil exports.  When the Saudi oil embargo ended,oil prices fell by 2/3rds and the USSR's export income collapsed.  Reagan didn't do that, and no one claims he's responsible for that either.   Gorbachev and other Soviet officials support this view: http://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm.     A far more persuasive reason for the Soviet economic decline is the rigid "command economy" imposed by Stalin in the early 1930s. It did not reward individual or collective effort; it absolved Soviet producers from the discipline of the market; and it gave power to officials who could not be held accountable by consumers. Consequently much of the investment that went into the civilian sector of the economy was wasted.    Gorbachev felt free to make a series of proposals for deep cuts in his country's nuclear arsenal because he was confident that the United States would not attack the Soviet Union. In conversation with his military advisers he rejected any plans that were premised on war with the West. Since he saw no threat of attack by the United States, Gorbachev was not intimidated by the military programs of the Reagan Administration. "These were unnecessary and wasteful expenditures that we were not going to match," he told us. If both superpowers were to avoid the growing risk of accidental war, they had to make deep cuts in their strategic forces. "This was an imperative of the nuclear age."  In fact, a Soviet ambassador insists that Reagan's policies unwittingly prolonged the Cold War: "Star Wars was exploited by hardliners to complicate Gorbachev's attempt to end the Cold War."  The hero in ending the Cold War, if there was one, was Gorbachev.             And unless the police suffer a massive crisis of legitimacy, such that on a very basic level we outright don't trust them to use force, this is pretty much the way it has to be.   Interesting that you mention that.  Did you see Taibbi's latest? http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-police-in-america-are-becoming-illegitimate-20141205   He was present when the Soviet Union ended, but he certainly didn't end it.  The Soviet Union collapsed because its economic system was intrinsically broken, or do Republicans disagree with that now?  Or do they just disagree with that only when they want to praise Reagan? http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/opinion/10mann.html?pagewanted=all   And then wave the confederate flag.

That's why Democrats today are the ones waving the Confederate flag, right?  Oh, wait...   It's a sick joke.  We spend billions on war to protect the  interests of billionaires, fake-praise the troops to make the task seem honorable, and discard the broken bodies and lives that come out of the process.  Why are Americans unable to  understand the game that's being played?                  This guy's name is Redditt.      Agree - that and supporting Liberman over Lamont.   Honestly, that seems somewhat myopic.  It's pretty clear to even the most casual observer that they are both on the conservative side of the spectrum on many issues.  Hillary, arguably even more hawkish than Bill.  If we ignore the past, we'll repeat our mistakes.  If we don't understand history, we're won't ask the right questions today.   Hillary is not just 20 years ago.   There are a lot of "liberals" who didn't pick up on Obama's conservative politics until it was far too late and still don't understand that the Clintons are part of the problem.      Understanding our mistakes is the first step if we want to avoid repeating them.  Electing conservadems is proven path to failure.      "Hard choices".  Neoliberals really ought to trademark that one.  Blair and his comrades have been making the "hard choices" to serve the interests of globalist billionaires, and the voters are making it difficult for do-gooders like him to transfer even more wealth to them using the levers of government.  If only the  common people were capable of understanding!  I don't have words for the kind of disgust that Blair and his ilk fill me with.         How does one get arrested for selling loosies?

A lot of disease were mocked as psychological disorders before the causes were discovered.   One of the messages that needs to get out is that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a thing that can be seen with molecular diagnostics like RAST.   It's a Kenyan plot!   Could not replicate.  I got exactly the same prices.  Even used a different browser so it didn't have cookies from my previous search.   Race is a big part of it: http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/feature/wp/2013/03/22/gun-deaths-shaped-by-race-in-america/    Look at the crime hotspots.. the areas where most of these murders occur. They aren't in places with super-high firearms ownership like Wyoming or New Hampshire. They're in Detroit, Chicago..  Did a quick search.  It looks like most of the violence per capita is in southern cities, but not, interestingly, in southern rural areas:  http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/20/news/la-ol-gun-homicide-states-20121220   Urban states with heavy gang populations such as California and New York aren't particularly high up on the list of per-capita gun killings, though of course in terms of absolute numbers, they look like murder capitals because of their big populations.    **Mid-size Southern states seem to be the places people are trigger-happiest** -- and where, of course, political opposition to gun control often runs strongest. Perhaps that's because **most of the bloodletting happens in Southern cities**, and it's in rural areas -- where gun violence is slight -- that gun rights are held most sacred.   A good graphic in this link: http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/   Two marketing agencies serving the same customer.   That's rational policy, though.     So many racists on reddit nowadays.   Why do you think gun violence is so much higher here in the United States?  By the way - I'm not reflexively anti-gun.  I'm from Canada, and we have more guns per person up there, but way fewer gun deaths per person.   The coffee lawsuit is an urban legend.  If you know the facts, it's pretty clear that McDonald's deserved the punitive damages:   Trial testimony showed that at 180 to 190 degrees, McDonald's coffee was much hotter than that served by other restaurants or by people in their homes. **The fast-food chain had received at least 700 complaints about hot coffee in the previous decade and had paid more than half a million dollars in settlements**, according to trial testimony cited by the Wall Street Journal.      Liebeck's injuries were hardly minor. She suffered third-degree burns on her thighs and groin area, was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo painful skin grafts. **Before filing a lawsuit, she wrote McDonald's requesting that it lower the temperature of its coffee and cover her uninsured medical bills and incidental costs of about $20,000. McDonald's offered $800**.     Later, as the case neared trial, a mediator recommended that McDonald's pay a settlement of $225,000. The company refused.      Jurors ultimately awarded Liebeck $160,000 in compensatory damages and about $2.7 million in punitive damages. "The facts were so overwhelmingly against the company," one of the jurors told the Journal. "Their callous disregard was very upsetting," another said.    http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rbrill/classes/BrillTortsF2007Eve/CoursePages/Course_docs/Supp_material/Frivolous_Suits.html   Just a note, neoliberals != liberals.  Neoliberals are people who espouse laissez-faire trade policy --- i.e., typically conservatives.   But not everyone does, and the result is a society with an enormous number of gun deaths.  I like to drive fast and I haven't been in any accidents.  It doesn't mean I should have the right to drive 150 through a school zone.   As a comparison, British citizens are 100 times less likely to be shot by a police officer than Americans: http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/08/armed-police   Surely, that's meant sardonically.   Insults not withstanding, you haven't shown anything to prove your case.      That is not what the article says.  You're reading the conclusion you'd like to see.   Police officers get that benefit of the doubt at every step along the way.   And   The lack of serious second-guessing is baked into the system.  And  Still, even that low-end estimate suggests that police shoot and kill someone in the United States more than once a day, on average. The overwhelming majority of those killings are deemed justified before the case ever reaches a jury.  And  Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEights Ben Casselman has argued, prosecutors rely on the police to do their jobs day in and day out, so they have few reasons to prosecute a cop aggressively and plenty of incentive to present a less persuasive case than they might otherwise, consciously or not.  And     Those cases certainly exist, even if they are likely more uncommon than is generally accepted.... In reality, its a wonder that any cop ever gets indicted for killing someone in the line of duty.  Say the opposite.      And even then, who knows what prosecutors tell a Grand Jury?  It's not enough.  There needs to be a special prosecutor appointed when cops are accused.              I think it's a Hangouts thing.  It is built to use as much CPU as possible.  It's offloading compute to the clients.      On Chrome or Safari, it practically pins all the CPUs.    Lots of people are seeing it: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hangouts+cpu+usage   I want good voice/video.  Hangouts is horrendous - it's impossible to receive calls, and absolutely chews through battery (1% per minute on my 2.5GHz Quadcore 2015 Macbook Pro).  Skype, well, Microsoft managed to make the UX even worse, didn't they?  And group chat/video is critical, especially for work, so I think this could be a really important entry into the field.  These guys know what they're doing.       Interesting, thanks for the clarification.   Agree that insisting on a specific outcome in a specific case when the facts aren't known isn't productive.  However, this is a teaching moment, and this case falls into a broad pattern.  It's very much worth pointing that out. I was pretty disgusted with the righteous, near-racism here on Reddit when the prosecutor gave his extremely unusual defense of the person he was supposedly prosecuting.  The real story is that cops keep getting off and prosecutors keep protecting them, so I think it's worth getting that story out.   It's not a coverup, it's business as usual.  If there's a conspiracy, it's one that happens all the time, and is to be expected when colleagues are in charge of policing each other.  In fact, [while grand juries *almost always* indict, they frequently don't when the defendant is a police officer.]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ )  Ironically, the right - which is constantly warning of Obama's jackbooted government thugs coming to take their guns away to Kenya - wants to change the conversation when the left points out systemic issues leading to an actual police state.    Prosecutors shouldn't be in charge of prosecuting their direct colleagues.  The glaring conflict of interest is producing the expected result, and the obvious moral hazard means cops act with impunity.  This isn't speculation - it's fact, and a situation which is being repeated constantly for obvious, logical reasons.  Body cameras are only a part of the solution. The next step is a law requiring  special prosecutors to deal with police criminality.       But I thought a grand jury needs to indict him, and that you can't call two grand juries for the same case (or does double jeopardy not apply here?)  	189

 I bounced around troops when I was in scouts, so for my eagle project, since I didn't know a lot of people, I tried to do something small, that didn't require a lot of people, and that could still have a big impact.  I would shy away from doing trail restorations, or building any large structures as those require a lot of people.  I looked at those options first, but after asking my new troop what other Eagle Scouts had done in the past, I was able to replicate an old project and knocked the whole thing out in a weekend with a handful of volunteers.  By asking the adult leaders and new Eagle Scouts for ideas on your project, you show that you're really trying to make an impact on the community you're moving to.  By showing an interest in them, they're more likely to help you both with ideas and by encouraging their friends and sons, in the case of the adults, to lend you a hand.  It also doesn't hurt that helping with an Eagle project counts as volunteer work for advancement, so you don't need to feel like any of these guys would be going way out of their way to help you.  	1

The Lone Ranger ponders for a minute then says, "Astronomically speaking, it tells me there are millions of galaxies. Time wise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three in the morning.

Logical candidates to replace UAB in C-USA:   Liberty, James Madison, Georgia State, South Alabama, Texas State, Arkansas State, ULL   Yeah, maybe more along the lines of FCS or lower division.  But take Eastern Michigan.  They have average attendance around 4,000 for the past 3 years.  The past 4 years, Ball State has averaged around 9-15k.  Akron 9-17k.  The NCAA REALLLY needs to bring back the 15k butts-in-seats average over 2 years.  Four teams didn't cross 15k in 2013.  Another SIX averaged 15-16k.   It just feels like a bubble that is about to pop.   There are plenty of FBS teams that should disband football. But UAB isn't one of them.        You know Barack Obama?!

Thats pretty awesome!  It would be cool if there was a site that had all the FBS stadiums broken down like that (when possible).  But that would be A LOT of work, for such little payoff.    It would be neat if someone color coded each section on when it was built.  So we could see which area was the original - more recent renovation.             I just used this to see when the comet landing will occur, at 14:00 GMT. Typing in "14:00 GMT" converts to local time   I don't understand why there aren't any commercials.  Especially if it can help spread some of the cost around.       What is *"neat"* about this is to look at the total votes, compared to the congressional districts won.  In **2010**: Democrats had 45.2% of the vote, Republican had 54.1%.  Democrats won 7 seats, Republicans won 6.  **2010 Redistricting**  In **2012**: Democrats had 50.60% of the vote, Republican had 48.75%.  Democrats won 4 seats, Republicans won 9.  In **2014**: Democrats won 3 seats, Republicans won 10. I don't have the percentages for this race yet.  So before the redistricting, both parties reflected the overall direction of the state.

 I think that might be less than what my high school drew, and I'm from Indiana. I know we got more than that for basketball pretty regularly for weekend games.   I'm still lobbying to let Muffet McGraw, our women's basketball coach, coach as many teams as possible.   I bet Kansas would let you have another former coach of yours named Charlie back.   Not really singing, more just waxing poetic. Though I guess it's similar to the way Shatner sings, so there's that.   I fucked Ted.   So are the other 2.   Don't hate on CJ's. Bar of choice for football players and who wouldn't be distracted by all the people under 21 there?   I could see that if it were the Beatles or Michael Jackson, or someone equally big. I'm not sure the Beastie Boys are quite big enough to be listened to 250 years from now. Sabotage never even made it onto the Billboard Hot 100.   Katana umbrella, even better.   As does Captain Kirk, who apparently drives to 250 year old music.   He looks like The Situation.   This and clearing cache and cookies. Solves 95% of my calls about things that aren't working.   Navy does that to us all the time. Niumatalolo says it's ok because they play for Navy. I'm fine with the cut blocking, they don't have the athletes to keep up otherwise and I understand that. It's the flagrant dirty hits after the play's over that are 15 yards away from the ball that I have the issue with.   Fair enough, Northwestern might as well be in the leaders division though.   I understand that, I just figure if one of the teams has a division's name in its fight song, you might as well make that division the one they're in.   How was Michigan not put in the Leader division?   My complaint is more at plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ)   This is why I hate playing Navy. So many cheap hits.   I'm pretty sure we always lead the country in 6'8" unathletic white guys.   Yeah, I'm a huge Hulls fan, but you have to go with Zeke here.   My favorite Gunner Kiel moment was at one point he tweeted something and ended it with #GunnerKielQuotes . Alpha move right there.   My issue with Rees is that he reached his ceiling about 3 years ago. His ceiling is not high enough to win us a championship without great players around him, and probably a Heisman candidate at running back. Golson has a much higher ceiling, and is a better fit for Kelly's offense.   Ross Browner and friends were pretty good for us in the 70s after leaving for a year.   Things Boys Do We Love.   Baylor hasn't been in shootouts though. Yeah it gave up 42 to WVU, but who cares when you score 73. That's not a close game at all. Their closest game is a 2 score game over the defending conference champion (who admittedly is nowhere near what they were last year).   A 19 year old complained about getting carded? I'd understand maybe if they were like a young looking 30 year old or something who maybe looked 24, but a 19 year old is barely old enough anyway.   I have him, and of course the guy I play today has Megatron.   Title IX, yo.   To be honest, though, even without the rule, a top 8 Notre Dame is going to a BCS bowl. Honestly a top 12 Notre Dame probably is. That has nothing to do with a sweetheart deal with the BCS, and everything to do with our fanbase. The same is true of an at large Texas or Alabama or USC or Ohio State. Financially it just makes more sense for the bowls to take those schools.   Which for the record, is actually a more difficult rule than the non AQ conference teams. They have to be in the top 12. Granted it's much easier for us to be in the top 8 than them be in the top 12, but that's more a product of who we play.   Not to mention I can't imagine he'd be feeling great during the game given the altitude.   Nixon's foreign affairs wasn't terrible either. He did open up relations with China.   At this rate in 3 years he'll win a national championship.   Please no.   Well we already know Rees can't outrun cops so they wouldn't have too much trouble catching him.   Hey now, they did manage to to hold the running game under 250 yards.   Dan Fox holding onto that leg for dear life.   Thanks for the PTSD, ND.   How was that not a block in the back?   He watches game film of the 2011 Michigan game for help.   The Tommy Rees vs Michigan special.   I could have made that pass.   In fairness most teams will see a pretty substantial drop off to their 3rd string QB, which is basically what Hendrix is.   Bring back the Irish Chocolate package. 100% TD rate to this point.   I've known all year he was our best option. My issue with Tommy is we're not winning a championship with him. He's a 9-10 win QB. Nothing wrong with that, it still means he's a good QB. It's just that someone like Golson has the potential to win a championship someday.   This would work a lot better if we believed in fullbacks.   I'd probably rather not. Tommy ought to be back next week, or at least by the time we play someone we can't beat with Hendrix. It'd be a shame to burn a redshirt for a quarter and a half, even if it is SC. I'd rather just run all game.   Poor Dayne. Couldn't catch a break.   [The Observer](http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/sports/kelly-says-tuitt-stumbled-into-question-about-future-1.3095756#.UmM2xvleZ8F).   Who's ready to start running the triple option?   Tuitt's playing better now that he's not going pro after this year.   The occasional good plays do not a good QB make.    I miss Manti.   Carlson and Zibby were the only bright spots on that 2007 team.   Last time one did the SEC got screwed.   Best player ever in ppr.   And those aren't even the home games they coached. There's probably more that have coached less than 14 at home.   I would be so conflicted if Sexy Rexy coached at USC.   That makes more sense. I was wondering who could have possibly lost a flair bet to Purdue.   And you're Eskimo brothers through Montana.   The main reason I liked City better was I felt like there was more to do. Aside from the main story Asylum was basically just go get Riddler trophies. City had a bunch of other side quests.   It's not often you see Berkeley calling another school nerdy.   So half the people wouldn't show up to vote and then would forget about politics until the next election when they make sure they're registered? This is how my fantasy leagues go.   Oh ok, I was wondering why she was making a pizza while shaving her legs.   Good field position is an understatement. He was handed 7 points, and basically giftwrapped another 14.   The Lout Holtz approach. A few years ago Lou was talking about how Weis would have an easier time coaching when we played at BC because he was used to playing in the Boston area and his mind would be right. He then said he always felt like if he got to coach at William and Mary while he was coach at ND, he would have coached a great game. One of the other guys called him out on it and said yeah and they would have had a Heisman caliber QB and been favored by 30 points according to you. No one could talk up Army or Purdue like Lou Holtz.   Personally I think USC needs a coach with major college experience. Maybe one who's won a major conference and gone to a BCS Bowl like the Rose Bowl. One who's coached places like Stanford and Notre Dame, who has ties to California recruiting and the west coast.  The only option is Lionel Tyrone Willingham.    Fuck that bullshit. I'm a Dem in Indiana, but I loved Richard Lugar. Tea Party tries to oust him with an idiot like Mourdock. They could have, too, until he started talking. Thank God the strategy backfired and we got Lugar 2.0 in Donnelly but from the Democrat side.   My guess is it's not so much sneak attack dates as they don't want to date outside the church, and figure they'll just be upfront about it.   Windows-C also does this.   Now if I refer to him as Brobama, where does that fit in in terms of respect?   It wasn't 3 time all american, it was 3 year letter winner.   A Mac Mini.   I would watch a 50 shades movie if it starred Seth Rogen and Emma Stone.   But aren't they all "Nice Guys"?   I'd like to thank Purdue for not playing this week.   We need the NBC 360 cam!   Or you have Sam Bradford who stayed another year after being projected to go #1, got injured and barely played, and still went #1.   South Carolina has also lost to the only good team they've played.   I call shenanigans. That puts the game over in the over/under. Clearly something is amiss here.   Yeah, I mean I won't complain about an almost game winning pick, but you need to just bat that down unless you've got nothing but grass between you and the end zone.   Could've been a big play.... except for the overthrow and the holding.   There was one play where Lombard was blocking 3 people successfully. It was ridiculous.   ND doesn't even have a parks and recreation major! Clearly ASU  ND academically.   I'm not sure there are too many schools left that USC plays that could actually upset them anyway.   Brindza may not be the most accurate kicker, but he's got a hell of a leg.   And an 80 yard run against Air Force 2 years ago!   How I foresee the rest of this game playing out: We get a TD at some point, one more FG for ASU. We're driving down the field as time's running out at the end of the game. Kelly starts calling pass plays inside the 10 and Tommy throws an INT, instead of trying to kick the FG, Graham beats us at dream job #3.   Torii Hunter, Jr.   Did anyone else know that Corey Robinson's dad is David Robinson, the NBA player?   That's one of the reasons Utah schools do well. They have a bunch of players 2 years older because of Mormon missions.   I know a lot of guys that age that buy it. It's health conscious people who don't normally drink soda, but want to mix drinks.  Can't mix rum with water. In the words of my friend who tried "It retains none of the flavor and all of the what the fuck".   One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that.   You guys should just do tradesies with USC.   I think the ACC is better fit. We don't want to be on such an extreme end of any votes that come down to private vs public universities. The ACC is almost tied depending on how you want to count Pitt. And academically they're pretty similar. Yes we like playing UM, MSU, and Purdue from the B1G, but the ACC does have BC, Miami, and Pitt. I also feel like for nonfootball sports it's at least a toss up, if not leaning toward the ACC. We do love our lax.   I was under the impression from watching the game on Saturday that Rees was basically Peyton Manning and Bell was Roethlisberger.   He's not a comedian, but Mike Tomlin looks like Omar Epps.   Honestly the best part is just not wondering how I'm being insulted in a language I don't understand.   I stopped playing for about a year. Latin America servers were easily the best addition when I came back.   Shit, I was hoping for a nice easy win.  	100
 I feel really bad for the boar now. Life is so cruel     Happy birthday to the GROUND *splat*   The dog is sitting on the dashboard   Hot   Do you ever think to yourself, that you might be stupid or retarded and everyone around you knows it except you because they won't tell you in case it might hurt your feelings or something?   Jurassic Park is my favourite movie. Always was since I was a kid...and always will be   	6
 I saw all of the original movies and I get the whole Engrish joke. I just don't remember someone talking like that I guess.   Yeah, like the episode of Cowboy Bebop where the dude has tits   Meh, take more time on it and use thinner strands.   I don't understand the title, but this is definitely going in my webm folder   It was a long shot, yeah lol   I think it's a chick. The username has "esmerelda" in it. Also she posted to a hair dye subreddit of sorts with a picture of herself   I searched incognito so it wouldn't go into related searches and bug me   What about that original post lol   I just looked one up on Amazon and it was like, 35 for a pillow and 35 for a case.    I'm in a cold basement and when I blow vapor in my hands it feels like the air around me. It's about 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the basement and 80 degrees Fahrenheit upstairs. The vapor feels colder in a warm environment to me than say, me sitting in my chair right now doing it in the basement.    Maybe even two.   ring-off   Oh yeah the same happens when I watch subbed anime too. Like the creepy dude who almost rapes Sinon in SAO two is the same voice as Izaya from Durarara   He's still genuinely asking an airsoft related question. He could have asked something like this in a different format on /r/airsoft   Buy a body pillow   This is a question that can be answered on /r/airsoft   Yeah I remembered that one too lol   I noticed that too. There's a sort of comedic effect to it that kept it kind of light, but it sounded really genuine.    Yeah, Rittsu was the same voice as Kirito's little sister in SAO. I picked it up right away and it bugged me.   The voices were similar in the dub, but I've watched a lot of dubbed anime before watching the English dub of K-ON and I could pick out who all of the voice actors were   lol meep likes RWBY still   3edgy5me just like cameron   Yeah there's some nice looking ones on Evike.   He could probably pick up a pair of LBX Combat Pants in Glacier Grey and they'd work well   Did you FAL in love?   I FAL in love with my FAL.   No G3's   :'^(   Yeah, that'd be cool to do on a CYMA M870   What? I'm not him   Oh yeah, I'll definitely get shit on for my choice but it'll be fun and unique for me   Well it's not gonna be anything special by any means, but definitely unorthodox.    Whoa, what shotgun is that? That's pretty snazzy.   Too bad they're so rare and expensive. Otherwise I'd pick one up and get a stock.   *It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all.   It's a small world after all. It's a small, small world*   45 minute detention for calling a teacher "Dude"   My new sidearms are too eccentric to keep out of a collection picture, so of course I gotta wait lol   Nah I'll wait lol   Sounds cool. I've never had any sidearms besides using my MP5k once or twice. I've never had a use for one, but the field I'm gonna start going to is gonna require one for close encounters which kind of sucks.   I got as many rifles as this guy and an SMG but I feel like I need some pistols to balance it out.   I should get around to posting my full collection some day, but I think I'll wait until I get some pistols.   Oh my god it's the fucking turkey from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.   I'm gonna miss that show.   **YEAH WE'RE COOL KIDS**   Don't forget his magical plot armor power that he uses to defeat enemies more powerful than him!   YEAH WE'RE COOL KIDS.   Fuck bandwagons. This isn't even a full picture of a gun.    Idk but it's the whole gun. The description says it's based off of a VFC 417.   What?   This is the whole gun and everything lol   Oh god, right during my HK buzz and I can't get it. I really hope they release another version that isn't limited edition and more affordable. This is so beautiful.   Catbrains said this is a test patch   Nah it works   It was expected lol   ayy lmao   Who cares   Well mixing black gear with tan based camouflages always looks beginnerish or novice. If he had a tan or OD vest the loadout would look at more professional and experienced.    Try some better external lighting and use the camera without the flash to get better pictures. Also tan and multicam a little less beginnerish.    Aww yeah I love Fox Stevenson.    Then ask Vorperoni   Ask good ol' Mr.Catbrains   I'm not sure on supply, that's all /u/Catbrains' department         I literally checked my inbox just now and thought, "Imma go check the mail" and I got it   *Nice.*   Oh okay. So yay? I still get patch?   It'd look cool without the triforce just randomly stuck on there   RemindMe! 2 days   Idk talk to Catbrains sempai   I'll probably get mine tomorrow. I'll post a pic bb   Ah. Makes sense lol   It's pretty spot on for what it's like for me.   There were some parts that went overboard with the "muh triggerings" but they did do good with the respect that there's a lot of specific things that can trigger it.    I expected this to be gruesome or something lol   Not really NSFW   I really wanted one of the /r/airsoft patches but it all happened too fast for me to get the money lol.   I can't wait to get my /r/a_irsoft patch though so that'll be fun.   I think there were a few spots where the PTSD factor is shotty, but the show did a wonderful job capturing what PTSD is like as a whole and the daily struggles of it.    Ha. Well /r/sinonassonline sounds like your knack Reascr.    Oh that makes a lot more sense. It's a nice touch (the counter, that is), and I guess if you leave it in all of your videos it'll make more sense or seem consistent. I just thought it was a little confusing.   I think it'd look a lot more fluid if you left it un-grainy, but again if you do that consistently in your videos then viewers would become accustomed to it.    I just thought it was overall pretty blurry and grainy. What kind of camera are you using?  Also the time counter thing was odd.   Oh, keep it up, make videos, and all of that good stuff. Have fun.  Just saying there's definitely room to improve. Like the footage quality isn't the best and the music overpowers the game volume a bit.    Nobody else does considering the downvotes.   Ew.   Overpowering music, bad footage quality.    Aaaaaand now I want to paint my L96 black, put a silencer on it, get a WE TT-33, and get a Death Gun mask.   Yes I'm aware that Death Gun doesn't use an L96 or a TT-33, but close enough.    We should have an official night and add more mods to it   It's my favorite chinese cartoon   Yee   Everyone pretty much joins and makes an account, and adds videos to the queue. It's pretty dank. http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft   That's two posts lol   Huh?      I don't see a need for overwhelming FPS if I have a good barrel set up and hop up set up.    I too, have a [tactical doge.] (http://i.imgur.com/7kNagaU.jpg)   Nah   Lol I wonder why people are downvoting you   Okay lol. You said it was the E above and someone else said it was the E but then someone said it was the standard.  Alright, now I know what it is lol   It's good but very underwhelming.   Yeah I learned. G36E.    Yeah lol.    Still pissed me off how in the new movie the kid just lugs around a fucking M249 somehow.   Oh, that's pretty rough lol   Nah it's because it's HTC   It's regarded as one of the greatest entry level guns and a great clone.   Did the soldiers use AK's and CZ-75's?   I paid attention to the guns more in the new movie and the only thing that bugged me was the kid carrying a fucking M249 everywhere.   ayy dank cheeki breeki may mays    Dank may mays?   I wasn't trying to greentext, just quote what I was saying lol   I thought most slavboos used cheeki breeki Russian guns   fuckin redditers man   Thanks   Yeah I saw the initial downvote and thought, "Well, alrighty then"   You said slav. I thought most slavboos used cheeki breeki Russian guns.   Catbrains explained lol   Meh   Meh it's the long one which is the one I like lol   Yep. I plan on ghopping it or something along the road   I was actually thinking of picking up an MP7 or the VFC GBB UMP to get another needed SMG in there lol  As for the XM8, it's good but isn't what I was expecting. It shoots about as far as my AIM Top M4. About far enough to hit what I want, but pretty underwhelming.   I have a friend who's out of the sport and has a G36c he's selling. I tempted to pick it up.    Nice. You should pick up a TT-33 or a Makarov.   In the description, baby   I got around to getting a G36, and decided on my favorite variant. Description's in the album.  Guns,   JG G36k   JG G3   Galaxy MP5k   SRC XM8      lolwut   Well if I had your username I'd invite you   And a skype chat   Being wrong about something is the first step to being kind of right about something   That AK is probably a CYMA rebrand, just like how the IGOR is a shitty ST rebrand   lolwat x 10^23   lolwat   Ah. The almost VSS.    Oh. I don't like how it's drawn and there's like six episodes of flying and talking between three episode fights.   Otherwise I like it more than Naruto by far and I'm cool with it.   Naruto?   It's the gateway show most people who don't watch a lot of anime watch. I don't like how it's drawn, the characters are all so fucking annoying, it attracts retards, overrated as hell, repetitive long fights, terrible character development, and there's the godawful flashbacks.    Most people use the filler thing as a beginning argument but have plenty of other valid reasons to hate it.   That's what I meant.   Not at all. I have plenty of reasons for hating both shows besides that.   Nope totally stock, came with that   That there is the Echo 1 SOF 2, a rebrand of the JG FAL Carbine.   The only difference is a Madbull barrel, Echo 1 motor, and Madbull bucking.  In its' prime it shot true and it was a pleasure to field. Only problem was I had to fix the motor height.    Something of the sort lol   Only reason I've really really kept it is that I really want to P* it some day   Oh it's a dead gun now. Just a prop.   Trigger kind of came out with the gearbox.   *Oh of course.*   All I need is the cool hat and olive drab short-shorts   [Oh yeah baby.] (http://i.imgur.com/LAkBjJq.jpg)   A can of Krylon and some time can do wonders   41% of Naruto is filler.   That's almost half of the show lol  Also these downvotes are hilarious   Wrong post format.   Also that gun is fucked.  	138
 yeah that was sad, could have been a good franchise I dont understand why it bombed.    man that would have been awesome!!!!!    I think it was Abed alone.    Yeah I guess you right and WOW 2 billion dam.    I wish Marvel or Disney I should say broke out the checkbook and bought spiderman back for good. I mean its cool he will finally be in the MCU but Sony still has control how awesome would it be for Marvel to have the rights back forever.    if they never sold the rights then marvel probably wouldnt exist today.    Leto will own the role.    Theres really noone worse than Uwe Boll.    Probably not    because thats the only one I have seen.    Kingsman    I wish he made a few jokes or something or was in a sketch UGH. was he only there to please the fans???    I wanted Wolverine to win.    Absofuckinglutely!!!!!!    Keaton duh    I will harvest that planet tomorrow before I let her take it from me    A good performance by Arnie and a few good action scenes but other than that its crap. I couldnt tell if itwas trying to be comedy or thriller sometimes, still worth a watch tho.    LOL    Awesome movie!!!!! Im gonna see it again!!!!!!    LOL    I thought this was a creepy post LOL.    I know he was only there for five minutes and is played by eric forman of all people but I did like Venom, I wish he was the main villain though.    Awesome!!!!!!!    Yes he would be good.    God its so exciting seeing all of this!!!!!    John Mcclane    Lion King    Heath Ledger    Yes    YES!!!!!!! its so exciting seeng Spidey come home I hope they can make him have a major role in the civil war film that would be epic!!!!!    Logan Lerman or Dylan Obrien    I wish they would rewrite the movie to include Spiderman in the major role he has in the comics that would be so cool!!!!!    No    Movies are meant to be seen without interruptions.    Yes thats the reason i go to the theaters so much even watching movies multiple times.    Every dam time.    I wouldnt mind a sequel but the director is busy it seems.    No this is print we dont air Speculation.    no    Oh god just make it stay dead please.    Okay they are just lazy then.    they kind of gave up on it because the first one didnt meet their expectations, personally I hope they make it work soon.    cool LOL never noticed that before.    Did Eddie Redmayne remind anyone else of Pollux troy???    its the reason they delayed the movie.    lets hope its true.    Yes hes an awesome director I think if he focused solely on that it would be cool.    Cool    Yes I hope thats what Afflecks future is.    I didnt think he directed. He would be a good one actually.    LOL    Good movie I havent seen it for about 10 years now maybe I should revisit it.    Which ones do you think should pull a Clint as in Just start directing movies from now on and also act in them??? Personally I think Mel Giobson and Kevin Costner should do that they are both great directors and arent really getting good roles nowadays. Thoughts???    OMG that seems horrible!!! Thank god I have never had an experience like that there were a few loud guys yes but not like that. I still go to the movies all the time and I LOVE IT!!!!! Its a shame that people like that still roam around in them.    rofl    Yes    Shes hot.    No not the bees!!!!!    Yes thats what I was thinking those r considered the Golden Age of cinema.    Gibson is an awesome director hope he directs again soon!!!!    Sylvester Stallone tried to make a movie about him a few years ago but the studio cancelled it or something and he made expendables instead I read the script and thought it would make a good movie.    his gun and badge from when he was a cop.    Thats about right.    Cool   theres something I really didnt know   Yes    Yes watched it the other night great movie wish i had seen it sooner too.    Is it actually confirmed that they will be in the same universe???    Jennifer lawrence, Anne hathaway, Rosamund Pike, Zooey Deschanel, Emma Stone, Shaileme Woodley, Brie Larsen, Alison Brie, Karen Gillan,Hayley Atwell, and of course Anna kendrick    Yes he should.    Yeah its mostly with b movies man there is one i saw once where it is glaringly obvious LOL.    Thats for an actual scene in the movie In the movie a documentary crew was filming the reunion between the mom dad and son.    The Fault in Our Stars    I will read it wish it was being written by the master himself though.   WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Yes I wish they would make one already but disney has bigger fish to fry I guess.    Because they want to take away the shock factor of it. I also found it annoying how they announced them all the time.    NICE!!!!!!!!    I just saw it to man what a good movie.    Cool    Yes but who could play him????    Yeah true they could go with an older spiderman in the MCU if it ever happens though.    I forgot that scene I must rewatch it I guess.    marvel has already said IF they get Spidey the role will be recst, thats the one drawback I see if marvel gets the rights.    true  hope its real tho   Star wars and Back to the future also Lord of the rings.    I liked Lone Survivor a little better because of all the action and stuff. Fun fact the main characters of both movies Chris Kyle and Marcus Luttrell were friends in real life, man what if they had tied the movies in somehow.    Id make The Mandarin the villain he was supposed top be. Just have Killian be the brain guy and have Ben Kingsleys character do everything including kill maya and fight with tony at the end. Also his plan is to start a world war by making it look like the president was killed by some other country or something.    AMEN Germany AMEN    OMG dude    All of em.    I just saw it and I enjoyed it a good little comedy tho like all comedies of course they showed all of the funny parts in the trailer.    After everyone and their mom has seen it.    Michales Proposal to Holly in The Office    I really wish that they had gotten the rights back for Spiderman how awesome would it have been to see Spiderman, captain America, and Iron Man all in the same movie. I hope this Infinity war rumor is true now that would be something.    HMM Ill check it out.    Who knows????     Not atm, sad too I wish they would hurry up I want to see Rooney mara as Lisbeth again.    I need new audiobooks for work what are some good suspenseful ones???       LOL    It was an okay season better than coven at least but not as good as the first two, I was just happy that when someone died they STAYED dead this time. Also Evan peters got someone pregnant again LOL.    LOL YES!!!!!!!    Because shes russian.    WOW that is so weird I was just doing voiceoverwork!!!!    Malcolm Mcdowell just watch the Book of Eli.    Normally I will watch most of the major ones including all best picture nominees. this year I might take it a step further and watch EVERY film nominated.    I was literally about to post Gary oldman for the Professional good job!!! Another one I can think of is jack Nicholson in the departed he was so awesome in that film!!!    Yes I will never forgive the academy for that one, he was easily the best performance in that film and they nominate and give the gold to christoph walz who already had one for playing an evil version of that character basically.    A bunch of them. the Lovely Bones is one I haev caught every year since its release because that is my all time favorite movie.    OMG YES!!!!!   	111

[no but shut up though](http://www.gamekyo.com/images_1/dc1911acd82cec0147111f1bd0ea6afd20110627173443.png)   Oh ya, I totally forgot about the touhou fighters    I mean lolis shooting at eachother, also damn good music      I know I want to do somthing music related and I want to learn about mastering and mixing and from what everyone is saying I wont learn about that in collage   Ok, I am a junior in high school who is looking to become an audio engineer and reading this freaked me out :(. What I'm getting from this is I should look for an internship and find a place that has a good engineering program?    For sure!   I played Jojo allstars battle royal yesterday! It was ok :( the movement felt bad but it looked fantastic and they got all the little details right, it sucks because Jojo is a great concept for a fighting game   Two degs    Sweet I'm all for story telling... I'll check some of those out   It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied   I fucking love Jojo so much. It has shown me that I can love anime! It also got some bad tastes out of my mouth (fuck you elfen lied)  P.S. I can explain why I don't like elfen lied if you want me to   Metroid metal.... Woa man   I mean you could post that, it sounds super awesome! But what I'm looking for is stuff that samples the ziabatzu, like taking little audio clips of them and putting it into a song, also covers of the theme. You know things like that :)    I like to believe that shaq's head is filled with marshmallows and chocolate, he is truly a national treasure...     Silent hills..... =( oh please I want to see the town in my dreams    Post music that is a remix, mash-up, cover of anything zaibatsu related! We've been getting some good music lately [I'll go first with somthing I made](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/ginger-breaks-wip)  P.S. I'll try to finish this sometime, although it's going to be be a little tricky since I lost the project file :/      Lets see.... /u/trollabot audiofrq    Exilent (   )      Holy shit 100 comments per month!? I was expecting less   Also Hardcore is one of my most used words.... Perfect    /u/trollabot test_subject8320  Let's see what we get...   I'm working on a very super secret special project and I need some liam vocal clips, the first one shouldn't be super hard to find just him talking about Japan, the next one might be a little more difficult I just need a clip of him saying "rain" bonus points for anyone who can find me a clip of him saying "tea". Post links and time stamps I can rip the audio my self :) thanks in advance!   [Like this? :D](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/ginger-breaks-wip) also yes this is by me   Maybe throw up a spoiler for that pic dude   Hey Darude! What do you think about hard trance? More importantly have you ever thought about making it?   I've seen Thera comment at points, same with Atmozfears    Angerfist = Floorcrushers (only did one song though)  Thera used to do Hard trance   You know what, how about we all list artists with other aliases just so we know!   Audiofreq = ~~BL1K~~ BRK3, Bioweapon, Orbit1  Activator = ACTI  Geck-o = Geck-e  Shingo Dj = NATP, Round Wave Crusher  Zatox and tatanka = Wild Motherfuckerz  DJ Hidden and Eye-D = The Outside Agency   Christan from Art Of Fighters is part of Meccano Twins          You could try some good ol' fashion crossbreed. The Outside Agency and Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) are two of my personal favorites, as for hardcore to hardstyle a lot of Endymion's tracks bridge that certain gap. I would recommend their track Mirror Mirror with Alpha2 (it is rawstyle though)   Now that is a movie I would watch! Coming this summer... David Hayter is Big Dog   "This is dog"  *David hayter grunt/startled noise.wav*   Up top to the pasty white dude bit brother! Hopefully we'll see some lesser known genres gain fans in the near future (hard trance 3)   This kind of bell/chime sound [it starts right at the beginning](http://youtu.be/mSulcjw9OOM) it's from the song rock that beat by the Highstreet Allstars    I understand were you coming from man I'm the same way when it comes to anime, I've never really liked the whole harem story trope. On a diffrent note check out "Jojo's bizarre adventure" it is one of the HYPEST animes out their! I'm talking guys with the mussle mass of bulls punching each other and fighting vampires. Plus the main villain Dio is one of the best villains out their, he is an asshole and he knows it, and at times you will laugh along with him because he's just so evil. Also any time any of the voice actors have to say an english word it is pure gold   Yep the one at the beginning    Sakura is fantastic for Asian strings   Val-Kilmer sounds really good, the synth is nice and the melody is catchy. For sure look into side chaining, it will make everything cleaner    The way the melody came in was a little sloppy, otherwise good job the actual melody was catchy and the kicks cut through everything nicely    His mix tape is hotter then 10 nukes   We should give this guy a name! Any ideas?   Thank you mods! Also can we have a button that plays a woolie sound clip every time it's pushed, if that's to much to ask for I understand :)   oooohhh, some of those sounded pretty good, thanks for this bra   Dude stop.... The vice can only get so tight    One of the best sample library peices of advice came from /u/noisestorm on Twitter (or reddit I don't remember) basically he made a folder of all the samples he made and some of his favorites from sample packs and deleted the ones he never used   When I get my computer back I am going to buy Sakura and I will send you the stems/FLP (if you got FL) and we will work on this togeather because I don't know a lot about trap!   Good sound design, especially that part around 0:13-0:14 it sounds really sharp. Make this into a full song please... Also maybe use a diffrent text to speech software, I've personally never liked the ones that come with FL, they sound kind of weak (Just my opinion! If you like them then don't let me get in your way)   *Tightens vice*   Thank you! I never considered taking it in a trap direction, maybe I could start it off as a traditional japanese song and then slowly introduce trap elements... Shit man I picked the worst week to send my computer in ()   Man SWERY should do an AMA on here, I think out of every lets play fan base we love him the most   Wait, this is by the guys who made jet set?!? (I feel dumb for not knowing that) also yep, going to have to put a vice on my nuts/wallet until I hear how it is   I've seen these drums before but I never knew what they were called, thanks a lot dude! The drums could be used for "the coming of the storm" part   I've never really given them a good in depth listen, when my computer gets back from the shop I'll have to give them a better listen   Yep, FL user! I have nothing against the FPC drums, I was just wondering of any other sample packs    I'm working on a song and I'm trying trying to tell the story of someone walking down a rainy street and going into a tea shop to warm up, I have the strings and rain now I need some percussion (mainly a good woodblock sound!) free or paid it doesn't matter, thanks in advance you beautiful people! 3   I understand what your saying dude, hmm it feels like I've had this issue with a vst before, maybe put a little more space in between the notes? (Sorry if I'm not super helpful my computer's at the shop so I can't really do any thing music related)   Digging the art style, reminds me a bit of king city, post what you think about it here! I'm always a little cautious with early access games   Also for those who don't know! King city is a great comic that I stumbled across in a book store, I don't think the ~~ziabatzu~~ zaibatsu have ever talked about it but it seems like somthing they would really like, check it out if you ever come across it   So basically what your saying is sony is a giant tentacle monster?    Yep, I need a PC port of this, I am convinced I will like this a lot more then dark souls    Sytrus has a bunch of cool ones (especially the pads) I'll list afew vst's   Sakura: sitar 1 (I love Asian strings!)  Harmor: I'm spacing on its name it sounds like some kind of synth that you would hear in a movie like blade runner  Toxic Biohazard: The underwater preset is pretty cool and dreamy  Serum: Any of art of fighters presets (he did a good job on them)      sakura can recreate this (I'm pretty sure), it's great for oriental stuff and it might have a erhu preset (I don't know for sure because I've never taken a good look at the presets :P)   Definitely add some reverb to the harpsichord at the beginning, it will give it a better presence, otherwise no real glaring issues with this, keep it up I'm interested to hear what else you can do :)     Nice job on the strings dude! The intro sounds great and it flows very nicely into the drop, keep your head up man you did good on this :)   In most songs that sample video games, the sample is used once and it comes across as lame and not using the clip to its fullest potential, this on the other hand uses the sample fantastically! Checkout Geck-o (his other alias) if you want to hear more from this guy (sadly this is the only fallout song he's done)      https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/rainy-day-in-the-east I'm thinking of turning this into a full song, but im stumped on what kind of percussion would go well with this. Also I'm not super happy with the melody it sounds inconsistent and the progression sounds off (just listen and you'll understand), thanks in advance for the help :)  [Feedback for k55v](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/31lctz/feedback_thread_april_06/cq3afcb)  [Feedback for GaFFGaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/31lctz/feedback_thread_april_06/cq3ar4t)  [Feedback for Drink_The_Noise](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/31lctz/feedback_thread_april_06/cq3nziv)  [Feedback for H3XAGON_](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/31lctz/feedback_thread_april_06/cq3q5sd)  [Feedback for Spookie4You](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/31lctz/feedback_thread_april_06/cq3qldh)   Looking to get into hard house, I've really been liking it lately, also thank you to everyone! I asked about hard trance awhile ago and got a ton of responses.   Wow... This was Russian, the kick was a little quiet   ;_; "im hunkered down in this cave for the night, seems pretty standard as far as caves go, although I am hearing some strange noises coming from deeper in the cave, it sounds like a combination of buzzing and growling. I'm going to go check it out, it's probably just a bloatfly and a couple of coyotes," -Some dead Motherfucker (R.I.P)   I feel bad for laughing as hard as I did    The switches remind me of something you would see on a virtual synthesizer, like the virus swich or the dog meat knob          Yeeeeeeeeeeeahhhhh!!!!! (Pat or the csi voice you decide)   BURN THE HERETICS ON A HOT GRAPHICS CARD!!    This is so 80's that it hurts good find though    This might not be the place to post this, post this on one of the feedback threads or wait until we have another plug DJ night :)   I made [this big 'ol mess](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/fx-kick-reese) out of one from the blutonium hardstyle pack, also serum fucking rocks!     I would love to talk with him sometime, just get in his head and learn where he got some of the ideas for some of the more memorable platinum game set pieces       YES!!! /u/mike0dude please   thank you.... thank you so much! now all we need is for the mods to put this on the sub       Wow that doll is super sexy/hot/cute also holy shit I have never heard woolie make a noise like that, I really do hope this gets ported to PC   It's so cute      I messaged audiofreq and he sent me the radio edit and DJ edit, I should still go to iTunes for Hoo-ey    For sure checkout the JSHC, also checkout psycho filth records for aggressive stuff, if your looking for happier music checkout [Foryousounds](http://www.foryousounds.com) all anime remixes, completely free! Theirs also mob squad Tokyo and massive criclez. WORD OF WARNING!!! At points you will have to resort to torrenting, I beleve that you should support the artist when ever possible but some times theirs no other way! I'll PM you a link to were I get most of my japanese stuff   Aggred, good songs that are sadly broken and mislabeled, plus I'm still pretty salty about Hoo-ey :/. Also on the 2013 hardcore comp. a good chunk of the tracks were from the FREE "this is hardcore" album   This too    If you want a good titanic sci-fi thing watch that one episode of futerama    If you like hardcore checkout the Japanese stream hardcore compilations    *pats on back*   How will I remember to use the code ~~WoolirM~~ WoolieM now?! (fuck phone keyboards)   "I hear the guy from your yug-ge-oh? Is in it"   very nice dude! heres a patch I made a while ago (its not as good as yours but still) https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0   Yep, I might be wrong here but our boi woolie woolz used to do a little bit of modeling    But it will only be painless if we  (Don't forget to use the code WoolieM)   I still need to check out the tidy shop so if it's not their I'll try out the torrent when I get home   Theirs no option to buy it :/   Back in 2006 tidy trax released "Dark by design - The producer series //01" it was a limited edition CD that has long since sold out. So my question is where do I start if I want to find it/who should I ask? I know this is kind of a stupid question but I appreciate any help :)   God dammit heady :(      Do you need help getting out?   Woa! Thanks man, I'll look through all of these carefully :D         Usually I buy the comps. From cloud 9 but recently I bought the 2014 one and it's safe to say I'm done buying from them :/       #it's not Phil's fault, blame his parents       Holy shit that hank hill one, their were a ton of good ones in this    Yo super serious question for you shitlords, would I like this game? I played about 50 hrs of darksouls and I was only able to ring the two bells  dark souls was pretty fun but it felt like their were too many instances of banging my head agents a wall, also I didn't really like the art style of DS, this on the other hand looks pretty cool       Sure thing dude! Expect to see more on here later today   Alek Szahala, he's a Finish freeform producer, a lot of his songs are acid influenced, I would recommend his song Darkstar    My boy from Finland! I love him so much, back when I was into dubstep he was on the top of my list!   It sucks that a lot of HT artists are going subground. I love subground but I love HT more      Yo could I get a episode number and time stamp on pats indigo prophecy thing, mental disabilities kind of resonate with me because one of my family members is mentally disabled    *Sigh* oh the ziabatzu let me count the ways I love thee, 1. You always make me laugh, 2. You make me love things (I am now a mgs fan because of you chuckle fucks) 3. I started liking anime more 4. I realized the glory of Japan because of you and 5. You have gotten funnier over the years. Now what I would do if I ever met you, Matt: I would watch a action movie with you and your wife and then look at your action figures with intent and ask you questions about each one, Pat: I would talk horror and computers with you until the sun goes down then comes up again, Woolie: I would have you guide my hips and teach me all about fighting games I would also buy you a new mic because seriously dude and Liam: I would watch anime with you and after we finish watching you could tell me about how great the vita is and I would then go out and buy one. Also being super serious /u/mike0dude should be in a video or be on the podcast he is the true MVP of this sub, Mike keep up the good work you beautiful SOB   HFS MAN! Thank you, looks like I've got a lot of listening to do   Thank you! Got anymore for me?      Hello /r/Trance! As the title says, give me some suggestions! I am open to anyone/any kind of trance. Also let me tell you what I listen to normally, I love the harder side of music so hardcore, hardstyle, hard trance things like that I've also noticed that I love music from 2009 (those old hardstyle melodies are one of the things I live for) thank you in advance :)   What would be the team names? The space chodes vs the woolie boys?      Resubmiting because this got taken due to mod suppression /s (I broke rule 2)  I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene      	156
 Not working... "need authorization"    Eurotrip. Like... 3-4 times?   Illuminati confirmed or are these types of open directories common? :p   Kraftidioten   Well I managed to get poorly translated English subtitles for [Kraftidioten](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2675914/) in some shady subtitle site, so it could be worse... I guess. Haven't watched the whole movie yet but it seems kinda nice. Weird, but still.   True. Nothing's worse than some antivirus software deleting my scene crack/keygen collection.   Battlefield Hardline Music DLC Pack - Add 5 brand new songs to your game for only 7.99$!   1911   Heeeh, a bit too short. I would have liked to answer more questions :)   ... I can't see it.   Lol don't even get me started on YIFY :p All of their 1080p releases have bitrates of ~2000 Kbps. Pretty much every 720p scene release I've ever downloaded is at least twice that. Although I traditionally prefer scene PC-ISO/apps releases too, as protections get tougher some stuff is either gonna take a VERY long time to be released, or won't be released at all, thanks to their rules. Some fine examples of that are The Sims 4 and the new Dragon Age. This is where 3DM and their friends come in with their v6 crackfixes 'really workz now!', but well, it's better than nothing, I guess. And well, I think SKIDROW has failed me more than P2P (Far.Cry.4-SKIDROW) :P   I love when 3DM or some other P2Pers release something, these fake blogs publish it and people are like "omzg skidrow juzt released crack for futball managor 2015 thx so much skidrow u r da best".   I really wasn't expecting to get so many replies, specially with so many explanations (I read all of them). First, [here's the Google Form's summary of the responses.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AU3sEVFAlJ9kpGZkkZjrxPlZx2tGoI_hxxgURzWl0Ac/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics)  I noticed that it just had the names of the countries and not a graph. So I made [this interactive map.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CC6VcZIpSAF5Jq0ScFTX1j_dPiiGa1_RDUXjGa95mRc/pubchart?oid=528833391 format=interactive)   Some interesting stuff (keep in mind that there's not as much data on non-Americans, non-whites and females):  * 64.4% of the USA participants think their country's dominant race will become a minority in it.  * 14.3% of the females would not have an interracial relationship, while only 6% of the males wouldn't.  * 78.4% of non-hispanic whites like being the race that they are, while this is only true for 63.3% of the participants of other races.  * "Propaganda" was the least popular factor of influence with an average of 0,83/4, while the most popular was "personal experiences in real life" with an average of 3,155/4.   I also made a word cloud (using [this)](http://www.wordle.net/) with the words in all of the explanations you guys gave, [here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/QEIPSP8.png)  Finally, [here is a copy of the raw data in spreadsheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PqQb7pyPrXcdoHD8kbF_4R8xdB8kWIJarvHTeeVywck/edit?usp=sharing)  Thanks to everyone who was a part of this! :)    I gotta start paying more attention to what I'm doing :/   You guys mean the survey or the actual speech? If it's the speech, I'll be one of the last of my class to do it, thanks to the alphabetical order, so it could take a few months. I could tell you guys how it went but I doubt by then you'd still be interested. But I'll be sure to publish the results of this survey when this leaves the front page or something! :)   I'm gonna give a speech for my Portuguese class which focuses on racial issues. This survey takes like 2 minutes if you're in a hurry, but more if you decide to explain your opinions. Thanks everyone :)      Damn this is awesome.   The door wasn't wide open. According to my parents, they left it closed (not locked). The trust we put in society was extreme, and yes, leaving the door open was a stupid mistake. But isn't invading someone else's house and taking away what's theirs much worse than honest people who would never do that forgetting to lock a door? Yes sir, we're the "cancer". Now I must go, though. Gotta support these people's welfare and their drop-out kids :)   My parents used to go to the supermarket thinking I would close the door when they left. And I usually did, but  one day I had my ear plugs on as I was studying, and didn't hear them leave. After a while, I seem to hear some small noise. I open the door and there are 2 filthy gypsy women in the kitchen. My heart starts racing and I pretend I believe their "oh we thought this home was for rent - or is it your neighbor's?" bullshit, as I'm physically weak and don't want trouble. One of them asked to go to the bathroom while the other one kept developing that fake story. When my parent's arrived, besides cleaning the toilet, they noticed some gold stuff we had (like necklaces we've been offered at our birth) had gone missing.  Now I'm just hoping the government decides to cut welfare for these pieces of cancer. But I doubt it, in Europe we love supporting those who not only do nothing for us, but also damage our lives :)   I don't think that could have happened if you bought in the actual G2A website (not some phish crap) with PayPal, while using a PC with no malware. Not sure if G2A allows actually entering your credit card without a middleman like PayPal, but if it does and you did it, it was quite dumb. I bought BF4 Premium from G2A months ago and it worked, but I paid it with Paypal (Paypal credit from a bank transfer, not credit card, though).   This deserves gold. But... you know... not in this economy...   dice pls   I'd suggest lowering the the texture quality, but wow, you have a Titan. Does it stutter immediately after you start playing or only after a while? If it's only after a while, it might be a memory leak.  Also, try changing the settings to "Maximum performance" in NVIDIA's control panel. And the texture thing, just to see if it makes any difference.   Nice one, will you publish the results once it ends? :)   I photoshopped a friend's ID card so that he could enter a night club. He said it worked. Oh, and I've cracked a few programs.   RELOADED has been releasing stuff under "DOGE" (like Goat.Simulator-DOGE). They just name that DLL for fun. You can clearly see it's part of the uPlay emu: http://i.imgur.com/XnhvAPl.png   Until 1 or 2 years ago I don't recall ever having problems with FPS stutters. Everything always worked fine.   Now all of a sudden it seems that new games start to stutter, even though I upgraded to a GTX 760 (not top of the line, but hey, I get enough frames per second with it). Watch_Dogs, AC Unity, Far Cry 4... I know they're poorly optimized crap, but still, there are people with similar graphic cards who don't suffer from it.   Does this happen to you?       Dude complaining about i5 3570 and here I am with an i7 920 :/    How did you make that glitch happen?   I think this happened when I had installed [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler). I fixed it by opening it and closing. But that's probably not what's happening with your PC. Try checking if you have your firewall on, and if your Internet connection is working properly.   Server name pls?   Create a retirement home for old porn stars.   Poor teammate :(    [OP] Objective Pushers Obliteration   Ah, I'm adding that server to my favorites. I saw tr1plex, Yay_Dogecoins and ONYXGFX on then feed, so I thought it was SAS.     	37
 I'm guessing that you would be in the atmosphere, maybe you can be the first person on mars?   I want invited to these week long orgies, how do I do it?   They also say that autism is "on the rise". When It's not really on the rise it's just that the diagnosis is much wider now than it was in say, the 80s.   I don't get them from the street anymore. I get real prescription stuff mainly because there's an abundance of them in my house because most of my family have prescriptions.   Imodium is an opiate that just doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and acts primarily in the gut, but the thing is, it either works really well, works too well or doesn't work at all. It doesn't feel consistent, but maybe that's just me.    I've never understood the argument that vaccines cause autism. If that was the case wouldn't most of the world have autism?   Hello everyone I'm new to this subreddit mainly because I didn't have much to post about. I have IBS-D (most likely, still need to do a little more tests but that's my diagnosis right now) and I get extreme relief from opiates, mainly morphine and codeine. The relief actually feels like a cure, when I take them I have no diarrhea whatsoever (mainly because opiates cause constipation but constipation for me is a relief), I still have chronic nausea and stomach cramps though. The only problem is that I'm not prescribed these meds, but they're easy to come by and make me able to function. If I try to come off them I would probably go to the bathroom around 8 times in 7 hours and I would have to take sleep meds to get any relief from that (if i didn't have any morphine or codeine).   Anyway, my question is, is it possible to get prescribed these meds for this type of condition?    But they're still essentially the same as the other atypicals.    Antipsychotics will produce the opposite of euphoria.    I've never known anyone that's white to take offence to being called a "white boy" or a "cracker". Maybe if it's more complex racism but not one word.    Why the fuck is it that only white people can be racist? Can't black people be racist too? It's so fucking stupid, if I hear someone thats black call me a white boy or cracker I'm gonna play the race card because that's also racist. Also, why do black people get so offended when someones mildly racist to them? I don't get offended if someone's racist about white people.   I'm not being racist if some idiot thinks that I am. If everyone wants equality (which I've always fully supported) then we should ALL get treated the same at the basic level.    I would've said, "Fuck you, you're racist too", to the teacher.    So what do you say if he wasn't american? What about a british person that's black? Do you also say African American? God damn, people are so dumb and stupidly sensitive when it comes to racism.    I've heard about the CBD recently. It apparently sounds good for negative symptoms as well, hopefully they finally try it out in a few years.    First horse burgers now deadly erection spiders, god dammit Tesco.    I was wondering that because the medications used for schizophrenia right now aren't exactly the best (albeit they are better than the very old style antipsychs), do you think they'll be new antipsychotics in the next 10-15 years, or are there already some in the making?   God dammit, she's a dumbass.    Could ebola not go endemic because of this outbreak (especially if it's not over soon)?   I think this is a very informative sub reddit. I like the posts here but I have a question... Who's serious?   Thanks, I've saved it so I'll read it a little bit later.    Thanks. I'll definitely do that.    So I haven't played minecraft since beta because I've just been playing other games basically and I've just started up a world and was wondering that there is a lot of changes that I don't particularly know about. Any tips and information anyone can give me about the new game? Remember the last time I played was mid beta. Thank you!   He looks so grungy. I like it.   If you could understand context you'd realize that I was being distant and just not dismissing him, I wasn't exactly trying to fully diagnose him it's called not being dismissive of someone.    Yeah it would be cheaper because amphetamine paste is just mix amphetamine salts like adderall but it's less pure. It's basically the stuff you got in the 70s and 80s.   Yeah it might not be your goal but if you had the option you would do it (if you were a sociopath) right? Also, look into narcissistic personality disorder or just narcissism (since you said you like talking about yourself). It co exists with antisocial disorders.     I have read up on the topic of a lot of personality disorders. Sociopaths usually have little to no emotion and empathy. They have little to no guilt for the wrong things they do and they think people are there to be exploited and oh, I don't watch TV either, that's so 15 years ago.    Alcohol is neurotoxic and CAN cause alcoholic brain disease and dementia. Alcohol is definitely worse for your brain and no, it's not different for a teen because you're just a different age not a different species.   [This is what he means.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity)   They were trying to plug it.    Why would there be a market for a less pure amphetamine? Adderall is basically just the same except it's more pure and you know exactly what you're getting.    I never used to get mad on opiates until I got addicted to them.   That doesn't make sense. Sociopaths usually don't recognize any fault within themselves and will only say they are if they can get something out of someone.    When I was taking ritalin I used to just snort the shit out of it. I would go up to 200-300mg in a day. Amazing drug while it lasts but when you come down it's metal as fuck.    I was even taking ritalin medically and I still felt the recreational effects initially.    Amphetamine is pretty recreational lol.   Why do we still have street amphetamine? Because doctors don't prescribe dexedrine or adderall as much as they do in the states so it doesn't get on the streets as much.    Yep, in the UK street amphetamine is speed. I've never actually heard or seen of anyone using meth in the UK.    Ants are gonna be Sched 1 soon.    Do you mean prozac and sertraline?    90c? That could cook my chicken.   I can't find EpicScale in my programdata, I uninstalled uTorrent. Is it possible I could have the miner still?   But why is it always in the Ritalin? /r/Conspiracy   I've been off them for a bit now and I'm fine. I'm more inward recently but that's about it.    My appetite isn't exactly great lately so I know I'm not over eating (well right now at least).    Holy shit, I'm on a vice article.    I've stopped taking my seroquel because it made me tired all day until it wore off 24 hours later (I took a controlled release version), but not only that but it made me gain 80-84 pounds (not just seroquel but the other anti psychotics I've been on in the past year). I've been off of it for just over a week (I know, not long at all) but my weight is still not back to normal, it's essentially still the same. I've been walking quite a lot (hard exercise is hard for me right now, just got bloods back saying that I've been pretty anemic and I have a stomach condition). I got a pedometer thing and It says I walk around 3-4 miles a day and I've also not been eating much, just lunch and dinner and maybe some chips, that's it. The only days I didn't walk much is when I got sick a few days ago but that was only for 2-3 days. I've not been losing any weight at all, I'm still between 235-238 pounds. Is there ANYTHING I can do? I've came off my anti psychotics because they're starting to just be a waste of time (yeah, yeah, I know, they "helped"), I walk quite a lot and don't eat more than 2,000 calories and at the most I eat around 2,500 calories. I've posted this here before and people didn't think it was possible, but yeah, whatever. I'm starting to lose it here, coming off anti psychs haven't helped (yet) and I walk and eat right and my weight still isn't coming off and my docs don't want to hear it. Is there anything I can do?  PS; If anyone doesn't believe I walk around 3-4 (maybe 5 at the very most) miles a day then I'll take a screenshot next time I'm out walking.    ##DID I DO IT?   One of my favourite movies. I even live in Scotland.    You're pretty much right. It's just an opiate that binds to the mu opiate receptors in the gut (just like any other opiate under the sun).    My dad is (was) an alcoholic and he's had to stop now mainly because he's developing a form of dementia that a lot of alcoholics get, luckily the thiamine has helped but it doesn't help everyone (he's not even 60).   I play CSGO (taking a massive break right now because it gets extremely boring) I'm a pretty high rank and I see what you're saying. Toxic players are so fucking stupid and annoying, I have one dude on my friends list who just rages because he dies (even if we win the game).   He seemed like he was actually bullying himself lol.    Tell them to fuck off (literally say, fuck off) and stop faking remorse, fucking losers. And PTSD from breaking up with a boyfriend? God damn, fuck that family they seem like a pathetic bunch of losers.    Have you seen a cirrhotic liver? Looks like a pickle.   Well alcohol can literally pickle your liver and give you a form of dementia, I would say its 9001x better.    Depends on how much you take and how much you drink.    I've got pretty bad "negative" symptoms (mainly not washing for days/weeks and not wanting to do anything other than sit in my room on my own) still but doctors NEVER ever take a look at it for some reason so I'm stuck not being able to fully function while no one really understands why and scold me for it.    It happens in the UK just not at the same rate as America. As /u/Fillyhaze said, the younger the doctor is in the UK (or Canada) the more likely they'll prescribe something, it happens much more often with psychiatrists in the UK than other doctors though. Psychs are often the most corrupt.    They're pretty much the same thing but certain people like to say psychopath or sociopath. I just got used to saying sociopath.    Real narcissists (Narcissistic personality disorder, which most peoples parents in this sub reddit actually have) are also sociopaths, they can make anyone believe them or like them.    After reading a lot on this subreddit I've came to the conclusion that narcissists are so fucking stupid and self centered that they don't even deserve human interaction.    So they're literally committing crimes against humanity, in a way?   You should leave, really fast. You'll either crack and kill THEM or they'll end up hurting you or worse, kill you. They're extremely abusive and bad parents.    [This is how much receptors they act on. The ones that are blank for efficacy are basically antagonists](http://gyazo.com/f32f36ce833a74312e3b2498e2f2a45a) 6-7 are agonists partially, but most are antagonists. So it's definitely not just one or two receptors, so doctors that tell you that are probably just mistaken because they're not exactly pharmacists or pharmacologists.    Seroquel will calm you down a lot more. Heh heh.   If you don't mind me asking what autoimmune disease(s)?   She said that her sister thought it was in Japan.    People either never take enough codeine (180mg-120mg) or they can't metabolize it into a working drug because they don't have the enzyme or insufficient amount of the enzyme.    I didn't exactly say that he isn't damaging it, he's obviously mildly damaging it but the other dude said that he's "KILLING" his liver. I don't exactly think he's killing his liver with only 900mg over the recommended limit.    You're right, my mistake. When you're constantly studying this shit you often mistake an agonist for a releasing agent or a reuptake.    Was just about to say that lol.    I don't itch from opiates as much anymore. I used to scratch really bad but not that much anymore. Tolerance can play I role I believe.    best answer.   Every time I do CWE's I don't get as high. You should still do it OP, maybe you're not as dumb as me.   I wouldn't say he's KILLING his liver with 4.9g a day.   Money.    I've had ritalin controlled release that was just little balls that didn't have much wax or fillers and was really easy on my nose. Depends on what kind he has. If it's concetra then don't just crush it up and snort it, that's probably the worst for snorting.    Either way, benzo withdrawal can kill you. It's just like alcohol withdrawal but arguably not AS dangerous but it's still in that ballpark and should be treated with care. If he was my patient and he even called me all sorts of names and shit I would still taper him before just letting him go.    Oral ritalin doesn't really do much other than for therapeutic uses. Focalin and Ritalin are only really euphoric when snorted. So try again in 2 days and just snort them. Are they XR or IR?   God damn pot head.    It's so fucking weird. You're chilled out and happy but you're also mad as fuck at the same time. God damn opiates, not even... wait, I'm doing them right now.   No problemo.   Opiates make me happier but god damn my temper threshold is so fucking low.    20-100 hours and 36-200 hours (for the active metabolite) is the HALF life. So if you take 20mg, after around 36-200 hours (usually it's in between those times) will go down to 10mg in your system. When I was taking lorazepam I was very happy and social for a week later.    I'm pretty sure it is but not to the extent of heavy recreational use of course. Amphetamines use a lot of dopamine and serotonin and pretty much deplete these receptors (thats pretty much why you come down) and someone who takes them every day for a few years would definitely have some brain chemistry changes.   I remember being on methylphenidate (ritalin) and I would have to take breaks every weekend just to EAT, so if someone is not eating enough and basically starving themselves due to no appetite could that also damage the brain? Because I know that korsakoffs syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency usually seen in alcohol but can happen because of malnutrition too. (Legit question, even if it seems dumb).   Xanax is pretty much the exact same except its stronger.  Edit: Yeah, don't freak yourself out of course but using benzos for a year at any dose (even theraputic) can cause seizures. It's DEFINITELY something to think about and have a friend with you incase it happens, you know, seizures aren't always deadly, seizures kill you usually by banging your head or having an injury when no one is around not by the seizure it's self. Honestly, seizures are the worst physically thing that can possibly happen but it doesn't mean it's set in stone. Just watch out for the mental stuff, you'll be cool though.   If you can survive benzo withdrawal - then you can survive anything  You're right. I've been through opiate withdrawal numerous times and it seems nothing like benzo withdrawal. Makes opiate withdrawal a walk in the park and that's saying something.    Stims (methylphenidate etc) never really made me feel warm and fuzzy inside (or maybe I was too speedy to realize lol), opiates do that.    Since that's what it was prescribed for you could have rebound symptoms of PTSD (not related to withdrawal, but withdrawal will make the anxiety worse for sure since that's part of the withdrawal syndrome). If it gets too bad I would definitely call the hospital, they'll give you a benzo if it's bad enough. Your doctor should NEVER have done this to you, with any psychiatric drug (ESPECIALLY benzos) you need to be tapered slowly off of them.   Edit: Remember, you wont get every symptom thats listed on the wiki, that's just a list of possible symptoms. If anyone got all those symptoms they'd be effectively dead lol.    Yeah lol.   If you've been taking it for a year religiously then it is a concern for sure. [This will tell you all the withdrawal symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome). Seizures are pretty common with benzo withdrawal, it's kinda like alcohol withdrawal.   Yeah, they use them in hospital when someone comes in having a seizure.    Does he realize that benzo withdrawal can induce, seizures and kill you? Medical negligence. You should taper, yes but have someone with you incase you do seize or worse, nearly die.    Even if it is rare, it still happens. Rare =/= never ever happens.    It requires dropping out of elementary.    And they should be reminded every day that they DID kill someone.    Those dispatchers should have been charged with some sort of murder or manslaughter and sentenced to a minimum 21 years.    It's a phenothiazine, basically an old style anti psychotic kinda related to thorazine in a way. There are a few (mainly old I believe) antipsychotics out there with anticholinergic effects. It isn't accepted as an antipsychotic anymore since it's pretty bad at being one but it does have those properties, mainly mildy blocking some serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors.  I remember taking it to get to sleep a few times and I would have audio hallucinations and feel really confused. Thank god it's not used as an anti psychotic anymore.    The comments on YouTube by those fucking trolls really piss me off. We should shoot this operator in the head and ask her a bunch of questions for 6 mins before getting her help.    I would wait for sure. LSD and Psilocybin act on serotonin, particularly 5-HT2A (which is a serotonin receptor).   Sexy.    Someone with severe anxiety or even just moderate anxiety and they take a benzo they'll definitely feel a "high" but the high will just be no anxiety. Maybe most people in our society feel pretty anxious and when they take benzos they have absolutely no anxiety and put it down as a "high"? Who knows.   	103
 After only reading the title, I came here to bitch about that story being cool but not funny... Then I saw the picture.   You won this round.      This, my friend, deserves an upvote!   Who are mostly Catholic that need to go to church... Do they kind of became 1st rudest again?   http://m.wikihow.com/Open-a-Wine-Bottle-Without-a-Corkscrew   I think you need to have given birth in order to have a IUD implanted. Not positive, though.    Excuse me... A human. I don't see how it is fair to take that HUMAN'S life. I have been in the "young and irresponsible pregnant girl" place. Now I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter. It isn't my place to have decided whether or not she got to develop from some cells into an actual baby. I wasn't ready to be a mother, but I figured it out.  Honestly, I had to grow up quickly... But I would never go back and change it. I will NEVER agree with abortion. Sorry if you don't agree with me.  That is the joy of being a human and not just a clump of developing cells that doesn't get a say in anything.   Rant done.    Yeah... What a weird hobby. Trying to save an innocent baby's life. SMH.   	8
                      Since it's a non profit support organization for the national parks system, I'm sure they would love to do it for everyone, but simply don't have the funds to do it for more than one grade level. I don't know why they chose 4th grade for sure, but it's an age when they kids are young enough to still love exploring, but old enough to also appreciate the wonder around them...it seems like a good age to target for their goals.   All the national park [annual passes](http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm) are remaining the same price -- this is by far the best deal for visiting national parks and by getting one, it encourages you to visit them more.            They have announced they will be giving away the free passes, but won't actually do it until the beginning of the school year. By signing up (no need for a donation), you'll get the notification when they begin giving them out.      Pinnicles is the newest US national park. You can learn more about the California Condor program [here](http://www.nps.gov/pinn/learn/nature/condors.htm)         As part of the Open OutDoors for Kids initiative, the National Parks Foundation wants to connect kids with the wonders of our national parks and the natural world through the Every Kid in a Park program. Open OutDoors for Kids believes national parks are the perfect place for kids to learn and self-discover the wonders of nature. As part of the initiative, they will be giving out a free national park pass to every child in the fourth grade for the 2015  2016 academic year, and will include entrance for the family of the 4th grader. The link will put you on the notification list to get the pass when they become available.

It used to be difficult to get to, but they have opened up a new walking path that makes it easy for anyone to get to it, and the result is that the glass is disappearing as people take it home. If you want to see this beach, you should make plans to get there asap. The glass beach likely won't be there in another 5 years.                        Thanking people for the work they do.   I started doing this about 2 years ago because of a friend. I noticed everywhere she went, she would thank people for the work they do. We'd walk into a fast food restaurant and some person would be mopping the floor, she would stop and thank the person for keeping the place clean and safe. Walking down the street and some guy holding up a caution sign, she would thank him for helping to keep people safe. When we would be out hiking, instead of just saying "hi" to the rangers we passed, she'd say "thank you for the job you do. It's greatly appreciated"  The vast majority of people work very hard at what they do and never get recognized for it. You'll be amazed at the surprise and the joy people have when you recognize their hard work. It's simple, doesn't cost anything and it will likely make someone's day.

What you do get is a consistently decent price if you usually pay retail at other stores. I think the main benefit of the free pass is to go and see if the membership makes sense for your situation. I don't think you're going to come away with huge savings.

They charge an additional 10% (except for excluded states) than member prices when using the one-day pass.

March 5 at 9:55pm  Dallas, TX  Edited    Assalamu Alaikum  Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:  I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night.   Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:  -Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago   - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males   - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*  - There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.  - They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.  - The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working. After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:  - They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.  - The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.  - They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.  In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.  Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.  "Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.

At 9 weeks (left), already established as the youngest swimmer in the world, Julie could swim for distances up to 10 feet as her grandmother walked closely behind (LIFE, Jan 18, 1954).  -  Today, an accomplished swimmer of 19 months, Julie has also become an underwater baby. In the outdoor pool on Hollywood Boulevard where her grandmother keeps toys resting on the bottom in the 4-foot depth, Julie submerges for as long as seven seconds and intently plays with everything from a tricycle (above) to a teet-totter.

During the Second World War in Eastern Europe, vinyl became an extremely expensive way of producing records. Therefore, during the 1930s and 40s, the lack of available materials caused both labels and individual music enthusiasts to search for new ways of production. Music became available on all types of wax and film, but most notably photographic film and x-ray plates. The plates were favored because of their thicker density.   Demand only grew in the USSR in the 1950s when records and tape recorders were in increasingly short supply and music was growing as a necessary escape from political tension. Young people in Eastern Europe realized that they could duplicate records using a converted phonograph and create an imprint of a record on discarded x-ray plates. Used x-ray plates could be purchased for next to nothing from hospitals and medical facilities once they were no longer needed. Then they could easily be cut into discs with scissors. Altered phonograph machines using wax disc cutters and machines like the voice-o-graph could produce grooves in the film that were nearly undetectable. Soviet society promoted science and technology and search of knowledge. It was often students who were studying engineering who would be the ones creating these records.

During the Second World War in Eastern Europe, vinyl became an extremely expensive way of producing records. Therefore, during the 1930s and 40s, the lack of available materials caused both labels and individual music enthusiasts to search for new ways of production. Music became available on all types of wax and film, but most notably photographic film and x-ray plates. The plates were favored because of their thicker density.   Demand only grew in the USSR in the 1950s when records and tape recorders were in increasingly short supply and music was growing as a necessary escape from political tension. Young people in Eastern Europe realized that they could duplicate records using a converted phonograph and create an imprint of a record on discarded x-ray plates. Used x-ray plates could be purchased for next to nothing from hospitals and medical facilities once they were no longer needed. Then they could easily be cut into discs with scissors. Altered phonograph machines using wax disc cutters and machines like the voice-o-graph could produce grooves in the film that were nearly undetectable. Soviet society promoted science and technology and search of knowledge. It was often students who were studying engineering who would be the ones creating these records.

Theres a Ukrainian singer called Pyotr Leshchenko  a Russian emigre who specialised in South American tango and gypsy music. After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately. You had popular Russian tunes that were classified as criminal songs, but they werent really. They were just regarded as low culture.

That's the product that will give you the most happiness for a price you can afford. If sales is done properly, everyone wins. You leave happy with your purchase and I earn commission. People who inflate prices artificially or lie about the performance of a product hurt the rep sales professionals everywhere.   I don't have to lie to you about a product. I just have to tell you that the one with the features you want is more expensive. You buy it or you don't. That's on you.

I smoked for about 12 years, smoking a pack a day at the end. I quit the day that my wife moved in. She wasn't going to put up with any shit and that made the decision to quit easy. There was no hiding it because she was living with me, and the temptation faded slowly. I still get the rare craving, but it's only for a minute and then it's gone.    I'm late to the conversation, but this is worth mentioning.   I was raised Catholic and went to church all my childhood, but after moving a couple of times I had pretty much stopped going to church by the time I became an adult and gradually lost a lot my beliefs over time.  Recently, my wife and I were planning to start attending church again since we now have a young daughter and we felt it was important that we raise her Catholic like we were. I went out and found a church for us.  At the new church I felt a connection with the deacon immediately. He was charismatic, energetic and "modern" for a church deacon.  He even baptized my daughter himself.  He was arrested on charges of distribution and PRODUCTION of child pornography mere months before she was enrolled in his Sunday school.  The thing that gets me the most is how comfortable I felt handing my child over that monster.  I'm done with the church now, not going back there or any other church.  	10
 That does suck. Maybe you should have looked for another college that would accept all the credits.    Lots of top schools offer scholarships. My daughter is starting this fall at a top private college for considerably less than she would pay at a local in-state school.    Because credit card companies factor in the default rate to their fees. If that were done with student loans interest rates would have to be higher to cover defaults.    the fact that /u/ekjp accepted to be a mod on Reddit has exponentially increased my respect for her   Go back and demand a jelly bean!

Also, is the pay similar for ATCs in all three facilities? (I would imagine the Tower is more difficult and therefore pays more, but I'm just guessing.)    What do you mean by "culturally" deaf? I've never heard that term before. Does it just mean "officially" deaf, or have some other specific meaning?    What do you consider an "international" school compared with a school that has an "international program" or department?    I live in Beijing and am familiar with that school. It's one of the best. Costs an arm and a leg though.    Actually they get the weekend off from public school. However, anyone who can afford it will send their kids to "after school" classes in the evenings and weekends. So the kids, especially middle school on up, but even many primary school students, are lucky if they get half a day off on the weekends. They also study from morning until night on week days. And if you think that these after-school classes are fun, extra-curricular stuff, think again. There might be a piano lesson in there, or swimming or tennis (if they're wealthy enough), but it's usually math and English.    +1 for shoes - not only a useful tool, but great for educational purposes (a good way to get kids started with Ruby)      Gnucash.

No, "m" with that accent means something close to "myself" (as in "he called me" = "me llam a m"). The translation to "my" (of poseession, like "my car") is "mi", without the accent on the i.

The safe option is to install a pirated copy of GTA V on another folder or hard drive, but spending 65GB more only for modding doesn't seem much of a solution.   The second line makes sense. He states first that x equals y. He then says that x times x equals x times y, which is correct given the first statement.    Let's assume x = 5. If x = y, and x = 5, then y = 5, so 5^2 equals 55, which is x^2 =xy   Think of the people that have Google fiber, 1gbps.

In 2012 new years eve a couple of friends, my gf and myself were walking home after a night out, at maybe 5-6am. They were like 15 or 20 of us. Out of the blue a car comes at 60ish MPH towards us, breaks and turns over repeatedly, hitting just with the tail one of my friends. Luckily it wasn't a serious injury (the car barely touched her) but it looked like it at the moment with all the commotion. We head towards the crashed car and got out the driver, who was a very drunk teenager. We called the cops and after they showed and took him, we got home. It was a very scary situation, we almost got killed and we returned as if nothing happened.   But I remembered hearing the name of that teen when police asked it to him. So I searched him in Facebook, in Twitter, anywhere I could find him, with no luck at all.   A few years later a friend and I were hanging in a bar near my home. Having a great night with some girls we met there, and one introduces us a group of friends of her. In that group was this guy. I remembered him very clearly, and when he said his name I said that yeah, I knew him, "you almost killed my friends me and my gf in new years eve". Man that was awkward, I don't know why I said it, it just came off me like that. He got very angry at first and after a lot of tension and discussion (he wanted to fight me, wtf) I told him we should drink a beer and talk privately. We did, and I said I didn't want to fight him, I just wanted to know if he was conscious about what he did that night, that he wasn't a murderer by the luck of a few inches.    He cried and told me he hasn't been able to drive a car since, that he remembers what happened that day everyday, and that he was very sorry for what happened. I just felt that he was being sincere, so after a while I told him that at least me forgave him, that it was all cool. It was a powerful moment, I felt so much anger when I looked at him at first, but then we talked and I don't know, it felt great to hear him say that and it helped me a lot to forgive him as well. I haven't heard from him since, but I hope he stays well and that he never drinks and drives again.  OK, not so much for a quick story haha so, tldr: guy almost kills me, friends and gf in a DUI car crash, casually met him years later, tells me how hard that experience hit him and how he hasn't been able to drive again (morally of course, laws in my country sucks, as my English so sorry for that).   I don't care what kind of moral crusade you're on, or how justified it is, it's just weird to talk like this to someone.  Moral crusade? Not at all. Maybe it'd be a moral crusade and a bit weird if someone called them out for no good reason out of the blue, but this person is talking about becoming an Uber driver... People should know that their driver killed (not injured, *killed*) another person while driving drunk.    Holly Molly.   He won inside the ring and outside it. That was what made him an artist.

 Thankfully the MC isn't your typical harem lead.  You'll see when it is adapted.   Domestic na Kanojo is by the same person as Good Ending.   I just started playing the game on Friday and today was the first time that someone interdicted me. What I don't get is that there wasn't anything on Comms and I was able to put full pips on ENG and boost away without any issues. They didn't even try to go after me... \\_()_/    I've been interested into getting a space sim game for a few years now. I backed Star Citizen back during the kickstarter but it has been a few years and not much to show for it. I tried EVE, but I felt as though it was too complicated and too far along for someone new to join, but I enjoyed playing it.  I've read a few reviews and watched a number of gameplay videos and I am wondering if it it worth getting.  In Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review, he likened it to a space Euro Truck Simulator and I enjoyed ETS2.     Even as a DPS, I've noticed stuff like ST and what not filling in ~5 minutes or less.   I can't wait until my WAR is high enough of a level to do dungeons with the so called insta-que.   The OP stated in the title that it wasn't on the scanalators website or on Batoto. They did as such before you posted the comment.   The part from the light novels is pretty lengthy but funny. Here is a snippet from volume 2 about it:   Ah, if it isnt a Starbucks! So there was one around here, thats great, its been a long time since I drank a latte!  Does it really look like a Starbucks? Thats a  Hm?...What?...Eh?  As they got progressively closer, Amis head became progressively tilted with suspicion. Certainly, the sign looked just like that of the North American coffee chain. The round shape, the green bordering, the somewhat indistinguishable humanoid image---  Th, this is  ---But that image was of the old man who owned the shop.  Sudou Coffee BarWe usually call it Sudoba   Another thing regarding Sudobucks but this time from volume 4:    "Welcome to Sudobucks" As the female college student workers voice resounded, a faint voice whispered within the shop. By the way, this place is Sudou Coffee Bar. There isnt a "bucks" anywhere in the name.    Don't ask me where to find it. Try searching online for it or something.   When I went it was Mahouka and Black Bullet. :(     [Yoake Mae Yori Ruriiro Na](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1543/Yoake_Mae_yori_Ruriiro_na:_Crescent_Love) is special to me because while it was cliche, the series goes farther than most romance comedy anime out there.   If they do decide to disable abilities I hope they keep Bard's swift song. It allows me to get around faster.   It is taking the [tsundere trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere) and applying it to sharks.  The best example of tsundere for people who haven't seen anime would be Helga from "*Hey Arnold!*".   He/She has done some stuff in /r/anime before as well.   As a heads up, you are requesting not suggesting an anime.   Suggesting on here is, basically, the same as /r/manga's "Read This!" or /r/anime's "Watch This!" tag.  I have changed your tag and approved your post.  ---  On another, note you might want to look at either getting an account on an anime tracking website such as MyAnimeList (MAL) or Hummingbird. This will help people see what you have already seen and scored and give you shows to watch accordingly.   Yeah, for that matter we tend to get the chapter before Japan due to leaks.   WARNING: While it is marked appropriately, the above spoilers are for the latest manga chapter.   Nope, I managed to get a Raspberry Pi 2 for $37 with a case.  [Amazon Order Page](https://i.imgur.com/zQxdsFg.png) - (Personal information has been censored)  Actual Product: [Box and Pi](https://i.imgur.com/26RVsaN.jpg), [Closeup of the board](https://i.imgur.com/a9R1puk.jpg)  I'd link to the page, but I guess the realized they could get more money if they made it into a kit.   I was able to get both an RPi 2 and a clear case for $37 with prime shipping about a week ago. The price quickly went up from that to $48 which isn't too bad since it included a case.   [](#lewd)   I love arcades, but sadly there isn't anything nearby for me and the last one closed about six or seven years ago.   ---  I had the opportunity to go to Japan last May and they arcades there were thriving and a lot of fun. I played a lot of Groove Coaster since it was a fairly easy to learn rhythm game coming from *Osu!* and it had multiplayer. Not only that but it was three songs for 100 and if you failed, it didn't kick you off/out like IIDX. I miss the SEGA and Taito Game Stations that I played at. The only thing I'd change about it would be to ban smoking, but smoking is pretty prevalent over there.   Like the others said I'd suggest that you get a MAL account or some other anime tracking website. It makes it a lot easier for people to recommend stuff.  ---  Make sure you remember to flair your posts accordingly! You didn't have one, so I went ahead and added it for you. Please remember to do so in the future. (Otherwise AutoModerator will remove it after an hour.)   [](#lewd)   Nope, that is yandere.   Yep, you can.  For the OS you'd want to use Raspian.  The office suite should be LibreOffice which can use and save as word/powerpoint/excel documents and such.  For a web browser you might want to use Chromium. (Unless someone has a better option)  ---  My concern is that your school's internet will block the Pi(s) and you won't be able to login into your network drive/space.   Not only that but you would have to set it up so that everyone has a login and someone would have to manage the permissions.   Check Amazon every so often. I found a listing for the Pi2 and a clear case for $37 with Prime shipping. I'd share it, but they increased the price to $48. (Which isn't too bad since it includes a case, which runs about $8-10)   I would figure that MLB.TV would HTML5 or something like that. I have never used it before so I have no idea.   The best bet would be to get:  * Raspberry Pi 2 ($35)  * HDMI Cable ($4-6 on Monoprice)  * Private Internet Access VPN (I've found that it works really reliably) $40 a year. They also have a [setup guide for a number of OS's including linux](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/).  * Micro-Sd Card ($8-12 since you'd only need an 8gb one)  * Power Adapter (An old USB Charger might do the trick)  * USB Keyboard ($15-30)  * USB Mouse ($10-30)  * MLB.tv subscription ($129.99 a year)  Setup costs: ~$260 (Includes both of the subscriptions)  Yearly after that: $170 (The two subscriptions)   Ignore the other guy. While I haven't read Re:Monster, I am thankful that you guys have been working on a number of light novels for people to read.   Hopefully one of the mods removed it since I reported it for plagarism.   I love how you completely, word for word, [copied my post from 8 months ago for the "How can I earn money on Rumble?" section](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/27sw0l/introducing_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/) rather than type up your own version of it.   [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/hQ5mqMH.png) for when/if OP changes it.   Considering that I hadn't seen a '-' in an username before, I'm sorry. I'll edit it accordingly.   At least you got the username right... I got my head bitten off since I didn't see the '-' before his name because of the custom flair.   If you look, it is the mods of /r/anime adding stuff to people's usernames. His username is only /u/-Niernen  EDIT: Make sure you remember the '-'. The + version gets upset if you get it wrong.   I would suggest that you reread this after the first season. You think it is good now, wait until then.  OP got the characters' traits, personalities and behaviors down to a "t".   That is why you leave your web browser up with something on it such as Reddit or Facebook.    That would take 288.461 years to complete.   Tip for anyone who watches anime on their computer using Media Player Classic, press "b" instead of pausing and it will instantly pause and minimize your video.   It isn't worth it to get it onAmazon since The Pi Hut jacked the price up $10...  I should have jumped on it when I saw it...   Heck, the new Rasoberry Pi has 1gb of ram on it and a quad core 1ghz processor.   They shouldn't since only some states have online sales tax laws and even then, most of the time, it only applies if they are selling/shipping from the state you are in.   I was looking at getting one from them as well. Price wise, it is $5 more than getting it from MCM/Element14 since E14's shipping is $9.99 and you don't have to wait as long.   The first 25-ish chapters have a lot of fan service and that is due to the publisher asking the author for something similar to his previous work, *Love Hina*. He wanted to make an action manga and he had to transition it from the harem-y series.   After that it is a great read and it is even better when you re-read it and realize all of the foreshadowing and hints that start from the very first chapter.   Don't craft, do leves. Around 25 I was doing the cornmeal leve like crazy. You can buy cornmeal from the Whistling Miller in New Gridania.   There was a vita release in Japan. Sekai Project is back porting the vita version to the PC since the Vita version doesn't have the 18+ content.   Grisaia already has a Vita release. Heck, the Pc version they are bringing over is a port of the Vita version.   Lancer always has the worst luck.   A trip to Japan. $3600 for two weeks including airfare, transportation, room and some meals. It was a lot of fun and I made a lot of good memories while I was there. I'd like to go back at some point of time and explore outside of Tokyo to see the countryside and other cities such as Kyoto.   As a heads up, bots aren't allowed on /r/anime unless they are approved by the moderators.   They are, effectively, banning their rc planes from flying within a 15.677 mile radius of the White House.  Area of a circle is "pi*radius^2" and 1 Km is 0.621 miles.  (sqrt(2000/pi))*0.621= 15.677 mile radius   Part of the reason why there is a difference between the screaming voices is that it is really easy for English speakers to pollute their vowels when sustaining a word.   In Japanese they only have a single vowel sound for each vowel and as such it is a lot harder for the vowel to be polluted.  For an example of a polluted vowel, try singing anything that ends in -ing and try to hold the -ing. It gets polluted. With the word "trying" try singing it as "tryic" and hold the "i" vowel then add -ng at the lat moment.  Source: I am in choir and we have to deal with this sort of thing.    Manga Rock censors certain titles if you are in the US, partially due to Viz but also for content for whatever reason.   How about installing an ad blocker?   I haven't heard of those sites, but if you want to do surveys and actually get paid mTurk would be your best bet. I've made ~$1000 over the past three years of off and on work.  It is owned and run by Amazon and you get paid through Amazon Payments which you can either deposit or use to get an Amazon Gift Card.   I sort of miss Hayate's antics but I wonder how Ell will enter the harem considering she is a robot, yet alone one made by that professor.   One nice thing is that all of these characters are under the Dengeki Bunko brand. Dengeki is a light novel publisher. (Light novels are basically young adult fiction titles that have an occasional illustration setting the scene or mood at the time.)   From what little I have played of the arcade version, there is slight conversation scenes before the fights but I have no idea if they add a story mode in the console release.  Source: I played three games of it while I was in Japan back in May of 2014.   It was early because the 1.00 FW of the PSP allowed anyone to run code on it. (They blocked it in 1.5, but since people could already see what and how the system worked, it didn't take too long to get hacked again.)   While it isn't the vita, I opened my 3DS in Akihabara and got about forty to fifty streetpasses at once.  Portable gaming is a big thing over there.   Thanks for that, I'll have them send it again to a different email.   How long does it usually take for the recruit a friend email to be sent? I had a friend send their code through the form last night and I have yet to get it. :(   They make machines that generate white noise. The machines will be louder and cost a lot less to run overnight. I own one since I live in a dorm and the people nearby are loud and I live right outside one of the common areas. It has helped me sleep soundly on a number of occasions.  Make sure you get one that has an actual fan rather than being a speaker otherwise you might pick up on the patterns in the audio which will annoy you more than help you.   Please read the Spice and Wolf light novels. :D   I would relist and sell them. (Unless you need the mats)   Share button works for screenshots on the PS4.   I was in Japan for two weeks and no one else from my group was around to go eat and it was after most places had closed. (8pm!) I walked down a nearby street to find somewhere to eat and tried/worked it out so I could oder some food and I ate alone.   Either that or the time when no one else around so I walked to Akihabara by myself to explore. I, barely, knew the language but thankfully I didn't have to speak to anyone.   Something something thank you for the suggestion.   Have you seen Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope)? They used rotoscoping for when the characters were playing music and it meshed really well.   Not really, but with enough cat videos on YouTube or NicoNico, they will be able to find the one close to what they want.   Actually, it wouldn't be too hard to do. They would just have to rotoscope a video of a cat walking for the realistic one and then animated it normally for the, well, animated cat.   There is also Eriri's use of alpha and bravo last episode.   It isn't entirely a 4-koma. There are parts where it is like a normal manga.   If you had read the article, this is now of the English version of the game. Japan had the crossover back in November.   It is an anime based off of the Disgaea games. The Prinnys are, basically, the lowest level monster/enemy/ally in the game and get a lot of crap for it. Heck, if you throw them in the game they explode!   There are two Final Fantasy MMO's, FFXI and FFXIV. XI has been around for over 13 years and XIV is the newer of the bunch.   I've only played XIV, but I really really like it. (There is a free trial as well so if you want to try it before you buy you can)   I've been leveling a cul and what I have been doing is finding certain items that do not have a listing on the market and put stuff up for sale at a much higher price. I've been able to sell a low-ish level dish for 1250 gil a piece and the mats run ~200 per and if I HQ it can sell up to 1750 for the same item.  You can take this idea and use it with the other crafting jobs/classes. You might want too look at making and selling housing items as people always need furniture.   I think shard prices will go up a bit due to the one method, other than mining/grinding them, getting fixed.   For those you wondering, you had to:   1. Accept a triple turn-in leve that had a shard (or other reward bonus) 2. Turn in twice for the rewards 3. Abandon 4. Get the same leve again. (It used to keep the rewards as they were. If you were getting 48 fire shards per turn in, you could always get 48 fire shards per turn in as long as you did the above method)   I've love to win. It would help pay for my studies as I found out I have to go an extra year.   If you search on Bing for (30-90 searches which depends on the account and "status") while logged into an account, you accumulate points (15-30 per day depending on the account's status). After 450 points, when your account is "gold" you can get a $5 Amazon gift card.  It takes ~2-3 weeks to get enough points to get one, but you can have up to five accounts per household.   I use bing for the rewards. (Helps pay for my subscription too)   I haven't read the LNs, but my guess is that the transfer student is the girl from the first episode that Tor beat.   Just wish to go to Ezorzea in FFXIV after they add the gold saucer in update 2.51!   Zalarea is small in terms in population and there are some guilds (Free Companies) to watch out for such as Evil, but overall I've liked it and I've started to notice the same people while traveling around.   What server are you on? If you are Zalarea, shoot me a PM and I can introduce you to a really good FC that likes to help people out. (Heck, they've basically been there for me every dungeon that I have had to do. They've also helped me with gear and what not.) The people are really nice and they won't go after you for DPS issues or even getting aggro'd if you are a DPS.   I'd love to get that Key magazine/poster/art-book.  (It is in the left-most box and you can see "Key" on it)   Get triple turn in leve - Turn in two times - "Do it later" - Abandon - Rinse and repeat.   Try looking for turn-ins that you can buy from NPCs such as cornmeal if you are leveling CUL.   The best one I found was the level 30 Cornmeal leve in Limsa Lominsa. Go and buy cornmeal from the Whistling Miller in Old Gridania. Cornmeal is 51 gil x 6 per turn in and I was getting 48 shards per.   On my server, fire shards go for 120-150 gil each. (Basically, the profit is about 5450 gil per turn in.) (I did ~40 levequests, which brought me from level 29 CUL to level 37 CUL and I got ~4200 shards from it all)   Sadly it is 300000 gil...   At least it isn't [DRR!](http://archive.uboachan.net/yn/src/1249719241125.jpg) (WARNING: Image is from *The Enigma of Amigara Fault*. It is creepy)   I did this a few times with my emerald/topaz carbuncle to make quests easier.  Another thing I did was just the rouge's hide ability to skip a large chunk of the level 10 quest rather than fighting.   Thank you for reminding people to use the appropriate flair!   Like /u/semajdraehs said, you had the wrong flair. You are **request**ing a show, not giving a show (**suggest**ing for people to watch.)  I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair correctly in the future.   No problem!   This is how I notice it at a glance since I have forgotten what little I learned from two semesters of it:  Hiaragana () - Curvy simple characters  Katakana () - Straight simple characters  Kanji () - (More) Complex characters   For those of us who use feet and inches, she is 6ft 1in.   Argh,  isn't kanji but katakana.      I'm new to subscription MMOs and MMOs in general.   What happens to our subscriptions when/if the servers are down for an extended period of time? Does SQ not deduct a day or are we just out of luck for that day of the subscription?   Yep, getting 2002 error. :(   If that is the case you ought to read the light novels. The novels have been published in English up to, I think, volume 12.  The first season covers volumes 1 and 2. The second season covers volumes 3 and 5.   Well, I'll change that...  Wait... That is what you want us to think...   What server are you on?   On the server that I am on, Zalarea, the FC that I am in, Heart, likes to help new players go through the content without rushing. Case in point, I am really new and they either ask around through the linkshell or their friends if they would be interested in running ____ dungeon with me.  I felt bad last night when I tried the daily roulette, we had a tank that was in level 50 gear and was running ahead but there was a new player. I felt bad that half the members of the party were speedrunning it and forgoing the experience and story that the new player was missing.   It doesn't even air in Japan until the 23rd so this is pretty early by Crunchyroll standards.   "Request" is the wrong flair for this, "Identification X" fits what you are asking better. I have changed it as such, but please remember to flair accordingly in the future.   As a heads up you'll want to flair this with the "Question" flair for this sort of question in the future. I have done as such for you this time, but please remember to flair your posts accordingly from here on out.   I know a guy that is really into Razer stuff. I'm trying to get him to use better headphones but no, if Razer releases it he has to buy it.  I don't get people some days...   If you are in the US and you are 18 or older, you ought to sign up for Mturk.   It is run by Amazon and you can get Amazon Gift Cards by buying it through what you earn from Mturk.   Personally, I've made about $1000 over three years of off and on work. There are times where I'll forget about it for spans of 3-4 months as college gets busy and I have to focus on that.  ---  Some information from the sticky:  **[Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com)** [US ~AND CANADA~]  This site is a bit different from your typical beer money site. This is a bit more professional. You work for "requesters" and they approve or reject your submitted content called "hits." Many people here think this great and it often gets them more money than other sites. They do require more personal info from you than the sites above for tax reasons (even though you likely won't have to worry about it) and not everyone gets approved to work here.   gt;   Age minimum: 18   gt; Offers: Different tasks requesters want you to do for money   gt; Payout: Amazon Payments balance or bank account   gt; Referral Incentive: None   gt; TIPS   gt;  Dont use mturk without having [turkopticon](http://microwork-dev.ucsd.edu/) installed. Its a browser add-on that allows workers to post reviews about requesters and gives you a good idea of whether or not to attempt a HIT based on the requesters reputation.   gt;  Only do hits that pay at least 10/minute. Mturk grind forum and /r/hitsworthturkingfor are good places to check for worthy hits.   gt;  It is better to return a hit (it will not negatively impact you) than submit if you are unsure whether the requester will approve it.   [This](http://yokohama-theatre.com/en/component/comprofiler/userprofile/graigrussell) could very well be him. (It links to the Yokohama Theatre Group) I didn't find anything on MAL so this might be his first anime related work.   Yeah, that was really good English coming from the commentator in the beginning. Heck, they might have brought in a native speaker for it. Someone might want to check the credits to see who did the voice over for it.   I, personally, liked the anime but I have heard that Alicia is made to be more of a "[tsundere](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere)" than she was in the game. (TV Tropes warning)  They also kept the watercolor/colored pencil look of the game which is pretty interesting.  I'd say that if you like the game it might be a good idea to, at least, try the anime.   You might want to give some information and/or constructive thought rather than just linking to the MyAnimeList page for it.     You can always change the flair by going on your web browser, even on your phone, and doing it like you would on a PC.  I have changed it as such, but please remember to select accordingly in the future.   This is a TV special, which is an OVA, and they tend to be fairly fan service heavy in order to have people watch/buy it.  My guess is that the main show will have a lot less fan service than this.   Best tip for this one is to figure out how to get airborne and then stay near the track. I made it down once but I had no idea where to go... :(   You can also use 7-zip, which is freeware, to un-rar a rar file!  On a related note, thanks for doing this!   thatsthejoke.jpg   What is funny though is that while they are having fan service, the characters are discussing the merits of said fan service. The entire thing, out of what I have watched of the episode, seems to be highly self-referential and sort of meta.   I would contact Amazon as that isn't acceptable. You paid for the 650 so you should be getting the 650.   I think it is a cultural thing. Case in point, while I was in Japan I went to Mandarake, which is a used anime/manga/cd/goods store and bought stuff that seemed new. Heck, I opened the Clannad OST and it had all of the original inserts and the only issue is that the box that holds the case for the trifold cd case is losing its adhesiveness which is something I attribute to it being 11 years old. The same thing for the Little Busters OST I got but there weren't any flaws. For that matter, it might was well have been new.  One of the professors I was with on the trip said that since there is the belief in the culture that everything has a spirit that it is to be treated with utmost care and this permeates their way of life.   You might want to look at the FiiO X1 or even the Sansa Clip. Both can play a lot more formats than the stock iPod Classic and you can even add more storage, up to 128 GB, through the use of a Micro SD card.  As a heads up, if you get the Sansa Clip, look into installing [Rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org) on it as it will allow a lot more formats and such.   That scene was in Angel Beats.    Not OP, but I have been to the Tokyo Anime Center before. Admittance is free and you are allowed to take photos but the use of flash is discouraged as it can fade the sketches and such.   I am fairly new, but this is my mentality:  * Need - When you know you need it for the current class or one that you are working on.  * Greed- When I'd really like said item.  * Pass - When I have no use for the item. I also do this once I get an item in the dungeon as someone else could use the loot.

Otherwise it looks like it's gonna be "Godzilla 1998 on an island"   So does joining the Kyubey familia mean you have to become a magical adventurer girl?   "/r/marijuanaenthusiasts thinks he's *so* funny for trading names with /r/trees"   "Finish him!"  "What are you talking abou- let go of my head!"  "Craig wins! Fatality!"   "Moses saw the burning bush, and knew what he had to do"   "It's a grim day, as television writer Stephen Moffat becomes the first person since 1964 to be executed in the United Kingdom"   Go beyond the impossible and kick reason to the curb!   Speak for yourself. *I* was the guy who got stabbed from behind *on*screen when they opened the gates.    Is It Wrong to try to Pick Up Magical Girls In a Dungeon?   When you hit someone with their own projectile (especially Villager's felled tree) using Rosalina's Gravity. They never see it coming.    I've been playing Mewtwo nonstop since Wednesday. I've landed the Dair like five times, and I got a Falcon-knee-level boner every single time.    "Why would I *not* be eating the Meow Mix? Is this not what this is?"      [This is all I could find in like five minutes on Google](https://creativeoverkill.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mp3.png)  [another picture of the same figure (nsfw)](http://scalemodels.ru/images/2010/12/1292708411_fg5600_misato_in_plugsuit_4.jpg)   Clearly she takes more after Misato in this than after EVA-02.    Whenever I get in a vehicle, the camera drifts to about 4:00 and I can't see forward when I'm not moving my mouse. My copy is a physical one from the "Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy" box set running on Windows 7.    "He has no style, he has no grace. This Kong has a funny face."   Ducktales!   The theory that I accept the most is that humans are actually the only species aware of type match ups. Because of this, Pokemon will ally themselves with a human to better their own chances of survival.    ...I'll allow it.    Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is somewhat similar, though it's a straight-up comedy, less than it is an action show. It's pretty similar in that it's also a sexualized parody of Magical Girl shows. iirc, the soundtracks are also done by the same person.   Also, it's not really an anime, but Bayonetta is kinda similar. You might want to try out watching/playing that.    [I am so, so sorry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1704614/)   Titanic 2: Everyone actually survived because of WHALES!   That expanded my dong   "I have a cream..."   I can't imagine they will. It seems to refer to Mewtwo's status as a "legendary" Pokemon.    "I've gotta get out of here before the cops show up"   *sees a head popping out*  "GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!"   "I'm sorry sir, but the test results came back. Yo momma so fat she only got two weeks to live"   "What are you gonna do, stab me?"   365 fucking pictures?! How much of this show is plot?   Gurren Lagann is gonna be up against Evangelion next round. God damnit, how the hell am I gonna choose?   Because people with shit taste don't understand character dramas.    Episode 4 was the one with the weird animation that introduced the Black siblings. You're thinking of episode *6*.   And that was the joke. All the changes I listed were made in Lagann-Hen.    Gurren Lagann:  -remove that one episode where all the pointless side characters died to fill some space. (Not Kittan obviously since he was important, but everyone else)  -episode 4. Fuck.   -shorten the "serious" arc where they were on Earth post-time skip  -maybe extend the final fight by like 7 minutes  -add a giant new form of TTGL made out of Kamina's soul  -give Yoko a Tengen Toppa Titty Tank  -maybe make it into two movies   Phoenix Wright objects to the fight!   Everything I can, except Smash Bros because I have the GameCube controller.    Dankest Eva meme 2k15   I think that it's probably the coolest of all the forms of Gurren Lagann, but I can't find any related merch. Am I just looking in the wrong places?   Isn't that kind of the plot of every haunting movie?   I'm not an expert on the Mandarin, but from the thread it doesn't seem like a full-powered Bayonetta would have too much with him. At her full power, she took down both the god of her universe (or at least, its presumed creator) and the man who was nigh-omnipotent by stealing the full power of several gods. The only thing Mandarin can do to harm her is going to be the matter manipulation, which Bayonetta has overcome before with Jubileus and Aesir. The speedblitz could be an issue, making Witch Time a bit less effective, but in the Balder fights in Bayonetta 2 she's already proven that she can fight enemies much faster than her.   Bayonetta wins.    Putin solos the whole planet as the communist pugilist.    NORMIES GET OUT  RRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE   tennouttaten. hundred outta hundred. Best anime. **Best anime**   Bayonetta vs... I don't know, actually. Galactus maybe, considering what became of Jubileus.    I dropped the baby penguin off the cliff after his mother gave me the star, which ultimately led to his death.    I dropped the baby penguin off the cliff after the mom gave me the star.    Kaworu as a Jesus figure always impressed me, because up until I realized that I always thought the show just used its Christian imagery in part for shock value, without very much subtlety. It was then that I realized the show is much more clever than I initially thought with its religious references.    Wiggle your big toe...  Wiggle your big toe...   Remember that these are real humans as opposed to the impossibly optimistic and masculine Simon and Kamina.    They seem like they'd be pretty cheap and easy to make, but I've never really done anything like that, so I have no idea where to start.   If I were to make a pair, my main concern is how I attach it to my face. It just seems to be a shape carved from some tinted plastic, with nothing to rest on except the bridge of my nose. And speaking of tinted plastic, what's the cheapest/best material to make it out of?   If I buy a pair, then where do I buy from?   That's not how that works.    I would really like it if they released volumes 12-14 as one big "End of Evangelion" Omnibus, considering they are the volumes that correspond to the movie.    Don't you fucking dare.    Finish A Space Godzilla.    Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla 2   Maybe Kobe's finally started speaking.    Not just unsupported. It's *actively disproven* in Evangelion.       I'm Oedipus-kin and this offends me, you motherfucker.    Yeah that's it. Not the fact that he's like 7.       Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, Panty and Stocking, does this guy even *try*?   Madoka Magica is very similar to Evangelion, while still being different enough to be enjoyable.   Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't exactly an anime, but it's the classic sci-fi mindfuck and Evangelion does reference it a lot.      Global strikes again!   Perhaps Mari will reveal the truths she knows and those will end up motivating him, making Mari not fucking worthless?   Well, time to preorder   What ain't no country I ever heard of   Evangelion already exists though   As long as she doesn't swear during her combos (and honestly, her shouting "fuck off" during a combo was kind of out-of-character anyway) she'll probably be fine for the game, considering Palutena has a pole dancing taunt.    Not only that, but African Elephants exist in the Pokemon universe as well. They're mentioned in one of Gastly's pokedex entries.    Excuse...   I think Cosplay Pikachu should actually be a clone of Pikachu who can transform between the five costumes, similarly to Shulk.          "Y=X^2"  "I got you fam"   implying King hippie is a bad thing.    I thought the shit was meant to go in the toilet.    My favorite character is Bayonetta. I have Counter Vibration, Wing Blades, and invulnerability.   Thing is, my invulnerability will mean that I get a good ninety or so years to fight Bayonetta. I'm to weak to ever hope to do any damage to her, unless I was able to become a witch/lumen sage, in which case I'd eventually be able to wear her down enough to beat her. Knowing Bayonetta, there's a good chance she'd just get bored and leave before I was able to wear her down.       [So, Ash Williams vs John Mcclane](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/276/9/b/death_battle_idea_81__ash_williams_vs_john_mcclane_by_777jaylee777-d6p1b2n.jpg)  I've only ever seen the first Die Hard, and from what I can tell John Mcclane is a relatively realistic protagonist. His feats aren't as over-the-top as, say, winning a war against an army of Candadian Demons led by your evil skeleton twin. Ash stomps every day of the week.    I think the generally accepted explanation is that when party members "die" in battle, they really just pass out. Then when everyone passes out, they actually end up dying. A Pheonix Down therefore couldn't save Aeris because she wasn't injured in a way where she could come back.    Arceus also loses its omnipotence.    You stay away from my Skitty.    Celestia's in her Canterlot, all's right with Equestria   Steph doesn't even make it to round 1, because he's already dead.    I've got a Lance of Longinus necklace.    Nobody screws Yamcha but life.    http://imgur.com/gallery/c7NJRa2   Bayonetta pls   From there we have two options: either Jake and Amir, and subsequently the subreddit, fall into obscurity and we all move on, OR we are promised more Jake and Amir (either renew the webseries or TV show confirmation) and we go the route of /r/rickandmorty until then. Though if it *is* the latter, not much will really change, will it?   I'd like to nominate Terminator 3 as a sequel to T2. It's not just that it's a bad movie from a different director with a poor premise. It's that its very existence undermines the story and themes of T2. 2 was a movie about defying fate and forging your own path to the future, the success of which was unique for what is, at its most basic level, a prophecy movie. T3 tore down the accomplishments of Sarah Connor to nothing more than a setback for fate. After watching T3, I could barely even enjoy T2 again, knowing that their struggle in that movie was ultimately pointless.   So a sequel that actively ruined the original, that's why I think Terminator 3 is the worst.    Does anyone know if the Yarn Yoshi will be compatible with Smash Bros?   I had a theory that Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are two sides of the same story. [I posted it here a while back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2xfjsz/evangelion_and_gurren_lagann_tell_the_same_story/)   How about a clone, who changes outfits kinda like Samus in Brawl?

I agree somewhat. Beauty has no weight limit, as long as it's proportional to their height. I'd be fine with a 300 pound girl as long as she's 8 foot 6.    I really liked the anime and movie (though they did remind me of Evangelion quite a bit) and I was wondering whether I should pick up the manga. Like Evangelion, it seems the manga has some subtle differences that might make it worth reading. Should I bother?   The End of Evangelion, because it is literally the ending to the TV series. It was what they intended before they ran out of money. It also happens to be one of the greatest films ever made in my own opinion, so absolutely check that out.   After you clean your brains off of the wall behind you, you may want to move on to the Rebuild saga. 1.11 is a remake of the episodes until the fifth angel, 2.22 deviates into its own story, and 3.33 is completely different.    I though it was the one from Cabin in the Woods.    It's as much Shoujo as Evangelion is Shonen.    "What happened to real music like Kanye? Now all we have is [human music!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTVUlbP40tI) What happened?"   "Sir, the rover has sent pictures of a carving on Mars! And they seem to be in English!"  "What does it say?"  "*Lex Luthor is a faggot*"   "What was the safeword again?"   (F): smack a bitch up  *Clementine will remember that*   "Oh man, I had the craziest day. One of our patients came started turning green and decomposing, and started clawing at us...  ...so we put the infected patient in quarantine and no one else was infected. Zombie problem solved."   "Hey guys, you know what my favorite Schwarzenegger film is?"   "Yo mama so stupid she asks Professor Oak if he's a boy or a girl"   "And for our next conference... bills from a hat!"   "I thought Pacific Rim was gonna be a *way* different movie when I picked it up"   "Let it go!"   Papa Franku would be disappointed.    No, that's the part that allows you to float in water. Just look at metal, which is 0% Jesus. Just sinks to the bottom.    Don't lose your way during your Escape From the City.    Can you draw Braivary beating down some nazis?   "Danny-senpai! It's not like I *want* to see your erection... baka!"   best girl  not octahedron tiddies   I prefer the Same Picture of Sailor Moon every day.    The meme was dank   We all know that in order to beat Spiral Power on the level of STTGL, you'd need to be no one short of Revelation Jesus. But is there anyone on the other end who can defeat STTGL by flying under the radar for long enough to take out the pilots?  From what I can gather, Simon is the only pilot that matters, and everyone else is basically just a Spiral Power generator. This would mean that anyone who can take out Boota, Yoko, or any of the insignificant side characters, can cripple it at least back to TTGL. But who's the strongest who's weak enough to take STTGL all the way back to five-meter mode?   Me so fucked up...   I didn't see that. Yeah, Mewtwo just has too much to deal with in a horde battle.    Didn't Ash become homies with God himself during one of the movies?  Regardless, I'm actually going to say no. Ash has had a lot of powerful friends (just about *every* pokemon that wasn't available except by events, what a coincidence!) but he has very little battle skill, next to no knowledge of matchups (he seems to bank on Spiral Power rather than strategy). Even if Ash had all this, Mewtwo is insane during his time under Giovanni. Ash has no chance in a one-on-one, regulation Pokemon battle. Mewtwo is the closest thing Kanto has to a demigod, and no single pokemon could hope to take him down. Maybe if Ash has them all in a row and gradually wears Mewtwo down, but it isn't very likely.    Do you have a talent for causing things pain?   Route 209 is my absolute favorite. A lot of the special battle songs in Sinnoh (Vs Dialga/Palkia, vs champion, etc) as well. Pretty much just the entire DPPt soundtrack.    I'll tackle them one at a time:  O-Ren: Without the Crazy 88s to wear down the Bride, she's going to have the upper hand. That isn't to say this battle will be easy for either of them, but it'll be easier for the Bride than the original battle since she won't fall down as much. The battle ends when the Bride disarms O-Ren and takes advantage of that oppurtunity.  Vernita: We only really know of Vernita as being on par with the Bride when they both wield knives. As her weapon of choice seems to be a butcher knife, she probably won't pose much of a problem against a knife-wielding Bride. Whenever she tries to parry with her knife(ves?), there's a good chance she'll just miss the parry completely and get slashed up.   Elle Driver: This may be the most even battle. Both are nearly equal in sword fighting ability. If anything, Elle is actually more skilled than the Bride. But she wants so badly to utterly annihilate the Bride in the field of battle. She doesn't know when to hold back as opposed to going for a kill, which will ultimately be her downfall. She'll lose her other eye (again) at which point the Bride finishes her off.   Budd: Fuck if I know. He had to resort to using ambush and we never actually got to see him fight. If he had, there's a good chance a dude with a shotgun can take out a woman with a sword. But, with her acrobatic ability, there's a good chance she'll be able to disarm Budd, which will cause his immediate defeat.   And finally, Snake Charmer himself. He is apparently even better than the Bride with a Hanzo sword (though he decided that their duel wouldn't be very fruitful for either party). By this point, the Bride will have been worn down by her other opponents. That being said, she'll fight even harder than ever before. The fight ends similarly to how it ends in the movie, with the one attack Bill couldn't foresee: the five-point-palm exploding heart technique. He has a monologue and walks his five steps, defeated.    At the same time, or can I just write "What happened in the movie"?   The Bride (Kill Bill)   I have a boner!   It's an angeru!   I know that 1996/97 were still pretty early for anime films to be integrating digital effects, like Ghost in the Shell.    Now kiss   You only needed one shot with the help of One Take Jake?   Context is oppressive, shitlord!   You're all missing the bigger picture. Sure, he can snort the rock, but he can also break it up into manageable bits that will be so small they just burn up in the atmosphere.    Not enough gang rape 0/10   I think the original/Rebuild voice cast works well. Having had two decades since they last did NGE, and also have done Rebuild, the dodgy voice acting might be a bit more smoothed out and everyone will be on the level of Tiffany Grant in NGE   The only Godzilla-related things my library has are a couple copies of the Marvel comic. I envy you so much.    Season 2 of Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. The series ended with a plot twist and a promise for a second season. We haven't seen anything PSG related since then.    I need my favorite fire-breathing turtle to replace my second favorite fire-breathing turtle.    Baragon and Varan, of course! The underappreciated vs the world!   [way too lewd](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/778/437/446.png)   Get back to me when you can play an N64 game in a Windows virtual machine in 4k60fps with a power glove and a DDR mat.    Christ man learn to use imgur   However, Godzilla wouldn't have a strong enough AT field to manipulate, considering he would be Lilim. His AT field is just strong enough to keep him as an individual and not a couple hundred gallons of LCL.    Gurren Lagann is only a few stories tall. Godzilla would thoroughly wreck him, no spiral power needed. Arc-Gurren Lagann is significantly larger than Godzilla, making for another pretty unfair fight.    GMK has a lot of weirdness, especially considering that Godzilla isn't even really Godzilla, it's a collection of souls in the form of Godzilla.    You can't spell ignorant without IGN.    I've got that same one sitting on my bookshelf right now. I haven't had the heart to open it yet, though.    The Evangelion series, except maybe Unit-00. They all have the AT-field, which makes up for their physical weakness against the big G.    By Word of God, Godzilla is actually a class VI kaiju.    Counting babies (which we do, because they are still the same creature) Mothra has never lost to Godzilla.    They overlap way too often.    Because while Germany wants to eradicate the hateful nature of its past governments, America values freedom of speech as well as democracy. The government can only do what the people want them to do (in theory). Because we have a constitutional democracy, America never has and likely never will fall into a genocidal totalitarian regime. Germany, on the other hand, realizes that the Nazi administration was just about the evilest thing they could do and has gone out of their way to stop it from happening again.     Weeaboos are the worst kind of person.   	165
 Good for you.  Try making enough fries for 265 people within a 1 hour time frame at sea on a Destroyer that is rocking back and forth.   If this were presented to me back in culinary school, as in, here is some oranges, make a soup I would have done this.  Segmented one orange into perfect skinless segments.  Set aside.  Juice two oranges and strain.  Add orange juice to equal amounts plain yogurt.  To that add a flavor packet of fresh ground coriander, 1 clove, 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, 1 tsp tahini  and 1/2 tsp finely ground red pepper flakes.   Place 3 or 5 segmented oranges in a shallow soup bowl.  Pour the orange mixture (cold or heated) over the segments but don't completely cover.  Garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and some cilantro leaves.  Sprinkle some Kosher salt over the top.   That's what I'd do.     Exactly what kind of eggs OP?    Also no.    This may help.   http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/AlcoholCooking.htm    Some sort of gourmet/healthy sub sandwiches with a side like potato salad or mac and cheese.  Prep and assembly provides work but wouldn't be time intensive and if you made you gourmet ingredients from scratch like a siracha or jalapeno mayo(jar) you could easily do this under $400.    Or enchiladas.       Those nooks!  Those crannies!  Your family and friends are the lucky recipients of your obvious talent!  Can I be your friend?    I always cook like this when I'm in bed suffering from the Flu too LOL!   We are a Constitutional Republic but unfortunately have operated as an economic oligarchy for most of our history and more recently a corporate oligarchy.  To be sure, the average voter is dissatisfied with this arrangement.  Religion plays a peripheral role but an important one because of it's influence on society.     I cringed when we had to make these in culinary school!     Good job man/woman!  I'll have to try the mustard.  How expensive is that remote temperature gauge?  I so want one!    Nice, like a haute version of frito pie!   Your question is puzzling.  I didn't say our founders hopes for America were more precious.  I would say that all Americans that fought in subsequent wars, including myself, fought for the same thing.  The US Constitution.  Their willingness to defend it was and is based on the same hope.    "pregnancy isn't a death sentence"  Actually it very well can be.  Carrying a pregnancy to term is much more likely to cause maternal death then abortion.   Meh.....Everyone knows this. Even lowly Navy cooks, and now you do too. Congratulations, for freaking what?!   Hopefully, within the next 40 years, enough for a generation or two to die out, the US will fulfill our founder's hopes and become the Constitutional Republic they envisioned and fought for.    US Government 101:  The US Constitution is not based on religion.  The US is not a Theocracy.  The US government is not based on direct democracy or the idea of "the majority rules".  Our Constitution specifically spelled out and defended the rights of the minority against the majority if it conflicted with the constitution.  This is evident by the separation of powers within the government that the people elect.  Democracy=theocracy is a non-gratis and makes no sense!  Although I know that many Republicans would love to convince the country that that isn't the case! LOL   Can you provide an example of one of your beliefs that is not protected by law but should be?    "My original comment demonstrates only the genesis of good and evil, i.e. the answer to the question of why murder is evil. Things are evil because they offend God."  Why would evil offend your god?  He supposedly created everything including evil according to the Bible.     Your god, as revealed to you has told you annihilate every man, woman, and child whether born or unborn from a tribe you don't have familiar ties.  What would you do?    You said this and I quote,    "Even while the Lord had his people, the jews, there was no actual law or written word until after the time of the Exodus".  The topic was prior religions not just the Bible or Torah.  So, I'll ask again, What are your thoughts about religions and civilizations that predate the Bible and the Koran?     Please explain how a sentient metaphysical god exists and how you can prove it or disprove it?    I'm proposing that there is an innate sense or morality based on empathy that does not require a God.  If you believe your god requires you to do something that runs counter to your empathetic nature then the god truths you believe in may be immoral.      What about a sense of empathy?  Empathy has been observed in "higher" species of animals.  Humans tend to gain this sense at a very young age before they can formulate an understanding of morality or ethics.  Empathy is an innate property of what humanity is and some other species are.  It also is the very heart of the "Golden Rule" which most religions will say they are based on even if the end results show that the original meanings where corrupted.     What you are suffuring from has nothing to do with your eye color.  It is called Narcissistic personality disorder.  Good luck with your recovery!   Are your morals dependant on a God given edict?   Do you think that people who have no religion lack morals?    Yea right!  You're a fake and you know this.  I'm sure you love the attention though.   That's crazy ignorant LOL!   Standard 6 inch hotel pan/insert.  Not sure who makes them but you can find them at any restaurant supply store.  Don't use an aluminum one!   Post yourself tonight without any makeup!  Let us judge if you are real or not.  I'm betting that you can't!   Try a hard to semi-hard cheese such as gruyere, parmesean, swiss, cheddar, gouda or mozzarella.  You want it to melt but not so much that it disappears.     Don't buy pregrated cheese.  It's coated with a substance that keeps the individual pieces from sticking together in the bag but inhibits the melting effect.  Buy whole block and grate the cheese you choose with a medium grate.   Freakishly oversized eyes and skin that has absolutely no pores whatsover,  seems legit!  Love the kitty though!    I think I could make mash potatoes "float" over soup without becoming soggy or dissolve if I melted a fine layer of cheese on top of the soup before I added the tators.  Sort of like putting whipped potatoes over a French Onion soup.    Hope this helps but regardless it has given me some great new soup ideas, thanks!   Let me make sure I understand you correctly.  You are ascertaining that there was no written language, much less any actual written laws from any civilizations before Exodus occurred (sometime after 1500 BCE)?    In order to judge the morals of the Bible you must be able to have an innate sense of morality.     I've had mine for almost 20 years and even though I use it almost at a commercial level,  I've never had a problem with it!  The culinary school I recently attended said they stopped buying KA mixers because they kept breaking down.  Seems that the company began replacing some of the metal parts with plastic ones.  Make sure she keeps her warranty/receipt!    Are you referring to rational thinking people or the more everyday, garden variety of ignorant Christians that can't respond, such as yourself because there is no rational response?   How do you reconcile that the first 5 commandments are clearly in violation of the protections that the US Constitution and  Bill of Rights.    Yea, I guess I'm a little OCD that way!   That one bun with the stripes going the wrong way ruined it!     Sounds like you felt helpless.     Looks like something from culinary school.  Microgreens would have been better than chopped parsley.  I bet it tasted good though.    They are almost always free.   Why did you post this?  No really, why?   Yesss!  Lived in Philly for four years.  The biggest aspect of a great CS is getting the cheese melted throughout the meat.  If you get a CS with a glob of cheese melted on the top they're doing it "wrong".   Did you call CPS?   Don't assume they can't.  Some people in wheelchairs can stand or walk for short periods of time.  It's nice of you to help if they ask!   Go to their website.  If I remember correctly it changes weekly.   Ha ha!  Your argument brought to mind the ad I saw for an "enchilada" taco at Jack in the Box!   6 to 8 applications of BBQ sauce gave it that dark lacquered look.    Sounds....interesting.  Thanks!   Not smokey at all.  Just a wonderful scent throughout the house!  We used a Cameron smoker when I ran an officer's mess that was on the sixth floor. They are made to be used on a stove-top.  This is just my homemade version of the smoker.    Stuck them in the smoker for 30 min. after I took the ribs out then put them with the ribs on the open sheet pan for 1 hour basting with the BBQ sauce every 15 min.   Durkee "Grill Creations",  St Louis Style Smokey Mesquite seasoning.   You've got to make sure the foil is wrapped tightly around the pan.  I only gives off a few puffs of smoke but nothing the overhead fan can't handle.  I wouldn't use this indoors for a long smoke like 4+ hours.     Many people from the UK think root beer taste like some sort of cough medicine.  Me?  A champagne float with strawberry ice cream,  a juicy beef cheeseburger plus fries.                What is a soferita?    Love it!  I invented a new sandwich when I was 4.  Bread plus an half inch of butter then stuck mini marshmallows into the butter and top with more bread.  My mother was actually brave enough to take a bite!       You need to get a power of attorney concerning their physical health!    I was in the military and tried everything I could to get stationed closer to home in order to help my mother whom I suspected was being financially fleeced and neglected.   Why are you protecting your sister who is clearly abusing your parents?  If I can figure out who you are and therefore your parents, which is not real hard, I will report this and also your lack of concern.  This may seem normal TO YOU!  It is not!     Where are your parents?  Do they choose to ignore this?   This is why you crack eggs in a separate bowl before using it.  The blood is not menstrual blood, chickens don't menstruate, duh!  It's just a little blood that occurred during the formation of the follicle egg sak.    Why this is WTF is laughable!  Except some boys reactions!     Chickens lay eggs.  They do not have menstrual cycles and chicks don't lay eggs.  Guess you slept though biology 1 and  basic sexual education LOL!      In my opinion I think it is a combination of circumstances.    Many high schools do not spend much time teaching evolution if at all.  HS biology classes are usually not taught by a teacher with a degree in biology.  My own HS biology class was taught by an athletic coach.     Many people do actively try to sabotage the teaching of evolution.  Here in Texas the Texas Board of Education uses a citizen review board to recommend changes to textbooks.  Most of these people are not experts and some have explicit agendas such as the dumbing down of evolution or including warning stickers indicating that it's only "a theory".  Because Texas is such a big state and textbook publishing is such a big business, changes can effect the industry nationwide.   The most devastating element to the teaching of evolution and education in general is the mindless cloning of textbook material by large corporate publishers who rely on the endless, thoughtless coping from texts going back decades and not bothering to update new scientific ideas and evidence. Laziness or sloth for profit is still a sin last time I checked!       LOL!  You're delusional and not even somewhat credible.  The best you could do for humanity is to not procreate!    I love this! Can I use this?   Mike, were your parents and society you grew up in the same religion you practice?   Meh!     Maybe but it's still a coinsidence ; )       Did you take your kids with you?   This made me smile. Thanks OP!   Not vagina.  Labia Major on the outside;  Vagina is not visible from the outside kiddo.    Their in-house made pickles are also wonderful.  My favorite is the chorizo-infuzed  Caca Oaxaca burger.  Chef Grober really rose to the occasion when he took on the challenge of creating the best burger in Fort Worth 2013 within shouting distance of Fred's, a Fort Worth all-star whole-in-the-wall burger joint since 1978!  Good things to come!   I used to dip my french fries into my chocolate milkshake when I was a kid.  I imagine the taste to be almost as good.  I'd probably dip each chip in real whipped cream for the full effect!         cute!   Sorry!   I'm guessing that your late wife didn't like a medium steak or yams?  Good on ya though.  Press on!   The best recipe you can use is the stovetop recipe from 'The Best Recipe' book which are collections of kitchen tested recipes from the 'Cook Illustrated' magazine. I've made this recipe many, many times for small and large groups and it always comes out perfect with a silky smooth finish. The secret is using evaporated milk which stabilizes the cheese sauce and you don't have to keep it cold till you need it. Don't forget the can opener though!  If you only have one camp stove and stock pot you'll need to make a slight modification but it shouldn't be a problem. You'll just need a small butane blow torch. The first amounts are for 6 side portions or 4 main dish and the second for 48 side or 32 main.  Mac   Cheese  Topping (opt) 1 1/2/4 cups dry bread crumbs pinch/1 tsp salt 1 1/2 /4 Tbps softened butter  Mac and Cheese  2 / 16 large eggs 1 / 8 (12oz) can evaporated milk 1/4 / 2 tsp hot red pepper sauce 2 tsp / 5Tbps,1/4 tsp salt 1/4 / 2 tsp ground black pepper 1 / 8 tsp dry mustard, dissolved in 1 / 8 tsp water to activate. 8 oz / 4 lb dry elbow or shell pasta 4 Tbps / 2 cups unsalted butter 12 oz / 6 lbs grated cheese, I use 1 part sharp cheddar, 1 part swiss, 1 part fontina and 1 part velveeta  For Mac   Cheese 1. Mix eggs, 1 cup / 8 cups evaporated milk, pepper sauce, 1/2 / 4 tsp salt, pepper and mustard mixture together in a bowl and set aside.      Bring 2 qts or enough for 4 lbs pasta to a boil in the stock pot. Add remaining salt and pasta. Cook until almost tender but still firm to the bite. Drain, retaining some of the pasta water, and return to pan over low heat, Add butter and toss to melt.      Pour egg mixture over buttered pasta along with three-quarters of the cheese; stir until thoroughly combined and cheese start to melt. Gradually add remaining milk and cheese, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot and creamy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the utensil you use to stir is long enough to reach the bottom and preferably has a flat end.      Pour Mac   Cheese into serving containers.  For the topping;      Mix the bread crumbs with the salt.      With a gloved hand. Mix the softened butter with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over Mac   Cheese.      Using a butane torch, carefully brown the top.  Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea! Happy Camping!      Cafe du Monde is over-hyped.  Spent seven years driving past the place every morning.  The few times I stopped there, their beignets were half cooked, greasy and overloaded with sugar.  Coffee was just OK.  Tourist trap.    Want a good breakfast?  Drive a little farther to Elizabeth's on Chartres at Gallier St.  Looks like a hole in the wall but it's the best and where the locals go!    Sort of like a scotch jalapeno, nice!   You must be in Texas! LOL   I originally posted the pics at r/military.  I posted this to r/neckbeards at their urging.  Most of the comments I've read were positive.  The few that were negative mostly took pock-shots at my calling my son out.  Sorry but believe it or not, every parent of a NB or almost a NB should shame their NB.  Being a NB is not something to aspire to!    Having to ask my adult son to make sure his door to his room was closed when I had company come over didn't make me love him less and he always knew that I was trying to impart a sense of cleanliness when I made him clean his room once every 3 months.    For all off the NB's out there, you should feel good that he won't suffer your fate LOL!    I just know that the military will instill that into him and all the negative NB's can kiss my ass!       I don't believe that I'm responsible for grown men that have made bad decisions even just because we are related.     OIC, sort of like purple in a purple drink lol!    Whataburger=Hallelujah   Amen!   Did you brine?  Looks delicious!   My Texan heart just grew three sizes!  Just perfect!  What kind of wood did you use?

Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea!  Happy Camping!  I only just now looked at Alton Brown's recipe.  All that typing for nothing lol. At least 'Best Recipe' gives credit to John Thorne who published it first!   Since dubliner is nutty and somewhat salty it pairs well with fruits like apples or pears, chicken/turkey/honey ham and most mustards.  Stay away from things that are already salty like most bacon and pickles.  A good sourdough or country bread would be good.     What is "brown" vs ketchup?   Shells are so much better than elbow macaroni.  Each shell becomes a tiny bowl filled with cheese sauce and traps little bits of yumminess!  Looks yummy OP!     Yes, thanks.   What can I say, atc_guy is right.  Hot chicks join the air force for a different reason and it has everything to do with the fact that the these prima donnas aren't cut from the same cloth that the other branches make of.       Even when I was religious I'd tell people that God helps those that (try to) help themselves.  That being said, you first need to lose your defeatist inner talk.  Everyone has set-backs in their life.  I doubt everything in yours was bad.    You obviously know how to use a computer.  My homeless uncle and brother never bothered to learn and it's crippling them plus they are felons.  Are you a felon?  If not then be proud and thankful.    When you put your kids to bed tonight look straight into each one of their eyes and try to imagine the strong loving person they see.  Then, before you go to bed, look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you ARE the strong, confident and loving parent that they see and you ARE even if you don't believe it!      Keep in touch Woman!   Are they willing to give you a letter of recommendation?  Please ask for it    Your name tells all.  Try walking into a church after hours.  Locked and bolted!     If the condition of my son's room does not cross the border into your definition of neckbeardism, as in a room that is not a normal livable space then I sincerely feel sorry for the girl you've shacked up with.  But maybe she's a slob and it doesn't matter!  She obviously doesn't care about giving away free milk!  But hey, good on your end right!   Sounds like you have unresolved father-son issues and that is sad for you.  I will call a spade a spade and when my son lives like a neckbeard then I will call him a neckbeard.  We have both laughed about it and the Navy has cleaned up his act.  Too many parents won't actually parent-up and tell their 17 year old brat that they need to grow up.  I wish you luck in your nest that you share with Mommy and Daddy.      I sent the before and after pictures to my son and even he approved and laughed.  He is a great guy and I am so proud of him.  When YOU survive bootcamp let me know and then I will give your opinion but until then STFU! because you have presented your self as ignorant and stupid.        Your aunt did a good thing and I'm sorry to hear it didn't work out.  Unfortunately it seems to be case more often then not.     I didn't cut them off.  They can always depend on me to emotionally support them.  I refuse to support them financially and even found a half-way house that I had to drag my uncle into.      This is best response I've received.  Thank you!  I wish my grandmother and mom, plus the absent fathers had taught them to be self reliant but they didn't or couldn't.  What I'm grappling with is what to do if they reject rehab, a roof over their head plus meals.  I'm not going to turn my back but I won't let them rely on me either!       I want to thank you for pointing out ways that I may have made it it seem that my son wasn't a neckbeard.  He had trouble even growing a mustache!  I'm not putting my son down and he would be the first to confirm that, however you seem to be putting yourself down and that is sad!      Yes, except for New Orleans but most of them sound like they're from New York anyway.   roadside stands selling boiled peanuts.  	111
 I also found [**Church History in Plain Language**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0718025539) that looks pretty good. Anyone know anything about this one?   So this book looks really good, not only for historical background, but explanations on the sprouting up of various Christian denominations. I might give this a go.      I actually thought that was really done well. He has a typical but enjoyable wrestling character. Not cringe-worthy IMO.   Very helpful and very encouraging.   We as a people have such a short term memory that we can't even     small but fatal   I don't know which is more cringe-worthy, the Psychic Divas or the terrible laugh and music tracks that the producers put on that show.   Absolutely. I was just kidding with my comment anyways. Using any opportunity to show off my goods. Great work, mate!   That's cute. :)   http://imgur.com/FwWTc4H   Just "IMHO" or "My Advice" would be good.   Dude. This is my first Steam Summer Sale to take part in and I have been living by your posts. I look for them even before I read the original post concerning what games are for sale.  I've played both of the games you just mentioned. Loved both. Looking at **The Testament of Sherlock Holmes**, **Child of Light**, and **The Banner Saga** from today.   Perfect assessment. I don't mind the graphics either. Graphics don't make or break a game to me. Out of the five main gaming elements, this is my order of importance:  1. Story/Plot 1. Character Development 1. Gameplay 1. Graphics 1. Soundtrack  My main problems with Fallout 1 and 2 lie in gameplay.    Thanks for the kind comments and suggestions.  Unless I just really get burnt out on 2, I will have to complete it before moving on to 3. I know they are totally different games, but I think that I will better appreciate 3 and NV once 1 and 2 have been completed.   Where is your TLDR of what we should buy? I've been religiously following your advice each day!   So, guys...this is a great response. If I could up vote you twice, I would do it thrice. Thank you for the detailed encouragement. I have taken it to heart.   I have. Most of the ones I have found are incomplete or really messy. There is one right over therebut it is pretty disorganized.      Good question.  1. I don't think Fallout 1 has aged well. Had I played it in 1997, I am sure I'd be a bigger fan. 1. Little direction on what to do and where to do it at. 1. Damage seems to be so random which makes the game increasingly difficult. 1. In fact, combat system is one of my biggest complaints. Don't think it is well thought-out or executed. 1. My uncontrollable party members get in my way, get shot, and refuse to let me out of a house. 1. Really glitchy, especially playing on Windows 7.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the story aspects and meta-narrative. Just playing it was what was so difficult. I'm afraid that 2 is going to be the same, just worse.   I'm an avid gamer. I appreciate great stories and deep characters. So, for years my friend has suggested that I play Fallout 3   New Vegas. I, however, have a personality that forces me to play games from the beginning. And when I say the beginning, I mean the beginning...of the entire series.  **Before playing recent Fallouts I must play through 1 and 2 first.**  I forced myself through Fallout 1. It was painful but manageable. I've started 2 but I don't know if I can physically do it. It is such an aged game. But I refuse to play 3 and Vegas without first completing 2.   I need some encouragement. Direction. Hope. Tactics. *How can I play through this game and enjoy it but do so in a timely manner?*  **EDIT: I'm new to this subreddit and am looking for some genuine help. Go easy on me!**   I checked. It would be his 555th. Born in 1459.   2014 - 1459 = 555.  No one seems to care...   Would today not be his 555th birthday?   I clicked thread title fully hoping to see the text box say, "...in the kitchen."    It's all ridiculously annoying.   **Altair** = Syrian (light brown in color)   **Ezio** = Florentine (olive in color)   **Connor**, excuse me, **Ratonhnhak:ton** = Mohawk Native American (brown in color)   **Edward** = Welsh (white in color)  **Aveline** = Half French Half African (black in color)   **Adwal** = Trinidadian (dark black in color)  Ubisoft has been very well-rounded in character creation and utilization. Just because they went with four men and no women in this game doesn't constitute as racism or sexism. It is all a joke. People just want something to complain about.   Here is the best version of the gameplay at E3:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhY_4jN-9a8   This helps tremendously. I think I'm going to play it safe and get a medium.   I hear you say small and I've seen small before but I'm scared I'm going to be suffocated.   I know it's been asked a million times, but I need a fit analysis.  **Weigh: 160**  **Height: 5' 11"**  **Chest: 39-40**  **Waist: 30-31**  What size of slim-fit oxford will fit me? Small or medium?     We love story-driven games. Child of Light is definitely one we would like to play through. Thanks for the other options!   We haven't. Should we start with the original Witcher?   The choice-making games are fun for us. But the reason we even like making choices is because of the stellar story and plot, both of which we look for most in a game.   We have not tried The Wolf Among Us. Great suggestion, though. Will download and give it a try.  Limbo and Bastion are both games we have played through. Limbo was enjoyable. But Bastion was absolutely incredible. Truly a unique experience.  Thanks for the suggestions!   PS3 exclusive. Blah. I guess I should have mentioned, we prefer PC gaming. Though we do have an Xbox360 and a PS2 (and a N64!).   My wife and I like to "journey" through games together. She sits by me and we collectively make in-game choices and enjoy story-driven games on a regular basis.  Here have been some of our favorite experiences:  * Max Payne 1   2 * Red Dead Redemption * Bioshock Seires * L. A. Noire * Tomb Raider * To the Moon * The Walking Dead * Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons   It might be cool to do a weekly update. That might be too much. At least give us something regular that will let us know how you're feeling, additional and unforeseen challenges, and pics!   What type/kind/color of shoe would be better?    They are my favorite pair of jeans that I own.   Are they cheaply made? Probably. Is the little leather label on its last thread? Absolutely. Will I have to switch these out for a new pair in a year or so? Likely. But they were twenty bucks.   I've never been all about flaunting name brands anyways. As long as they look good and feel good, they are good for me.   Posted this in WAYWT. But would like some specific feedback on the most casual of outfits. I really like casual/comfortable/timeless. Am I doing it right? How can I reproduce this *feel* with different clothes?  [The Look](http://i.imgur.com/jHXrY5z.jpg)   [Casual Friday](http://i.imgur.com/jHXrY5z.jpg)  Nothing special. JCrew, 20Jeans, Nikes.   I actually prefer #2.   It is unique styling but I think it fits you a lot better than the first shirt. Navy shoes work best.   I'm not completely sure what you mean by RPG. Traditionally, RPG stands for role-playing games. Bioshock Infinite doesn't necessarily fit that category.  But, I'm assuming you mean games that contain well-developed characters and stories that draw you in as if you were the main character him/her self. If that is the case, here are a few of my favorite:  * Red Dead Redemption * Max Payne 1, 2,   3 * Tomb Raider * Mafia * Mafia 2  * Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic * Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning  And if you haven't played the original Bioshock and its sequel, Bioshock 2, you should give them a chance as they are great pieces of work on their own.   I'm sorry, but these suggestions that YouTube is a terrible source for learning magic are completely wrong and ill-informed. Just as you can find valuable teachers concerning any subject on YouTube, you can find magicians that know there stuff.  One in particular is [52Kards](https://www.youtube.com/user/DecksAndContests).    My friend just married Kanye and Kim.    I just finished **Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven**. It is an older game, but I believe that it has aged well.   It took me off guard at first, because at the beginning it feels like a GTA game. However, when I got pulled over for running a red light I knew I was into something completely different.  Mafia was a great game. It was a *huge* challenge. Hardest game I've ever played. But a great story and some great characters.   I've got a life-long ban from from Neopets. I used to "hack" other peoples' accounts and launder money into my account.    * My wife and I would most likely attend. * We'd rather it outside (pool or lake). * We could bring some food items for grilling.   	44

I guess it is kinda my fault i feel depressed all the time now that i read my 'hobbies'     I'm too hard on people and i expect too much and that ends up pushing them away. Its hard seeing people physically avoid you, I've tried to change but nothing. It hurts.   I like to read, skateboarding, and sometimes writing. I'm not social, a point that my gf or ex or whatever loved tp point out. I guess it is kinda my fault i feel depressed all the time now that i read my 'hobbies'   I feel as if i need to get away because everyones weighing me down, my mom is currently living with me and she's just, i hate saying this, but she's a leech and her and my dad dicorced a month ago and that also hurt me pretty bad. And myself im just hate myself, my attitude has pushed many of my friends away and i feel as i am holding her down from becoming what she wants which hurts me because she sometimes cares and sometimes doesnt and that just suck.

Dubbed TrES-4, the planet is about 1.7 times the size of Jupiter and belongs to a small subclass of so-called puffy planets that have extremely low densities. The planet is located about 1,400 light years away from Earth and zips around its parent star in only three and a half days."   DOCTOR OCTOPUS    Chastity Lynn   Chill out there /r/conspiratard   Cryo. Do you even... ah fuck it.    I think there was a "successful" revival of a pig or something ill try and find the article.  "On 20 January 2006, doctors from the Massachusetts General Hospitalin Bostonannounced they had placedpigs in suspended animation with a similar technique. The pigs wereanaesthetized and major blood loss was induced, along with simulated - via scalpel - severe injuries (e.g. a punctured aorta as might happen in a car accident or shooting). After the pigs lost about half their blood the remaining blood was replaced with a chilled saline solution. As the body temperature reached 10C (50F) the damaged blood vessels were repaired and the blood was returned.The method was tested 200 times with a 90% success rate"   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_animation   Some people are little bitches my friend.   Well the it was a Battlefront TRAILER after all.   EVERYONE THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL SHIELD, MOVE ALONG. http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1255/647214371_4252bd7d4e.jpg   You guys are fucking st   Okay now im contemplating why they wouldn't come out, you'd have a 'survival' card. Lets say the actor unexpectedly dies, we the people have evidence of the government killing a 'whistleblower' if you will.    TIL that only Europeans can have crawl spaces.   Hopefully you'll be dead. ;)   Well no one wants to die right? I meant think of all the things the government can do to you, like all those torture tactics that they use.   Shite.   1. Droideka 2. You could play as a Jet Pack Trooper if I'm not mistaken and if that isnt enough you could play as Boba Fett.    Who doesn't like spending money?    Oh yes let me (The Actor) just go against my secret totalitarian style government because that seems like a good idea.   :,( i love you man.   Then don't play, dont comment, and dont even get on this sub. For not caring you seem awful worried, just observation and deduction.    Damn son, have fun! ;)    BE CAREFUL WITH NAIR OP, PLEASE.

They may tolerate it but its not something theyre eager to do. When theyre finally able to jump out of that tub its as if theyre experiencing pure freedom. No longer held back by you (their evil shampoo wielding owner) they are free, and with that feeling comes excitement.  Imagine youve just done something you were terrified of  whether thats sky diving or riding in that scary elevator at work thats always breaking down when youre done you often feel a sense of adrenaline. Its a rush of excitement if you were able to conquerthatthen you can do anything.  Many people speculate dogs experience a similar level or excitement and exhilaration once theyre freed from the tub. It might be the pent up nervous energy or it might just be a sense of freedom. Whatever it is the end result is usually the same; no holds barred zoomies.    	101

 You own the mineral rights to those 20 acres and can build non permanent structures on it with a non concrete foundation and so long as you can tear it down with no evidence that it was ever there, you can build whatever u want...for the most part...    Will do my friend! Thanks for the love!   We pulled this today in the first hour   http://i.imgur.com/z5PK1Vj.jpg   $180 for a 20 acre claim bt the pain is the blm paperwork process..   Well, in spirit ;)   Already ran into him..      You are correct..we are hoping it is signs of a pocket near by..exposing bedrock with lots of virgin gravels on top..looks good so far :)   Maybe $25...      no music up anywhere yet tho :(   so if you look at the maker of the toy set, it is the same name as who apparently left the ransom note for the family...oh man, gotta love photoshop!   as a drummer who has played many shows in the past, DO NOT PLAY YOUR HARDEST SONG first.... that is horrible advice! Play the song that you and your band feel will keep people's attention and make them wanting more, that way you can get the audience into your music and band and if you fuck up down the line, chances are no one will notice. As opposed to playing your hardest song first (which to the average listener, they wont be able to tell) and possibly fucking it up and having that be the thing people remember because it was your first song.   In the end, put together a set that will keep people interested, and that doesnt necessarily mean playing your hardest song first.  Bring lots of sticks and keep a rag near by for those sweaty palms because with it being your first gig, no matter how calm and collected you are, you gunna get the nervous sweats  Make friends with the front of house engineer too, he ultimately holds the fate of your band for that club in his hands....saying hello and offering to help with any kind of stage set up really does go a long way.  bring lots of sticks and dont drink too much before the stage, being drunk at your own gig is over played  AND REMEMBER, have as much fucking fun as possible and keep telling yourself this is why we all got into gigging in the first place!   Good luck brotha! Whats the name of your band?            Hahahaha I recognize those anywhere!

It is in north Lake Tahoe just west of Truckee CA on top of Donner Summit    Thank you I appreciate that :)               Hahahaha is this Mike or Chase? It's Alex from VS here...

 No worries! The more people that play this game the better. It's one of those you can keep coming back to and replaying.    Enslaved odyssey to the west is an amazing single player game. It's quite overlooked but it's one of those games that just draws you in. It's based on a really old Chinese story Journey to the west and its adaptation is brilliant. It has really colourful scenery. It plays like a 3D platformer with some puzzles and stuff. Really recommend it.   	2

 Darlene doesn't look at Mr. Robot. She rolls her eyes in that direction while still looking at Elliot. And remember that when Mr. Robot cuts off one of the guys, if the theory is true, then it's actually Elliot cutting off the guy. The lady you are talking about is just looking towards the right. She is not looking at Mr. Robot.   But putting all that aside, after the comments made by u/Bear__Jew, it might be true that the writers are just trying to fuck with out brains. Mr. Robot might after all be real.       Dude. DUDE. I think we should stop before we kill the surprises they have planed for us.     So this is him? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUN5C8hKLzA   Is this him in these scene's ?  http://i.imgur.com/zCjLDHW.png  http://i.imgur.com/fdRtaI2.png     Is your friend working for the show?    Totally. I had a huge smile on my face when this scene came on.     Exactly. Look at [this guy's eyes](http://i.imgur.com/OdT4ydb.jpg) for example, he is looking at Darlene. I think it's just Mr. Robot who's not real, for now. Also did you notice how Elliot din't react when Mr. Robot put his hand on his shoulder?  I think it's now obvious that Mr. Robot is not real.    Look at Darlene's eyes when she is talking. She is looking at Elliot, and not Mr. Robot. Here's another one, when she is asking, "What's the plan?" : http://i.imgur.com/UlcnkHI.png You can watch the scene again to make sure. It's kinda obvious now.    Are you Elliot's father?

 love the name; Hablas francais tambien?  I once tweeted something like "Putain le faux czar du Russie"  But Putain is french for Puto   prly typed on mobile.  m is next to the enter key   did it for you https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext/comments/3284d2/thats_pretty_convenient_i_hope_someone_sues_the/      the silent treatment is much worse than grounding, buddy  (especially when there isn't much to ground when you're kept on a tight leash)   People laughing in your face man.  The one time I ever got suspended, I was in 10th grade (year 11 for any Brits reading), I was scared and devastated, kind of internally losing my shit.  The particular assistant principle who was asking me questions and filling out the paperwork was a real jerk to me.  I'm not saying I deserved to be treated specially or anything like that, but I believe I deserved a basic level of human respect, you know?  In my fear and anxiety I asked a kind of silly question, which he could have just answered matter-of-factly or maybe, maybe chuckled at, but instead he more than guffawed; he outright laughed out loud to my face when he answered me.   This of course only served to make my fear and anxiety (about what awaited me at home) much worse.  I was in trouble though, so that's one thing.  Last semester, I am in Grad school btw, during a meeting about our theses (dissertation in other nations), just to go over general guidelines, I asked a serious question about the scope of the topic area (trans-atlantic comparative policy as opposed to a purely European focus), and the professor leading the meeting did the same obnoxious laugh in my face and rather than saying "yes, people have done that; it fits the program name well." he said " *guffawing laughter* well it has to have some European element to it; otherwise, why are you in [this] program?"  Thanks; thanks a lot.  Made me want to leave the room at the time, but it was a mandatory meeting. He made it clear that he didn't think I belonged there when it came to my assignments too, but it's ok.  I'm not the one with a problem, so I don't let these things get to me.   I graduated in 2011, and I consider it quite a while ago because so much has changed in the world and everyone's lives.  We, and the world, were all so different it seems.   that and the unauthorized breaks just show she was spoiled too much as a child and cannot fathom not getting whatever she wants /  having her way.    could also be a creeper using that line as an excuse to blatently photograph pretty people   that is disturbing.  *shudders*   love the quote; I googled it and couldn't find an author though.  Probably because it's worded slightly differently.  Great nonetheless   That's an interesting angle, comparing it to physical motion, and it makes perfect sense.  Although functionally, telling your arm to move and using your mind to move it as it is done normally, do not really seem different, your arm doesn't move if you just think it, you have to physically get in there and make it move.    So based on your analogy there, and my experience, perhaps the "mental theater" really is necessary....  Seeing as the thought that is used to move the arm is not in the form of words.  I guess it is in the form of energy.   OK, I got an opportunity to test this hypothesis this morning.  It could be a mental block, so others must try it to give the results more validity.   So , my nose started bleeding at 8:17.  (I am prone to that as you may have inferred.). Just as I was about to leave.  I covered it with tissue but used no pressure.  It was going quite heavy.  I tried twice to just concentrate on willing it/ mentally asking it to stop, with words.  It was still going strong.  At 8:18 I tried it the usual way, visualising the energy and the physical healing.  It stopped immediately.  For reference, prior to realizing I could do this for myself, my nosebleeds would typically last upwards of 5 minutes with the help of a cold compress, longer and slower without.  So yeah, its a major blessing. Point is though that, even though it theoretically should work without the visualization, this proves that, at least for me, it is definitely quicker andeasier with.   I think that's more of a mind trick, but what a neat way to be opened to the possibilities   I love that episode.   neo-imperialism FTW!   not so weird at all; I noticed this about myself, and I googled it and its common.  I thus included it in a fictional story I wrote on /r/nosleep : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p11q/part_1_invisibility/   It's nice to be taught by a parent in the home.  My dad is heavily into all martial arts and the mystical concepts which stem from that interest.  He studied meditation, and has books on all sorts of related things.  However, he never really got into any of these things with me, only vaguely maybe.  He is fascinated with levitation through meditation.  Other than that....   I would have upvoted you, but your points seem to go well with the Darwin Award concept IMO   Worst Case Scenario: that person is disturbed because your "Fartglare" looked sexual.   telekinesis; that is very ambitious.  When you've been practicing with that for long enough, does the time and effort it takes for it to work decrease, as I have always suspected?   in my experience; telepathy is a very personal connection.  Opening those lines with people you don't know well is quite dangerous.  If you are not mentally strong, they can easily plant ideas and affect what you think you think.  Watch out for that if you're even remotely serious.   "healing service"; learning "from a master"  ; that sounds impressive.  Ancient, formal arts; I think it's fascinating how different cultures and traditions use such different means to accomplish the same goals (and also have a variety of different goals in some cases...)   smart teachers make you swap papers twice.  two graders.   It depends on how exactly this was all measured.  There is narcissism, and people who come across as self-righteous jerks.   Then, there are people who have confidence, who can be kind of know-it-alls, and other such traits, but that is not the center of one's character.  It is possible to be confident and believe you are right about things but also know you are not the center of the universe and be a kind individual.  I completely understand the attraction to confidence for a number of reasons.  The particular statement about manipulation is concerning, but I don't think such a questionnaire can truly evaluate these intricate, elusive components of a personality.    yes; although blind people can do things without seeing it, it is undeniably easier when you can see what you are doing.   wow; well kudos for picking it back up!  I never fully dropped it, but I have been somewhat inactive the past 5 years as well.  (Which was mainly to protect someone and because of a relationship I was putting all my energy into.  But that's irrelevant.)  I too have the dreams, quite frequently when I get enough sleep.  Getting adequate sleep will help you have more of the dreams.   You can remember dreams better if you make a note of it right away.  Keep a notepad and pen on your nightstand.  and thanks for the welcome :)   well, as mentioned above, I always remembered "Stein" too.  At least you have something more stable/concrete to tie it to.  That confirms that we didn't just collectively mis-pronounce then.  now I can feel uncomfortable again....   ah, ok, so that's a little different from what I understood you to mean.   So the issue is not whether or not the energy is behind the effect, but whether that energy is simply the intent and we are just attempting to process it by visualizing it.  In general, the energy is not physical, it is electrical.  The visualizing I guess is a method which allows us to channel and control the energy.  The intention and the energy are two separate things though.    You need the energy; things don't happen with intention alone, not really. For example, I intended to go to the store today, but I didn't put in the energy to get up and go do it.  The "sensory theater" of visualizing things is a method of using your mind to channel it, although you're right, it's not truly necessary for the effect.  The energy itself is though.  (In my humble understanding).   well clearly your upbringing has had a lasting effect, seeing as you eat bunnys   i've come to the same taking chances conclusion.  I was only single for three days in high school; I started HS in an LTR and finished it an in LTR which just ended last year.  I am now in grad school with a deplorably limited amount of expierience in this confusing "game" if you will.    Depending on how you look at it, you could say the taking chances has worked out ok so far, but I've learned that you should still be careful when taking chances, so as not to ruin anything along the way.  So, I'm still holding the taking chances philosophy, but I'm being cautious.  Perhaps too cautious, but I honestly don't know what to do in any situation I am faced with in this regard, as I have practically 0 experience in being single.   I'm in grad school.  I hate to redo anything.  I hate to even retype something if the backspace accidentally makes the browser goes back.  I would be super super pissed.  I would try to figure out how to come back, and if I couldn't, I'd focus on not making the same mistakes and go about things in better more respectful ways.   and mine was 100% covered by my existing insurance! Thanks Obama :)   (in a 100% non-sarcastic way)   you're welcome!  I hope this gives you some ideas for experiments to use that excess energy   Great!  feeling your energy is a good first step.  You need to be able to clear you mind to control it well.  The best exercise starting out is to meditate and think of nothing.  It doesn't have to be for long, just start small and go longer as you get better at it. I mean absolutely nothing.  Not your breathing, not your heartrate, not the fact that you're thinking of nothing.  **nothing**  Separately from that, if you're not already doing so, visualize your energy.  Visualize it moving through your body and to your hands.  Focus on your breathing as you do so.  Visualize it flowing as you breathe out, but don't release it.  Visualize it flowing into a ball between your hands.    As far as actually using it is concerned, you have to have an intention with a need or desire behind it which drives you; you focus on harnessing your energy as described above, and you use your intentions to direct it to a purpose.   That is my attempt at a vague description of the process.  If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask   yes, people do; I personally don't have the patience for it.  I'm sure it gets faster and more effective with practice, but starting out it takes an insanely long period of intense concentration and I'm just not up to the task.    A friend of mine did it in class when he was little and freaked people out.    now, something marginally easier which I have accomplished is using energy to manipulate electronic devices.  It has a visible physical result, but the energy doesnt have to be converted into physical kinetic energy; it remains as an electrical impulse just as it started in your mind, which is my understanding of why this is easier to do.    My most successful experience occurred, in 8th grade, out of necessity, which is key actually; unless you are really practiced in these things, for it to work, you have to **need** it.  There is great power and energy in desperation.  With which I incapacitated 7 overhead projectors in various ways (as I did not specify a method in my intention).  The great necessity felt by my 13 year old mind?  I had trouble reading from those antiquated projectors and I did not want to be made to get glasses.  My desire to not have to get glasses was a really intense need to me.    The point of adding that last detail is that, **need** is relative.  It's the energy created from the need that fuels this.    Being full of energy as you are, you probably don't *need* the **need**.   this is quite rare for me.  I usually just know things are going to happen, or that someone will call or whatever, maybe see them in my mind.   I do regularly, at least a couple of times a month, smell something randomly that isn't there.  Like, I randomly smelled chocolate chip cookies burning in an oven one night last week.  These smells usually last a minute or two.  Sometimes less.  But they are quite distinct, and are not the result of a strong craving, as I have no desire for burnt cookies.    Now that you've made me think about it, the first explanation that occurred to me just now is that maybe someone I have a connection to was smelling these things and the sensory perception transferred to or was picked up by me.  In any case, seeing as you have experienced Clairalience, pay more attention to what you smell.  Then test yourself by focusing on something you couldnt possibly know or have smelled yet (like, what your mother or neighbor, or grandmother in another state, is going to cook for dinner tonight).  Don't try too hard or you'll disappoint yourself with a mental block.  Just relax and focus on imagining them (in this case cooking).  Then, if you do smell something, check later (by calling, going next door, whichever is applicable) to see if what you smelled did in deed turn out to be the case.  Don't be discouraged if it wasn't.    Trying to harness abilities such as these is an issue of trial and error usually fraught by high expectations and fear of failure.  When you're first trying to do it on purpose, you may smell something at first because you really want to and not because you actually picked up on it.  So don't be disappointed, just keep trying.  Again, the key is not to try too hard.  Just relax and tap into it.  Although I don't have experience with *psychic smells* , I have simply taken the model I have for honing any such ability and applied it to your situation.   I hope this helps!     your wording is a bit convoluted, but I understood the question to mean, are we really influencing things with our energy, or is it more of a self-fulfilling prophecy in which we use our will to lead us to/ give ourselves "permission" do things which make it happen.  Did I understand you correctly?  If so, then, yes and no.  It depends on what you're talking about.    The giving permission idea can be similar to what happens when one prays for strength or courage to do something.  You give yourself confidence to follow through.  But, that is not how everything works; that is only in those cases which involve personal action on your part.   If you are directing your energy to, say, short-circuit or otherwise overcharge or break a light bulb, that is a matter of physical electricity/energy.  It is a more concrete physical process and outcome which occurs, so it is certainly a result of the targeted energy itself and not the notion of giving it permission to break.   Living things which can process the intent-guided energy in more than just a physical way is where you question becomes pertinent.   If you are directing your energy to heal something, for instance, your friend's nosebleed.  When the bleeding stops, it is not because you gave it permission to do so, but because you contributed energy to accelerate the process.  Your energy served as a catalyst.  If its your own nosebleed, then you could argue both ways.  The brain controls the body.  So, yes, you fed energy in to catalyze the process, but, you also, with your mind, ordered your nose to stop bleeding.  You can control your breath, and your heart rate (via adrenaline and nor epinephrine) with your mind; when we tap into a few extra percent of our capabilities to do these things, one could certainly argue we are just using our mind's natural ability, through whatever neurological processes, to control the body.     not so clearly for me; my intuition works more like, say I'm planning to go out for a walk soon.  Suddenly I'll feel all throughout me the impulse to "go, go right now" because it'll be beneficial to me.  So I do, and then I run into people with seemingly perfect timing.  It's more vague than what you describe.   I'm so glad I came across this thread.  I have been excitedly running into people with whom to discuss these things on /r/paranormal and /r/Glitch_In_The_Matrix , and I had been thinking there should be a sub dedicated to this.    Anyhow, I wanted to hear from others how you got started working with energy.  Did you read something?  Did someone expose you to it?  Did you have an experience which inspired you to learn?  or Did you simply start without any particular stimulus that you're aware of?    How old were you when you began?  or Have you been doing it as long as you can remember?  I thought this might be an interesting discussion to have; to compare "origin story"  notes :)  My answers, for example: I have been doing it as long as I can remember, to a lesser extent.  I really awakened my potential at age 12, after having read a book which empowered me to take control of my life and helped me to overcome the social adversities I faced, as well as to explore my full potential (from the theoretical food for thought proposed therein, not the specific content itself).   eh, well idk either; that was just my attempt to dismiss it and not dwell on it.  As long as nothing else happens, it's nothing to worry about regardless of what it actually is.  	41

 It should be a thing. I don't think I, or anyone else I know, realized just how much work it would be. I had multiple law students describe it, but actually doing it was a complete wake up call to the amount of work that had to be put in.   Maybe, but if I were TJ, I'd still want the fight to get that loss back.   Two scenarios:   (1) If the candidate died the day before the election, would (s)he be taken off the ballot? If so, who would (s)he be replaced with? The VP on their ticket? If not, and (s)he still won, would the VP become president?  (2) If a candidate won and became president-elect, but died before being sworn in, what would happen? VP-elect becomes president? Something else?   I'm lost.   Replying to wrong person.   Likely not enough evidence to charge the guy if your video doesn't show his hands on your neck. I'd steer clear of his home if I were you. Should you have to? No, but it's the smart thing to do if there is an alternative route.   I'm so sorry.  Was your cat an outside cat or would the cat have been stolen from inside the apartment?  You could always have a lawyer write up a letter demanding the neighbor return your cat and hope it scares them into giving the cat back.   Money?   Perhaps the agent is upset because he didn't properly verify your identity. You should ask him about that.   Went to a 9:30 yesterday. There were only two other people in the theater besides my girlfriend and I.   Just want to point out that lots of people say "I have nothing, you will never be able to collect," it's not necessarily true. I would highly recommend getting the judgment in small claims court. The filing fee isn't much and it won't take a ton of time.  Then you can fulfill the judgment anytime in the future. If she ever gets a job, you can garnish her wages. If one of her grandparents/parents ever die and leave her any inheritance, you may be able to get a cut. If she ever wins the lottery, you will get your cut. It seems highly unlikely that for the rest of this woman's life, she will never have any income or assets.  Also, I'm reasonably sure that interest will be included whenever you are able to collect.   I'm not a lawyer, but maybe one can chime in on the legality of just not paying the landlord and leaving it up to them to bring you to court for non-payment at which point you bring proof that nobody was in the apartment for three weeks and then the burden of proof would be on the landlord. I'm inclined to believe that if the landlord admitted it was his/her workers plugging in that caused the overage, any court would make them pay for it.   Well assuming he got his money back fairly quickly (I know, a big if), then he could have reinvested and caught the market on at least a portion of the upswing.   Why false? The market did fall over 40%.   I tend to agree with that. Anyone can go nuts for a minute 30 and outshine their opponent.   You could suggest an alternative of getting a camera to cover the area if it's usually all in one place. Also, you could point out that this would have to be an ongoing thing, where every time a new dog moved into the neighborhood, they'd have to get DNA tested.   Warning to OP: he will likely claim OP gave him permission to do so, and if that's the standard business practice (I'm unfamiliar with the gold trade business), then it seems the decision may be tilted in the gold buyer's direction.  Then again, just the threat of a lawsuit is enough to scare some people to pay up. And, the filing fee for small claims court is usually not much, so it seems worth a try.   I apologize in advance because this will come off as racist, but if you just go to the airports and stand in front of the United and American terminals, because no security to stop you from getting there, and look for the most Islamic-looking people you can find and call them out in front of everyone. At the very least, on that day at that place your odds are pretty decent of targeting the right people, and innocents who get offended are just part of the deal, unfortunately.  Maybe they'll bail at that point. You can point out that they have boxcutters and give light details of their plan (they have pilot training, etc.). At the very least, it seems the authorities will detain you and them and you just try your hardest to convince them.  I at least remember United 93, so that's one terminal I can definitely get in front of and execute the plan.   What a time to be alive.  Drone dude was probably just hunting for boobies at Spring Break.   If he comes back looking anything like the fighter that destroyed Mizugaki, I still think he takes the belt.   I'm not a lawyer, but it seems pretty straightforward that by not signing to un-enroll your child, he is effectively not allowing you to choose the daycare. Therefore, HE is the one who is not complying with the court order. Perhaps talk to your attorney to see if the attorney could send him a letter to this effect.   Ok bud.   Ok bud.  I find it hilarious that your entire comment karma is negative, btw.   Ok buddy.   Can a lawyer chime in on the legalities of the husband appearing and paying the ticket for her?   Here, the orders were warranted because the dog (correctly) alerted on the car. So the officer had every right to ask the man to step out and search the car.  Haha coming away with no charges does NOT mean he was illegally detained.   Dude needed to learn to comply with cops orders. Dude got arrested because he didn't.   I thought the same thing. I can only guess that it was because of the length of the fight.  Look at Ronda's last few fights. Were they beatdowns? Yea, she whipped the hell out of her opponents. However, it would have seemed more of a beatdown if she just battered the opponents for 25 minutes.   If it is illegal, you can and you should. For example, if he hits you or threatens to hurt you in any way.  A police record showing hundreds of violations will only increase your likelihood of you being able to get out of there as fast as possible.   Which country can you buy 12 UFC's for $120?   I mean they can, but it's against the rules and could result in a DQ.   Just in case anyone else just got curious, season 2 is set to premiere in "mid-2015" whatever that means.   Yea.... It's definitely time to lawyer up.   Why don't we do those? Sounds fun.   You call the police every single time anything out of line happens. If you have to call 100 times, so be it. You don't have to walk to the police station every time. Walk to the nearest neighbors house and ask to use a phone to call the police if you don't have a phone. If that neighbor doesn't answer or refuses, continue on to the next one.  By continuing to call the police, you will have a continued record of what is happening.   Eh. I guess. I feel like if a fighter's corner thought he was being brain damaged enough to throw in the towel, the fighter should least care about the manner in which he lost, as long as it was clear he was going to lose either way.   http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations  Section 15(A)(xxx)  It's illegal.  Edit: LOL downvote me for showing you the light   It's legal in boxing. Not in MMA. I know, it's stupid.   So wait, if you were not working there before law school, what was their incentive to pay you to go? How did you apply for this deal?   It's so funny how people view experiences differently. I worked for several years in a professional office and got used to the 40 hour work week then nights and weekends are mine. Then I attended undergrad and went straight to law school after. I found it MUCH easier to go straight from undergrad to law school, because I was used to giving up my nights and weekends to study. While I agree they are nothing alike, I still found it easier being used to working nearly every night and weekend, as opposed to only the occasional night and weekend in a real world job.   Good point, fair enough. I guess the fighter would just lose by DQ, but if you're gonna lose anyway who cares?   Corners can't stop the fight in the middle of the round. It's in the unified rules.   Like the other guy said, what if OP dies in a car crash on the way home from the funeral. Now there's 7 kids with no income. At least if OP has life insurance, they'll have some sort of fallback.   At least you could explain that away by "he just got caught," and you're not the guy who assured his friends that Barao would wipe the floor with TJ, and then TJ outclassed him the whole fight (even though we all thought Barao would win).   Yea, watching that video and Rogan says something like if Nurmagomedov is dominating RDA like this, then I'm excited to see how a fight with Pettis, the top of the food chain goes. It's crazy that Khabib DID dominate the the top of the food chain like that. It just so happens that RDA was above Pettis' level.   For real, before FW got moved to the UFC, the best in the world were in the WEC, except for a few small exceptions.   I honestly thought Jon Jones would beat Matt Hamill.   Not the time or place, dude.   It is almost surely already criminal. If I were you, I would (in order) cut my contributions to zero, start job searching, and report the CEO to the police.   I'd be very interested if you have the time! And it seems like there is a lot of interest from others around here.   I'm sorry if this is too much but do you think you could just post the top 10 for all weight classes?  Like you should make the rankings a whole post and explain a bit how you came up with them. I for one think it would be very interesting and probably pretty popular.   Why are you being down voted? Isn't what you wrote true?   I use VPI and I've made two claims for a total of about $3,000 in the past 3 months. They're great, you just email in your claim form and receipts to them and they process it and send you a check. The only downside is you have to pay the entire cost upfront.   I have it because I know I would spend anything on my pet to keep her from dying. I also know I don't have the funds right now to deal with that.  The deal with insurance is that, on average, it's a bad deal. That's how the companies profit. If you have the money to cover a potential large expense (think $5K per animal) then you're good. If you don't, then get insurance.  I pay about $200/year for my cat and I've used it twice in the past 3 months to claim a total of $3,000 from the insurance company. It's worked out for me.   Damnit I was off by 100 days on my math. Oh well.  RemindMe! 7300 days "You did the math wrong"   RemindMe! 7200 days "Check the bet"   Pettis did the same thing in his post fight speech. "After the first punch, I couldn't see out of my right eye. No excuses."   You could just tell me. It's not cost of living because he's not comparing NY to anywhere else. It's not PPP because he's not comparing another country to NY. And if you think it's CPI, you should check the source on my inflation calculator.   Not necessarily. The Court could interpret the ruling however it wants. It could legalize marijuana for just those plaintiffs or for all of CA.   Sorry that's wayyyyyy off. NY State minimum wage in 1979 was $2.90 (http://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/minimum_wage.asp). Adjusted for inflation that would be $9.34 (http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=2.90 year1=1979 year2=2015). Extrapolated out for 40 hours per week for 52 weeks a year, we arrive to $19,427, nowhere near the $50,000 you claim.   Does that not make those grad plus loans ineligible for PAYE?   Very surprised not to see MMA on the list at all.   No but really. Explain where I've been childish.   Lol. Justify how ever you want. I was asking because I was wondering what jobs besides actors take off months at a time. I guarantee you come off as more of a creeper than me to any girl with that comment.   Way to be a creeper dude...   If you don't party and focus you can easily get a 4.0 in your year at UTSA. With that you are virtually guaranteed to get into UT.   What do you do if you don't mind sharing?   Obamacare still caps the annual out of pocket cost at $13,200 even if he's on a family plan. This is sketchy.  https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-limit/   If you're Packer fans join us at Red's Saloon when NFL season begins!   I just want to throw Pet Insurance in here as a possibility too. I've paid about $200/year for my cat and she's racked up bills of over $5000 already from eating a spider, a couple UTIs, and getting into some lillies (highly poisonous for cats).  I'm aware that, on average, insurance companies make money. That's why they sell their product for the price they do. Therefore, you need to do a cost-benefit analysis. I knew that I would get my cat to the vet no matter what because she's a family member to us. And I knew that, being in graduate school, I couldn't afford it if she had a big expense. Therefore I will keep insurance until I have a job where I can afford a several thousand dollar expense if need be.   This. OP should contact the trooper at his phone number and notify the trooper that he just became aware that it is against the law not to report the accident since he believes the damage will be over $1000. Unless the trooper is stupid, he won't argue at that point and OP can easily get the trooper's insurance info.   I have several friends who work at the DA and that charge is never dropped around here. I guess people in different JX's have different experiences.   Well I don't know what the charges are, but $200K bail generally means it's pretty serious, and this is not his first offense. I think it's decently likely he could get several years.  Edit: Read the article. Charges are resisting arrest, battery on a peace officer and unlawful fighting. The prosecutor will likely be out for blood for battery on a peace officer. That alone could get him several years.   Even still. I doubt Mayhem has $20K to give up.   Bail generally works where you pay a bondsman 10% of your total bail amount and they post the whole amount to the jail. However, the catch is you don't get that 10% back when you turn yourself back in to the court system for trial, like you would if you had paid the whole amount yourself. 10% USUALLY isn't that much. However, here it's $20K, so I'm inclined to agree with your original statement of "bye bye Mayhem."  Sidenote: When people skip bail (don't appear at their next court appearance), and have made bail through a bondsman, then the bondsman in some cases is entitled to bring the criminal in to receive their money back. This is where you get shows such as Dog the Bounty Hunter. He's a bail bondsman.   I don't know about pointless. I think that it works *most* of the time, just not every time, as long as you keep it to only 2-3 degrees removed from the first fight. It's not very accurate when you get to the point that Might Mouse beats Fedor like 26 fights removed, but it is pretty good if you have A beat B, B beat C, therefore A will probably beat C.  Let's look at this current scenario. Khabib beat RDA. RDA beat Cerrone. Khabib will very likely beat Cerrone. Not 100%, but it's pretty likely.   If you got 8th in your class you are likely a hard worker.  I went to a pretty hard high school and was barely out of the top 50%. I then went to UTSA for a year and focused on my studies and no partying. It was ridiculously easy. I was top of ever single one of my classes and easily had a 4.0  I say this not to brag, but to show you it is possible. If you're a hard worker and willing to put in the time, you can likely successfully CAP in. Now it's just a matter of deciding if you're willing to live in another city for a year.  Also Austin is a kick ass city with tons to do. I grew up there and it's just become better every year with ACL, SXSW, the kite festival, tons of hiking, Barton Springs, Zilker Park, 6th Street, etc. whereas I have a good friend at UNT and he hates it cause there's nothing to do.   As a Packers fan watching the Bears get rid of Marshall, the Lions get rid of Suh, and reports that the Vikings are trading AP... I'm just excited.  Edit: And with us keeping Cobb!!   Yes.   I applied every year and was never approved and I had a zero EFC every time. They just run out so fast. Everyone knows about it, unlike the article implies.   I actually threw you an upvote because while I don't agree all his competition has been crap, I think it has been a significant step down from what Johny and Lawler have been facing lately.   What card is 2% cash back?   Cause we've seen Johny and Lawler slow down significantly in 3 round fight whereas Rory is still going strong at the end of 3 rounds in pretty much all of his fights.   Dude he definitely gassed HARD in the first fight. I mean Johny did too, but not as bad. Johny won the 5th of the first fight and that was what put him over the edge.   Oh I completely forgot they just had another one. I just moved from the Austin area actually and missed that one. I was talking about the one like 5 years ago headlined by Palhares/Marquardt that ended in disappointing controversy.   I bought tickets... I wake up and pray to the injury gods every morning.  This is my second UFC event and the first was Fight Night Austin with such a disappointing ending.   Agee. But I think Rory will just have a deeper gas tank. Remember how Robbie looked dead for the majority of the last 2 rounds in the Hendricks fights? That may have been fine in those fights, but Rory don't gas like Johny.   How would anybody know not to park in the spots then? I haven't read the statute but I'm almost positive it would be illegal to tow in that scenario.   You need a breakdown of ALL expenses. You only listed housing. You're missing food, medical, gas, car insurance, pet costs, cell phone, entertainment, household costs, gifting, and anything else you spend money on.   Look at refinancing it. I've heard of Sofi but do your own research.  Also, you didn't post your budget but if you are paying $1000 for housing costs, you can probably fit all other monthly expenses into another $1000 per month. Where the heck is all your money going???  You should budget it all as low as possible then use all money to pay off your debt. I'm almost positive you could be done in 3 years.   You may actually want to look at getting a credit card. For example, the one I have gives cash back of 1% on everything and 5% in certain categories every month. All together, it works out to about 2% per month cash back. Adding up roughly what you spend (can't use it for mortgage, electric bill, or child support), that would be about $600 per year.  I just set mine to full auto-pay each month out of my account and never worry about it.  Also, I'm not sure if you have an emergency fund, but it would give you some form of payment if you had a true emergency. Say your car broke down and needed a $300 repair tomorrow. Can you pay it? What would you do in that situation. Yes, it sucks to be in CC debt, but it sucks even more if you can't pay to fix your car so you lose your job and then you lose your house because you don't have a job, etc.   I hope you got the drivers insurance information and several of the witnesses names and contact numbers.   Many times, it's the guys who are loose and having fun out there that can get inside their opponents' minds. Werdum-Fedor comes to mind where Werdum was laughing, joking, and making funny faces all fight week.   Everyone forgets Father Gabriel.   Non-military here. Why so?   Non-legal advice, but perhaps there are social services he qualifies for since he was abandoned. Maybe start with calling the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (http://www.dhs.state.pa.us/) and asking them where to go from here.   I'm saying if he walks in with a lawyer and wants a plea deal, they will likely offer him a deal where he pleads guilty to a lesser charge. In that scenario, the prosecutor will drop the original charge.  I see where my original post could be misinterpreted from my intended meaning. We both obviously know how this would work so lets stop arguing about it.   How am I an idiot? I said "if you plead guilty, they'll drop the case." What room for sarcasm is there even? By "drop the case" I mean to say they charge you with Murder 1 then plead to Murder 2, they will drop the Murder 1 charge in that case. They have to. Again, I don't even see anywhere where I could have been sarcastic. I'm not recommending anything, merely stating facts.   Well it's your weed budget for the rest of your life then.   I'm not being sarcastic.   So Chik-Fil-A makes tons of extra money, people get reheated, day old food, and you don't make any profit because you gave it all away?   I'm guessing from your phrasing that these are both already reality.   Of course they'll drop the case if you plead guilty because that's their whole goal. If they charge you with murder they'll drop that too if you plead guilty.   Dude just get a lawyer. Look at it like this: you had enough money to buy weed. Take the money you were spending on weed and spend it on a lawyer. Lots of them will do payment plans. As others have said, look for a plea deal that doesn't affect financial aid and is eligible for expungement.  	104

 why was he not searched before they took him out? Is it against his rights (I'm not lawyer or a cop)?

 Well, as someone with a kid, I cannot blame them. I wonder - how would you handle it if your kid was walking from a convenient store and ended up shot dead, and then the shooter is not only not put in prison but CONTINUES TO OWN GUNS!? Jesus fuck. Rocks and bottles do not a gun make.    How bizarre; the guy seems to attract trouble. So many arrests / violent run-ins. Dangerous human being.    Hernandez was only confirmed as the shooter through Bay County Court documents. According to court records, Hernandez was in another room of the apartment practicing form in front of the mirror and the gun  accidentally went off and went through the mirror and the wall and fatally injured the daughter, his attorney reported.  ...  Hernandez and the girls mother, Cynthia Votta, had been in and out of child custody court since 2011, according to court records. Hernandez was awarded sole custody in 2013 after Votta moved out of the home without the children, court documents indicated. In September, a circuit court judge ratified Hernandezs award of custody.         My heart goes out to the family. The horror of the two younger children watching their father and older sister massacred by someone will affect them for life, I'm a mother as well and cannot fathom, yet the fact that I do imagine it makes me work harder to ensure we put an end to this kind of terrorism we are all threatened with daily in the US. No other developed nation has this kind of crazy gun violence taking out citizens on the daily and yet not a peep from those in charge of keeping the safety. I didn't hear any politicians comment on this at all; not one mention.   As the mother's brother said, "no one needs a gun." He implored people to stop praying for an end to gun violence and take action            Thanks for the work you're doing! As a mom raising a child in America, this is my biggest concern, gun violence. No other issue takes so many American lives daily and yet is not being combatted as it should be. Imagine if ebola were killing 83 of us per day.       He's not by anyone outside the wingnut fringe of god|gun worshipers.    I Hate Huckabee   The city's police chief, Tim Styka identified the dead Monday as 33-year-old Jonathan Stoffel, of Neenah, his 11-year-old daughter, Olivia Stoffel, and 31-year-old Adam Bentdahl of Appleton. Stoffel's wife, Erin, was shot three times, but survived and is hospitalized in critical condition.  Another family ruined by this fucking plague of guns and small-brained egotistical fucks. This guy was en route to becoming a police officer and in his anger, shot and killed a child.       I did not know who she was until reading about this event. TIL she thinks Obama's dad is secretly Malcom X. Well, secret except to her.       Curious how different those months were for the fetus vs a baby in a normal active mother. Having carried my own son to term, I often had internal conversational thoughts toward him while he was in my belly, touched my belly, etc. This makes me wonder if nurses spoke into the belly, or rubbed it etc. One would hope so.    There's a strange self-flagellation in America where people almost gag-reflex statements about why things can't be nicer / better / more effective here like other places. Fuck that shit. If you can't see a better future, go work on your imagination. Don't poison the environment with blanket denial based on pessimism. I'm all for input based in fact, but if you just come to say vague negatives for why berries specific suggestions aren't for us, g'wan now.                      He's by far the best Independent running as a Democrat, anyway. I love the guy!    Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.    Any republican with sense would actually agree with this; Bernie is for the American people, the worker, the little guy, the boostrapper, doing the best for the strongest growth our country can muster. Seriously, all that shit the GOP talks but goes 180 against? This guy is the real deal.    No protections in place for American workers. [Here's a link talking about his stance on the TPP for example.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file)    I wonder if the DNC will do him the same way the congressional dems have run away from every progressive move Obama has made?    When you wear shit stained glasses, Walker looks like a rose.    Agreed! We lost some good ones when Feingold and Kucinich were out.    Agree totally, if we move in a better direction in this country, the fringe right wing will fall off, Hillary's center-right coalition will be our conservative wing, and we will have an energized progressive left that moves toward a much healthier future. I have to be optimistic after suriviving Reagan, Bush I, Shrub and the return of Shrub...it's been a sad dismal drag to the right concluding with the obstructionist klan situation that's been fucking America over at every turn.    A woman had a bullet in her neck, the third of 7 shattered window incidents. Have you got a source that this is not bullets? Do share if so. Otherwise all accounts point to an ammosexual.                               No shit. Hope they figure this out soon and before someone dies. The girl is still in the hospital who was shot last week. Fucking bullshit.       Stupid decision does not equal the theft of another's life. No one should take a life. People take drugs because our brains have receptors that often give positive feedback to the taker. If that is unacceptable in society, find a fucking civilized solution. A cage = a murder is not that solution.    Barbaric nation. Fuck the death penalty. Humans, evolve.       I hope this post is read by all.     Exactly. It's fucking despicable. I sit here with my young son and wonder WTF is going on with the USA, how fucked is it going to get?   Every human - do not shoot/beat/sever spines of people.   Every human - do not seek violent revenge.   *please*   News reports have said that James Holmes bought his arsenal legally. But did he really? The mentally ill arent supposed to own guns, and is there anyone who thinks this guy wasnt wrong in the head? He supposedly was odd enough to creep out a Colorado gun range owner.  A report last year from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that states arent doing enough to stop the mentally ill from getting firearms. After the Gabrielle Giffords shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that the bar for banning someone from owning a gun is awfully high.  Ill say the same thing I thought after Seung Hui Cho went on his murderous rampage at Virginia Tech: How about requiring a co-signer for your gun license? This could be a family member, a friend, a co-worker, anyone who could swear he knew no reason you shouldnt have a gun.        Also using appleTV as well as trying it out on my ipad / desktop - no hiccups at all. Don't have gigabit fiber, so for me this is wonderful. When I was using a friend's login and watching it as HBOgo, it did have hiccups.    Signed up. Fucking happy. I was one who bitched loudly about the lack of options for cord cutters specifically related to HBO, so I am one of the first to sign up for this. Curious how many people signed up in the first month so far...   Unfortunately we still do not question insanity before we sell ammo to people in the US.   [...Holmes had purchased over 6,000 rounds of ammunition online in the weeks leading up to the tragic shooting.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/23/james-holmes-received-amm_n_3327140.html)            Funny, American here and I frequently use sheie.    Human mountain goats. Or, Mountain Humans.    Wow, that's an incredible photo    As a single mom who is busy...basically always...I have had moments when I'm standing in the kitchen and the dishwasher is washing the dishes, the washing machine and dryer are also going, and i have a realization of how incredibly fucked I'd be without these machines. Meanwhile I can cook and code and pay my bills.    Fuck. This kind of moment is so important in understanding why everyday Germans were not able to stop the fascists. I studied the holocaust in college and remember thinking if every person in the German population had refused to go along, they Might have been able to stop it. But it would have taken a massive collective to do so.    Don't think it's a she?            At this point I am glad for how the halfwit terrorists react to kindhearted people trying to stop death. Because they will be the nail in their own coffin as we overturn 2A to end this scourge.    In the same way that ISIS wins by killing people; they terrorize and bring fear and spark death and violence.          "Shortly before 2 p.m. Graham Anthony Pittman ignored the pleas of park rangers and shot himself in the head while sitting inside his Jeep Cherokee, according to Tony Underwood, special agent in charge with the State Bureau of Investigation."   The report states that the younger Pittman, who was 28 and the father of two young children, shot himself in Morrow Mountain State Park in Stanly County, in full view of visitors, following a domestic dispute.   Rep. Pittman has championed expanding gun owner rights in the General Assembly and during his campaigns for the District 82 House seat.    Pittman is the primary sponsor of a bill filed Tuesdaythe day after his sons suicidethat would prohibit any local government employees from enforcing federal firearms laws, unless by court order. The bill, titled the Gun Rights and Privacy Act, would also repeal local prohibitions against carrying concealed weapons, and would streamline the handgun permit while traveling across state lines and to make the purchase of a firearm more efficient.       Still worth getting it on record, and cc: the white house with your message. Fuck these so-called representatives who do nothing close to representing the people.    Right. It's just a message to the plutocrats and the Klan.    Fuck the GOP. Fuck them to hell.       No one has EVER assumed I was female online unless I have a female name or image next to my name. And yet here we are.    This is the clash of very-recent history and today in the US; there are now two generations born after the civil rights fights where people were killed for trying to gain voting rights, where government officials presided over brutal treatment of blacks - obviously not to say it's "fixed", but it isn't what it was. So the term is a clusterfuck because the history of race in America is.  But even with these reminiscences, those times have the feel of distant history, of dusty newsreels and faded photographs. So the programs central focus is on what it calls the last lynching in the United States: the murder of Michael A. Donald, 19, by two young Ku Klux Klansmen in Mobile, Ala., in 1981. Or as Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, the third delegate Mr. Koppel spends time with, says, in the era of color TV.   James Knowles, one of the murderers, says on the program that he and his confederate, Henry Hays, the son of the local Klan chief, had randomly selected Mr. Donald as he was walking down a street one night. The two kidnapped him at gunpoint, then drove to a wooded area where they beat him and slit his throat. They returned to hang the body from a tree within view of the Hays family home.   The case became a landmark, though; after the men were convicted, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center brought a federal civil suit on behalf of Beulah Mae Donald, the victims mother, connecting the murder to the Klan as an organization. In 1987 the jury returned a $7 million wrongful-death judgment, bankrupting the local chapter.  from: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/arts/television/13lynch.html?_r=0         There are always commenters on these stories saying "welp, shouldn't run from the cops"  These are the same people who would sign off on concentration camps during Nazi times. Gotta be a yes man, fascist and free.    There are always commenters on these stories saying "welp, shouldn't run from the cops"  These are the same people who would sign off on concentration camps during Nazi times. Gotta be a yes man, fascist and free.    I try not to watch ISIS beheadings, or cop shooting videos - that kind of barbarism really fucks up your soul. I will however work to stop it by reading and being aware of it - not advocating ignoring, but watching such brutality is poison.    This same misogyny and harassment can also be seen with the Gunsense hashtag -- a hashtag used by gun safety advocates and Shannon Watts from Moms Demand -- a grassroots organization working for gun sense in our country. This hashtag is trolled regularly by pro-gun, NRA types which results in shameless comments. Shannon's tweets and Moms Demand tweets are also trolled non-stop.  As a matter of fact, if you say anything pro-gun safety you will be trolled -- hashtag or not -- by a legion of trolls. I have personally been the victim of that many times. But by far, nobody gets it worse than Shannon Watts of Moms Demand, and her organization. Check out her timeline on Twitter any time and you will see what I mean.           The first time that I was posted to Washington, DC some years ago, the capital and suburbs endured a frightening few days at the hands of a pair of snipers, who took to killing people at random from a shooting position they had established in the boot of a car. I remember meeting a couple of White House correspondents from American papers, and hearing one say: but the strange thing is that Maryland (where most of the killings were taking place) has really strict gun laws. And I remember thinking: from the British perspective, those arent strict gun laws. Strict laws involve having no guns.   After a couple of horrible mass shootings in Britain, handguns and automatic weapons have been effectively banned. It is possible to own shotguns, and rifles if you can demonstrate to the police that you have a good reason to own one, such as target shooting at a gun club, or deer stalking, say. The firearms-ownership rules are onerous, involving hours of paperwork. You must provide a referee who has to answer nosy questions about the applicant's mental state, home life (including family or domestic tensions) and their attitude towards guns. In addition to criminal-record checks, the police talk to applicants family doctors and ask about any histories of alcohol or drug abuse or personality disorders.   Vitally, it is also very hard to get hold of ammunition. Just before leaving Britain in the summer, I had lunch with a member of parliament whose constituency is plagued with gang violence and drug gangs. She told me of a shooting, and how it had not led to a death, because the gang had had to make its own bullets, which did not work well, and how this was very common, according to her local police commander. Even hardened criminals willing to pay for a handgun in Britain are often getting only an illegally modified starters pistol turned into a single-shot weapon.   And, to be crude, having few guns does mean that few people get shot. In 2008-2009, there were 39 fatal injuries from crimes involving firearms in England and Wales, with a population about one sixth the size of Americas. In America, there were 12,000 gun-related homicides in 2008.         Officials didn't release any names and said it was unclear whose gun the boy used.   Well then their work is cut out for them. Track. That. Shit.                              	100
 1. Working for Cracked was less pleasant for me pretty much across the board. Meaner editors, often terrible feedback (admittedly because they had more pitches to read so they felt they had to skim a lot) and political agendas for lists I didn't agree with.  2. I could write what I wanted for Cracked, but it was pretty much all spec until they posted that it was approved.    1. Once. It was a guy covered in fake plant stuff like he was cosplaying Swamp-Thing and holding a flower. I said "Guilty over his part in the Kennedy Assassination, the Grassy Knoll became a hippy."  2. It didn't win.    1. I'm fine with it as long as they give links and credit to artists, and try to include actual research and commentary on it.  2. That said, my favorite site like that (other than Listverse of course) is clickhole.com.    Seeing it. I assume what happened was during a period when my brain was developing my sex drive while I was really young, I saw it happening in some cartoon and that somehow got mixed in with my impulses.   But as far as I know, that might be debunked Freudianism.    1. I never would think Cracked going "SJW" is one of its problems. I'd say it's real problems is when it reports inaccurately for the sake of clicks. Jason "David Wong" Pargin has numerous articles full of complete bullshit if you actually research them (particularly his private obsession with insisting being overweight is untreatable except through surgery, which his own sources don't condone anymore, or his "Monkeysphere" article.) If a writer reports honestly and gives the facts accurately, it doesn't matter to me what their agenda is.  2. I assume that was a dig at J. F. Sargent. Well, he was always nice to me but I remember a lot of factual holes being poked in his article about video game prejudices. I haven't read much by him since that I can remember, so I don't know if he does more thorough fact-checking now.  3. I think Cracked is way better than it used to be.  Much as people get all nostalgic for 2007, that was when Cracked reported straight up horseshit sometimes because they didn't have to cite sources or when Pargin would say a suicide note without a suicide was "gay."    fwiw, it doesn't really bother me either but I only tell people about it online.   Best thing about FA is it means you've got nothing to lose socially!   There was no *like* about it!   1. Probably because I saw it in cartoons a lot during my sexual development.  2. Eh, why not?    1. If Cracked's editors accept one of your articles, they make you fill out a form with your tax information and such before issuing you a payment through paypal, which is a one time thing.  2. Jamie Frater at Listverse just makes you fill out a form granting him rights to the list and then sends you payment through paypal.    You're welcome.    Yes. I said it was weird.    Sigh.   I'm thinking Twi's new castle will feel a lot colder and less homey by comparison.    Hey Mr. Baruchel, was making This is the End fun or mostly a pain?    Yeah I could. I just have to draw it or pay someone to.   I know, jk.    Eh, it's just a matter of conditioning too. You can use associative training to induce phobias or whatever. Same thing, except generally accidental.    Can he swing From a web?    Seeing cartoon characters inflate like balloons.   Incidentally, I was going to be interviewed by former Cracked writer Ian Fortey about that for a book he's working on, but that seems to have fallen through.    What about that doesn't make sense? It's about your brain forming a connection between a certain thing and stimulus.    I think Kurt Vonnegut said he tried to do the same thing with Slaughterhouse Five.    1. I got banned from Cracked from mentioning in a comment section that the editorials sometimes are disdainful of contributors and suggesting that they recruit new writers because they pay them less than the veteran writers.  2. Yes, they often alter written articles. I've had my points about people completely flipped because editorial thought it would fit the tone they wanted better. I would have preferred they just send it back to me with a "do over" note as that would have encouraged me to do more proofreading at a younger age.    1. Never read an issue of Cracked, I just read the site.  2. I do remember reading Mad magazine in sixth grade, that was pretty sweet.    1. I find my own ideas at Listverse and Cracked. Cracked occasionally kind of assigned articles, but that was primarily for columnists.  2. Hmm... Probably the one above about obsession art is my strangest list.    1. Listverse doesn't force a comedic tone that their high turn out means will become samey and kinda grating after awhile.  2. As a writer, Listverse is much more open in terms of ideas they publish. I'd never have gotten the film inventor article published at Cracked unless I'd become a columnist.  3. Listverse doesn't force in certain prejudices against acceptable targets. The fetish art article above would have had a much more judgmental tone if Cracked had accepted it instead.  4. As a reader, Listverse puts all its content on one page.  5. As far as I know, Adam Tod Brown isn't an editor at Listverse.    1. I got banned from Cracked from mentioning in a comment section that the editorials sometimes are disdainful of contributors and suggesting that they recruit new writers because they pay them less than the veteran writers.  2. Listverse pays less per article, but for me it's been such a better experience that if I'd known what I was getting into I would have quit Cracked long ago in favor of them.    I have one that I think most people would find incomprehensible instead of creepy. It's the type that gets mocked on Somethingawful and Encyclopedia Dramatica every once in awhile. As ridiculous as it might seem, it cuts down on the need for a human sexual companion a bit, which as someone who has the lack of confidence that some psychologists believe leads to a fetish anyway, is out of the question for me anyway.   You too?    http://listverse.com/2015/01/20/10-provocative-works-of-art-based-on-one-persons-obsession/  I like how the title tries to dance around it not being fetish art but the article is really blatant about it.   Pretty sure it's actually all SFW, but why risk it?   She'll still just zone out during foreplay.    Literal pointing and laughing when I fell in a river during a hike during a school camping trip.   Holy shit does remembering this ever make me feel less alone.    I've gone on a study tour of Vietnam, done rock climbing in Texas, swam in the Pacific Ocean and tried to surf (seawater is some nasty shit.) I've tried going on bar crawls and gone to fancy restaurants and hotels.  Never while doing any of these was I happier than when I watched a movie I enjoyed.     This is actually kind of old and someone did tell this very rude person how to leave the group. I didn't include that in the screencap because it wasn't funny.    Of course not.    I'd just prematurely ejaculate and then wait for her to leave.    I've gone on adventures. They've all sucked. Expensive, uncomfortable, often very annoying because they involved sitting around waiting for something or led to something disappointing.   I don't envy the adventurous.    I just saw Selma and it got me wondering if there were situations in, say, Russia where after the serfs were freed police or soldiers had to be dispatched because certain local governments would not free slaves or grant the freed slaves their basic rights?   I don't know if the fact that in U.S. history it is generally understood that it took a civil war to end slavery while most other nations ended it without a war makes that country anomalous.    Yes. If I had the money, I would have myself chemically castrated.          Women drinking when they're looking for casual sex. I am not saying women who have bad experiences as a result of their impaired states deserve anything at all that happens to them but I don't understand why you'd do that in such a risky situation. It just seems to increase the risk of being assaulted, contracting an STD and/or getting impregnated, or having sex with someone you wouldn't want to if you were sober. It's like going out snowmobiling but intentionally worsening the steering or smearing your visor in advance.    Why would anyone take life seriously? Horrible people are on top for completely unjust reasons. People get away with crimes all the time. And it's all effectively pointless since eventually we're all going to die and be forgotten no matter what. You'd have to be stoned off some endorphin or another to take something like that seriously.    God is Hyperbole and a Half ever the most overrated thing on the internet. Obvious points made slowly interrupted by unoriginal comics crappily drawn.    Bring Pinkie Pie into the cave of wonders? What could go wrong?   Wait, why was the human pretending to be asleep to annoy Pinkie?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5nlAkArpOQ  Speculative fiction (sort of) about why humanity has never made contact with sapient life from other worlds.    I wonder what the bottom 100 were.       Mason has come unstuck in time.    Now I feel bad that I made Matt feel bad because it made me uncomfortable when he made a joke. It's a vicious cycle of bullshit.    It's an order.    I can rant on it if you really want.       Have you ever seen some extra try adlibbing a funny line to get a raise?          How does this not already have 8000 upvotes?   Oh, they must have forgotten to tweet or share a link to this thread.    Bet that guy's going to post a SO RANDOM vine to /r/videos with the same story.    Yes. As tempting as courting the progressives and the LGBT community might be, Disney is well aware that conservative countries and the heartland are their bread and butter so they'll make sure to squash those homophobic complaints.    That short is so great, then we get a good look at this goofy-looking monster.       "I'm unemployed, but I've got it way better than these people."             Prejudiced against people without faces? You facist.    I don't believe labels to be an effective sorter.       Wow, is he ever bitter-looking.    /r/badass   Never go to Norway, /r/creepy. You'd all have heart attacks by the end of the first day, apparently.          http://youtu.be/2Qy4EIvvVj4?t=14s   It's more boring than sappy.   "We hit an animal and didn't injure it much."          Bill Murray doesn't show up until half way in it and isn't particularly good, from what I've heard:   http://www.filmthreat.com/features/79089/   Russo-Finnish *Platoon*.    I've heard you were a real jerk during the recording and that they had to chase you around with the microphone. Aren't you ashamed of your behavior?    FO:E is still a huge downer. But then, so is pretty much all post-apocalyptic stuff.    Oh, so suddenly hanging out in a kid's bedroom makes you a "creep!"    http://listverse.com/2015/01/11/10-fascinating-facts-about-steven-spielberg/  A few of these I was genuinely surprised I'd never heard of before, like the whole marijuana thing and the toilet movie. By the way, has anyone ever heard of Arnold Spielberg outside of in relation to his son?    The deer eyes are so distinctive that they made it so that I had to take a few moments to study the reverse and see that it's supposed to look like a seal when it's flipped.    Certainly not. I don't mean to be snobbish, but even as a kid, I felt "huh, this Harry guy is just like another chosen one" since I'd already seen The Matrix and Star Wars and that was a bit of a hurtle to ever getting too immersed in it.    I'm trying to be offended, but honestly, I think they look too well done for that.    It feels like it doesn't really honor the man properly if it's not somehow equipped with devices that kill anyone that touches it.    Creepy nothing! That looks awesome!    For what it's worth, I was quoting an alternate take from that scene.    I've seen numerous ads for them and became curious what you guys would have to say about them.    Can something be disturbing but not creepy?             I ain't that good.    SPOILER: It turns out in Amazing Amy that Amy frames the boy she has a crush on for murdering her. Makes it even more embarrassing for Nick that he didn't see that coming.      http://listverse.com/2015/01/09/10-frightening-facts-about-horror-movies/  I think the thing about losing 184 calories by watching The Shining is a bit dubious but overall it's pretty neat.       I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good.   For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.    There really are better ways to store all the teeth you collect.    Thank you for your apology.    Personal Landmark anecdote: I was going to attend one of their recruiting events, but I overslept and missed it.   It was a time in my life where I was too much of a fuckup to get swindled.    Finally! The gritty Toy Story reboot!         What's so badass about that? I thought that was one of the early signs Walt was actually the villain of the show. It's just random, petty destructiveness.    I admit I'm a latecomer to the fanbase, but from what I understand, it was a low-rated show for the first few seasons until Gus became a major player. That's around the time that Walt and Jessie stop being compelling bumblers and start becoming quotable criminals that fans start finding "cool" and such. Is this impression correct?       MPAA rating calls "shenanigans."    Youtube ads. I like the thought that my checking out their video made my favorite channel a tiny amount of money, so I'll just open another tab and do something else until the ad's over.       Isn't this more like a fish ranch than a fish farm?   That was just an excuse for saying thank you for doing something that we'll need more of as a species soon. It must have been very difficult to develop.       And the officer says "Here, let me bail you out of it." And then he takes the guy to jail for the night.    How did you not know that's what Legend of the Overfiend is?         It was about the prom date that took the brooch and hung out with other guys.       It honestly kind of made me uncomfortable when Donnelly called that woman a cunt.          Not from what I heard. For example, when they were talking about how the past wasn't as sophisticated as we remember, they just mention the things from the articles (Police magazine existed, Sugar Sugar was a #1 hit, etc.) with no further analysis besides saying "Now, you think THIS, but..."    The climax and ending of this movie just don't work, I don't care how meta the ridiculous of the movie is supposed to be. It's rushed, too silly to be invested in anymore, and unsatisfying.    I never thought this image really worked since the way it's cropped it looks like it could so easily be faked.    I assume that's New Zealand dollars, cause I heard those trees only cost $500 American.    I'll buy that for a dollar.       A lot of it just seems to be stuff recycled from the articles.       I remember there being a lot of snot in this movie which really grossed me out as a kid.    Between this one and the Fluttershy booping herself one, I like to think there's a running theme developing of the ponies being embarrassed by their human equivalents.    I know and have listened to multiple people who love bad movies in person and through podcasts. They will talk about generally traditionally masculine subjects like sports and the like, but when they talk about bad old movies, they won't shut up about hairstyles. Like if they mention Road House or some bad cult movie from the 1980s, mullets and such will come up. I have heard so much about the rat tail Anakin Skywalker has from people that hate the prequels, 1970s hairstyles for movies from that decade, and so on. I have never heard people talk about this in regards to good movies.  What's the deal?    No, that's why I asked.    Is this spec?       If he had hit that cub and the mom went after him, he'd probably still be able to pedal away from her pretty easily, right?   But that crowd is going to stereotype everyone anyway, and hey, at least if the documentary existed it would indicate we're willing to admit those members of it exist.    Winter is infinitely more uncomfortable than it is beautiful. Much as I love this movie, it is in the top three Disney movies I would least want to be in.   The other two are Mulan because of the mountain scene and The Little Mermaid because I would drown quickly.    I heard the guys on Retsupurae complaining that Unexpected is too biased towards positivity and The Dissolve had the same complaint about BT, so would you be interested at all if someone made one about the clopping, gore fics, bullying, and so on? I imagine getting the cooperation of the subjects might be a little harder or involve more deception.    At this rate, eventually they'll go a live action The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and it'll all be worth it.    Roth and company are too embarrassed to admit this, but the only copy of the movie got locked in a time capsule.    The Rumpus Room was lost forever when the house went into the sinkhole in the movie.    Crap. This actually bothered me. I might need a pony hiatus.  Starting tomorrow.    Pretty much everyone else in the world saw Inception, right?    Isn't every pony "______butt" then? Why did the fans nickname her specifically Sunbutt?     That's the most generic comment I've ever seen on any genre. I've seen this said about anime, comic books, comic book movies, tv shows, folk music, etc. There will always be people who dislike the way things currently are because they don't realize there was lots of forgotten junk in the past and think the past was better because only the classics remain.   Name any era of horror and there's lots of obscure terrible content that can be pointed to as evidence that at that time people weren't exploring its potential.       Isn't he modelled after one of the writers?    I wonder how much licensing a show costs.    But Yoda said that the dark side isn't stronger. If the show was part of the dark side, the light side would just get its ass kicked.       http://knowledgenuts.com/2015/01/02/when-meat-was-more-deadly-than-combat/  This probably wasn't anywhere near the first or only time this happened, but it seemed to be the time with the most social impact.    1. Boredom. Scenes that do not add to the characters, story, or tone and which are only there to stretch the movie to feature length.  2. Annoying characters included either as comic relief or because people being shrill is supposed to be relatable.    Are you making a timelapse video?    That is some passive-aggressive, convoluted revenge.    Just yesterday foal Fluttershy posted a tutorial on how to mouse!      Eh, honestly I found it kind of boring. It had all the trappings of fun sci-fi but it just didn't know what to do with it.    What a twist. It's like Psycho.       I will stand by my belief that it's so over-the-top it circles back around and becomes funny again. Somewhere around the pointless electrocution.    I'm really looking forward to an all-female cast for this one!      Rarity felt like throwing up a second, smaller Fluttershy is how that's possible.

 So why do these people "like" Xbox on facebook if they're just going to do this?   I answer my phone with Ahoy-hoy, just like Mr. Burns.   In regards to physical media, how do I lose my games if my Wii U quits working on me?  I can still just buy a new system, just like I would have to do with the PS4 or Xbox1, and play all the games I previously purchased.   Can't say I've ever seen Father of the Bride.  But here's [Animaniacs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6_b0qhjpg) episode it's also in.   Hell yeah, Animainiacs reference!!   Makes you feel like you're defusing a bomb with all those colored ends.   I'm pretty sure it was asking what the worst game you've ever played was.  Otherwise you're just going off of what other people have said.   I have mostly stuck with just watching the Star Wars movies. But my friend said his 10 year old daughter asked this question about characters names in the Clone Wars. I tried doing some searching myself but can't seem to find anything.      Hey, I actually beat someone this weekend then with my 105!   All 5 of those guys are above 20 on ESPN so it has to be a different site.   I'm still surprised that Benny Parsons and Red Byron haven't been inducted yet!   I honestly think 5 per year is too many.  In 10 years the requirements to be on the ballot are going to be pretty low if you ask me.  Nascar doesn't have large teams like other sports do which gives them more options to pick from each year.   I'm still surprised Benny Parsons hasn't been inducted yet!   Two of my favorites are "Hold on" by Korn and "Lose Yourself" by Eminem.  I tend to prefer more upbeat paced songs for my entire runs too.   I've been there several times and as long as you're about 20 rows up or more you can see the entire track fine pretty much anywhere.  From there it's basically what part of the track you would prefer to sit near for the different action.   So are you trying to deplete all your funds within the first few races?  Haha   I don't see Gordon doing a part time schedule along the lines of Mark Martin.  If anything I think he would be in just a handful of races a year if he did go the part time route.   I had that about 2 years ago with a group of kids about 10 years old.  I thought to myself, "do they even know who Forrest Gump is?"   Would this be it? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSOI1nvXuJQ   To go along with this, if a number is slanted forward on the drivers side, then it will be slanted backwards on the pasengers side of the car.  They keep the standard look of the number regardless of where it's placed on the car.   I'm pretty sure Jeff Hammond is just FOX's bitch and they send him to the worst spots around the track to do a 10 second segment just to fuck with him.   I don't mind Bowyer myself, but for some reason my brother just hates him.   That's true, but if you think about it, while the air titans are on the track that would most likely mean that the surface is too wet to even want to have the cars out there yet to help dry it.   I wish I was BIG!!      Ha, now that would be interesting to see. Actually I just want to see Jr. Wreck.   Thanks. That's what I was looking for.   I know Hamlin would get the points for the race since he starts, but who,s name would actually be listed as the race winner?   I agree.  If he wins 2 races he'll essentially be in the chase since the guys he mostly racing against for 20th are second tier teams.  And the past 2 years with the wild card only had 1 driver each year with more than 1 win not in the top 10.   I went with 2 of my brothers last year and we got there around 3pm.  It would have been sooner, but my brothers aren't too motivated to get up in the morning and our hotel was in downtown Charlotte.  We didn't have any trouble with parking.  It was about half a mile south of the track in a free lot.  I would recommend getting there sooner though if you feel like walking around and being able to check out a good amount of the stuff there.   When someone says that NASCAR isn't a sport because it's just cars driving in circles, I usually bring up the fact that they are just dumbing down what is actually going on.  If you explain basketball or football like that, then both of those sports are just running up and down a court/field tossing a ball around.  Doesn't sound too exciting that way.  Same with baseball, it's just guys standing around 95% of the time scratching themselves with someone throwing a ball every once in a while.  At least in NASCAR there's action going on 100% of the time during a race.  Granted some of the action is better than other times.  But essentially no other type of sport can make that claim.  Another point I'll make is that the majority of the NASCAR driversa are just as in shape, if not better, than a lot of athlese in other sports.  If this doesn't get through to them to at least acknowledge you have to be athletic to race, then they are just being ignorant.   I would say pretty much anything by Pantera except this song.  Mostly because it's the ONLY song by them that a radio station will play.   My brother and I still think of the rocking chairs that FOX gave both Mark and Rusty in 2005 for their retirements.  Rusty has been rocking away in his chair just waiting on Mark to retire and finally use his too.   I noticed this in the Texas race results too.  Except Dave Blaney was one of the 4 in a row.   Can someone tell me why Truex was penalized on pit road earlier? I thought the announcers said it was because the crewmen weren't over the wall before he left the pit stall.  But I've never heard of that before.   Brilliant!   I didn't think they were picked as the random car for inspection for the races after Talladega.  I thought NASCAR said they were going to inspect his car along with the other standarad cars that get picked.   I'll be down there this weekend for my first Martinsville dogs.      I think it's entirely possible.  Through 5 races he currently has 145 points, and Ryan Newman in 20th has 121 points.  If you figure the person in 20th roughly doubles their points over the next 5 races that would give them 242.  So Hamlin would only be maybe 100 points out of 20th when he returns.  He will need 2 wins for sure, possibly 3 to get a wild card spot in the chase though.      I would have to say the [T-Rex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkEVKzZNQDY) is the best demo on the original Playstation.   Hopefully it's not rain for the entire day.  Then we can finally see the new track dryers in action!      You have an initial budget of $100 and need to buy 5 drivers.  You can either try to buy 5 guys in the middle of the pack to have an overall good group.  Or you can spend the big bucks and get a top driver or two, but then sacrafice it by having to pick at least one lower level crappy driver to be able to afford all of them.  If your driver's value goes up, then you can sell them at a higher level than you bought them at and your entire salary cap increases.  For example: You buy someone that costs $20 and after 3 weeks they now are worth $21.  If you sell them, then your total salary cap will go up by $1.  But the same is true for drivers who go down in value.  You can sell them at a loss and take a hit, or you can try to ride them out and hope their value goes back up.     Walmart almost decided to become a primary sponsor for Jeff Gordon just a few years [ago](http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2010-08-24/walmart-in-negotiations-to-sponsor-jeff-gordon).  Not sure on the reason off hand for why the decided against it.   I doubt walking from the track to call a cab would make much difference.  At least I wouldn't think so from the way things looked to me last year.   My brothers and I went to the All Star race and Coke 600 last year for the first time.  Our hotel was downtown Charlotte and we drove to each of the races.  Basically for driving I took it easy to drive back each night.  Cooler sized for the track are 14" cube and it can be a hard or soft cooler.  As for leaving, once the race was over we hung out around our poarking lot for about 45 minutes which is about when traffice was starting to get thinner in our lot (still a LOT faster than Michigan takes to clead out).  So a cab probably won't work the best for leaving the track.  If your hotel is in the track area, you may be able to just walk the distance depending on where it is of course.   Wow, I don't know how I never realized that from all the times I've watched it.   * Korn - Follow the Leader * Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine * Live - Throwing Copper   It's plumber action man!   Not really a big party or anything, but about 12 or so people were in my apartment drinking when I was in college.  The outside doors were closed since it was fairly cold outside.  Someone came in and went straight to the kitchen fridge.  He heads back out the door with our ketchup in his hands and says "now all I need to do is find a hot dog" and left.  We were all just kinda in shock wondering what the heck just happened.   Women shopping for groceries.   Agreed.  I was thinking the same thing.   I agree the new setup is terrible.  I use Jayski.com and msn.com for most of my news.  And for some odds and ends stuff I go to racing-reference.info   MY MANWICH!   Fuck you replacement friends!   What about the mornings you don't wake up?   I believe I did.   Kind of the opposite with a city boy moving to the country side, but Son in Law.  Pauly Shore!!   And it still is a number.      Ikaruga on the Gamecube   Or possibly live out a real life Idiocracy.      While I find this stuff interesting, can anyone explain how a telescope like this can be focused on such a specific area for hours as the article mentions?  Wouldn't the rotation of the earth have an effect on it?  	67
 Ah yes, the Normal Things store. Of course, that is where I go to get my normalpornfornormalpeople  	1
 Makers of beer do need microbiologists with sensory training. Brewmaster microbiologists can easily identify strains of yeast or bacteria just by smell.  As this paper showed, microbiologists could also help with brewery design, especially microbreweries  - as building materials, spatial area, indoor conditions  such as airflow, humidity, and personnel traffic - are all very important.             True, you can use only ingredients you want. Traditional breads and pitas don't have emulsifiers. Italian chocolate Domori doesn't have them either.  	5
 More details: It is Polish minister of defence - Tomasz Siemoniak  And on the right Polish president - Bronisaw Komorowski.  Reaction is to statement that new NATO force HQ is going to be located in Poland - however later on he said that was because of wrong translation - and he have hear "forces will be located where they will be needed".     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojVsXB12zC8  Same + great music.   Every time I look at all those people in the background I'm all like "Do you even pray Duarte??"      http://gfycat.com/AmusedNastyGlowworm      [Obligatory with the flag, 'mreica!](http://i.imgur.com/QmRtr8L.jpg)  EDIT: relevant nick above.   Anybody with white PBTs can say how fast they get dirty?  I was always wondering about that.  EDIT: I just realized that somebody already ask that question, but didn't get any answer about getting dirty.   Yes, it is good, same as Rapid - just full size layout.  In that price tag you wouldn't find anything better. You can also look up rosewill rk 9000, which is also considerate as one with good quality/price ratio.    You didn't specify layout, as I'm a TKL guy...  CoolMaster Quickfire Rapid - good, "standard", cheap (one of cheapest), and same manufacture as Filco.  Other than that - Leopold 660M, to Europe is one of cheapest options if you like such layout. So which keyboard is "the cheapest" depends on that where you live.  For example in Poland SteelSeries is one of cheapest (90$), and next is Razer BW Tournament (120$). In Europe you should also check Das Keyboard as it might be good option to go.   Whoa, that is interesting! Look at "mayo, mayonnaise" and it seems that mayo comes from ~1860!       Yeah, I'm fully aware that system of ratings is "dumb" and Google could easily make it better, but still it doesn't justify such garbarage reviews.  What's more I also get review such "Hello" (1-star), and "You won't look at it if I gave 5 stars. Great app!" (1-star).  Which was pretty sad for me as I also read 5 star ones.   Sorry but Google Play doesn't scroll down to review itself. [Here is pic of it.](http://imgur.com/oLlCYjs.jpg)      You should be able to do so.   Because it uses Google Calendar as source of information of you events in next 12 hours. And if you don't have it - app won't get that information.   I will!  I'm very eager to do that, and as well I'm going to IO so... it would be done as soon as they are going to release it.   Thanks I will test few configurations on my friends mobile, and include that in next update.  However less pixel density widgets in app (settings, and list of widgets) is done on purpose.   Please specify phone details, I will see because there is small algorithm that adapts resolution of drawing to your phone. Because otherwise on 1/4 devices you would get errors, memory overflow etc.   Did you updated from previous version? If yes please reinstall - for some people it was solution, however I tested and didn't notice it. If not please mail me(mail is in the app), describe step by step what you do and where it fails, also please specify details of phone/system. **I would appreciate all of people who have such issue to do that** - as I would love to solve it but it is as a riddle because on my 5 test phone everything is ok.   Maybe some of you remember [my widget \(12Hours\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tajchert.hours) that I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1uvt84/made_a_clockwidget_with_events_marked_as_colored/) 4 months ago.  After a long time I have done bigger update that add thinks such:  * Languages (Polish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French). *  **More than one instance of a widget** - go and put 12Hours everywhere! *  Second custom touch action for a widget. *  **Custom colors!** *  New skins (and more yet to come). *  Wizard when adding a widget * Optimization and code cleaning so next features will take less time.  I know that there is still much to do, but would love (as last time) feedback and advice on what features I should focus on, and what you would like to change.  That is my "thank you" for you guys, as only because of you it became popular (around 130k downloads).  disclaimer I would take a look at each (even down voted ones) ideas and opinions but things will be implemented not earlier then 2-3 weeks, because I discovered (by making that widget) that it isn't good to write code in a rush./disclaimer  EDIT: I have made some **G+ group** with access to beta releases and to discuss new functionality, submit your layout to include into app etc. -[HERE](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108716578003125422667)   If you are a tech person - check out smart.exea.pl  Is it worth moving there? It depends in what sector you are looking for a work.         Can you provide link to that group buy? It looks quite interesting and if price ain't high - well, why not?   The same as any other subject but it is a wrong subject.   I would suggest as most people here - go for it, as it is best moment to do so at your life (and later on it would be only worst). But don't rely on nursing job in Poland - English teacher would be a better choice, and if possible try to merge those two - look at Medicover/Lux Med (private clinics) as they possibly are looking for such people (or maybe translating medical literature to Polish, or teaching medical students).  Good luck!   So... like any cinema in Europe?  Only booze is 18+ not 21.      Seriously?  Aren't websites for that? Like providing information about you, your portfolio, projects etc. you know, stuff like that...  Are we going to spam Google Play with thousands of our portfolios apps?   Sobieski   FTFY        	34
 I am currently building my PC (most of my parts havent arrived yet).  I got my monitor and I used an HDMI cable to attach it to my xbox 360 in order to test it out.

Born to an Indian mother and Serbian father, Richard M. Milanovich grew up in poverty in Palm Springs, living in a shack and receiving government handouts of surplus food. He served as in infantryman in the United States Army from 1960-1963, and later returned to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Reservation to engage in tribal politics. The first function Milanovich had in the tribal hierarchy was the post of the tribal secretary, but eventually he was elected Chairman of the Tribal Council in 1984. He won the Indian elections thanks to his plan of agrarian reform in the territory of Indian reservations. Under his leadership, Cahuilla Indians regained a large portion of land that belonged to them and on their territory they began opening hotels and casinos that brought them great profit. Through his vision and leadership, the Agua Caliente Band became the most prosperous group of Indians in the United States         ,  .        ,              .      -  1960.  1963. ,             ,          .          ,   1984.  ,    .               .   ,                            .     ,          .  http://www.eserbia.org/people/society-and-politics/330-richard-milanovich  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrZc4abfAE feature=youtu.be   Don Juan   I think it was the jew who has stolen the ice cream from adolf when they were kids...

 Amazing transformation. How differently do people respond to you now as opposed to then?   She clearly says this is not my client.  Where? The article and news report both state he was her client.  Edit: Also, as to your third point, they were clearly outside of court and likely had just attended some sort of preliminary hearing. What authority backs up your assertion that this scenario qualifies as an "ongoing police investigation"? I ask because your admonition about commenting without knowing the law implies that you yourself actually do.   Wow. That is absolutely absurd. This cop needs to be fired yesterday.   I know several who seem to think their opposition to marriage equality makes them more acceptable to mainstream society.  Plea for acceptance essentially (and unfortunately).   I submitted a claim about my watch and forwarded about a dozen pictures (as requested). I have not received any response despite following up every week for 4 weeks. Not even an acknowledgement of receipt.  I opted out of arbitration so will be sending Motorola a demand letter this week, followed by a lawsuit, to enforce the warranty.  Their customer service is shit in my experience. Utter shit.   Mods, please delete. The other thread is better sourced.   I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion judges in this area are elected.  Edit: Nope, looks like my suspicion was incorrect.   This doesn't surprise me. I post all the time but rarely publicly.  Do people post publicly on Facebook on a regular basis (non-celebrities and such)?   _Directly_ create 140 jobs. Those people will participate in the economy which will create additional jobs. The local businesswoman quoted in the article is an example of this.   bench slapped  I've been using "judicial smackdown" but I'll be using this from now on.   He said "many", and he's correct. A sizeable percentage of Americans watch it like it is the Bible on TV.   I agree. Those of us with a fine, South-Augusta-redneck pedigree couldn't be happier about the prospect.   That's not why I use it. There are great communities on Google+.   I assume its manufacturing based on the proposed location, but I really have no idea.  There's a local redditor who works for The Augusta Chronicle but I forget his name. Perhaps he has some info.      Don't forget the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Take each one of the enumerated powers and add every power necessary and proper to exercise them and you have the full breadth of federal power.  Given the history of the Confederate States, that power is large by design.   I use it as a phone book. Easy to just write the first few letters of a name.   I may be interested but not for a few months. I'm currently running each morning and using my diet to shed fat. I plan on getting back into the gym around late Spring/early Summer.  I am a member at Anytime and will be looking to workout in the mornings. If you've found a partner, perhaps I could join y'all.   It has been limping along for years (at least two foreclosure sales). Without this partnership, the PI may have been lost completely.      I just can't wrap my head around how anyone can believe both (1) their god is a loving, just god and (2) their god condones execution of children for watching soccer.   The Book Tavern   I say 6-3. The CJ may vote with the majority so he can write the opinion.   Damn that's beautiful.   The 12th Amendment arguably prevents this. You're not eligible to run for the Vice Presidency unless you're eligible to run for the Presidency.   I didn't realize until yesterday (for whatever reason) that it works alongside Gmail and doesn't _replace_ it. Tried it out last night and it looks promising.   I think that's an exception. Same goes for Nacho Mama's.   It's funny how you don't realize something is structurally annoying like this until someone else says it. That button needs to be moved.   Oh shit. I was resisting inbox but this makes me rethink that.   Let's all remember this when competition forces them to provide decent service. When fiber comes to Augusta, Comcast won't be able to keep me as a customer even if they offer it to me for $1/month.   Huh - color me shocked. Maybe they did do it intentionally, haha. (But not out of support for marriage equality, but out of a desire to put this issue to rest once and for all.)   My point is that the Sixth's decision may end "justice delayed" quicker than it would have ended otherwise. Without a split, it would have undoubtedly taken longer than June 2015 for all Americans to obtain marriage equality.  Do I think the Sixth intentionally created a split because they secretly support marriage equality? No.   And Spanish. But that's the joke.   I guess it depends where. I have great coverage and 4G.   I don't understand why people don't use Sprint. Literally. I don't understand. Everyone I personally know who doesn't bitches about data caps and expensive plans, yet refuses to switch to Sprint. My cousin wasn't responding to my texts and I finally found out he turns data off or something. I don't even know where to turn data off...  It's mind-boggling to me.   Scumbag Sixth Circuit is actually Good Guy Sixth Circuit.   Chiron Technology Services just [announced](http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2015-01-16/cybersecurity-contractor-opens-center-augusta?v=1421425394) an office in West Augusta.      General incumbency "stickiness" applies to judges, too. And since the public rarely sees anything they do (unlike a legislator who has an easily accessible voting record), it takes a massive screw up for the public to form a negative opinion about a judge.   Even assuming that is done in every election, I highly doubt enough people read it to beat out the legal community.   As long as the term is long enough, this really won't be a problem. It doesn't have to be a lifetime appointment but as long as it's long enough for there to be turnover in the legislative and executive branches, the pandering will end the day the judge is sworn in.    It is not unforeseeable that community leaders would just appoint judges who will do what they want.  The governor of the state would likely be the person appointing judges. Judicial elections are awful. Generally, the electorate has no idea who is a good judge or who would make a good judge. The end result is that the local legal community (i.e., the "community leaders" you fear would be in charge were judges appointed) decides who wins. And that is a very tainted process.  Edit: I'd also like to point out that many states - like mine - have a hybrid system. If a judge retires before the expiration of his or her term, the Governor appoints his or her replacement. What's the net effect? Almost every judge retires before the end of their term. And since incumbent judges almost never lose, we essentially have an appointment process already.  Edit2: Also, even assuming races will be competitive, what is the likely pool of candidates? Attorneys. This means that if you run against a judge or lose in an open election, you run the risk of facing a less-than-favorable judge in court. This greatly discourages competitive races in places where judges are elected.   Alright, reddit. Tell me why this one isn't anything to get excited about.   Man I thought Thomson was set to be the next city absorbed into "Augusta". How fast is shit growing out there?!   Why do you think that follows?   This is just how we do things here.  No it isn't. _See_, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. How we _actually_ do things here is to weigh rights versus state interests. If your religion requires that you murder your child for being raped, that is outweighed by the state's interest in preventing murder.  It's a complicated constitutional area but a good starting place is to Google "levels of scrutiny constitutional law".   None of the rights in the Constitution is absolute. For example, your religion may sanction honor killing, but murder is still illegal and that doesn't violate the First Amendment.  Southern Baptists thought interracial marriage violated their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean interracial couples must cede their rights to marriage equality.  It's a lot more complicated than your post implies.   You can contact the Ronald McDonald House. Also, the Augusta Pride festival always needs volunteers.   Don't you get it? Ending segregation was way more racist than segregation itself.   Every business benefits from the public. My gay tax dollars help fund the massive Navy that allows a basement business to get widgets for 5 cents each.   Requiring tolerance of intolerance is a false equivalence. There is most definitely a relevant distinction between wanting a cake that is pro-slavery versus one that is pro-Civil Rights.  We don't have to pretend that all views are equal. We can disagree, but some views are less valuable (pro-baby rape, for example).   I guess I just don't see it. I'm born and raised as well (except for school) but my parents attended Augusta College, as have countless friends and family.  To me, it's just a name. I also don't get upset when people do whatever to the American flag. It's just a flag. And if the choice is between a great school without "Augusta" in its name, and a lesser school with it, I would choose the former without a thought. I don't think that was the choice but damned if everyone wasn't ready to torpedo the merger just to save the name.  And you're right, I don't have much patience for Augusta hate. But I don't see this as having anything to do with that. Georgia State, Georgia Southern, UGA, Mercer, Emory, etc., don't include the name of the city they are in, so it's not like Augusta was being singled out.  As for the level of involvement, I don't think it's beneficial in and of itself. Hell, this city went apeshit supporting Chick-fil-A as well and that was nothing more than bigotry.   That feature has [been around](http://imgur.com/SB3N5QO) for a few months, at least.   I've apparently read too much erotica. I was fully expecting this story to end with one of you bent over a bench.  So, yeah, keep us posted.   I'm sure not everyone will agree with me but I was put off by the level of outrage and effort given what was at stake. I saw more outward participation to "Save the A" than for any other campaign for any cause in the last few years. There were yard signs, bumper stickers, letters to the editor, rallies, etc.  To each his own but I don't think any reasonable argument can be made that "saving the A" was an even minimally important issue.   It's not an either-or thing. That was ridiculous, too.   Without making a statement on Azziz himself, the "Save the A" campaign was the most ridiculous thing I've seen in Richmond County in a long time. (I suspect there may be an equally ridiculous "Save the B" (Berckman's Road) in the near future.)  Pursuits don't get much more trivial than that.   Astroturfing. Probably copypasta from somewhere.   Damn   I think he would do a much better job than the other two candidates. He's got a lot of passion and a track record of getting things done (the latter being the most important, in my opinion).      That's not a realistic way to change the outcome and get quality candidates.  Vote. History is full of examples of it working.   What? You're talking to someone you made up, not me. I was pointing out that not voting has an impact on an election.  If a candidate loses, it's usually not only because the other candidate got more votes. Turnout is a huge factor.   If I recall correctly, he is embarrassed of those and doesn't want them to be seen.  Therefore, thank you for posting them.   I'm sure the larger companies would figure it out. But I would think the IRS would be skeptical of any system that completely avoids the purpose of the tax rate.   Ah, yes. If I recall there are several factors the IRS will look at.   But the CEO of a company paying out $10 million isn't likely to be an owner eligible to take distributions, correct?  I own a small business and pay myself distributions. My accountant advises me to keep it close to 50-50. If I were to pay myself a larger distribution, I would essentially have to pay myself an equivalently larger taxable salary (from what I understand).   Would it be a dollar for dollar thing? The company could create a class of shares and pay $10 million in dividends and it would result in the same cash expense as paying an additional $10 million in wages?   Do you have examples?  If the CEO was set to earn an additional $10 million, but $9 million would go to the government as taxes if paid in wages, what non-wage, nontaxable compensation can the business spend its cash on that rises to that level?  Edit: I'm not denying there are ways. I'm genuinely asking.   Not voting for his opponent means instead of a 0, he got a 1.   Vote in the midterms, not just the Presidential elections!   It sounds like it's working the same way a very high marginal tax rate would work. Few companies would actually pay their CEO an increased salary if 90% of it would go to the government. The money would instead be funneled back into the company.   "Blame" seems like an odd choice of words for a major cause of economic growth.   http://imgur.com/K2YzsNO   For someone who can remember "from Grovetown" essentially meaning "country as hell", the growth of that area blows my mind.

Probably for children who may not have reliable heat at home.   I went my entire public school education (K-12) in Columbia County and just can't remember.

Huh... TIL. Well, awareness is always important.   2015-01-01   I vividly remember reading the last one in the paper as a kid. "Life is a blank canvas, like fresh snow" - or something like that.  Damn good comic. Damn good.   This is probably my favorite meme. Maybe because I had a version of this conversation with my mom about Facebook for 5 years.   And a lot of gay ones.  Me included.   To be fair, his attorneys phrased it that way. Not her.   I think if one gets 100,000 signatures, the White House will "respond".    going out and maxing out credit cards on clothing and other non-seizable goods a few months before filing  If it's done with the intent of filing bankruptcy, yes, it's likely fraud. The difficult part is proving it. Plus, you're generally dealing with debts in the thousands so most major credit companies don't view it as a worthwhile fight (the big fraud fights I see are in Chapter 11s - business bankruptcies -  because the debts are in the millions).  It can be an embarrassing process but most people I run across view it in retrospect as a very simple process. The worst part is generally the self-inflicted shame.  Edit: And it sounds like you are on a much better path now: "No more credit card bills, and proper payment arrangements made with the doctors offices. I don't ever plan to do get into a mess like that again."   Or just file bankruptcy.   In my state, retirement accounts are fully exempt. As for cars, you get an exemption up to $5,000 (and many cars without liens are not worth that much). Home equity can be a problem but only if there is a lot of it. The court isn't going to force you to liquidate your house if the only creditor that will get paid is the mortgage company.   In practice, most people who file a Chapter 7 will not lose anything. Each state has bankruptcy exemptions based on categories of property. Any property up to the value of the exemption is protected from your creditors in bankruptcy. (The idea behind this is to prevent bankrupt individuals from simply becoming wards of the state.)   *in a Chapter 13.  A Chapter 13 is a repayment plan; a Chapter 7 is a liquidation. Judgments can be taken care of in both but in the latter, the judgment creditor will not get any payment.  In practice, most judgments are avoidable and the underlying debts dischargeable.   Bankruptcy attorneys who know what they are doing will require payment up front for a Chapter 7 (which sounds like what you filed). If not, the remaining fee is a pre-petition debt that gets stayed and discharged just like any other. Importantly, the client could potentially sue the attorney for violating the stay if any collection efforts are made (such as calling for a payment).  Of course, if you hire a bankruptcy attorney who agrees to a post-petition payment plan with the intention of not paying (because you now know the above), that's probably fraud and not dischargeable.   I think the point is that that's not exclusive to Atlanta, and doesn't not happen all over the country and the world (sorry for the double negatives but they are appropriate). Blaming a region really doesn't help the overall "greater good".   You don't deserve these downvotes. Homophobia is a national problem and implying this only happened because it was in the South is dangerous to LGBT people everywhere.   That's everywhere for you. Atlanta is incredibly gay friendly.   That's Joe's on Juniper... a very popular gay bar. I can't believe this happened there.   That was my immediate thought. You're done for now, OP! We're comin'!

 It depends on what kind of park... Most parks have nice trails, so going on a scenic walk is always an option.  Bitches love scenery. Some lake-based parks have canoes/kayaks/paddleboats for rent.

    This actually moved me to tears. Absolutely beautiful.   Dude, don't worry too much about that. It really is about the couple. My husband and I have been together for 9 years on the 25th and I make it an active point to give him blowjobs on the regular, usually during my period. I initiate them, and they're only for him. He returns the favor when I'm off, so the cycle of giving goes round and round.   Awesome!! I discovered Diet Bet because I follow Chris Powell from the tv show Extreme Weight Loss on Facebook. Apparently he and his wife host like 3 bets a year, and he posted on his FB page that the New Year bet was starting in a few hours. I researched it as much as possible, the FAQ and game rules have a lot of good info so I strongly recommend that you check those out. After I read everything I could, I paid the $30 buy-in knowing that I had 7 days to change my mind. The sign-up process is very straight forward, it can all be done through the website or the mobile app.  The motivation doesn't come from "oh I am going to get SO MUCH MONEY!" like you would expect, but I am stingy and wanted my $30 back lol. Mostly just know I had *very* clear goals in mind is what kept me in line. I got MyFitnessPal and followed my macros, and submitted unofficial weigh-ins weekly on the app. You're only required to do two official weigh ins on the day the bet starts the day it ends, but when you update weekly it tells you total pounds   ounces lost, how any you have to go till your goal weight and how many days till the final weigh in. It sounds so simple but having it spelled out like that in black   white was really critical for my success.  You can join any bet within 7 days after the starting date, so if you want to join the one  I'm in now I'd be happy to send you the link. I hope this answers your question and gives you more insight into the process!    Eating disorders alone are hard to get support for cause people don't take is seriously. Being a man and having an ED...that sounds impossible to people, like how people think men can't be raped. Men struggle too, all the time.  I think it's incredible you were able to overcome all of that seemingly on your own. You don't have to do it alone anymore, there's an entire community here willing to support you. Any time you feel like you're slipping, hit me up and I'll do whatever I can to help you out.   My first Diet Bet wrapped up yesterday. I bet $30 I could lose 4% of my body weight in 28 days. I lost 9 pounds,  making the cut by 1 ounce and won back $42! Because I was employed at the time I did my first bet and wasn't ready to stop the progress yesterday, instead of cashing out I used the winnings as credit to buy into another game.   True that I had some anxiety in the says leading up to the last weigh in, but for the whole month I was VERY motivated to stay on track and keep up with my food log.  If things keep going this way, I can easily see myself continuing to do bets till I get closer to my goal weight as a way to develop solid habits and give myself a better reward other than food.   If anyone joins I'd be happy to make a team and keep in touch!!     Binging, unless you purge, is laughed at by professionals  That's just sad, as if an eating disorder can only occur with both B   P. But that's exactly what I was afraid of people saying - that my problem last night wasn't real because I wasn't able to purge because of my surgery.  You're right, I can't reward myself with food. Logically I know it's not healthy to have that type of relationship with food, but it's so hard to let go of that mindset. I'll let you know how it goes when I figure THAT part out.   Chin up, best of luck on your road to recovery and fitness, and thank you for your support.   It's so rare to hear something like that, most people scoff at these types of things. Thank you for the validation and support!   Thank you that makes me feel a ton better! I got used to immediate backlash in other subs, so I was worried. This really is the best subreddit I've ever seen. Thank you so much for your kind words and support!   Hell yeah, that's awesome! Keep it up, you got this!   Reddit - World's Best Clairvoyants Able to Detect if a Stranger is a Parent or Not   True that most kids just pratice willfull defiance and cover their asses but eventually most children will realize the stupid thing they want to do isn't worth the consequences. Every kid is different - each kid needs individualized child rearing - but humiliation is not a form of child rearing. It's just crule.   I just imagined OP trying to throw the snow back up into the sky.   Nah that's just parenting. Teaching a kid cause and effect, and that actions have negative consequences. That's totally different from humiliation.   Exactly! People forget they aren't just raising kids. They are shaping and molding a future adult and it's their job to make sure the kid isn't going to be a shitty adult. It's a terrible cycle.   Hell yeah, Geaux Cajuns!   	16
 The internet has kind of democratized book critics, it's also reduced the nature of cultural gatekeepers to rather dedicated readerships. But it's still funny to see grudge matches between critics and authors.    **AIR FORCE ONE** and **SABRINA**   There's a lot of things wrong with the entire essay. It's ironically called "Media Engineering 101."    *She knows our dank memes.*   I'm like 99 percent sure that Devin Faraci's tweet went over their head. Although, it's hilarious that someone in ISIS is handling the twitter account and blocking Gamergate. I wonder what kind of office conversation that was like?    What did a bagel do to you?  ISIS is known for infiltrating local Jewish bagel shops.   I'm willing to bet that you don't even know how you're being attacked by her. I'm betting he does. Most of us do. Do you really? For starters what did she do to warrant this petition being revived? Firing a dude busy fighting cancer. Ruining most ama boards by still not creating a replacement for Victoria.  A swing and a missssss. strike three, you're outta here.    The internet is the only place where you'll find a bunch of twenty somethings ignoring years of legal precedent and believe a slippery slope ends at something that would positively affect an online community's legitimacy.   I don't know why Chris Hansen is sitting on his hands. These guys are seemingly throwing their hand out there.    As GamerGate continues to demonstrate to the world that the SJW emperors have no clothes (especially after today) the endgame is rapidly upon us as they will seek escalation into international banning, criminalization, and censorship of anything that isn't pro-narrative.  How does anyone read this and not think of religious end times predictions? Shit, these guys are one step away from worshiping the blockchain.   The guy probably reads Glenn Beck books because *The Overton Window* was the name of his first thriller, I think.   "*When you talk about films, nobody agrees with anybody. Guys get mad at each other and the air is full of screaming*" - David Newman and Robert Benton, *"The Movies Will Save Themselves,"* 1968   Reddit is hopelessly in love with talking about itself.    Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:  [Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)  Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.  In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.  In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:   gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."  Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.  But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.  Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.  It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.  Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:  [I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)  As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.  But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:  [Reddit chief Ellen Pao resigns after receiving 'sickening' abuse from users](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns)  [How Ellen Pao lost her job but survived Reddit's swamp of trolls](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/12/ellen-pao-reddit-trolls-feminist-silicon-valley)  The Financial Times:  [Pao quits Reddit after attacks on her leadership](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e833f86e-274b-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html)  The London Evening Standard:  [Reddit chief Ellen Pao quits after 'sickening' abuse and death threats from users](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/reddit-chief-ellen-pao-quits-over-sickening-abuse-and-death-threats-from-users-10382305.html)  ZDNet.com:  [Reddit CEO Ellen Pao resigns after week of 'sickening' attacks](http://www.zdnet.com/article/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-resigns-under-fire/)  DailyBeast (op-ed):  [Reddits Terrorists Have Won: Ellen Pao and the Failure to Rebrand Web 2.0](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/reddit-s-terrorists-have-won-ellen-pao-and-the-failure-to-rebrand-web-2-0.html)  Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.  Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.  Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.  https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3d4w47/opinion_narrative_engineering_101/    Submission History: The story of two Twenty-something kids, who are basically an internet version of True Detective, and their voluntary mission to hunt pedophiles.

It's such a dick and balls on the table move too.  "I'm now going to air out some laundry and I want everyone to know."  This drama Mbius strip is getting me hard   I think he, uhhhhhbh, just dropped the hammer.   Can you be my new dad?   I know some indie and other film publicists in my city. I have no idea how they'd respond to the offer of Reddit AMA's, and it's been a while, but if your avenue doesn't work then hit me up.   Well, there's a difference between censorship and the shenanigans from that Jesse Jackson AMA.  I think the mods would be well in their right to curate quality questions that don't make us look like a bunch of rabid dogs like "You're a well known race-baiter and huslter. What's it like knowing your the worst thing to happen to race in 60 years."   WE NEED MORE ABOUT THE CUH-RAZY MOVIE GETAWAY STARRING ETHAN HAWKE AND SELENA GOMEZ!!!!   How many Memes will be in the new meme pool? Have you assigned a task for to collaborate with the writer to make sure these memes in meme pool are the dankest of the dank?   Go back to SRS\SRD you pot-stirring fool.   "Stop poking holes in my argument and go back to a place where no one will question my brilliance!"   Reddit is so far up it's own ass in it's victim complex in this situation to even discuss this.  That guy got it right.   Is he planning to actually fight ISIS?   So parents?    This is what happens when you let the same dude bro people who use Reddit run Reddit.   "Your honor, I would now like to submit a dictionary of terms Reddit commonly uses. In it you will find term definitions for dank memes, chairman pao, gaslighting, hot dog pizza, the jews did this and the Church Scene."    Another lawyer here. What happens when everyone breaks NDAs and slanders the other party?   The judge says fuck this you people deal with it in Karma Court.    Mad Max: Fury Road   Reddit makes me believe sometimes that its run by a bunch of those plastic babies from American Sniper.   Is there some sort of home depot power tool analogy to go with this? I read too many lock and key analogies.    Everything in the linked thread I read with the voice of Ironhide from the first Transformers.   "The human exhibits traces of pheromones. He would like to mate with the girl."   [Yishan and Ellen right now](http://i.imgur.com/lR2RsL3.gifv)   I'm sorry to hear about the hazing. I'd like to work with you and change the world immensely.  http://images.sodahead.com/profiles/0/0/3/8/3/4/7/3/5/hwat-127135844125.jpeg   I imagine it wouldn't look good with these two possible headlines.  "Former Reddit Employee with Cancer sued by Reddit for Breach of Non-Disclosure"  or  "Ex-Reddit Employee Fakes Cancer Claim to Blame Female CEO for Firing"   This is what I was aiming at. Reddit is basically gonna make themselves like fools if they take action either way. It's better to let it slide...that is. Unless...Yishan wants to be responsible for some popcorn.   [It sounds like he doesn't give a shit anymore](https://twitter.com/yishan/status/619657668261601280)   [This popcorn keeps coming. I can't handle it.](https://i.imgur.com/NvhhMqC.jpg)   Basically it means that Yishan can freely beat around the bush and Reddit can't really do much. But I was talking about the inevitability that Reddit would go after Yishan for making innocuous statements about how Reddit handled a very public situation because of a nondisclosure provision. I don't even know if he signed one. He would probably have been the one to make the decision on whether to have one.   It would make Reddit look worse to their user base who will see Yishan as a whistle-blower and in the press because those statements from Yishan are going to get signal boosted. I imagine that if push comes to shove, and with Yishan's tendency to not take shit like that sitting down, we're going to find out in the near future whether the "cancer" statement is true or false.    Between this and his public outburst against that shit-talking ex-employee (that was him, wasn't it?) he seems to be an extremely unprofessional individual.  The weird thing about Reddit is that it allows former employees to air their grievances out and corporate has no way of confirming or denying the accusations. Imagine what would have happened if Yishan never responded and just decided to let that simmer. Intimidate public opinion would shift because a Reddit employee says he was fired indiscriminately.   Yishan basically kicked it in the balls instead of becoming one of those lightening rods for Reddit to seethe at. And then the process repeated itself during the Ellen Pao era, except corporate handled it properly by not putting itself in the area of divulging the nature of someone's employment history.   All this means is Yishan is clear now to pop some corn around Reddit's offices.    Granted that I have no idea what the terms of this guy's termination were, but I can't imagine they didn't include nondisparagement and nondisclosure provisions. And now, in the litany of things that people who are anti-Pao like to rattle off at the merest mention of her, "fired a guy for having cancer" and "pry this position from my cold, dead hands" are regular features.  Think of the position Yishan puts Reddit corporate in now that he said this and KickMe said there's dirt on people and Yishan is going all "fuck it" on Reddit and Twitter.  Reddit is basically one of those justice scales right now and Yishan just tipped it in favor of the transparency set that make Reddit's most vocal members. If Reddit attempts to go after Yishan for just poking around the bush, they're gonna piss off that user base, who'll go fucking nuts and they already got through pissing them off just a few weeks ago.    They fired their last PR handler.    Ellen Pao and Yishan are friends. Now that they're both out, the gloves are gonna come off. I wonder how this is going to get reported in the press? Ooooooo...this is getting gooooood.    Yishanzai!   Yishan is the Kernel of Popcorn. And the best part was he ran the company so he's got good shit to air out. It's not like he's entirely wrong, but damn this dude just loves to talk about inside company stuff.  Oh, what a day. What a lovely day!   Looks kinda boring.          This movie will end up being about The Wolverine again somehow.    I would like to see one of these talks with both the directors of Narco Cultura and Cartel Land talking to each other. They both bring up similar issues and I think it probably would lead to a fascinating discussion.    Very, very interesting talk. It's interesting to hear the dichotomy between the two subjects of the film. I wonder why with the amount of defense spending that none of it finds its way to the border? This seems like a massive oversight.  I imagine cartels are smart enough not to cause violence on American soil. They probably realize that if they did that would basically mean the beginning of the end of that kind of access to the border.   [Redditors attempted that and failed.](http://gawker.com/5932987/reddit-island-could-an-enthusiastic-online-community-create-a-nerd-oasis-in-real-life)   25 movies that are all gems in a special way    /r/TheRedPill.    4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days    Might be the first time anyone has said the name of this movie in the history of this subreddit.       [How true film is looking right now.](https://youtu.be/VdC15Vy_sRw?t=2m31s)   I've read Michael Gibney's [Sous Chef](http://www.amazon.com/Sous-Chef-24-Hours-Line/dp/0804177899) which tells a similar story. I gather Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is in the same vein, but essentially what I gather is that you get 3 hours to prepare for lunch, one hour for break and dinner prep and the rest of the night being behind on orders. Did you ever work in a kitchen with the ambition to become a head chef? From my experience reading these books they're either treated like war narratives or ones where people had the ambition to become head chefs and own their own restaurants.   Have you thought of starting a sub reddit with the ability to tell all those stories? I'm having a hard time wondering why you mod the subs you mod, bothering with the metaverse and other unsavory subs to put it lightly, and yet you still refer to the guys you worked with as a second family.   How did you recognize Reynoldo Rey from 227? I don't think he would even recognize himself from 227 if he was alive. I know you have a history on Reddit but I kind of want to hear more about these kitchen stories. Most interesting customer? Weirdest things that happened in the kitchen?  Also, favorite things to prepare? You said you like cooking and fishing so I'm guessing you like preparing fish on occasion?   Do you have any stories to share about cooking? Favorite thing to cook? Worst dish prepared? Worst customer served? You worked in the cooking industry presumably so what's life like on the other side from your perspective?   Okay, fine, if you won't answer that question then I won't get into a prolonged battle.  Do you have hobbies?  What are your top 10 favorite books?   Do you at least recognize that some of the stuff you say is problematic?   We ask that you embrace Reddit's diverse culture rather than cleansing it. We get our touchy-feelies on Facebook. We come to Reddit to be reminded that life can be harsh. We come to Reddit to see hot girls taking off their clothes for nothing more than karma.

This seems like an awfully myopic view of the function of Reddit.    He looks like he's gonna sell me a car.   The Wolf of Wall Street captured the energy of that song. I doubt this film will.

James Cameron has to be the least prolific blockbuster director around in his tier next to George Lucas.   Nobody has to be convince anyone of watching a movie - I've stopped watching Hollywood as they are mostly the same old violence filled trash.  So you're gonna watch a movie with hundreds of flogged extras and a 45 minute battle????   Man of Steel was praised for it's brevity! A three minute trailer is short! Hooray!   [uj] They referenced Green Lantern and X Gone Give it To Ya. There's gonna be so many memes. Yippee. [uj]   If you can't attack the proof, then attack character. Exactly what I'd expect. This is a sub for intelligent discussion, you don't want it fine, go somewhere else.   The original claims were:   1.  Only comments criticizing her incompetence and/or equating her to fascist leaders.   2.  There are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations.   I provided proof of both, twice. Unless you can refute the claim I really don't need to entertain the bunch of childish baby responses I woke up to saying "cunt isn't really sexist, we we just posting we wanted to punch this cunt in the face but it was in the appropriate subreddit! That has nothing to do with gender." Fucking hell, I have one right below you resorting to bromides and un-sourced bullshit.        Stop being pedantic.   Would you prefer I don't treat your comment with the respect you expect it to be given and just say "hurr durr pedatic, ur wrong?" I can't pick out the "spirit of your comment" when it's wrong because the comment that started this conversation was over the fact that someone was denying that any activity whatsoever of sexism occurred let alone made it up to the front page.  For instance, out of all the signatures that signed the Ellen Pao petition the [numbers on the words "Cunt" and "Bitch"](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3cfpoa/word_cloud_of_reddits_ellen_pao_petition_oc/) out pace regular prepositions. And this is out of all participants who commented on the petition. Unfortunately, I don't think they're calling her a "cunt" because they know her personally and therefore can attest to the validity of any of these statements. If you want more fun selections from Reddit's grand petition [enjoy the video from the guy who did the data-mining on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8IIey7vydM)  In comparison to reddit's 160 million unique monthly visitors, they are a minority. A vocal minority, to be sure, but they represent around 0.1% of the reddit userbase, assuming that every one of those subs is an active, unique user (and they aren't all active and unique).  160 million users of which the [overwhelming majority is male](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-gender/465979). And which an overwhelming majority of that majority managed to launch a large organized temper tantrum resulting in a CEO stepping down making their "DAE Pao is literally Hitler" campaign seem legitimate. Did [Yishan end up getting this treatment when he banned The Fappening?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuxtaposition/comments/3c1bn6/ellen_pao/) (NSFW). [Did this occur when Yishan instituted policies at Reddit that banned Jailbait?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate51/comments/39on4t/ellen_paos_cunt_very_nsfw/) (Also NSFW).    But if you want more proof you really just need to compare the statements of Steve Huffman who essentially rephrased the same policies of Ellen Pao and the responses from the same audience who actively went out of their way to downvote her responses into the thousands. Ultimately, this is a conversation about the pernicious nature of these communities that eventually turn their giant crybaby campaigns into organized efforts to take over the community center. The question becomes do you want these guys (the people who don't contribute or enjoy becoming apart of communities) to be able to take over the community center by rushing from their dank basement and taking a baseball bat to good communities, which seems to happen with regularity now, or does Reddit take the stance that allows free association to also include the ability of free exclusionary measures to weed out those pernicious actors?  They can't have it both ways.   Not many calls for Huffman as being literally Hitler when he said he wouldn't bring FPH back or that he wanted Reddit to be a safe place for all sorts of communities. Then again this is a different conversation.      Hugh Jackman looked real burned up about not having a seat.   Probably because Sam Raimi pretty much can't top the terror of the first one so he jumped ship and made a three stooges comedy film. It's a remake and yet it's basically a whole new take on a film.   However, I think that Evil Dead remake is on par with the original. Aaron Motion should be a bigger name in the field of cinematography, but his work on that film is brilliant.    I don't know. It's hard to pull off a massive science fiction fantasy and those aren't really a dime a dozen with the kind of production values that The Fifth Element has. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I think it's damn near close for me to perfect.   The Big Lebowski. I've watched it like 3 times and I never understood why people find it so knock down drag out hilarious.    Best scene was when they blew up the cat. Other than that, it's a pretty okay vigilante movie that borrows heavily from Michael Bay looking camera work.   "No one tells me there are no blue berry Popsicles."    Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn never wasted their one fuck.    Was this filmed from the perspective of someones dick?   Nothing will beat that compilation. This was alright, kids stammer like they're eating apple sauce, which is funny, but that other one was just a long cut of people realizing what they got themselves into is terrible.   game recognize game   You should see her Twitter account. She tweeted out an uplifting news link about Redditors attending a kids birthday party and some skellington got 1000 retweets by telling her to resign. Who the fuck wants the job of CEO?   I hope Memepool says "Thanks Mr. Skelatal but I don't feel like eating Jolly Ranchers I have broken arms, FUCKING KEVIN. I want to be air force."  10/10 writing.

Pls Zack. Let me have your man baby. you are visionsary. beautiful visionary.      SRD got hit with the accusation that we collectively dogpiled the Dylan Storm comment in Pao's resignation announcement to -700. This must be a new achievement.    its a fucking internet site. get over yourself.  A rare moment of self-awareness in a sub devoted to a giant temper tantrum.    Shit, it's gonna lead to so many "MODS ARE CENSORING ME" that mods would probably just shut down the sub.    The creators I'm talking about literally run all the defaults and the thousands of other medium and small sized subreddits. None of these people are employees of Reddit and they had the power to shut down the subs that account for a lions share of its traffic and Reddit couldn't do jack shit without pissing off even more users. It's insane how much power Reddit corporate has given over the main subs that drive traffic.   The entire point of Reddit is that you can create the subreddit you want, curate the community you want to have, with no restrictions.  Unfortunately, users seem to believe this entitles them to undermine creators intent by saying that they want the ability to freely post anything if it means posting it, having it removed by a moderator, but still having it be there. You've just removed the ability for moderators to do their job of curating a subreddit, which is exactly what they do thanklessly for free while going about the other obligations of their daily life.   If moderators at /r/askhistorians want to curate a subreddit that aims to be like a historical journal why would you remove their ability to do that by taking their power away to deal with comments and users that undermine the sub? If I'm an editor of a sub that aims to the editorial standards of The New Yorker, then I don't want a bunch of one line posts about "DAE broken arms jolly racher chris nolgan?" clogging up my pages. But if you want to make a sub that allows that, the Reddit gives you the ability to do so. The issue here is users not realizing the power of editorial decision making is only a click of the button away. Outside of that it becomes a discussion about getting eyes on shit that the moderators didn't want in their subreddit and users complaining about censorship because they weren't able to hijack an audience for what usually are bunk causes.  And I'm overthinking it because these are the issues that will arise. Thinking about it makes sure a policy doesn't go into effect that will drive people away from the site before they make a mistake in implementing it.    The part that I enjoyed about his AMA was that he essentially said that they have 50 million to burn through which he thinks means that he has no real expectation to deliver on monetizing those investments. It's gonna get real sticky when they run low on cash and those investors start getting antsy.   Because you're taking away the power of moderators and creators of subreddit to create the subreddit they wanted. People seem to misunderstand that Reddit is a place for creators, by creators and made with the purpose that you would curate the experience you want to create.   If you take that power out of the moderators hands then you're basically asking for all sorts of things that you didn't want. The moderators of these quality subreddits have no obligation to stay and tolerate it.   You already have moderators here clamping down on shitposts. Can you imagine placing new rules that would ensure higher quality posts and then having the company who tells you to do whatever you want and create the subreddit experience you want that you now have lost that power?    The next CEO is just going to be a guy in Costa Rica with no publicly listed address and nameless issuing out draconian orders.    I mean all the criticisms that have been leveled against it have already been talked about about. Pretty much taking out the Poison Snake lady and the plot about the Silver Samurai and just making it a "Wolverine Vs the Yakuza" story would have shot that movie right to one of the best comic book films.    You won't concede even when I do provide sources, because you're part of this hate movement.  Besides, you already lost the debate a couple of messages ago via a fallacy.  We're done here.  I guess he doesn't have any????   Hundreds of games, books, plays, movies, and events got censored or cancelled or disrupted by SJWs.  wut??????   And I feel like Scorsese wouldn't even include his all important "voice of a pufferfish from Shark Tale" that is essentially to completists.     I don't think anyone is saying that there hasn't been any sexism or racism directed at Ms. Pao.   The original commenter said both that he had seen no posts in the postive numbers that were racist and that "there are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations."  These are both patently wrong statements which negates yours saying there hasn't been anyone denying that Redditors really shit the bed on this one. And one only has to look at the response when Yishan stepped down as CEO. He was the one behind the banning of both Jailbait and The Fappening and yet my front page was not flooded with babies calling the CEO a cunt, "a gook" and "this fucking bitch."  The complaints against Reddit are valid, but not when you have these type of people attempting to hijack a conversation about the fact that Reddit didn't really give a shit about interacting and communicating with the community that keeps its doors open. And these aren't minority numbers. These are thousands of people as the screenshots show. FPH had 150,000 subs, KiA has 40,000, SRC has around 10,000 and all these people keep giving the community a shit name. Meanwhile, cunt wasn't something thrown around when Yishan did the exact same measures against subreddits like Ellen Pao did.      How many heads do you have? I need to know to adequately prepare my information for the heads that watched it and the heads that didn't.   I meant it would ruin your day to have to go through all the hoops of legal action, as justified as they would be.  "Why can't I just grope all the women I want, man? Your trying to arrest me, you know, ruins the rest of my day."  I hope none of these people become lawyers. They're gonna put a lot of their clients in jail.    I imagine they would have more hilarious shots of Dennis Leary looking like someone showed him a squirrel nutsack.   I enjoy your backpedaling.  "There's no evidence of sexism or racism"  "Oh, well, cunt is really a term of endearment."  "Oh, well, calling someone a gook isn't racist."  I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like when presented with evidence you just want people to keep giving it to you until it's a mountain full of it. Then when there's none left to give you'll go, "SEE! I told you. No sexism or racism."     [Screenshots from /r/all](https://i.imgur.com/kQ9EhcC.png)  [Punchable Faces](https://i.imgur.com/2gLNE4Z.jpg)  But I suppose "Ching Chong Ding Dong" and "This Cunt" were just affable ribbing.   Neither is KiA. Heyoooo.   I read their opinion section from time to time, they have a lot of inane bullshit on there like an opinion piece on peas in guacamole.   I don't know whether to laugh or cry that it wasn't pointed out immediately in the next comment with a pejorative like "you believe this shit?" or "this fucking sub."    Breitbart: The only news source where reporters are allowed on Twitter to call former CEO's "Vexatious" and still be considered detached from the story they're reporting on.    This is the same plot as Spy, but with bro spies and shit.   BUT I THOUGHT EVERYONE WENT TO VOAT? OH NEVERMIND I DOESN'T WORK ANYWAYS HAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA   Someone really needs to explain how Aisha Tyler became the designated MC of nerd ceremonies at every big convention. Also, Zack Snyder ain't no public speaker.    It's probably a more auspicious event for Tarantino, who will hand the power of dictating musical emotion to Ennio Morrecone, than it is for Morricone to score it.  Morrecone is basically the Eric Roberts of film scoring. He does like seven or eight movies a year, a large work load for his age, if you pay him. He does a ton of weird direct to DVD projects.    Why don't they just release an HD trailer?    I don't think anyone on /r/movies has seen anything other than comic book movies, Christopher Nolan movies, and an assorted bag of 14 other titles associated with mind fucker filmmakers.    It's dehumanising because it breaks people down into races. And I have the nagging suspicion that even if they had had Asians at the forefront of the casting, there'd be complaints that none of them were gay or transsexual or something else.  We're all white on the internet.       Oh shit. Batman is in two movies.    The Rumpled Shithole  Dick Dickerson and The Castle of the Grotesque.   The Corn Gorge   The Meaty Sack  A Repetitious Fingering.     i don't think enough people have seen it because it was a fucking terrible movie, but Identity Thief was pretty much one long mean spirited fat joke after another.     And lastly yup, people were right when they were saying thats Robins costume in the backround of the first trailer, and the jokers killed him :(  I hope Jenna Malone is playing the next Robin then.    It's weird how uncanny Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder's aesthetic is to each other.    Why does he need a coat?    I believe that story line is a middle finger to those who hate man of steel simply for the destruction.  Or it's addressing a story point that even David Goyer seemed to scoff at. Whatever he planned in his original script it didn't seem like that was one of them.    And thus the age of DC begins.  It will be a glorious fanboy war.    There's something hilarious about watching Henry Cavil walk into congress with that suit shot with all the sincerity of a serial killer movie.    Who as time to read articles when you have time to pretend your in an online high school movie with stratified cliques?   Mah fathur was a gamur. mah granpappy was a gamur and ur gunna be a gahmur sun.   For these people it seems, high school never ended. Some just got a bit more "professional" and pretentious with their bullying  High School. High School never changes.    Save your money. For the love of everything that is good.    The social justice warriors on twitter are not happy this is being made...  who cares?       Probably because all those nostalgic nerds raised on MST3000 and Redlettermedia all think they're Buddy Hackett and then start talking during movies. Then there are the teens. Fuck teens.   But they're **"nice guys**"   All media lies. All media is corrupt. No one believes even traditional print like the New York Times. Gamergate will not be able to fix games journalism or journalism as a whole. But what it can do is open the eyes of those who care about the truth and continue to be a watchdog of the corrupt.  I'LL BELIEVE ANY REDDIT COMMENT BEFORE I BELIEVE FIRST HAND REPORTING.         I love the diminutive ["it was just like four guys doing it."](http://i.imgur.com/k0fws6A.jpg)     "Mom, no, look I'm healthy. You want proof? Let me show you this thing called Reddit. This is what it looks like when people shit the bed."   because if they made a horror movie that cost money then it would look like Jurassic World.   I wonder what it's like to be DavidReiss666 and have people actively attempting to come after him because he won't let them post 8 hour documentaries about holocaust denials?   okay. u got da job? when can you start eating hot dog pizzas?   u like hot dog pizzas?   mramo   DJ Khaled is the Mark Twain of our time. true satire.    If there's any justice in this world Adam Sandler would announce Grown Ups 3 on the same release date as Pacific Rim 2.   We need a fucking Jaeger airplane.   Basically this is going to be the best TV series ever and Starz just found itself a viewer. They better not skimp on all the cool as creature effects.    SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary". What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.  Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.  The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.  The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology. What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.  Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.  In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.  GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome.   SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary". What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.  Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.  The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.  The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology. What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.  Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily.

 I don't have IB, Ghorn, or even Atheons Epilogue.    IM A CHILD AND IM ONLY ALLOWED TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES ON WEEKENDS SO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY!   What console?   Thats not that bad, I expected it to be more. I guess I'll try to save up for the $35 one to save a few bucks for the next one. (And I have askednicely   Well this sucks, my parents refuse to get me it for Christmas as video games are a waste of time, and I'm a kid with no money :( could you tell me how much the DLC is so I can start trying to convince my grandpa I need money for school supplies?   Do you have to buy the DLC to get to light lvl 32? Do you have to buy the DLC to get the new raid and weapons? I don't think I will be able to buy the DLC, but I still want the full Destiny experience.   I'm a middle school "Kindergaurdian" and all the people I play with say I don't squeak so I refuse to take offense to this like I do all the other posts complaining about young guardians.    That only *hands* could satisfy   Destinylfg people have always wanted to cheese the Templar for me. I don't even know HOW to kill the Templar legitly.    Yes. I have good friends who now play on xbox one while I'm still on 360. They were kind enough to hop on 360, do that 1 gig update, spend 20 minutes finding other level 30's and ran me through the hard raid. I got Timebreaker, The Truth, and the chest and gauntlets. All I need is the helmet now :)   First time running hard mode raid, I got the Timebreaker, the Truth, the raid chest, and raid gauntlets.    "I hear they're almost ready"   I have an atheon save if you guys wanna join we also need 4 gt: jade sueta   Only have 2 people, need 4 more more. Lvl 28 titan and 27 titan. Add Jade Sueta     my gt is jade sueta we need one more.   Gt : jade sueta we need 2 more ppl come and join   What console?   I know, I cringed myself through it. And I laughed so hard at the end when he said " umm, rapping isn't normally my style, but I hope you enjoyed!"   Okay I thought after you heard the song it would be very clear that I was being *extremely sarcastic*   http://youtu.be/7zez-WjcZhw   Haha I put this up as a joke, I saw this video and I really had to push myself to actually watch it. I wanted to know if everyone else thought the same.      Thank you!   Hahaha that was perfect!   Like if you stumble across a hilarious spelling error that makes the sentence completely different?   Wow thank you so much!   Awesome! I only need four, so I that means I can upgrade twice if I get as many as you do!   Are there any good imgur apps that you know of? I type in imgur in the App Store and like 20,000 imgur apps pop up!   I'm mostly a mobile user, but is it possible to post a link from my camera roll? Or do I have to upload my picture on imgur to get a link so I can post to reddit?   Cool, I have an extra legendary plate I don't need, hopefully I'll get a few out of that.   thats awesome! I'll ask a few friends. Thanks.   thanks!    I'm a lvl 24 and to rank up my chestplate defense I need 6 ascendant shards. I already have two, but I have no idea how I got them. What's the fastest way to get ascendant shards?    Hahahaha my friend told me this forever ago!   i got this achievement by doing a the Heroic Weekly strike. You don't need to do the VoG to get the achievement.  Wait, nevermind! Wrong achievement! I was thinking of Flawless Striker.   Diarrhea because migraines just suck.   Have you read Enders Game series? (Im assuming you have, based on your username) how do you like it?   Im in middle school (junior high) What is post secondary? Elementary school?   that doesn't sound like fun. I'm a few paragraphs done, but it was mostly my partner doing it. I look up the articles, she puts my quotes into words.    Once upon a time, there was a dad and a mom and a bunch of kids. One day, the mom and all of the kids get murdered except for one child. The dad raised the child as normal, but one day the kid disappeared when he went off on his own to check out something. The dad then devoted his life to finding his kid, even if it meant traveling across the ocean. He had the help of a mentally ill silly woman. Together, they find his son Nemo and they are happily reunited.    No, I can't think of anything that could connect the two, except its in your head.   In English we were doing a 9/11  unit and we have to explain the reactions and stuff on how tragedy affects community and do an analysis and stuff.      Meh. I have other things on my mind then whether or not I like beards. I guess they're okay.   I really don't feel like writing said essay, so if you could ask me some questions to take my mind off the fact that I should not be on reddit right now.   Definitely has to be Photograph. From the second I heard it I knew I would love it. I was on the verge of tears with how beautiful it was.   Whether it involves a hose or swimming in the ocean, I want to hear it!   Im on right now my gamertag is Jade Sueta.   Still looking? Ill add you   Ansel Elgort *don't judge me*   Is there a subreddit for *everything on this site?*   *GASP* how did you discover my secret!?   Wow believe it or not I had no idea that subreddit existed!   That would be awesome.   Um... Sorry???       Haha but either way I have no answer. I don't really listen to eminem often.   Well maybe in a few million years the world will shift and it won't be so lonely anymore.    Its an island in the middle of an ocean....   I feel like this is a trick question and I'm supposed to answer " ew I hate eminem he's not a REAL rapper like (insert weird rapper name here)"   More like upper middle class. My parents want to move to Hawaii, so we have to save money and shit, but then they go and buy my bro an iPad mini when I can't have a bag of chips at the store! And woah, now we pay 130 a month so me and him can go to Tae Kwon Do! ( not complaining, I love TKD)   Sonic the hedgehog, talking tom, and this guy who looks like a rapper with a foreign language as subtitles. And those are just a few of the thumbnails.   Well on YouTube he always types in "asdfghjkl"    The world will never know.   Ama   The music was bad, and it wasn't so much a stunt montage as much as it was a "jumping off the same 4 things for six minutes" montage, but hey, you can only improve from here! :)   Well survival is partly fun, part cash. Me and my friends will grind sandy shores surivival for like an hour an a half, and 20 thousand isn't that bad for each one. I think if you are with people you enjoy and doing a survival, it's like a podcast or commentary or something. It just gives you something to make some money while chatting or talkingabout something with your friends. If you are just going in with random people sitting there in silence while playing, you're gonna have a bad time. ( and 20k on ammo! Do you only play with sticky bombs or something?   Thanks! I'll add you when I get on tomorrow.   Why........?  	68

    I just started reading the first book and I'm already halfway through it... Can't wait to finish so I know what you're talking about!!! Ah!  Update: I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK. HOLY SHIT.   Is that a "That wasn't a fart!" expression?  Congratulations. She's absolutely beautiful!   True, but she got into a lifeboat for a second time (the one Cal and Jack put her on) and got off of that one too! If she would've stayed on that second lifeboat, maybe Jack would've had a chance.    Yay!! We got ours in the mail today. We are leaving May 9th, and I'll be turning 23 while we are there :)   I'm not a professor, but I had the same professor for 5 classes and I know something that always drives him mad. This professor teaches creative writing courses, and every week people turn in rough drafts of their work for the class and professor to critique. Far too often someone says things along the lines of "I finished this right before class" or "I completely forgot my work was due until the last minute, luckily I was able to whip something together." They say these things to fellow classmates and most importantly to the professor. Oh man my professor abhors it. He is extremely passionate about his classes and about writing. Whenever students say stuff like that he takes it as they didn't care about their writing or the class, and it makes him feel like they are wasting his time. I mean, it takes hours to critique the works for each week (for my novel writing class each manuscript was like 20+ pages long) so I totally understand why he is so upset when students act like they didn't care about it, and so blatantly admit that they don't care.    Yay! Congrats!   Just keep checking! I've heard that people double book and then cancel one of the reservations when they make a final decision.  People will probably cancel as the date gets closer. After obsessively checking for weeks, I managed to pick up a BOG dinner reservation for May 11 about a week or so ago.    For some reason, I'm thinking Liam. I really wish Sammi would die though.    We have "Better Call Paul!" billboards here in Northern Kentucky. I've been meaning to get a pic of one for weeks.    I cannot wait to prank my husband with this in May.    Yay!!!! I'm glad it's not completely impossible to get a reservation lol.    Hi all!  My husband and I are going to be in Magic Kingdom on May 11 to celebrate my birthday. We didn't get to experience BoG on our honeymoon, so we're going to this time around. When we booked our vacation, all that was left were lunch reservations, so I got in at 1:15pm. However, I wanted to see if I could get in for dinner because I kind of want my birthday dinner to be sit down and not quick service. I've been stalking the reservation site, but for weeks I've been getting the "Sorry, no reservations are available blah blah blah" message. Imagine my surprised today when TWO reservations appeared! One at 4:05 and one at 8:55. I nabbed the 4:05 time. Now I can't decide if I want to keep the lunch or dinner reservation (we don't we to do both at BoG in one day because that's way too pricey; our second meal will be a quick service, most likely Pecos Bill)  I've been weighing the pros and cons of each. I really like the idea of lunch being cheaper, but I like the dinner options a bit more and I really want to try to meet the Beast. I cannot decide, so I've decide to ask the experts. Those who have experienced BoG, which do you like better - lunch or dinner?    Just the white Red Heart Super Saver - nothing fancy since I was just practicing.   I am still relatively new to crocheting, but I decided to try my hand at a dress last week (I told my husband we can't start trying for a baby until I am a pro at making baby clothes haha). I found a relatively simple pattern that uses just double crochets and shells (2dc ch 2 2dc in same stitch). [Here is the link to the pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/angel-wings-pinafore) on ravelry. Also, [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e9/61/5c/e9615ca1910a65cfe58bbe0055b227f7.jpg) is a super cute dress that someone on Pinterest made using the same pattern. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/FyuhyTu.jpg) is my final version - I didn't try to gauge it or anything since I was just seeing if I could following the pattern (I'm still learning how to read patterns, but it came out alright. I used Red Heart.   I really hope it's not Morgan, and I've been trying to find reasons to believe it isn't. In an interview Robert Kirkman said it would be a huge misstep on their part if Morgan didn't meet up with the group at some point (though he refuses to confirm if he ever does). Also, last December, Scott Gimple said, "People want to follow that character; I want to follow that character. There's a Morgan story to tell. It's the beginning of something, but I'm not going to say what it is, or how involved it is." There hasn't been much of a story for Morgan's character so far, so hopefully they didn't just screw with fans and just killed him off.    They did it! They did the thing with the window!! Ahhhhhh!!!!   I hate to admit that you are be right and there may be new deaths... However, didn't they dig graves for Lori, T-Dog, and Carol (who they thought was dead) at the prison even though there weren't any remains to bury? If so, then that means two of those graves could still be for Noah and Aiden despite not having their bodies.   	18

 Copious amounts of top shelf cannabis.   I love to tongue punch a fart box, especially my wife's.    Hello Aziz, who was the funniest cast member on *This is the End?*   Great job catching up!   Everything was cool, liquor, bud, cheeseburgers, then these two bitches started texting the same guy. He showed up at the party, then he was coaching one of the crazy whores on how to beat the other one's ass.  It's a shame, but it's survival of the fitness boys.      Too much.    I like to play the meow game.      A while back.. you mean five days ago.   That's it!   I know. I talked about this on FB for the past week, and I live in Cincinnati. Rain, gloom, and fog. Expecting a storm here in the next 30 minutes.   I suppose only Ringo knows.   Are you yanking my wand, or do you have some evidence?   ..and that the look-alike had tons of plastic surgery.    I have seen many videos that say Paul is dead, and the remaining three called him "Fauxl" because they wanted to keep the machine going.       the Gryffindor fireplace was connected (in case of an emergency or something) but disabled, and that Sirius (who spent a lot of time learning Hogwarts' secrets) knew how to override the security measures.  That is genius.   The doctor, after an examination, sighed and said, Ive got some bad news. You have cancer, and youd best put your affairs in order. The woman was shocked, but managed to compose herself and walk into the waiting room where her daughter had been waiting. Well, daughter, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things dont go so well. In this case, things arent well. I have cancer. So, lets head to the club and have a martini. After 3 or 4 martinis, the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more martinis. They were eventually approached by some of the womans old friends, who were curious as to what the two were celebrating. The woman told her friends they were drinking to her impending end, Ive been diagnosed with AIDS. The friends were aghast, gave the woman their condolences and beat a hasty retreat. After the friends left, the womans daughter leaned over and whispered, Momma, I thought you said you were dying of cancer, and you just told your friends you were dying of AIDS! Why did you do that?? Because I dont want any of those bitches sleeping with your father after Im gone.   Well Dumbledore would have been pushing 40 by then, maybe he'll make an appearance?   In Bruges has Brendan Gleeson(Moody), Ralph Fiennes(Voldemort), and the girl that played Fleur, forgive me, I have forgotten her name.   I can smoke a pound in a single bound.   35 year old male who only showers weekly in the corner of his mom's basement, and he will never shut up about the fucking button or goddamned home-made lube.   Sewing through the top layer of my skin.   That we are all a part of the same living world, and that there is a life force that is everywhere. Just my theory, but do you ever notice how angry and hostile you feel in the city, but when you walk in a forest you haven't a care in the world?   Car wreck. My brain was injured.    We would wash our hands a lot more.    This pipe of some top quality cannabis that I'm about to spark up when my kids leave in a few.   Does dead count? I was dead for about 90 seconds.   I think you're barking.   I agree. The dementors just shut him down from the first time he encountered one.   Do you have beer?   Wow, they won and lost 5 in the matter of minutes...    How about you just don't drink yourself into a stupor? That sounds like a plan to me.   My bad.   LOL! OPA, I really like you. We should be friends.    This *post* is worthy of applause, well said.   Very close.   3.4 of some sweet sweet Jack.      How awesome would it have been if Albus sent Snape to fetch Harry?  "Hello Petunia, long time. I need to take the boy to school."  I mean, she knew who Snape was, it would have been a better choice instead of Vernon driving all over England trying to avoid some letters.   How awesome would it be to send Severus? Hello Pet...  tunia. I am here to take Lily's son to Hog..  warts.   It would be like trying to divide by zero. The entire world would implode, and the we would be temporarily floating in the atmosphere until we lost all oxygen. It would be hell on earth.  Seriously though, what if your biggest fear is your biggest fear?  The thing of it is, we just don't know.   The top point of the triangle should be pointing up the arm, not downward towards the hand.      Image is fine, the tattoo is upside down.    Why is it upside-down?    I'll be there the first week of August, and I'm excited to see Diagon alley!   I would also add that phoenixes are *extremely* rare, even in the wizarding world. Mythical or not, they're real in the Potterverse, and I doubt that anyone, even Dumbledore could become a phoenix animagus.   One day a redhead, a brunette, and a blonde were on their way to heaven. God told them the stairs to heaven were 1,000 steps and on every step he was going to tell them a joke. If they laughed they would not be able to get to heaven. So the redhead made it to the 45th step and laughed. The brunette made it to the 200th step and laughed. But the blonde made it to the 999th step and laughed even before god told his joke. God asked "Why did you laugh I haven't even told the joke yet" The blonde said "Hahaha I just got the first one!!!"   I think Albus was around 117 when he died.   I'll be there the first week of August, but I have never been alone.      What, it's a good one.  It's also set about thirty minutes up the road from me.   Ha, I was in the county inn, in a camp bunk bed situation. I thought everyone was asleep.   Long story short, next morning, about 12 guys around me all knew, and all they said was, "Well, did you get your nut?"   I have three daughters, and I would do the same. Hell, I would probably take pleasure in it.   Tibetan Freedon Show, 1997, Randall's Island, NYC.   Red River Gorge in Kentucky.   Just happened in Texas not too long ago. A guy found a farm hand raping his daughter. He beat the guy to death, and was not charged. I believe that was the right outcome.   Gummo   Beg your pardon.   They are wearing a Nickelback tee shirt.   I was struck by lightning about four years ago, that was pretty traumatizing.   This is what I was trying to say, yes, I just couldn't find it.   I don't think so, because that happened in Little Hangleton.    Oh, I don't think so. He killed Bertha in Albania beoforehe came back to England with Pettigrew.   It was Bertha Jorkins. We don't know if Wormtail killed her or not. I don't see how Voldemort could have.   Harry isn't a true horcrux. Harry is an *OOPSIE* that Tom Riddle was not aware of.   That's what I do. not to save them, but I'll pause and do other shit for about a half hour, then you can FF through the commercials.    I know. The average half hour show is a 22 minute, three act play. Whether it be sit com or cartoon.    I have them all, but ABC Family adds in the deleted scenes.   Four minutes of movie, six minutes of commercials...   Yes, I have around 100 Kenner figures starting with the original 7.   Riddle's soul split after Lily refused to step aside and let him kill Harry. When Lily didn't step aside and let him kill Harry, that's what caused the rebounding AK curse, causing a piece of his soul to latch on to the only other living thing in the house (who knows where the damn cat was). Harry was the carrier of Tom's soul that he never intended to make. It was purely accidental, but he properly created the other six, giving him an eight piece soul.   Beg your pardon Miss Head, but creating a horcrux takes an enchantment that Voldemort did not do when he attempted to kill Harry.   Yea, that is really creepy. I made another post about that. He was at least 18 in season 1.   Bitch! You know what I want!   The sarcasm is thick with this one.   That's funny.   I don't like to go in the heat.    I have some obscure pieces, but I don't know what they're worth.  Edit: anyone interested?   This album was released in 1993, and it was a bit of an anthem to my life as a young buck. Thing is, it still holds strong, every, single, time, I, listen, to, it.  Edit: Thanks for the gold!   Down to 70% now, but it's been 90-95% the past week.   I got Molly, I needed a Bruiser.       thank you!   I have been called that, but what's it to you man?    I apologize, is there a different sub for this?      What?    Thanks   When I meet someone new, and I get asked that question, I just smile because I am the epitome of stoner.   I'm 38, long hair, goatee, graphic tees, crazy shorts, and sandals.   That's what I meant, sorry. I have 98 command points.  Is Union Jack a good one?   Yea, I've been thinking about Groot. I hate fighting him.   I can buy the alts, 98 A points, but I would rather build my stack of heroes.  Speaking of, who should I invest in?    [Sorry](http://i.imgur.com/saodfPV.png)   No shit, Sherlock.      [Here](http://i.imgur.com/saodfPV.png)   Hang on.   Neither of those, but elektra does very well in the bleed dept. and can kill when the opponent is below 30%.   You could always pick your favorite [chapter art.](http://i.imgur.com/IJQ13E5.jpg)   Don't have Black Knight, but when I don't use Taskmaster I use a 14 Elektra.   I've been playing this month with a 14 Sabertooth and a 13 Taskmaster.         There were plenty of POTUS' that were from Jewish decent, starting with Lincoln, but I think Bernie is the first full blooded.   I think the American people are ready for a serious change, and not that Obama bullshit. Bernie is opening a lot of eyes across the country.   You speak of a woman president, who was the last Jewish president? Nixon?  Edit: Clinton, and then Eisenhower before him   I would put my money on Bernie Sanders.   Making home made lube.   ..and there was a twinkle there that I would say Gambon lacked. Plus Michael is just too damn short. Albus was supposed to be over two meters/six foot.    Harris had a very gentle and quiet voice, and I always thought that was perfect  Yes, this. When I read, I read Albus in Richard's voice.   You are barking.  "Alas, earwax."   Is that all it is? I thought it was like a full on cigarette filter. I just smoke from my pipe, maybe I need to clean it.   Do filters take away the buzz? I smoke nothing but the best, and I've been worried about my lungs lately. I see everyone rolling with a filter tip. Should I?   That's my point, it won't have the pheromones and or hormones.       What are you smokin'?    I hope he's playing *Walk.*  	118
 Minor pet peeve of mine:  "enemy" is a term of war, or battle, whereas "friend" refers to a social relationship.  This phrase is more powerful (and conveys the sentiment better) if altered slightly:  "The enemy of my enemy is my *ally*."  Not being a dick, just putting the idea out there; do what you like!  Fuck the Raiders.   /r/theydidthemath    Chris Harris III incoming?   In the post-game presser Fox said that Rahim was just very fired up, yelling, "That's why you drafted me!"  Fox said that it was all very positive, just lots of emotion after a big play.  Recall that Rahim almost lost his leg last year, and could have died.   Not the 10 hr version.  Downvote!  (Not really!  Good on ya.  Go Avs)   I approve this message.    If it makes you feel any better, this is how I approached every game in the late 2000's against you assholes.  I just knew LT or Sproles would score 5 touchdowns or something.  And they always did.   Agree.  Let's never say salty again.   Every movement starts with a single idea!      Totally right.  Football in the new era is getting to the dance,  then playing your best 3-4 games there.  If we play like the SF, SD, or IND games in the playoffs, we have a good chance.   If we play the SEA or NYJ games, not so much.  It is true for every other team in the league, too.  But I think that the Broncos have a greater margin for error than almost every other team, and that feels good (for example, both the D and O can carry us if one falters).  GG.  Fuck the Raiders.    Are you sure?  Are there any Cardinals players who have an opinion?   Ugh.  No kidding.   Oh yeah, that's the good stuff!   They clearly have a QB package.  Heard Romo and Elway.   Nobody forgets monkey riding a dog.   Ha-*ha!*   **Hate** bullshit calls like that taking away great plays.  Boo.   False.  NE and KC and SD away are rough.  Cincinnati too.     Nobody knows anything until Phil Simms explains it.   Juwana-Man trucking.   Yeah.  #54.  Here's a helpful guide as his twitter pic: [ pic] (https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/514594308352385027/l_2ixyDj.jpeg)   Groovy.  Thanks.   You are cool.   Not a Chargers historian - which of your # are retired, and I am guessing his will be once he gets the HOF?   Chargers fans:  LT celebration okay?  Homage or being a dick?   Umm.  Thanks,  Carey.  Awkward as fuck here.   Ro-mo.  Ro-mo.   Nah, watch this horsemeat commercial.   Still might . . . And give a first down to the Chargers from the flag.  This could be more supreme stupid from Malik.   I think this may have been the initial pitch.   Own.  That. Shit.  It is *your* sandwich,  too.   "Okay, guys, we have reached our allotted amount of rapes and beatings.  Tone it down."   Are you sure?   Everyone watches *Two Broke Girls*, *The Big Bang Theory*, *Two and a Half Men*, *Elementary*, and millions of CSI/NCIS iterations.  Everybody.   You are correct.   Most folk in these parts think he will play out his full 5 yr contract (so, two more years after this one).  Seems possible if the injury bug stays away.  He isn't exactly getting worse.   On purpose, tighter is safer.   Yeah, but *he'd* know.   I'd answer, but I am technically at risk for alcoholism,  so . . .    Other Manning and Romo?   Saving them for the second half, I bet.   Clearly ran 5 yards.   Solid 2 min drill here.  Looks like we will get points w/o giving Rivers a shot.  Obv no turnover etc   Carter *also* bit on the short route.  Who cares if he catches it 10 yards short?   Yeah, me too.     No way Q.Carter belongs on Gates. I get the plan, coaches, but he has failed.  Move on to something else, jeez.   No arguments here, but in a game thread?   Von Miller is our dreams.   He posted a bunch of testimonials regarding the sexual assault allegations.  Like LOTS of them.   I approve this message.  *The Catch* is legendary.   It'd be like comparing any 98 yard drive to *The Drive*.   I think it is the Donahue (sp?) Interview.   If not that, the black and white one with Mike Wallace.   Lost to the Ravens -- Acknowledge.   Beat Chargers and Patriots -- Ignore.  Lose to Seahawks -- Acknowledge.    ETC ETC.  DITCH this shit.   Until very recently, this was the Broncos' *m.o.* as well - collapses from frontrunner to missing the playoffs basically got Shanahan fired and destroyed any chance McDaniels had to continue as our coach.   Yeah, I can't wait (but I am going to, because there's lots more football to be excited about!)   I think it is because ARI still plays SF once (and beat them earlier!) and SEA twice.  So, those games have a much greater effect on the implications than does this one.  Even if PHI wins, ARI is still in 1st place with an inside track, and conversely, if ARI wins, they can still shit the bed in their division games.   I mean that you have more security with Bitcoin because your identity is not automatically attached to your transactions.  I agree that there is greater responsibility to take care of your keys, devices,  etc with Bitcoin, but the benefits lay in divorcing your personal information from your purchasing power, and I think that is worth the increase in personal responsibility.    Totally agree.  My go-to "elevator" explanation is this:  1.  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency which is traded through a *network*.  (People understand "peer-to-peer" from Napster, and most have a reasonable concept of a "network").  2.  Just like banks/companies/families have a ledger/transaction balance/checkbook - so does the Bitcoin network.  But, it is public, and everyone in the network has a copy.  (Likewise, people understand a "ledger" - making the jump from a pen-and-paper ledger to a digital, decentralized on is certainly a leap, but you can help facilitate that leap by introducing that concept early)  3.  Mention the "headline" benefits (no 3rd party, personal security, etc.)  (Get 'em excited!)  **Then**, if they are interested, we can talk about the blockchain, mining, SHA256, etc, etc.  But don't load people up with that up front - they'll get scared.   Yeah, that is a major early misconception (one which I had, as well).  And you can tell that the gentleman was thinking along those very lines when he asked, "And that's for *one* Bitcoin?"   This was a very valiant effort for morning news/talk TV.  Important points were made, there was some fogginess on the details (I don't think she really understands where bitcoins come from or what they *are*), but overall this was way better than I had anticipated.  If segments like these cause just 1 in 100 people to give bitcoin a serious investigation, then they deserve praise.   Good job, ungulate bro!  *hoof bump*    Wait, I was watching that game, what was so egregious?   ninja edit:  The offensive P.I.?   This is a legitimate complaint.  Honest assessment of your record / division standing after those 6 games you mention (i.e., before finishing up the division slate)?   But it was to the Rams/Seahawks game - where you got to watch the Fail Mary beneficiaries get Special Teamsed to death.      Still beat the Steelers.  You're probably gonna be the game that keeps them out of the playoffs.    I read that as "Food Loin" every single time.  You know, like a loin of food?   JJ Watt is a just a shared hallucination of the entire human race.   Through the first seven weeks, I think we are getting a much better picture of how this season is going to play out.  And let me tell you a secret: it is going to be **AWESOME**.  We are looking at absolute dogfights in the AFC West, AFC North, NFC East, NFC North, and NFC West, with at least four legitimately strong Wild Card teams in each conference.  Do not be surprised if a 10-6 team whiffs again this year (like last year's Cards).  And then, the playoffs will get going.  Since opening up the year slowly, the Colts, Broncos, Ravens, Patriots, and Chargers look *really* strong.  Add in a dark horse like the Bengals (who have fallen off of late) and the Chiefs or Texans and you've got some great playoff football brewing.  And the NFC won't disappoint either!  Cowboys and Eagles still have 2 games against each other, but are otherwise X-1.  Packers and Lions are X-2, and have looked unstoppable at times.  The West is going to be absurd unless Seattle falls off the map, as the top 3 teams still have 5 games between them (Arizona has the lone win, so far).  The possible playoff matchups here are also very intriguing.  tl;dr - As we approach the midway point, this year's playoff push looks to be thoroughly entertaining - and the playoffs themselves will be even better.   Actual line from that movie (when Will and Shawn (Sean?  w/e) are parting ways, and hugging:   Will:  Does this violate the doctor/patient relationship?    Sean:  Only if you grab my ass.  A fine joke, reasonable, not even too dirty with only one possible bad word.  The TV "censored" version:   Will:  Does this violate the doctor/patient relationship?    Sean:  Only if you turn around.  Isn't buttsex dirtier than ass-grabbing?  TV is weird.   PFM said they installed the fake screen to DT -- Welker Go route on Friday, too.  DO YOU SEE WHAT YOUR THURSDAY GAMES ROB US OF, GOODELL?  DO YOU SEE!?!?!?   0/   We scrong, then.   Oh man, it is Chargers week!  Time to pull out the Cryin' Ryan youtubes!   Did you cringe when the announcer on Sat. night said, "When I look at him [Winston], I just keep seeing Big Ben!"  Because my wife and I did.   Check out [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nfl-week-6-elo-ratings-and-playoff-odds/), they do a weekly "Playoff Odds" calculation and often mention the possibility of a team going winless.  I have linked to week 6, where the Raiders were predicted to go winless in 11% of the simulations - the Jaguars, the other winless team at the time, went winless in 7% of the simulations.    So, to answer your question, I would guess that the number is slightly higher than 11% - so probably better than 1-in-9.   Stupid Thursday games. If you'll recall, this happened last year to us (Welker had his concussion the Sunday before and obviously couldn't play on Thursday).   Also /r/dataisbeautiful would eat this up.   First he was stream - of - consciousness dreaming about Andrew Luck getting traded to the Broncos in 2030 and beating Peyton ' s record.  Then Collinsworth said they'd be at home for it.  And Al said they be *in* the home, and then said maybe in the casket.  No verbatim   Jokingly referred to his own demise on national tv.    Bad juju.   Al Michaels ' daydreams are awesome.    Quick!!! Camera on Peyton!   Ha!  Go Cardinals!   Raiders could be the last winless team.  Oh, wait . . .    Relevant:  Luck has played one more game.  Your point stands.  Talk to a Texans fan about Colts and QBs.   Very possible.  One NFCE team will be good, one NFCN team, too.  2nd and 3rd in the West have to compete with them.  Will be dicey.  For WC, obv.   How many times are they going to let the right tackle move early?   Eagles are a reasonable answer, but I would give it to Dallas.   And of the 6 games between those 3, only 1 has been played so far (Cards beat 9ers).  Then, we learned the Rams can show up, too.  That division race is going to be awesome to watch.   Change hands! !!!   And we spotted 'em one incompletion.   Me too.   Yeah, he really does.   Possible but very unlikely.  Him sitting out his first 3-4 years, plus injury last year make it a longshot.   Broncos won toss and deferred.   The bad CB blitz on 3rd and 17 was a more likely culprit. Boo.   Pot Roast with the record.  Calling it.   Hahaha.  Harbaugh is awful.  Even if he wins this challenge (50/50), he just moves the Broncos back 15-20 yards.   Still 1st down and 10 to go.  Is your time out worth that little?  What will Kaepernick do the next time he can't snap the ball in time?   WR in high school.   John Fox ' s Review Coach has the responsibility to call down to him there.   Which animal?   Easy call, his arm with the ball hits the pylon.   Kick never had a chance.   Happy with how this game is playing out.  Just like last week, a division foe is going to lose in heartbreaking fashion.   Sick Gaines, bro.   I think that was a poor challenge anyway.  Chargers still go on 4th there.   A. Sherman is best Sherman.  	105

I can assure you, it *wasn't* spam.    I'd like to get it *un*banned and back up   running again.  thanks!       the days of green lawns and pickets fences are over.  why are they over?  it just rained a ton where I live, and though there've been the regular dry periods that most of the country has experienced, water's never been something lacking in my area and nor really is land                                                                                                                                                                           seems hypocritical.   I guess this means that he's ordered his guards to stop carrying guns and start carrying ... candycanes?                                                                                                          Don't get me wrong, I have *no* doubt that things are going to continue to advance... and continue to advance to technologies that are capable of all sorts of things we can't even imagine yet....  ....but, I still think the 'singularity' concept is more like an 'it all blends together because it's over the horizon and we just can't yet see what it's going to be or how it's all going to fit together'  than a 'this is going to be so dense we'll never figure it out'           I personally think the singularity is overstated, overhyped, and essentially just a marketing buzzword.  I think things will continue to get ever-more complex... and that the average person will become ever-more confused by them... ...and even the *smartest* people will have difficulties discerning elements... ....but, never underestimate the human mind's ability to 'sum things up'.   to 'lump things together', to 'pattern recognize' and, as such, categorize things, process things, or otherwise sum things up such as to dismiss them.   in short: 'the singularity' is a marketing pr buzzword.  it's hype.  it's the 'over the horizon' phrase that the present uses to 'lump things' it can't yet see.   when we get there, it'll be much clearer   maybe it's zooming out?  carbon required to harvest, transport, process, etc?  Consume the carbs and we fart their carbon back out?   in such that the carbon equal to (and more likely greater than) that that's initially sequestered is released over the course of... a year?   definitely easier for 'em to get to....     AI means self awareness, consciousness and not a better calculator  have something to back that up?  I believe you may be over-complicating the definition of AI  for example, Merriam-Webster defines AI as: : an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence  : the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior   wikipedia, obviously the standard-setter on everything and never wrong,   Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also the name of the academic field of study which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behavior. Major AI researchers and textbooks define this field as "the study and design of intelligent agents",[1] in which an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.[2] John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955,[3] defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".   Wired covered this about 15 years ago... can't remember if it was Kurzweil, quote, interview, or written by... I know he was definitely mentioned in it.   but, it created a differentiation between artificial intelligence and artificial spirituality. ...whereby the intelligence had become so complex that the system was otherwise 'contemplating things' on a spiritual level.  That said, AI has been around for quite some time... and it doesn't necessarily imply 'consciousness' ... at least not in the more traditional perception of the word... as defined by Google   consciousness kn(t)SHsns/ noun the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings. "she failed to regain consciousness and died two days later" the awareness or perception of something by a person. plural noun: consciousnesses "her acute consciousness of Mike's presence" the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world. "consciousness emerges from the operations of the brain"   *My* understanding of it... as it was explained somewhere along my readings.. is that its been around for quite some time.   and that it's basically a system's ability to make independent decisions based on information w/out human involvement in those decisions.  obviously this would fit the 'aware of one's surroundings' aspect of the google definition above... whereby, say, a satellite with a sensor array designed to detected space debris .... ... as well a laser designed to 'zap' the debris to blow it up or otherwise put it into a decaying orbit.    instead of a human deciding for each   every ISS nut   bolt floating around... the satellite uses its sensors to detect analyze, categorize, and otherwise identify the space debris... ...and, then, uses its programming to 'zap' it w/out human intervention, assuming it matches preprogrammed perimeters.   but, the 'decision' is still preprogrammed... within pre-established perimeters. It is an 'intelligent' decision, but not necessarily one that requires 'consciousness' to do... ...though, it could be argued that the satellite has self awareness due to its ability to detect things around it... but in truth, it's just functioning within perimeters.     AC or AS even would take that to an entirely different level... each about as complex over the previous as AC over AI.  ...at least in my opinion.  AI itself isn't really all that fascinating, systems utilizing it are built   used all the time... AC? I'm not quite sure we've reached systems capable of that ...yet.  and, even if/when we do, it will still, technically, be functioning within preprogrammed perimeters.  At the same time, machines write their own code all the time... most code is machine-written coding at this point ... has been for probably about a decade.  but, again, difference between AI, AC, and AS.  I'm not saying we can't get there, I'm not saying people won't program systems to be as convincing as possible (of their consciousness   spirituality) ... they already are, the tech news covers this all the time... ... hell, i'm not even saying it won't actually be conscious, spiritual, and have a 'soul'... much more simplistic machines seem to have 'souls' or 'essences' of sort... just talk to a farmer about his tractor or a grease monkey about his '68 mustang in his garage... but, imo, I believe that people will have a difficulty of sort accepting AC or AS ... or even AI in its more simplistic understanding... without an organic component to the system.   ...which, well, can easily be involved.  we're building neurons all the time, and we've had neurons that interact with silicon systems for well over a decade... so to build a hybridized system... ...where most of the processing happens on the 'binary-side' of things is *totally* possible... again, I believe we've already done it.. many times...  ...and, even go so far that all the *primary* and '*critical*' processings... ...the ones that the user interacts with that creates the 'convincing consciousness' side of things to the lay person interacting with.... but, again, w/out typing the two together... or, with a removal of the organic, I still imagine people will see it as being, essentially, a machine.                          	199
 What do you mean "employment agreement"?  Employers must pay you for all the time you work. If you're working, you have to get paid for it.  There's no employment agreement that can supersede that.   Eh, your former employer sounds like a jerk. It's a campus job, so it's supposed to be a learning experience as well as employment.   Giving you the boot without giving you a heads up about your issues and giving you a chance to improve or change would be bad enough in a regular job. For a student job on campus, that's just beyond the pale.   If you don't care about keeping your job, why not just report it on up the line. I'm sure the upper management would like to know that you're keeping sensitive customer data on an unsecured, external HD for months after the work is done.   And hey, maybe the problem actually gets fixed. Worst case, your boss cans you and you collect unemployment.             Yes, but he still manages to become a super-ninja and sex all kinds of hot women.  The books are a fun read, but Kvoth is a Mary Sue to end all Mary Sues.         Personalized pavers that once lined Clark and Addison streets near Wrigley Field, home of Chicago Cubs, have been found around Pontiac, purportedly coming from the nearby landfill. The bricks had been billed as permanent fixtures by the Cubs organization when they began selling them in 2006.  The Chicago Cubs began selling the pavers near the holiday season in 2006, inviting fans to purchase brick pavers on which they could engrave personalized messages, up to a maximum of three lines and 15 characters per line. Prices varied, but were typically around $160.      Mediocre!                     In my defense, I copied it from the original article.   Greetings, Starfighter. You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan armada.                      I would like to buy a ticket right now, please and thank you.      Life is a spoiler      Let's have a press junket to try and generate a little positive PR and then throw a few reporters in prison when they write about stuff we don't want them to write about. Makes perfect sense,.   Didn't feel like much of anything, really. Nice to see Stan and Peggy finally get together.   I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of Don meditating and then the cut to the Coke ad. Maybe I'm dense, but it didn't mean anything to me.      I watched the trailer and it actually made me laugh, which is a rare thing for a sitcom trailer.  I'll definitely give this a few episodes when it hits the tube.      Matthew Perry's  "Mr. Sunshine" had an opening theme song which was "Mister Sunshine..yeah" and then on to the show.   It's all in the game, yo.         Ozymandias was based on Thunderbolt and Silk Spectre was Nightshade.  It's important to remember that Moore changed these characters quite a bit when writing Watchmen. Nite Owl and Rorschach are maybe the closest to their Charlton equivalents. Silk Spectre is almost nothing like Nightshade and in fact her outfit is based partially on another 40's heroine, Phantom Lady.      Mad Max is hampered by its R rating and maybe a bunch of people who would like to see it spent their money on Avengers last week.  I expect it's going to have long legs, though. It's a great great film and it's going to benefit from buzz and word of mouth.    Yes, Adalind said that the anti-Hexenbiest smoothie was only a temporary solution to the Juliette problem. I expect her powers will come roaring back at a plot-convenient time.    Yes, I was thinking that bad ass Juliette would be the heavy hitter on the team going forward, but it looks like Claire Coffee is going to be the Grimm Team Hexenbiest instead.  Can't fault the decision since Coffee is the better actress and much prettier to boot.          Katheryn Winnick                Yes they did. They finally realized that they loved each other, all the previous seasons to the contrary not withstanding.   I really liked that show and the final episodes were just terrible.   I agree. I hate that you can't have a man and a woman be friends/partners without it turning into a romantic sub-plot.  I really really hated the ending of Warehouse 13 for that very reason.   That green guy...what's his name?      TIA?         It's [nutpicking](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nutpicking). Find some whack job on the other side and compose a breathless, blog entry excoriating their whackjobiness.   Makes for good clickbait, but it doesn't mean much.   I'm offended by that question.    Never get out of the car. Never ever get out of the car in a situation like that.  My driver's ed teacher told me a story of a student of his who loved to fight. Big guy. Strong. Loved to scrap.  So one day he gets rear ended and he gets out of the car, fists up, ready to mix it up.  The other guy just shoots him.  A couple years back I was driving to work after dropping off my daughter and some asshole in a landscaping truck is behind me and honking every time I stop at a stop sign. Like he doesn't understand the concept.   It's a nice day and I have the window down, so after a couple of these I make a comment or two out the window about his lack of understanding of traffic rules. At the next stop he stops his truck,and gets out. I can see him walking towards me in the side view mirror.  For about a half second I contemplated getting out of the car and teaching this asshole a lesson. Then I'm thinking that I'm a grown man with a family and a mortgage, the last thing I want is to bleed out in the street because someone honked at me at a stop sign.   So I waited for him to get close, then I put my foot down and drove away.   Very few countries have that many large venues suitable for a World Cup match. Most soccer stadiums in these countries are for local teams. They can't seat 50,000+ fans with concessions, parking, etc.  Plus, building new stuff helps FIFA get their grift.   I love sports, but more often than not it seems the whole reason to own a team is to squeeze money out of the public coffers and justify shady real estate deals.      I'm pretty sure that FIFA is the only international organization more corrupt than the IOC.               Yeah, I don't know. I have no problem believing Kim is an evil bastard, but I don't quite buy that he's a Bond villain.    But you can buy a 2kw generator for one tenth the price of the battery.  From an economic perspective, it makes no sense at all.      Make no mistake, this kind of internet vigilantism is only going to get worse as years go by.   Look at some kid the wrong way or sit on the train with your legs spread too wide or make a dumb joke to your seatmate at a conference and some righteous defender of all that's right is going to whip out their bat phone and make sure your supposed transgression is spread to the furthest corner of the world.  Welcome to the fishbowl.    The video looks best when the characters are pretty much static and the camera is doing the moving. Then it's very stylish and evocative.  When the characters move too much, they look jerky and video-gamey and it's not as effective.         I prefer [this pic](https://scontent-lga.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/10852759_785821501508004_1931213515_n.jpg)      Yes, the 65+ cohort are working more than they used to, but they still work a lot less than the 16-64 group. They're also increasing as a percentage of the population, so overall it's a drag on the total Labor Force Participation rate.   I'm sorry, but you've made one of the classic blunders. Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.  Oops, sorry. I mean the fairly common mistake of confusing rate with number and how rates of smaller groups change the rates of larger ones.  Now, it's certainly true that the labor force participation rate (LFP) for those 65 and older has been increasing. You can see an increase of a few percent over the last ten years. It's now about 19%. But LFP for the 25 to 64 cohort is 77%, obviously much higher.  The issue isn't that the 65+ cohort is working less than they used to. As your data shows, they're working more. But they still work a lot less than younger Americans and since they're increasing as a percentage of the total population, 12.4% to 13% based on census data, the overall LFP rate goes down.      Nicely done, although the song is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.  I accidentally played the S2 teaser trailer at work and as soon as the sound came out of the speakers my co-worker spun around and was like, "Holy crap. What's that?"   Sure, but the long-term decline in the the labor participation rate [is mostly structural](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/declining-labor-participation-rates/).  The US population is aging and the Boomers are retiring. A lot of people checked out of the economy early due to the Great Recession and they're not coming back.   Yes, you should watch them...because they are awesome.   Sure they do. There are [six different official unemployment calculations](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm), each calculating the number based on different factors.  The one we normally consider to be the official unemployment rate, the one that gets quoted in the media, is U3.      	84
 How is the sizing compared to JL?    It rarely happens, but when it does it sucks. Not only do I feel sore when I move, but my legs just ache. I had chocolate milk with protein powder after I worked out, and then ate an actual meal another half hour later. I am getting plenty of water. I could have stretched more afterwards, but this has happened to me before when I have stretched. I'm a rower and I did some pretty intense and long race pieces this morning in a single.   Oh also I realized that I go on some pretty terrible sugar binges if I completely cut it out of my diet. So have some chocolate chips or a cookie every couple of days or something so you don't lose your mind. It helps with the binge eating and with general mood improvement.    Society tells us that therapy is for the weak but honestly that shit is so damn helpful. I feel like the typical rowing mentality of "push through, you ARE tough enough for this" is also working against my argument here, but if you really want help, you should try it. I'm a 20 year old lightweight female rower, so I know your struggle, and even if it doesn't work out for you, go to two or three sessions and see what happens. See if your school offers anything.   Also my 2k PB is a 7:41 when I weighted 132 so maybe we should be friends or something?  	4

 Because there might be new viewers who have no idea what it's called?         My only gripe with the main event was that shoddy producing with bad camera angles    Makes sense. He doesn't seem to have that new driver vibe to him   Since WWE is hard on protecting their product now, most of the new talents are given a new, copyrighted name that they can't use elsewhere.   But there are leftover from the old era, John Cena, Randy Orton and Mark Henry were lucky to debut when trademark is not really important, or in Mark Henry's case, his name, like Kurt Angle, carried it's own weight  So /SC, which talent was the last one was allowed by the WWE to use his or her own name?   Depends. Jann is an exceptional talent that also adapts to the physical side of racing like duck to water. Not many people, especially people that are used to sit on their couch could commit to.  For example Gregger Huttu, who is regarded to be the fastest driver in virtual racing, was totally drained physically when he test a real racing car at Skip Barber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_sCrM1CcI  It helps that Jann's is a footballer, and that he might have trained with his dad. But a normal person who has no physical training prior? he might have a harder time   I know, IIRC it was more than that the last time. But I was just pointing out Suzie got the drive because of Toto's influence as a shareholder, not because Williams is a customer team for Merc.   Her first test with Williams was when Williams are still using Renault.   Son Goku      He was McLaren's test driver during his DTM years, so it's not like he has no single seater experience   Actually Toto has a stake in Williams  Torger Christian "Toto" Wolff[1] (born January 12, 1972 in Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian investor and racing driver who is currently a 30% Owner and Executive Director of Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team and *a shareholder in Williams F1 of which he owns just under 5% in shares.*    Corey Graves is doing this with Becky Lynch on NXT. One of my favourite thing because he hates her for no reason    the banking means that you would need minimal steering when you use the karousel and if you time it just right, it will spit you out in a straight path.   I always use that during online races where new drivers would use the upper non banking section and I would just swoop through and overtake them. There is a LOT of time to be gained there  A (not really clean) lap from me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N06vsYwNyB4   I kinda understand what he's coming from really. LU feels like a Spanish Soap Drama with awesome wrestling.   The way the promos are packaged, the video work, the cuts, it feels like watching a TV drama instead of a wrestling show. There is no Kayfabe or suspension of reality since you know it's just a tv drama.  Maybe that's why Cornette hates it due to his old school way.   If 100% of the people using mobile phone in the world uses smartphone, yes.   But since not everyone is, hence the logic is still Call -- Timeout -- Voicemail. Everything is standardised, no matter what phone you use and no matter what country you use that phone in   Hmm  I'd say the heavier, brushless motor means that you have a better control on your steering (no more gear meshing feeling) and you will get better road feedback as well  Also the stock rim that comes with the set feels awesome and robust   any game that supports directdevice should work with the wheel. I've even used it for Formula 1 Championship 99-02  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEVf0B2Lrfc   Well if I would have to compare them in Laymen's term  T300RS - McLaren P1  G27 - Nissan GTR  Microsoft Wheel - Suzuki Wagon R.  And yes, the extra that you pay for it are worth it.    I agree, except the for your second paragraph. They do not "pick" Project Cars, they were chosen by the developers to help with the handling and give feedbacks.   There are no perfect simulators out there and I doubt there ever will be. Hence why I just race and have fun on them all.    A returning Hell Rock would have been much better   http://imgur.com/a/VV4i7   Also Lana only follows Rusev on twitter right?   Dreamer: Hey Dixie, I haven't got my pay yet  Carter: Sorry about that. We're a little short atm. Why don't you work some indie shows for a bit?  HHH: Want to work for us for a night? We pay you on time  /S  *Downvotes incoming*   Old but powerful one  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQOJSqTF1cM   With an L motor? No. Especially when the car is around 1kg ++ Need to use the RC motor for that      The texture for the skins does not look high res tho (pixelated sponsors). Might need to double the size next time   Imagine if he debuts with the Big Show's music  Wellll!! Well it's the Big Joe! It's the Big Bad Joe toniiight!~   I don't think Pirelli could bring that much tyres. They would have to pick a tyre in a certain amount of time before a race so that Pirelli could handle the logistics      Track specific bug. Had no issues with other tracks atm      Being a real life Batman   I was racing online at Bathurst last night. I was on pole, and was looking forward to a clean race since the other guys were fast on the straights, but my car was fast on the twisty bits, hence I would be out of harm's way when cars thread the needle on the top of the hill  But it turned into a sham quickly. At the start, the guy in third jumped the start, and hit me. Not only that I have now a broken car, I ALSO have deemed to jumped the start, even tho it was not my fault.   As I trundled along avoiding the mass accident on top of the hill as I expected to happen, I pitted, sure to be able to challenge for some consolation places.   But due to the auto pit exit, the bloody game said that I cut the corner when exiting the pits. And I have a bloody 1 MINUTE penalty. 1 minute! How the bloody developers think that 1 minute is a good penalty for corner cutting?  Now that I have lost a lot of time for that penalty, I have to pit for a second time to fix my car, and I thought the first penalty was my own fault, so I slammed on the brakes before the manual control was handed back to me when I exit the pit lane. But lo-behold! I was given ANOTHER BLOODY 1 MINUTE PENALTY.  TL;DR: Corner cutting is buggy, and the penalty should be lessen to 5 seconds   Depends on the racing series. Most FIA sanctioned race will penalise the driver that ignores the blue flags three times.    Microphone on a pole match   Because Steph, as with Hunter is a fitness freak. Both of them even have a fitness video.  Shane meanwhile has not been working out for a while, and i doubt he could work in the ring anymore unless he starts back from basic   do you have anything smaller?      http://i.imgur.com/z8gU2Q8.jpg   watched that Wrestle 1  Goldberg entering one changing room, and exiting another  Altho I'm more sorry to see them retire KroniK.    Years of experience. Really. You'd develop like a 6th sense via adjusting where would the guy be in relative to you. Audio cues also helps      WWE is like reality TV drama with wrestling in it  Lucha Underground is like Wrestling with fake spanish soap opera in it  Others are wrestling with story if they feel they need it   Yep. For me it's HUD with mirrors, HUD without mirrors, no HUD, and then telemetry in that order whenever I cycle the HUD button in the cockpit   Last time I did a 12 hour endurance race in the old GTR game. After the race, I have a fever, was really nauseous and my eyes won't focus for an hour after that.  10/10 would do again   Goldberg is a poor man's Gillberg   Try moving the brake balance forward a bit. I set the brake balance at 64% forward on the Formula A car and I rarely locks now.    Yep. Hence why I usually brake and coast now instead of slamming on the brakes as hard as I can. Hard to do when a maniac behind just slam into you instead of trying to outbrake me :/   I hope the tag match would be ala War Games, one by one a tag partner is released in teh ring   Depends. IIRC McMahon was furious when Punk and Cena did that spot, and the only reason they got away with it was that they were the top two guys at the time.      New Jack. Easily one of the most hated guy out there He does not really loves wrestling. He just loves hurting people    Holy shit. I totally dig that guitar riff for Bork   I only bought it because I don't have consoles, and 2K15 is the first for the PC for a while.  Honestly tho they should ditch Yukes!. The lack of wrestlers were supposedly due to "storage limitation" but I blame Yukes! on still being stuck on last gen console mentality for that. Storage are cheap nowadays, and not everything should only be stored on the DVD/Blu-Ray. But that's Japanese developers for you   Brundle drove the Force India and found out first hand how difficult the modern cars are compared to the ones years before   Can't seem to adjust the brake balance in the car. I've been locking the rears on the Formula A and usually I would shift the brake balance forward for corners that i have this issues. but it does not seem to work as my rear keeps on locking.   Manually shifting teh brake balance in the pits works, but then I would have an overheating problem as I can't shift the brakes to the rear.  Anybody else having this problems?   Sepang   Yep. just found out about this in accident last night. My sweetspot is 10.   I think it calculate the number of people clicked/searched for the particular show rather than the show that are shown on the network itself   Sepang will usually offer cheap tickets a year in advance too, hence making them even cheaper   CM Punk VS Cena (RAW) for the main event slot of WMXXX   Ed Leslie?  Oh wait, that's for his whole career   "THE DRAGON IS TWERKING MAGGLE!"   San Jose North Mexico  Goddamit JBL   How is Tamina related to the Ano'ai? through her mom? Because IIRC Snuka is not related to them   Has he changed his style in TNA? I mean he was famous for being sloppy in WWE, but has he turned for the better in TNA?   Never saw his match in TNA, well basically TNA in general as it's not shown in my country, so i'm legit curious   It was badly executed, I'll give you that. And once he won you knew what the main event for WM is   Uhaa-man will win it away from Hooah-man!   It's called Kanji and both Japanese and Chinese use them   What /u/cookiebombers meant was turn one was specifically tight. Too tight for any racing cars IMO. It's like a mini hairpin. if they had shorten the barriers, I think it would have been much better    An interesting fact about the last Monday Nitro, Road Dogg, who was released from WWE due to drugs, was at Panama City trying to get a job with WCW that day. He was surprised to see Shane McMahon there instead   JAVA uses NPAPI to run on browsers, and for some reason Chrome has disabled it starting in April 2015. Hence live timing sites that relies on JAVA would not work now.  Enabling NPAPI in Chrome Version 42 and later  In your URL bar, enter:  chrome://flags/#enable-npapi   Click the Enable link for the Enable NPAPI configuration option.  Click the Relaunch button that now appears at the bottom of the configuration page.    dat replay  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhWAglnawI   because they are face instead of heel now? the switcharoo between them and The NEW DAY! is quite nicely done tho. It was subtle   It's because they used her for the whole taping session, which is why she seems to be on every episode.   And you she needs the exposure. You don't become good from just hiding behind the scene. She might not be good now. but in time with enough experience she would   err I did this because I wanted to use only 240 degrees   But Rusev, we are already married...  TO VLADIMIR POOOTIN!   Also you can cheat the degree of rotation here. rotate until you see your DESIRED degree of rotation, and hold it there   You get the pack from pre-order   Just a thought, but is Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury are now MORE over as J J than when they were active wrestlers?      Happened to me last night. I had to uninstall Logitech Profiler to make it work.      Option - Control - Calibrate Wheel at the bottom  here: https://youtu.be/0K6Aiiz8RN4?t=1158   Wheel calibration menu? I set mine at 240 there   No assist here. Brakes feels okay. The default setting for every car is 90% brake pressure, hence even if you are stomping the pedal your car is only using 90% brakes. It might be to help newer drivers not to lock their brakes? Try changing it to 100%   I was listening to music during the game downloading session and I forgot to pause it when I ran the game  It was this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GVIMWt8q2Q   Also some of this short reign were in Russo years where they need something to get viewers to watch their product. Title Changes were the easiest hook    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K6Aiiz8RN4  Testing Project Cars for teh first time. Default graphic settings on a GTX970 @1080p. FPS counter on top left  Must say it looks good   For some reason when I checked the system log for the game it states  Nvidia SLi false AMD Crossfire false  I am using 970 SLi. So yeah. It does not detect my SLi     They are being courted by ROH (long term contract), LU (for season 2) and TNA (big contract) as reported by Wrestling Observer Newslette   Had some issues with Logitech Profiler and Project Cars. When the game starts, apparently Logitech Profiler (running in background) would crash, and restart. This will lead to the game being forced back to the foreground. In some rare cases, the game would not show up even if you click on the icon on the taskbar  Solutions:  If you are using logitech peripherals like controller and steering wheel, run the game in Windowed mode.   Either that or uninstall Logitech Profiler altogether if you're not using any Logitech peripherals         Currently I am taking "TNA is dead" with a grain of salt. It's like a new meme of wrestling.   With the report that they are talking to Young Bucks, I don't think their position is that bad. Not making as much as they would like, yes, but not as bad as people are making them to be.      All I can think of is "That would definitely fail side impact crash test"      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzmI3vAIhbE   I would accept it if it's just for a special show, not if it's used for every match.  Most wrestling matches are built up slowly to that crescendo, that apex if you will. And the moves, such as signature and/or finisher is a guide for the viewers.    The only thing I hate about it is the upper orange/red swoosh on the nose make the nose looks like it has two section, ala the old stepped nose.   They should have made Ambrose vs Rollins match last. by the time Orton vs Reigns was up, i stopped watching knowing they can't top any other segments of the night   I read that at "#perverse" for some reason    Not me. Newer cars have those sleeker looking profile    Their Iron Man match in FCW was awesome as well   Rene Rast uses Project Cars for training and track learning  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZ41aHyZhwgVt3aBYxquSQ     rFactor solved this years ago IMO by not having any pit crew animation, and you have to target a red box in your pit box. A good driver could save loads of time attacking the pit lane    which should be easy. WMD forums would be full of custom skins next week   Foley winning the World Title the first time. We only had Monday Night Raw in my country at the time, and it was pre internet days so nobody knows the results in advance.   Also the night when Jericho beats HHH for the world title in RAW. Fuck the ending where he has to give back the belt tho   They were part of Back Street Krew, which makes sense   IIRC Rikishi was with the Undertaker's group of backstage enforcers, the Back Street Krew      Prost was Ligier, which was quite a good midfield team. And they were never backmarkers.   Prost and Panis could, and should have better results, but Panis never did show all the promise he had before his nasty accident, and Prost was never a good team boss.          Depends. The reason it would work in WEC is because the top teams are all factory teams, each running three cars, and each are backed by a powerful car company budget.   The same rule in F1 would quickly kill of the non works team that are struggling like Sauber and Marussia. And remember, the 3 car per team idea was also floated in F1 but quickly shot down by fans themselves.   As a Malaysian they also have cheaper price for Local students. Some fans recycle their old university card to get in cheaper   your explanation made me realise why they changed to rumblestrips instead of painted concrete sidewalk kerbs years ago   Ironically if not for Nando's toy throwing tantrum, McLaren would have comfortably win the 2007 WCC if not of they being thrown out of the championship for constructors   24 hour race car, which I think is a LMP1 car for all intent and purposes. Lego took some liberty I think. But I like it due to I can modify it with my own remote control and lego engine with minimal change.   The generic F1 car model is awesome due to the pushrod suspension, something that actually worked well and made it easy for me to explain how F1 suspension works to other people   Hmm Naomi and Cameron looks to have normal body size, as well as Emma.   But seriously she does seem to be thinner as you said   Also they have backstage duties as well. Producers I think? Wrestling means they would have less time fore their real jobs   I just realised that Paige actually has a hot body but her current costume makes her look slim   It's actually an easy way for the drivers to locate the apex of the corner, hence why they are everywhere, even at street circuits   Depends. Some of the drivers who grew up in the Senna era like Alonso and Hamilton actually wanted to drive for McLaren rather than Ferrari   I am 30 and I also love Lego  http://imgur.com/a/cMsik   Roman Reigns   All broadcasters have streaming option IIRC. Fox in Asia have Fox Sports Play. NBC has their own streaming, altho according to people here it's a bit laggy, and most of the people who get the Sky broadcast is using NowTV.   In fact, for Fox, while the TV only shows the race, for the online stream the have dedicated onboard and pitlane stream as well   I tried to get into the site after the race started. I can't due to all the traffic. still needs a long way to go before it's a feasible pay option   0 lap gap, but how many seconds?   streamup is horrible once it get a lot of viewers. Try using gaminglive.tv as alternative   Or he could slowly loose all of his eccentric character, and by the end of his run, have a looser retire match against his brother. At the end, he's no longer goldust, and lost as Dustin, passing the torch of the bizzare character to his brother   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0F2Gu3GGqw   Less family friendly but not as hardcore as ECW or even during Attitude Era.  To be honest with all the incidents and death in wrestling after the Monday Night Wars have ended, they (the wrestling industry as a whole) realised that they need to tone down most stuffs for the benefit of the wrestlers themselves   time and money constraint I would think. they took an existing nose and front wing assembly and modified it   It's a Malaysian plane bound to Malaysia with a whole lot of Malaysian families. It was like when JBL did the Nazi salute in Germany.   Yes, we know you are a heel, but there are something you can't do.          God. I am sorry. I meant old in the context of this game vs the latest (well on the PC for me) 2K15.     	139
 Ha! That is amazing! You got his expression perfectly, thank you so much!   Aw, thanks **blush**   Any help would be appreciated... Or suggestions on a sub/website where I can post this and get the answers I'm looking for?      [I tried](http://i.imgur.com/qneWxcj.jpg) :(    I didn't hate this.   Oh did you need dis? But **I** need dis!      **TIL** [Pablo Escobar looks like Jason Siegel with a mustache...](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/3998210560/h581EB678/)   Thank you! This is actually very helpful.   Like, when something he says or does causes me to get anxious and I ask him to watch his tone of voice because it's stressing me out, he'll change his inflection to sound pleading/frustrated about what he did wrong, as well as gesticulate with his hands and it stresses me out more and just causes me to shut down more and idk how to explain to him that it's not unheard of for people who've suffered abuse to be hyper vigilant to body language... Does that make sense?   No need to apologize. Thank you for the suggestion :)   PLEASE do the world a favor and report this to the police, OP.   I can really relate to this, too.   Yep. This is about where I am. Depression turned to apathy/laziness, then I had an accident at work and hit my head on the stairs and now I'm just angry and want to die   [Bubbles?](http://i.imgur.com/fuOJKlo.gif)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJLJf9b8XI   Well, I don't bartend... I am just a cocktail waitress. I really like it though! I get to talk to cool and interesting people, I get to have fun with my coworkers and I get to be myself!   It's weird, but after years of interacting with people, you just kind of *can* by hearing what someone says and by their body language just kind of knowing what it is they want.. Mind you, I work at a bar so I have gotten really good at remembering orders based on the "type" of person and repeating their order back to them. Usually I can remember orders for up to ten people and even remember what they got long after.... Now, names on the other hand are a completely different issue...   Damn good taste, dude!!! I usually drown my sorrows at a bar so I'm not "alone" but that's a great lineup you have so... Kudos? Sorry you're going through that, though :-/   Laughter is the best way to **really** piss someone off quickly...   Nice try, theflylife13099....   Myself   That sounds like a fun one. Any particular medium? Also, that artist's work is really cool but I think his coloring takes away from the beauty of it.    http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com    References can be seen on my tumblr. I can do digital or traditional media. Sorry if this breaks any rules, I just figured it's worth a shot.   I want to be in the middle of *that*!   Thank you!   Duly noted. Thank you :)   I would think it'd be a congregation of dentists...   That's relieving but I'm still pretty concerned it could become complicated. The hole is deeper than the photo suggests. It's about the size of my pinky fingernail... What type of tissue defect could it possibly be? It also looks like there is bone exposed; there is whiteness inside the hole and this hole definitely wasn't there before :x   This is the only place where it's possible to have a plane fly over a car driving over a train riding over a boat all at the same time!   Sorry, I guess I misunderstood... Since the images were hosted on the artist's own site with no ads, wouldn't that qualify?      Oh gosh. I'm guessing you're either a firefighter or an EMT?    Yikes, what a jarring scene that must've been!   I was living with my aunt, uncle and their two kids (8   10) when I was 14. I was recently put into the state's custody because my mom was an abusive alcoholic. My uncle and his family were kind enough to take me in. I was there for four months when in June, the day before my last day of freshman year in high school he just... suddenly froze up in his chair and reached for my aunt (she and I were standing right there talking to him as he was complaining about "heartburn"). It was terrifying; my aunt yelled for me to call 911 but I couldn't move.... That's when his sons came downstairs and made the situation even tougher- they kept asking their dad to wake up. I ended up having to take them to a neighbor's house when the EMT's arrived. I found out later that night that he was pronounced dead on the scene. The wake was very strange to experience.   No matter how old they are, it's always sad. I think I was more torn up having my nana die than I was when I saw my uncle suddenly drop dead of a heart attack at 51... I was 14.   I kind of became numb to it, too... I know that feeling :-/   It's still very sad!   Yeah, especially when it's unexpected. Eery...   What the fuck?   Witnessing someone die in front of you...   Sorry to hear that happened to you. The foster care system in the states is abysmal. Sadly, I understand why, though... Over worked, underpaid social workers and thankless families giving them hell. Plenty of my foster parents only took me in for the money. Glad to hear you got your life in order, though! I can say I definitely learned fast how to advocate for myself and it's worked well for me still. Take shit from no one!   Damn great job ya did there!!!   3.141592653589793 .... That's about all I can do since it was what was on my graphic calculator in high school.    I work at a bar and my managers get annoyed because I never carry an apron or a pad of paper. I can remember up to 10 orders without needing to bother writing them down. It impresses the guest and it saves me time.   Jackson   Fucking grackles... Clever little assholes.   Wow, you have such an amazing body! I'm envious! :)   Thank you! :)   We usually try to keep all our kitchen gadgets unplugged when they're not in use   zero, I suppose. I didn't even use a flame, I just kept a steady flow of hot running water on it. Though, you can totally use a crockpot on low for simmering bones, too!   Never ever thinkin' there was trouble in the water they were drinkin', they just guzzled it down   I had to work the rest of my shift so I left it simmering in hot water for a few hours (not boiling though!). I put it in a to-go box and carried it home in my bag and immediately left it outside to dry and let bugs pick off any extra flesh. I work as a cocktail waitress so I kind of just dicked around on my shift since it was slow anyway.   Oh! I work at a restaurant in the boston area. They had a whole pig roast and I had to work the day of my birthday so I asked them to let me have the skull. I cleaned it out during my shift and brought it home with me.   Thank you! :)   [After cleaning it out, it sat in the sun for a week.](http://i.imgur.com/9btHYMX.jpg) It's now in a peroxide bath for sanitizing and whitening.   	56
 /r/SexyAbortions   I don't know man. Do you like them? That's really all that matters.   Wear what you think looks good dude.  Something I suggest is to buy a shoe, and let it sit in the open. Look at it for a while. Try it on, walk around the house with it, etc.  If you start to like it, then keep 'em. Money well spent. If *not*, then return them. It's that simple.   I've been looking in to these recently. How do they fit?   What pairs do you have?   oooohhh, the way you worded it made it seem like "My Yeezys, or my Bred AF1s."  Like you were talking about Yeezys.   Around once a week   Is it just me or is there a lot more movement?   Need.   What colourway?   What do these look like?   Like the silhouette in general or a specific colourway?   I need to get a pair of these still   That honestly isn't a bad colourway.       Yep, it does happen to be on there  [John Oliver carrying out promises he made] (http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/390d0l/john_oliver_carrying_out_promises_he_made/)   Where'd the creases go?   I've been a bit iffy on these. How do they fit/feel?      I feel like you could turn this into a really dope picture   I mean you could go both ways. The gray would match a monochrome outfit. Gray/white shirt, black denim. But so could the blue as a "pop" piece.  That being said, I suggest the grey pair as you can match it with more, but buy/wear what you like.   For example, one of mine is the LeBron 9 "Hornets". Most people look at me weird when I say that, but it's because it was the shoe that kind of introduced me into all of this *and* the first shoe I bought with my own, hard-earned money.  What are some of your guys'?   You could buy a Size 9 in the shoe and maybe add an insole or two in the left shoe to make it fit a bit smaller? Idk, might work, might not.   You can try dipping them in melted wax and then a clear sealant. I mean I have no *real* idea if it will work, it's just a suggestion.  	24
 The Macbook Pro is really a great option, and you can use parrallels Desktop to run Windows simultaneously. That said, depending on your budget - try looking at some ASUS systems like the [G501](https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G501JW/). They are equally good as the MBP.   Doesn't work when compiled with pdfLatex   Another point is top 10 is a bit fuzzy. For example - in materials science there are multiple subfields like ceramics, polymers etc. Some school may often be better in a subfield than a much higher ranked school.  But yes, overall rank matters slightly - and the reasons have to do with funding. As someone who has spent their grad career in both a top 10 and a 50th ranked school the difference in financial situations is striking - and that matters a lot, especially if you are an experimentalist.   I am a huge Garamond fanatic - and consider the EB Garamond much better than the standard URW Garamond. I have been considering switching over to EB Garamond - not in XeLaTex -- but in pdfLaTex. Has anyone here succesfully done that?   Smells fake. Especially, the following phrases jump out:  *lived in the woods* and *started several of my own businesses*   Have you thought about teaching at 4 year colleges like Rose Hulman?   If you are a condensed matter physicist, it is easier to enter academia in materials science - rather than physics. Just my 2 cents.  There are also better materials science schools in your vicinity than physics schools ([applying the 12 hour driving limit](http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-can-i-travel.htm?address=kansas%20city,%20ks speed=60 time=12 accuracy=5 u=miles hw=false m=false mode=DRIVING)) - except for CU Boulder.   The best physics programs are almost always on the coast (Princeton, Berkeley, Harvard, MIT or Stanford or Cornell). And getting a tenure track position without a top 10 physics degree is fast becoming impossible (MatSE is almost no better in this regard).  But the midwest has several excellent schools - in Illinois (Northwestern, UIUC), Ohio (OSU), Iowa (Iowa State - Ames Lab).   Of course, if your area of interest is something else then none of the above apply.   Background please? Like - why was the injection *malicious*?   The whole world wants to sell me something. I, for example remember when Quora was decent (it was not great). Then came the SJWs, and then came the Indians.  IRC truly is eternal   The most important question here - Kate Moss flies Easyjet?   I collaborate a lot. I go by a rule, which has made me considerably happier now. I go by perfection on my own primary author work, and go by "good enough" on my secondary author work.   Crying is bad for you professionally - but the flip side is that academia often has piss poor HR - leading often to those situations arising in the first place.   Everybody wants you to do everything in grad school. Which is why you must prioritize. Do only that work that would lead to a publication - nothing else.  Things can wait - no one will die because of that.   Well it's true. Idiocy should be called out for what it is - rather than hiding behind a veil of political correctness.   The vast majority still use MATLAB. But because of rising costs - groups are switching to Python along with numPy and sciPy. Try getting the Anaconda distribution - it has all the tools you will ever need and is completely free.  I still have high hopes from Julia, but the noises coming from that sector are not always very encouraging.  	15
 Was the peanut butter one just people mixing up jif and skippy in their heads?  Nah, probably just a higher dimensional peanut butter.   You make a good point about evaluations, I feel that people miss a golden opportunity to improve every time they are given a bad evaluation. Does your club use general feedback slips for each speaker?   That's an interesting concept and would definitely help you learn how to give a perfect speech. But personally I'm not sure if that prepares people for the real world where they will likely just give their speech once. There's also a risk of over-preparing a speech and making it sound less natural. I'd perhaps suggest repeated a speech once but no more. Maybe even giving it again in the same meeting after some feedback.   Ah that's something used at our club as well! It's nice to get a variety of feedback, especially on the occasions when you have an evaluator who's scared to give constructive criticism.   If you feel ready for it, volunteer as Toastmaster. We had a new toastmaster at my meeting the other week and he added in a couple of new elements which helped keep things fresh and interesting.   **Mastery** Waste 10,000 hours instead of mastering a new skill   I'd be interested to hear your views on this question as I think that whilst toastmasters has been incredibly valuable to me, there are a couple of areas in which it is lacking. I won't suggest anything yet though, I'd love to hear your unbiased answers!   If I remember correctly, is this the crash that circulated really quickly online and brought twitter into the limelight?   Hi Jstbcool  First of all, thanks for your incredibly well structured and thought out response. It's rare to see that on the internet!  I'm surprised I missed the effect sizes and it's definitely something that we need to be aware of, you make a very good point. In fact one of the things that stood out for me in this paper is the fact that they computed their required sample size a-priori in terms of power. It's refreshing to see people embracing the "new statistics".  I didn't mean to suggest that the participants played 8 hours of luminosity straight. However, having participated in a lot of Psychology experiments myself I felt I could speculate pretty accurately as to which of the two trials would be more tiring. Portal 2 is likely to be much more engaging and most importantly, fun. I think this would affect participants attitudes towards the testing as a whole, particularly with regards to motivation. Motivation is something we take for granted in Psychology a lot and I would hazard a guess that it will have had an effect even in the testing phase.  My third point stems from the reading I've done into the effects of nutrition on cognition. Nutrition is a pretty fascinating subject because there are huge pitfalls in a lot of the research and these are often worsened once cognitive testing is brought into the mix. It's not uncommon in this field of research for a cognitive benefit to be apparent on the day of testing, but to have disappeared once tested again a few weeks later. But, in defence of this study, it is a good starting point for further research to explore longer term effects.   If this study can be replicated, it'd be interesting in the future to work out exactly what aspects of Portal 2 are causing the cognitive benefit. It's extremely difficult to break down the components of such a complicated game, especially as it wasn't designed to be a brain training device. I get the impression that dedicated brain-training games are simple because developers attempt to make them evidence-based. By jumping in with Portal 2 we've almost worked in the opposite direction; we have a game that may cause a cognitive benefit, but we have no idea what the mechanics are which make this happen.   There seem to be a ton of problems with this article and I highly doubt that there's really been any effect at all.  To name a few:  - When carrying out this many statistical tests you are almost guaranteed to get a couple of Type 1 errors (finding an effect when there isn't one). P values in this study were only reported to the extent of p  0.05 which gives no indication of what the actual p value is. With the 11 tests that they're carrying out in this study we'd want to carry out a Bonferonni correction and divide the significance level by 11 (0.05/11= 0.0045).   - 8 hours of lumosity is going to cause a lot more cognitive tiring than 8 hours of portal. Lumosity is just not engaging enough to play for this amount of time. I highly doubt the participants were motivated to actually do the cognitive tests after all of the practice.   - There is no follow up on these tests so we can't tell whether any effects (if they really exist) are apparent for a matter of hours or if they last for weeks. I'd wager that if you tested them again a week later you'd get null results.     When they lost Modern Family it appeared on Now TV a day later. Maybe somebody just paid a higher price.   Sometimes it's awesome because if I stay calm I can generally transition from sleep paralysis into a lucid dream.  Sometimes it's just the most terrifying feeling, you can put all your effort into moving and nothing gives. You start to worry it'll never end. Luckily I've realised that sleep paralysis doesn't extend to my tongue, so if I freak out I start moving my tongue a lot and movement seems to slowly return to the rest of my body. Man, I'm weird.   As a 23 year old who has just had a cancer scare, this hits home pretty hard. Thank you for sharing this and I'm glad you've found meaning in your life, this message is something I'll be sure to look back on in times of need.   Is a black hole as big as it "looks"? From my limited understanding a black hole has such a high mass that light cannot escape. Is the material all condensed in the middle with a larger surrounding area that light cannot escape? Or is the visible size of the black hole also the size of all the mass it contains? Is it even possible for us to know this?   I agree, the thing that worked for me was to not allow myself any snooze time so that I just get up.   I can't give any better advice than everyone else has already, but you may find this article interesting.  http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death  	16
