 Yeah, the neighborhood chick that Buck diddles with the pool cue.    I never worked in a video store, but when I was a kid, I was obsessed with Heather Graham. I used to banter with the guys who worked there who told me she was in the movie "The Great Outdoors." I knew he was wrong, so I bet him she wasn't in it. I'd give him five bucks if she was or get the movie "Pay Back" starring Mel Gibson on VHS for free if she wasn't. I got to take "Pay Back" home with me that day. That's the extent of my Blockbuster stories.    Tell some stories about your days! Things that got on your nerves, interesting movie requests, celebrity sightings (and what they rented obviously) and so on!    I know I can't prove this, but I use this quote at least once a week.    ROBOT, RIP HIS ARMS AND LEGS OFF! *you can basically quote this entire movie in yells and capital letters and nobody will hassle you for it*   YOU BETRAYED THE LAW   Shut your bucket.    He looks like T-Bag from Prison Break.    You should ask if you can swap your 15 minute break for a free pass to slap a customer instead.    At least you're raising your children right! Never give up, never surrender!    I think Scary Movie fails because its Scary Movie haha Off topic here, but I think they got better when the Wayan's brothers weren't involved.    Don't open that! Is there air? You don't know!   I agree, its satirical without being slapstick. Not an easy venture as so many movies (like you mentioned Scary Movie series) go for the cheap laughs.    I seriously love this movie to death, but I always considered it just a guilty pleasure- the assumption being no one else really likes it too much. Turns out everyone I know loves this movie too. What does Reddit think?   Listen, I hate to defend Adam Sandler, but shut up.    Is that what you call complaining about "gay jokes?" lol    No. You're just a liberal baby. Your post screams "I'm uncomfortable by gay jokes."    Get over yourself and your idiotic desire to make all things PC. So tired of you liberal babies bitching over what hurts your sensitive feelings.    I said you're a cry baby   One of the dumbest assessments I have ever seen. Cry baby.      Django is American too....   Ah see, Paint it Black always makes me think of Full Metal Jacket. But then so does Surfin Bird. I was gonna say Wooly Bully too, but that song actually makes me think of Happy Gilmore.    Yeah, and wow that was such a perfect song for that scene. You just can't hear it nowadays without getting psyched up.    What're your classic 'you hear a song, you think of the movie' songs? I can't hear Somebody to Love and not immediately think of the Cable Guy.    You smoke weed? That's awesome!!!!!   It is all about that East Valley :) Gilbert for the win!   Doesn't sound too bad. I'll try to stay awake.    Armageddon is hated by most because of the scientific inaccuracies. I'll take the experts' word for it, but it doesn't change the fact that it has great lines, great characters and a fun plot. It is not my favorite movie, but if you start complaining about the accuracy of this movie's elements, then you might as well discredit every movie because I'm sure you can find a bullshit in every single one.    	29

 I'm getting him a baby sock for Christmas!      If you have a Twitter, follow Orlando Informer or just check the page. It was a Godsend for helping plan everything. Try to go as early as you can if you plan on riding Escape from Gringotts, don't know how busy it still is, but less than half an hour after early entry, there was a 5 hour wait not counting general admission times. The train is a must! Make sure to ride to Hogsmeade and back to Diagon Alley. It's a different ride. If I were you, I would go straight to the Studios side, before it gets too crowded. The butter beer ice cream was amazing, and chocolate has a kick at the end. The mixing station doesn't taste too well. Just flavored water. You must watch the Deathly Hallows show in Diagon Alley! Also, get an interactive wand and look out for places to use it. The chicken sandwich, Guinness stew, and cottage pie is delicious in The Leaky Caldron. The Three Broomsticks have wonderful chicken. Sorry it's so long! Have fun!   http://www.orlandoinformer.com/2012/harry-potter-butterbeer-recipe/  There's a lot of recipes on here, but my boyfriend and I love the first one! Apparently it's good if you add butterscotch schnapps if you're 21!   Well, thank you for that. Exactly you're question is based on what we don't know.   I had always assumed the egg still had the spell that made it impossible to obtain through the accio spell, so he knew he couldn't use the spell.   Hagrid never graduated. Maybe I should have said graduate. My apologies. As for the other part, I've never read or heard anything like that.   I think that Hermione would lead the way for more freedom for house elves who wanted to be free, but less cruelty for the ones who still work. I don't think Harry would live in a mansion. I think he's much too modest for that. As weird as it may seem, I think Neville might be headmaster. He's fair and brave, with Harry's influence it might be possible. I believe Luna would go on to be editor of the popular newspaper The Quibbler because of the fall of the Dark Lord, no one trusted The Daily Prophet anymore, and Luna lead the way to discover the creatures she always claimed existed. I like to think Hagrid ended up married the the Ms. Maxime and having children, who were the first humanoids allowed in Hogwarts.      I didn't even think this would ever be a question?!   I don't know how accurate it is, but while riding the Hogwarts Express. You can hear Ron ask Hermione to conjure food, and she says it's against the law of Transfiguration. That could be the only thing I could think would explain it.  	11

I'm 19, and I still live with my family, albeit I did dorm for 2 quarters. If you like it, you'll get it. Is my motto. Depends on your interpersonal likes. For me, I tried waiting for the Note 5- I had a Note 2, but it broke- I bought a temp. phone (lumia630) fucking phone sucked! I missed my note 2, so I bought a Note 4, new for $520. Regrets. My life is more better with this companion, as I use it EVERY HOUR. ( except sleep) Cheers!    Oh, sorry I forgot to mention it's only 90% calibrated. I have the same problem about the 5%, but it's no big deal. I just charge it for a 30 minutes, and it'll be at 50% for a few hours. Easy fix.    I didn't really scrutinize the battery to accurately say, but from conjecture. I did this. Did not charge the battery full when it first arrived- I didn't have time. The future is now- battery was 50% right off the bat. Then I let it drain from that day on, by itself. Once it drained I let it charge over night to 100% (while off) then I turned it on, following that I did the same thing again. By the 4-6th day the battery was give or take calibrated. Although, it's not 100%, more like 90%. My phone stays on 1% for about 2-4 hours, which sucks because the screen turns lowest brightness and I can't use the camera, damn you Sansumg for being so conservative...    Twice. Don't stress about it too much though. A watched boiling bot never boils ;p    Drain that baby down to 0% Let it turn off, by itself. then charge it until it says, "100%". Did that with my 10,000mah one.   There is a product that will make your life more blissful. [Zero Lemon Case](http://www.amazon.com/Warranty-Zerolemon-10000mah-Extended-Protection/dp/B00Q7C6FTA) Will make your life ridiculously easy. I charge my phone every 2 days. I use it heavily, as I am always on Pandora or just using it for school/work. Buy this and you'll never scream at your mom again.    Depends what you like. If you suffer like me financially I'd go with the Note 4. Make scarifies in life for the things in it. E.x I don't eat at all outside, and mostly hang out with friends doing free shit, allowing me to Study Abroad in Japan for a few weeks. On the phones, usually the newer one is nicer, and better.    Is there any news on the release date?    I never buy phones from people. They could have fixed the phone with the shittest replacement parts. Looks new, but everything has been replaced with the lowest quality aspects, but this is a highly pesstemistic view. Cheers!   1) is definitely a nice one. But these are mostly written for stupid people, ergo, "self-help" As they cannot help themselves. But in an other life, You should take time to read A Prayer For Owen Meany, that book will Fuck You Up. Cheers! .   If your life sucks like mine and bought an ATnT phone, just instal icon apps on your phone, so it will look idiocentric. I just added a red sticker to the back, so if my phone is in the dark, I always put is face flat on the floor, so I see a big Ole Dot. Cheers!

 [Citation Needed]   Quick question: what's a "personal day"?  (From the UK - they do things different over here!)   I love OK Go's songs....  ...but Of The Blue Colour Of The Sky has to be one of the most badly produced albums I've ever listened to. I'm no audiophile, but I actually contacted Amazon because I thought their rip was faulty! I also downloaded a torrent (bad too) and in the end, bought the CD thinking that it can't possibly sound so bad. I was wrong - it does, and I can't listen to it now.  Yes, I'm sure there are artistic reasons for it, but to my ears, it just sounded bloody awful.  Sorry guys. Love the songs, love the videos, but get someone else to produce your albums :-/   As Amazon forked Android, and introduced a competing app store, they have waived all rights to use Google's own marketplace.  You make your bed, you lies in it....   Not the smallest regret, not even for a minute. And I suspect others would agree here.   Your call and glad it suits, but please tell me your decision wasn't based on tripe like this!   No, not remotely like this.  My kids (7 and 5) wake at around 7am and play by themselves quite happily or come into see us. We're usually all up having breakfast by 8am (sleeping my life away doesn't suit me) and the day goes from there.  What do I do if the kids are away? The same. With possibly more sex ;-)   Remember, a good landing is one that you walk away from. An excellent landing is one where you can reuse the aircraft....   Life finds a way.   With a swipe card, steal it, learn to copy signature, use it. In fact, no one I saw in the US even checked the signature anyway, so you probably don't need to bother learning it.  Steal a CnP card and you can do virtually nothing with it apart from NFC payments (low value) or online transactions (and most banks require separate passwords for these now anyway).  I haven't swiped or signed for years now.   And they /chose/ to do this!?  Our wedding had the people we wanted at it. About 70ish with a mix of friends and family and I guarantee you that not a single person was there because we "had to invite them". Plenty of family were missing because, well frankly, we didn't want them there.  Our day, our money, our choice :-)   My kids' school (UK) doesn't allow fizzy drinks, or sweets in pack lunches. Likewise they don't sell them on site. More or less unlimited fruit though.... :-)  Start kids eating well when they're young and you'll set them up for life. Stuff em with Coke all day and they'll sit on their backside and watch TV instead.  (My kids do get sweets as treats BTW. I'm not running a monetary here... No fizzy drinks though. None of us drink them so they're rarely in the house. The kids would probably prefer something else anyway.)   I didn't. Thanks OP.   I agree. I too have not found his writing particularly offensive.  As for calling for a ban on linking it here...please let us make up our own mind rather than enforce censorship. Reddit is (or should be) a democratic community. If the article is tripe, the community will downvote it into oblivion. And if it gets up voted, then the community disagrees with you.   Don't play god. Let us decide what is good or bad.   Errr, chill dude. This sort of stuff happens in sport.   Vettel has talked about Ferrari ambitions in the past, so this is hardly surprising.  What would be surprising was if it was Fred vs Seb next year. Now /that/ would be cool....   I'd love to see anyone offered a P1 and then turn it down in favour of the 458.   Sure, the 458 is a fine car, but the P1 is on a different planet!   Some twat in a Merc did this to me yesterday. Bastard!  Plot twist: I was in a BMW. Surely it should be me doing this sort of thing...   They are offensive, antisocial, class-divisive and the after-smell created by them is offensive to all in a public place.  At least the tobacco was OK.   The term "Bobby" originates from the early days of the police, created by then Home Secretary, Robert Peel. Originally known colloquially as "Peelers", the term "Bobby" (a short form of "Robert") is the last reminder of the origin of the British Police.   "A DUCK!" (*gasps*)  "Who are you that is so wise in the ways of science?"  (Watched many, many times including once in German, unsubtitled. Couldn't understand a word and it lost nothing in humour :-)   Where's his exercise bike? You know...the one he pedals to charge his car up.  Because if he's doing anything else then it's NOT FUCKING ZERO EMISSIONS!  Aaaaand relax :-)   Start any conversation with a stranger by apologising:  "Sorry to bother you, but..." "Excuse me, can I.." "Pardon me, but..." "I'm very sorry to disturb you, but...."     I love that he wasn't going to bother taking the black, but when he did, potted it like he was on a pub pool table.  For raw talent, the best there has ever been by a country mile.   You need to paint a clear picture here if you want others to understand   Once, perhaps. But not these days. First class rarely means next day now.  That said, for valuable goods, its hard to beat Special Delivery which really will deliver next day. Its a lot more cash though...   *sniffle*   And presumably you have no frame of reference....   All fair comments, and obviously I'm a driver myself too, but really and honestly, I neither care if a driver is being wound up or not. If I don't think its safe for him to overtake, I'll make sure he won't. My life  his temper, every single time.  As a balancing comment, I've often wondered that if you stacked up arsehole drivers against arsehole motorists, who would win :-)   You walk everywhere and are therefore largely unimpeded by the road closures? Surely this makes you better of than most...  Why would you sigh? I'd have thought you'd be happy that such a great event was coming to your town!   The two abreast thing is interesting. I have my own take on this as a cyclist:  1) If I'm riding with a friend, we ride side by side 2) If a car comes up behind, we'll move over 3) If I'm riding on my own in a place where I deem it to be unsafe to be overtaken, I'll ride in the middle of the road and the car must wait until I say he can overtake. I then move in. I don't allow myself to be squeezed into the verge, and make myself as wide as I need to to prevent it.  And you know, I've had very few problems with (3). Most drivers are content to be told when it's safe to pass and I've possibly saved myself being shoved into the dirt any number of times due to "optimistic overtaking".  As evidence, I present....me! Not dead, too :-)   I think millions is probably more in the right area today....   Amazon UK can deliver to a local pickup point (typically a fuel station or convenience store) and you can then pickup your item using ID and a confirmation code at your convenience.  Its called CollectPlus and is a marvellous system for avoiding the wait in all day blues.  FWIW, I only use it for Saturday deliveries - most stuff just goes to my office during the week.   I'm still astonished that anyone in the USA has patience enough to sit through the ads!  On the subject of cost, most people in the US have cable / satellite? The number is rising in the UK, but many people (strangely, more so in affluent areas) choose to only get free to air TV and for 150 vs twice that for a basic satellite service, its pretty good value.   I'd be interested to see how much people pay in the US for a comparable service. I'd be willing to bet that 150 wouldn't go that far....  	33
 Thats a pretty cool chart by FO.     The big cost there is joining the military.   Are you sure? Didnt Gates play with a torn one a few years back?   I'm not too worried about the foot.  Yes it will always be in the back of my mind, but is there really a better replacement for him?  Maybe Gronk, but he is also an injury risk every time he gets onto the field.  Graham will have his snap counts limited as this is an injury that needs to be managed but it's not like he didn't perform the other weeks he was limited.  In regard to last week specifically, it looks like his limited snap count, especially in the red zone, was based on the Saints game plan not his injury.  Here is a full article on the subject matter:  http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/100078/saints-graham-adjusting-to-limited-role   Graham with one foot is still better than every TE in the league.     Yea it is a 16 team league and was planning on picking Fitzpatrick and McCown to play the matchups till Rodgers came back.   I do think that's a trade you should make.  The drop off between Smith and Allen isn't as great as the increase going from Johnson to Charles. And carolina is still a very good defense so losing KC isnt that big of a deal.   I'm 8-2 and trying to set my team roster up for the playoffs (weeks 15-17).  I was wondering if I should give the Rodgers owner Luck for Rodgers and tannehill.  I really have no idea how to evaluate Rodgers for ROS value considering the timetable for his return is so muddled.   Vereen.  Johnson is nothing more than a Tate handcuff.   I understand that we shouldn't get hyped up about Johnson, he probably will get the same amount of work that Tate had with Foster in the lineup.  But Tate is injury prone, so Johnson does have value.   That's fair.    I think you may be over reacting to the Rodgers injury.  We have seen good RBs do well with bad QBs, ie Stacy, AD, Charles, etc.  Obviously it would be better to have Rodgers at QB but I trust McCarthy to come up with a good offensive game plan.  He is a good coach, he had Favre and Flynn (albeit in a small sample size) look good in his system.  Lacy's schedule is just as easy Morris'. While the redskins o-line is probably better, the packer's o-line has been pretty solid at run blocking.    With all that being said, I view both Morris and Lacy pretty similarly.  They are probably anywhere in the 8-12 range in RB rankings.       You dont need Spiller to get 20 carries a game to be great.  He's efficient when he gets the ball.  And I'd rather have him not get the ball that many times since he has had injury issues throughout his college and nfl career. Also the Bills run alot of plays due to their up tempo run oriented offense, so a split with Jackson isn't anything to worry about.  Even with jackson, Spiller was getting more than 18 touches a game when he was healthy the first 4 games.     1 qb, 2 rb, 2 wr, 1 te, 1 te/wr/rb, 1 dst, 1 k  	15
 I also always liked the [imagery](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mushishi/comments/27977b/mushishi_episode_6_cinematography/) in Mushishi.   This felt like a mix between Harmonie and Chihayafuru.   That's most likely right. Ship sunk.   Aww, Daichi's lady friend has his jersey number as a key-chain.   I guess it could be argued that Machida should've turned it up earlier but I think the reason he was able to gain momentum was because Weidman started to fade in the 4th and couldn't apply the same amount of pressure.   That was endearing. I like how Naru's behavior put to light Handa's flaws to himself -- too prideful to apologize and too enclosed in his comfort zone.  Hopefully this turns out well since I've been itching for a SOL about an adult and they're rare to come by.   I'm pretty hyped about the super-duper awesome genius prodigies matching up against each other.   In this episode: exposition  Is this suppose to be a bad thing? Or do we really want things happening without a proper set-up and build-up a la Captain Earth.  I think the exposition was delivered well either through the flow of character interactions or background dialogue (radio).   Prior to the Royals there were the 2006 Diamondbacks with Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Young. Quentin and Gonzalez were used to get Haren. Their pitching prospects aren't worth mentioning hence the Haren trade.  2007 and 2011 were the only good years they had. D-backs and Royals show how fickle talent development could be. Even the Rays took years to figure it out.      It's freakin excellent. My AOTY last year and will go down as one of my all time favorites. I'm glad that this will give it a bit more exposure.   Crunchyroll webplayer definitely needs some work.  The PS3 app was absolutely horrendous a few months ago but after an update it has been fine.   Looks fine to me too. Better animation, better camera work, better effects.   Hiromasa Yonebayashi (Arrietty)   Man, this has been getting said for the last three years and the team hasn't gotten anywhere.

[My favorite track.](http://youtu.be/1QR6LJuv6sc)  Also an underrated anime. The 1st season took a while to find its stride but the 2nd season was great and more than makes up for it. It had some of the most emotionally charged fight scenes I've seen. Also well choreographed and animated.    They made four seasons of Natsume Book of Friends.   To me episode 18 was the turning point of the show. It turned from a funny show to a "I laughed so hard that my sides hurt" type of show.   I thought this might be Mushishi's version of a nature documentary but instead it's just Ginko getting swindled lol. I loved the folklore vibe of the whole episode.  Also Ginko walking around in circles reminded of episode 14, when he got lost in the bamboo forest. That episode was really sad.

[Episode 8](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/06/mushishi-zoku-shou-episode-8.html)  [Episode 9](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/06/mushishi-zoku-shou-episode-9.html)     I feel there's been too many practice episodes. Some good, some just okay but it does get a bit monotonous. I think a change of scenery and activity while maintaining the volleyball-centric story would be a good palette cleanser.   Near the end of the last episode there was a short scene of Kaori sitting in the dark and her diary on her desk without anything new written on it. I thought that was ominous but it seems despite her set-back and all the negative memories coming back, Kaori is still bravely pushing forward. But now Hase...we need intervention!    Hase's just overthinking it as per usual  I think that's quite the opposite. He usually follow his emotions impulsively (with both negative and positive results). Right now he's feeling scared, so his instinctive response is to avoid the situation. If he actually thought things through he would've arrived to a logical conclusion that it's best for Kaori's recovery for them to stay "special" friends.    Rory seems like a nice guy and all but Rogan's constant verbal fellatio of him is really irritating and makes me want to see him get knocked out by Hendricks.   [Anime VS Real Life](http://m.imgur.com/a/AfIsv)  If you're an anime fan interested in cinematography: [link](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com)   I think I will upvote anything Gintama related.   So Sidonia did not encounter a Gauna for a hundred years. Then Nagate surfaces and almost right away a Gauna shows up.  The Captain predicted that the Council would want Nagate dead so she purposely navigated Sidonia into Gauna territory so she can sortie him and somewhat appease the Council. Although not ideal, this situation fits her strategy of defeating the Gauna instead of running away, with Nagate as her ace just like the way she pictured Hiroki should have been. This is also why she doesn't give a shit about the Kabi's attracting Gaunas.  Also I'm speculating Ochiai threw away the Kabis in order to force the Council to use his Gauna-Human hybrid as a weapon since it can kill Gaunas without a Kabi.   I'm more curious if the anime would boost the manga sales. It's a bit concerning that the older volumes didn't make the top 50 in the last few weeks of rankings. Unless they're not available.

I don't care how mentally tough you are, you're not gonna will your body to move when cramps have immobilized it.      This episode has a such a gloomy feel to it. The same sort of melancholic feeling I get when I watch 5 cm per second.  Hase gets clean up duty. His crepe date then goes to hell. He loses special friends status. Fujimiya seems to have stopped writing in her diary. The street light then forebodingly flickers off on Hase. All of these happened in a span of one day.  Being Hase truly is suffering.   Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor. The second season exists, just accept it!      The way Shaft used the song was underwhelming.  The story about Ayano and the orphans, the story of the Monster, the Snake's schemes and how Kano fits in all of this were awkwardly put together. There was no flow whatsoever.  I was hoping for a jigsaw puzzle story that would cleverly put the pieces together but with only three episodes left I would not get my hopes up that the show can pull that off.     The Captain's super secret facility needs to be more secretive.  I really like the sequence where as Tanikaze becomes a bigger hero so does his obsession with Guana Hoshijiro. The sliding glass barriers was a nice touch. This is a really well directed show. Hopefully, Kobun Shizuno gets more quality material to work with in the future.    Nice character development. Been waiting for something like this, hopefully the show would build on it. The show is fun but a little bit of depth doesn't hurt.  Short supply of magic fuel seems like a sign of rationing for war. That's a nice touch and adds to the world building.      Watch the remake, Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's amazing.   [Knights of Sidonia](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/knights-of-sidonia-episode-8.html).   First volume sold almost 6,000 in its first week. I was hoping for more but it actually still out-performed the [projected sales](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1 hl=en ie=UTF8 nv=1 rurl=www.google.com sl=ja tl=en u=http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/show.cgi%3Fn%3DB00J2GGZ5C usg=ALkJrhgoECCiZRNruKB_hdEHEg-cIKnjvQ) based on the Amazon Ranking Stalker. The projected sales for the later volumes are higher but I dunno how accurate that is.   I think all the action scenes which there are plenty of, and some of the more important non-action scenes are animated at full 24 fps or done "on ones." The rest of the non-action stuff I think are done on twos with maybe the exception of the earlier episodes which are noticeably choppier.   [I think this epitomizes Hase's feelings at the end of this episode.](http://gfycat.com/HighRashClingfish)   The show is really pushing it with the teasing and the bait   switch romance. It's giving me Touch flashbacks. I should be bothered by it but the show is so damn heartwarming that the gimmick just comes off as amusing.   It's just part of the process, a painful one.   http://www.hulu.com/kinos-journey  Unfortunately none for Mononoke (TV).   [It's Archer's Mr. Sparkle moment.](http://i.imgur.com/YpJaVxT.png)   [The Family Portrait.](http://i.imgur.com/q4KyelV.png)   It's tempting to listen to that song again but I'm gonna hold off so the next episode will have maximum effect.   Y'all should watch Kino's Journey and Mononoke (TV) if you haven't yet.   [Knights of Sidonia - Episode 8 Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/knights-of-sidonia-episode-8.html)      Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Super amazingly perfect and overpowered MC is weirdly amusing.   [Ping Pong The Animation Episode 8 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/ping-pong-animation-8.html)   AoT animation was even more inconsistent than KoS. The first half of that show was littered with stills and some of them out of context to the dialogue. There were even [unfinished](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/13547/659701-2hmdkci.jpg) portions and the studio [apologized](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-09/attack-on-titan-staff-apologizes-for-unfinished-episodes-on-3-stations) for some of them.  Also, in general, anime shows are animated in low framerates. We're talking about 8-12 fps or sometimes lower. KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG. Just imagine any Pixar movie rendered at 8 fps and it would look more noticeable than most animes.  KoS's frame rate has gotten better though and action always looked fluid.   Only ones I know that were clear about couples having sex:  **NANA.** Also much of the romance centers around adults who are already in a relationship. It's great and much different than most romance animes, I highly recommend it.  **Otona Joshi no Anime Time.** Four different stories about four different women. It deals with adults so the themes are mature; single working woman, unhappy marriages, and dysfunctional family.   **ef: a tale of memories.** Teen romance with the common anime trait of characters unable to commit. The characters are well written though.  There's also White Album 2 and Clannad.   "My only regret is that I have...LeBronitis"  -Lance Stephenson    Eh? I'm just making a general statement on the /a/ topic and not comparing the two communities.   ITT: couples who need to just fuck already  That's almost every anime with any sort of romance.      Emiru died because the admonition infection has spread. She was infected because of her deep feeling of despair and resentment.         I for one want Lance Stephenson to keep on talking. This is entertaining.   [Manga](/s "I didn't quite rage but it was definitely frustrating. I just hope there's a development in the characters that would justify hitting the reset button. I'm also wary of a possible love triangle involving Hajime. I wouldn't mind using him to push Hase in the right direction but I don't want a drama built around a love triangle")   Dammit Hase just admit to yourself that you like her. I guess Shogo is going to have to coax it out of him, like always.  This episode set things up so well, much better than the manga. [Manga Spoiler](/s "What happens next is really going to hurt. It would also really frustrate some people since with only four episodes left we most likely won't see a payoff that would justify such a huge setback")     Hinata's energy gets me hyped up. I really like how most of the characters play off of that energy or just with each other in general.  This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue.   Also the OST if amazing.  [This sequence at end was great](http://imgur.com/a/3JNtj).   Stephenson is averaging almost 44 min/game. The guy is being run ragged.   Tatsuya being ludicrously OP and amazing at everything is weirdly entertaining and amusing.   The nightmares that Shintaro seems to be having are the intros in Episode 1 and 5, the ones with him and Ayano talking.  Also we finally get a connection between the "Monster" and the rest of the cast. The teacher, who's also Ayano's father seems to be involved also. Maybe they're the family?  Eternity seems to be a theme here. The monster is immortal, Ene woke up in a body that's practically immortal, Haruka seems to have been granted an immortal body and Ayano seems to exists in a time and space where she's eternal.   I love the use of rain as an analogue for her tears. The parallel between the drifter mushi and Teru's life was also an elegant analogy. Mushishi really excels at these type of things.  There's some awkward editing in this episode though. The way the flashbacks were done was a bit jarring.      We finally get the overall picture of the show which is to rebuild in the Rem star system but the Captain thinks it's not that simple. Looks like the political/social turmoil will get fleshed out more with the departing ceremony.   Man, the cinematography and editing in this show is absolutely top notch. It even managed to make the death scene look beautiful.  [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/aoeFH)     In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.  What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco.   They're missing out. The attention to detail in terms of background art, hud displays, UI displays, the wear and tear on equipments and suits is superb. The cinematography, editing, music, sound effects, the action and just the overall direction has been excellent and not just for an anime but in general.   Eh. You're missing out, I love the murder mystery vibe of Mononoke.   This episode was hilarious. I totally did not expect this show to pull off something like this. I'm a bit lukewarm to Akira and Toru but some more comedy would really add some much needed charisma to these characters.         The animation in the last scene when Tina, Enju and Kisara were hugging was silky smooth. As opposed to the action scenes which were mainly made up of cut in-cut aways, quick match cuts and close ups in order to hide limited animation.  A cute scene featuring lolisaction scenes. This show knows its priorities.      Spoilers, obviously.  [1](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/13036/010.0/compressed/m021.jpg?v=11390333328) [2](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/13036/010.0/compressed/m022.jpg?v=11390333328) [3](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/13036/010.0/compressed/m023.jpg?v=11390333328)   Agreed on Heito and the mad scientist. The whole hysterically evil act is so tired. They really bring down the show, which is unfortunate since the rest of it have improved since episode two.  If you really like the aspect of a supernatural being born out of despair and tragedy then you should really watch the Mononoke tv series (unrelated to the Ghibli movie).   [Manga spoiler](/s "Five episodes should be more than enough to cover at least up to chapter 16. Although, I doubt five episodes is enough to resolve that arc. So Season 1 most likely won't have a closure but with good execution it could still feel satisfying albeit with some uncertainty.")  [](/s "I just really hope they don't go the route of using filler episodes and then use Chapter 14 as a cliff hanger ending. The would really suck.")  [](/s "As for the memory loss, yeah that hurt but it was more so frustrating. The relationship between the two was progressing so well despite Hase's wishy-washiness being slightly irritating, then all of sudden we're back to square one. At least Hase seems be showing good growth out of it, with the way he's handling things so far")    Aww! They didn't do Fujiyama's internal monologue during the study scene that was in the manga. I guess it makes sense in terms of pacing the characters, and also consistency since most of the anime is told in Hase's perspective. But still, I really liked that moment.   The chemistry between Hinata, Kageyama and Tanaka is great. Their interactions remind me of Ippo, Takmura, Aoki and Kimura.   The 256 Gardes dissolve formation sequence looked great. The memorial scene was well shot too.   [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/CSSGs)   I think the surprise more has to do with how it was executed. The flash forward was so unexpected that it might have caught people off guard which made the death reveal shocking despite the deathflags.   VP7JGTL6ZSU  7EZGXHSL7XT  8YHYL4UPVAF   Kawaii.   Both teams played hard.   The drama has somewhat been more nuanced in the last two episodes which is a big improvement but it also made the wacko character types like the Scientist and Heito stick out like a sore thumb. I wish those characters didn't exist, since they're off setting any consistency that could be established.         [Comparison Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZjbNhLODKU) [Spoilers]  [Mirror](https://mediacru.sh/PvAXTKyWald-)   Should've used an exclamation point to assert dominance.         The cinematography in this show is just ace.   [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/G2jR3)  My [favorite part](http://gfycat.com/VapidFlimsyBuck) and I also liked this [one](http://gfycat.com/ConsciousBronzeAustralianfurseal).  Also the music is great.     You should build him a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon to show your appreciation.         I clicked on the link expecting Kondo. Slightly disappointed that it wasn't him. Only slightly because boobs.   That was...that was actually kind of good. The episode did a good job of making the characters intriguing, I feel like this is how the show should've started instead of bombarding the audience with too many dramatics. I'm still not getting my hopes up but this will keep me watching.   The sweetness of this show is turning me into molasses.   That was a nice and laid back team building episode.  I also like that the show rarely resorts to character stills with just moving mouths during dialogues. There's always little body language animation the makes the characters feel alive.    I'm curious about how this show will tie everything together. This could end up a disjointed mess or a unique and cleverly told story. Either way this is a type of show that requires patience and the audience to let things unravel instead of expecting the storyline to be laid out in every episode.  Hopefully the saying "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts" rings true for this show.   Mahouka sure tries hard to make the anti-discrimination Course 2 students look like extremists. Fuck them not being happy with discrimination, amirite?  There's a difference between institutionalized discrimination and personal bigotry. They seemed to be fighting against the latter when the former is far more important. The former could be changed with progressive policies while the latter can't.  Obviously bigotry is not OK but like Mayumi said you can't change what an individual feels by force.       I guess those Gardes are worth more than civilian lives and structural damage. As cold as it sounds it kind of makes sense since they're the only line of defense and must be used as a last resort. Even just losing 1/8 of their Gardes would be a huge blow and that's with very little guarantee that the Guana won't get through. So if the option to evade is there then it's probably the best option most of the time.  Still pretty ballsy and quick risk assessment by the Captain.  I didn't expect to experience such an intense space battle so soon after Yamato 2199. What a great surprise.  Also gotta love the detail and design on those graphic displays, UI, and flight instruments. It's the little things that create the space sci-fi atmosphere.   The dark tone in this episode is so contrived; the blood licking, the random murderous character, and the mystery mecha inexplicably located in a hospital basement. Still, I'm morbidly curious about this show so I'll keep watching.   Don't worry they'll go back to not caring about basketball once they're eliminated.   Bullshit double tech. It's just the refs making up for the missed foul on Val.   Too many monologues and speeches crammed into one episode which undermined Sugawara's characterization. I feel like that was an excessive amount of set-up just to initiate the chemistry between Kageyama and Hinata.   At first I was worried about the jealousy angle but the episode fortunately didn't dwell on it and merely used it as a cause of conflict. And the dialogue was good enough that it came off as a natural reaction from a young man who's in love. Although, I still would've preferred if the show used something less cliche and convenient.  I also really liked how vague they are about the diary during the riverside conversation. It expresses how unsure they are on how to handle the situation but both know how important it is to them. I think that really made the resolution all the more gratifying.   The moment the fingers make contact with the eyes it should be called a poke, the ref shouldn't wait for the opponent to get hurt. I mean, they don't ignore a low blow shot even if it didn't affect the fighter, same logic should be applied here.   You forgot to add that they're a bunch of screwdrivers playing Monster Hunter. It always amazes how Sorachi comes up with these crazy ideas and make them work.   Even one cour shows need 2-3 episodes to set things up.   I'm finding this "plot development in 3 episodes or bust" mentality among some anime fans to be silly. It's an initial approach that promotes needless impatience and an entitlement for instant gratification.   And now we have a big breasted Christmas cake character. This show is just hitting all the otaku-bait staples.  I love the high-brow stuff like Mushishi and Ping Pong and the more subtle drama like One Week Friends but sometimes I just like to sit back and enjoy wacky shows like this one.   These muggles are so salty.   The pacing seems fine for a 26 episode season. First three episodes set up the characters, magical setting, student council and the awkward take on discrimination. This episode introduced the possible conflict with the anti-magic terrorist group, it's pretty obvious that's where the plot is going.   So many good passes are wasted on Asik.   DeRozan got the 2006 Finals Wade treatment.   This episode gave me a "The Most Dangerous Game" vibe and a little bit of "The Birds" vibe towards the end. Good stuff.   CG also allows the animators to have more freedom with the camera work since the camera is operating in 3d. In 2d they redraw all the different angles which is a lot more work. The amount of camera angles, transitions, and different POVs that we saw in this show's action scenes are something you're rarely going to see in 2d animation.  Also I really like the lighting and shadowing in this show, again something hard to pull off in traditional animation.  Hopefully CG in anime keeps improving, variety is a good thing.   I actually want to see Kunato try to pilot the Type 17 and possibly make a fool of himself. According to that little bit of exposition the Type 17 demands more from the pilot since the computer system isn't as advanced.   The framerate is up and down. 1st episode I thought it was ok, 2nd episode it was really distracting and 3rd episode it's ok-ish. Overall I think the show looks great.  I didn't expect all of them to die. Even though someone dying was predictable I thought it was executed well. The voices of panic and everyone's composure unraveling were pretty convincing.   He doesn't have to commit and it might remain that way but I'm just pointing it out that it's a weakness.  Throwing a game is disrespectful to the opponent since it belittles their effort and pride. I highly doubt Kong would appreciate being pitied like that.   Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.  Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby.   I really wish this didn't go the amnesia route. We already have a series with the same "mysterious powerful girl" setup that uses amnesia as a plot device.  The interaction between the three is starting to grow on me and inserting some world building gives the show a sense of adventure.   Why the fuck is there a case of mass destruction inside a Gastrea?  Also, some of these scenes are put together well with decent enough dialogue but the overacted voice acting spoil these scenes. The screaming and wailing can be a bit grating which is a shame since I like how the show is building up the bond between Rentaro and Enju.   Grizz had to beat both the Thunder and Lady Luck   Yeah, a bit heavy handed with the character emotions and motives. It's going with the old "angsty MC with a tragic past" concept; nothing wrong with that but the portrayal was way too straightforward and unrefined. Despite all of that, I didn't mind the first episode, it was effective in establishing the dark tone albeit a bit forceful, and it did enough to piqued my interest.  Hopefully the drama doesn't get too overbearing and the show would let it breath. I haven't seen much of Okada's work but she's been criticized for overdone melodrama, so I'm crossing my fingers here. I really really liked Anohana though, melodrama aside.      I know anime fans love to complain about MCs in romance shows being wish-washy and beating around the bush but this one is quite the opposite. The relationship feels rushed and unearned, and lacks chemistry. The show hasn't done enough with the dialogue and circumstances to build a feeling of genuine bond between the two.   Werdum really turned it on after Browne taunted him. Then Werdum proceeded to taunt Browne for three rounds.   Gotta commend Tatsuya for his composure when Miyuki was working her "charms." If I were in his place...ummm I might start questioning my moral values lol.  This has all the makings of a fun guilty pleasure show; overpowered MC, imouto fetishism, nonsense jargon, awkward take on discrimination, and good action.   Finally a three.   Andersen you idiot.   I love Eagle, WTF am I doing watching the ESPN broadcast.  	150

Also, I'm enjoying all the Ten in this thread.    Whatever she was buried in (I forget the name of the material) basically mummified her. As to how they discovered and collected this evidence, I don't even want to know. I assume my father purposefully set out to preserve her body so that one day the truth would come to light and he would be more or less exonerated (in every way but legally).    I haven't seen the tox screens, I was only told that she was "drugged". I'm not sure what they found.    Thanks! I really need to do a Return to Deepwood, PA story.    ***Possible Triggers - (please see end of post)*** ________________________________________________________  It's funny what you remember as a kid. I don't remember my 5th birthday or my first day of school. But I remember very clearly the day my dog died. It's been 12 years now, and it's still the most vivid memory of my childhood.   My sister Ashley and I were typical twins. Always hatching diabolical plans and getting into trouble together. On this particular day, we had colored our cat, Pongo, blue. Even though my mom tried to punish us separately - me on the stairs, Ashley in the dining room - we were still making faces at each other and giggling. She was just about to scold us when the doorbell rang.  My mother gave us both a you-better-not-move-a-muscle look as she went to answer the door.   Standing on our stoop was a tall, lanky blonde man wearing a red tracksuit. I remember he had shifting, watery eyes. He noticed Ashley and I immediately.  What *we* noticed was that he was holding our dog, Rocky under one arm like a sack of flour. Ashley called to Rocky softly, but the dog didn't move. The man began to talk lowly with my mother. She cupped a hand over her mouth and I heard him say "Do you mind if I use your hose?"  My mother rushed us upstairs to our room and we watched out the window as the man rinsed off his fender in front of our house. It was our first taste of death and we cried for two days. We were six.  My parents, deciding to use the sad occasion as an opportunity to teach us about death, held a funeral in our backyard for Rocky. Ashley and I cried as we read a poem we had written together the night before.  My mother held us as my father hammered a white, wooden cross into the ground bearing Rocky's name. Even our older brother Eric was there, which  was nice because he was almost always next door playing video games and smoking something smelly with the neighbor kids. I think I saw him tear up a little. We had loved Rocky.  That was only two months before it happened.   What I remember much less clearly was the night that Ashley disappeared.   My parents had thrown a going away party for Eric, who was leaving for a semester abroad in Japan. Ashley and I had begged them to make it a pool party and we'd finally worn them down after much pestering. The pool had only gone in three months before and it was our official christening party!  Oddly, I remember only bits and pieces of that night. My father was drunk. My mother was giving tours of our newly remodeled house to everyone, whether they wanted to see it or not. My brother was in the living room with his friends playing video games. And Ashley and I were in the pool playing mermaids, which was our favorite game.   My uncle Cliff gave us rubber bands which we used to bind our ankles together. We then swam around the pool pretending to be mermaid princesses. Just after it got dark my mom called us for dinner.  We both jumped out of the pool and ran around the edge before my father yelled at us.  "Rachel! Ashley! No running, or you're going inside for the night!"  My mother handed us our burgers and people cooed and admired our matching bathing suits. We were always matching. Together we sat down on the pool deck to eat.  Afterward, we got back in the water to play mermaids, again.   At some point my mother called us in to bed. We pretended to cry and begged her to let us stay up a little later. She didn't fall for it. We stomped up the stairs and went into the bathroom to strip out of our swim suits. I remember we decided to switch beds and dress in each others pajamas so we could play a trick on Mommy in the morning. It was our favorite prank and she deserved it for making us go to bed early when we weren't tired. Nevertheless, we fell asleep quickly.   The next morning, I woke up alone. I don't remember getting dressed or eating breakfast. What I do remember is spending what felt like forever walking around our house looking for Ashley. The new renovations had yielded new hiding spots and it took me awhile to check them all.  I finally went to ask my mom, who asked my dad, who had just returned from dropping Eric at the airport.   "Paul, please tell me you took Ashley with you to drop Eric off?!"  "No, why?" My dad's face paled instantly.  "Oh my God. Paul, we've looked everywhere, we can't find her."  My dad was already moving from room to room in the house checking all the places I had checked. By the time he returned, my dad was crying.   "Diane, call the police. Now."  That was the day my mother turned into something else. She never smiled or cried again.   But I did.   But I never cried as much as I did when when Rocky died, which always made me feel bad and confused.  I remember a big police man talking to me, asking me what I remembered, had I heard anything in the middle of the night. He even asked if I liked having an identical twin sister or if I hated it. That question confused me for many years.   The days turned to a week and still no Ashley. I slept alone in my room, switching from bed to bed, some nights pretending I was Ashley and it was Rachel who was missing.   Lots of men with dogs came and went into the woods behind our house. Reporters were parked outside everyday and overnight. My parents wouldn't let me watch TV. The policemen tore up my bedroom and the rest of the house. I thought they were looking for a goodbye note. I thought Ashley had run away. I was so mad at her.   Months went by and I grew lonely. I was excited when my birthday came. My mom cried from morning to night that day so my dad took me out for pizza. But he was quiet the entire time. My brother fell in love with a local and decided to stay in Japan. Since he was 18, my dad couldn't stop him. My mother missed him and Ashley and drank wine and slept all the time. My father tried to be there to support me but he was suffering in his own way, I think. He upgraded Rocky's wooden cross to proper stone when I asked why Ashley hadn't had a funeral.  I think he knew I needed a place to grieve. We all did.  One day he came home with a new dog which I named Naughty Boy. I hated Naughty Boy. He was trying to be Rocky and no dog could *ever* be Rocky. He eventually ran away. No one looked for him.  Four months after Ashley disappeared my father filled in the pool. I remember sitting in my room (which felt big and cavernous and cold) and watching them drain the pool. It took two days to fill it in with dirt. The pool had been the one last happy thing in my life. And my father had taken it away. He had taken my brother away too. He was the taker of things.   One afternoon, I was flipping through channels on the TV. The remote dropped from my hands when I suddenly saw my face on screen. It was a show called Unsolved Mysteries. My mother walked in then and saw what I was watching. I was afraid I was in trouble but she just gave me a blank look and walked right back out. I turned the TV off.  My parents began to yell at each other when they thought I couldn't hear. Their marriage was strained. There were so many phone calls from witnesses who reported seeing Ashley somewhere. But they were almost always just seeing me. Whenever this turned out to be the case, which was often, my mother would give me an accusing look, like I had purposefully raised her hopes and then kicked the chair out from under her. Every false lead seemed to kill her a little more.  It was around then that I realized why no one liked me anymore. I was like a ghost, an echo of my sister. A pale shadow following around her mysterious disappearance. My parents could barely look at me. I know they  think I didn't notice, but I did.  We eventually had a funeral for Ashley, but I don't remember it very well. At least, not as well as Rocky's funeral. I just recall thinking how stupid it was to have a funeral for an empty box.   After a year, my mother filed for divorce. I still remember their very last fight. They were so far gone by then that they didn't seem to care that I heard.  "My brother would never hurt my children. Christ, what the hell is wrong with you, Diane? You can't just go around casually accusing people of serious crimes like kidnapping!"  "She's not kidnapped anymore, *Paul*, is she?" She spat at him. "She's dead! But I'm starting to think you already know that."  "How *dare* you say something like that to me. I love Ashley. I loved all our children!"  "Yeah, I'm sure you loved Ashley a lot. How much *did* you love her, Paul? Do I need to keep Rachel away from you, too?"  *SLAP*  I recoiled like it had been me he'd hit. I didn't understand what my mother had said. Tears poured down my face. Stupid Ashley. Why couldn't she have just stayed in bed? Why did she have to go wandering off? Where did she go? Why had she done this to our family?  My thoughts were interrupted by a whisper from the next room.  "Why did you fill in the pool, Paul?"  I ran then. I didn't understand that question. I didn't want to understand.   Years went by. My mother met a new man named Bobby and moved out of our house.  My dad and I maintained a strained but quiet home life - I avoided him at all costs. I spent more and more time at friend's houses and he spent more and more time in his study. The following summer, Dad built a deck over our filled-in pool. He never bought furniture for it.  When I was 13 I learned that my mom was living with Uncle Cliff, my dad's brother. I hated going to their house. Cliff had an above ground pool, and always tried to get me to go swimming with him. He even bought me swim suits, little bikinis that made me uncomfortable to look at. They would be laid out on the bed whenever I came to visit.   But I never went swimming with Uncle Cliff. I hated pools now. Soon they stopped inviting me to their house.   My dad was now spending every night shut up in his study, which he had moved to the room at the back of the house. He kept it locked and he would never let me inside.   I moved out when I was 18. My dad hugged me the day I left. It was the first time he had looked at me, much less touched me in seven years. He whispered that he loved me and then turned around and walked back into his study, closing the door behind him and locking it. I left.   Three weeks later a police officer showed up at my apartment. He sat me down and told me my father had been found dead.  I went to the house that night. My dad had killed himself in his study while sitting at his desk. I finally got to see the room - the body was gone, but the blood remained.  I looked around. The study was basically empty. There was a desk, a chair, seven photos, a notebook and a drawing.  The desk sat in the middle of the room and faced the window to the backyard. The photos were of Ashley and I. The drawing was one that Ashley had drawn of our family shortly before she disappeared. The notebook was empty except for the last page.   It said: *What happened the night of August 16th, 2002*  But there was nothing written below it.  The chair was covered in blood but I was so numb I sat in it anyway. So it had been him. The whispers were true, he had been him all along. Our own father.   "What have you done?" I whispered.   I looked out the window and was surprised to find it situated over Rocky's grave. The tombstone was almost close enough the read.  "Ma'am? Ma'am, I know this is difficult. But I- I want to let you know that with this notebook we can get a warrant to excavate the yard."  I glanced up at the detective standing next to me. I knew he was trying to tread lightly. I nodded at him.  "But out of respect," he continued, "I want to ask you first."  I looked back out into the yard. I looked at the empty deck my father had spent an entire summer building and then never used. What was buried underneath it? I stood up and looked the detective dead in the eye.  "Dig it up."  I thought I knew what they'd find at this point. I thought maybe my mother had known it all along. But neither of us were right.  The excavation took 6 days. First, they had to tear up the deck. I stayed at the house that week, in my old room, and watched their progress from my bedroom window. The room didn't feel too big anymore. It felt small and suffocating.  I had my father quickly cremated and scattered his ashes in a ditch off the 405. I threw the urn in there too.   The first body was found at 11:29pm on a Thursday. I awoke to the sounds of yelling and dressed quickly. I ran down the stairs, through the door and out under the flood lights in the backyard. I darted my way around the mounds of dirt to where the forensics team was gathered. I braced myself and peered over their shoulders.  "That's not my sister."  They all turned to look at me.   "What is she doing here?" Someone said so no one in particular.  "That's not Ashley." I tried again. Someone grabbed my arm then.  "Who is that? That's not my sister! Who is that?" I was yelling. I knew I was becoming hysterical, but I couldn't stop myself from screaming.   They dragged me away from the body. I sat next to the house wrapped in a blanket for the rest of the night. I didn't understand. Who was that? That wasn't Ashley. Ashley was me and that wasn't me. The bones were too big. They were too long. That wasn't Ashley. Who was that?  At dawn, someone finally came to talk to me.   "Rachel-"  "Who is that?" I asked for the hundredth time that night.  "Rachel, we can't say for certain at this point but there's some strong evidence to suggest that the body might be, well that it could be...your brother."  "No," I said flatly, shaking my head. "Eric is in Japan. He's married. He's 30 now."  "Well, do you have an address? Or a phone number?"  "No... I mean...Eric doesn't talk to anybody anymore."  "Okay, well the M.E. took the body, so we'll know more soon. Just hang tight."   *Just hang tight.* What an absurd thing to say. The shitty world I had managed to build for myself from the ashes of my former life was starting to crumble.  Who was in the pool? The question haunted me for days. It wasn't Eric, it couldn't be. That much I knew. Unless Eric had come back from Japan. But I would know if he had, wouldn't I? Wouldn't he have come to see me?  I got my answers a few days later. Eric had not come back from Japan - because Eric had never left. Though his body had almost completely decomposed, the cheap, plastic "Good Luck" beaded necklace around his neck hadn't. The police ruled that he had died on the night of the party.  I didn't understand anything anymore. My mind refused to accept their findings. I began falling apart.   I wasn't there when they found the other body in the pool. It was Rocky's. When I walked into the house, they gave me his bones in an evidence box. It was all they had.   I looked down at the box and the dirty bones inside, and I knew where Ashley was. I knew why my father had moved his office. I knew why he had replaced Rocky's cheap wooden headstone with a heavy one made of shiny white marble. I knew why he had inscribed it: *A Voice I Loved is Still*. I knew why the date didn't match Rocky's death.   Ashley's small body was well preserved. When I saw how little she was, I started shaking. I never remembered being so small. He had taken great care in burying her. She was inside a white bag I had never seen before, a special type I had never heard of. It had effectively mummified her. She was laying on her back in a dress with her small hands crossed and her eyes closed. She looked peaceful and beautiful.  I watched them place her gently on a metal board. I watched them zip a different bag over her. I watched them load her into a van. And I watched them take her away. I sat down next to the headstone. It was her resting place for the the last 12 years. I looked through the window and I saw my dad's desk and his chair. I sat there all night. People brought me water and tea. But I just stared at the empty hole in the ground. Confused, angry and lost.   The excavation team left the next morning. The lead detective on Ashley's case - a man named Beller - called me around dawn. Because of the state of Ashley's body, they were able to collect evidence from her. They were waiting for it to cycle through the lab. I asked what kind of evidence. He wouldn't say.  The day I got the official report is another that I will never forget.    I was on the phone with my mother who I had finally found after months searching. She was in Philadelphia with Uncle Cliff and they had taken up heroin together.   I told her the police wanted to talk to her. I told her about Ashley and Dad. I didn't tell her about Eric yet. I couldn't tell her that over the phone.  But she wasn't all there. She asked the same questions again and again. She repeated what I said. It was hopeless. I took down her number and hung up the phone. Detective Beller could deal with her.   As soon as I hung up, he called me.  "Rachel, we have the results of the autopsies, can you come down to the station?"  I sighed. It was late. After the conversation with my mother I was exhausted and emotionally drained. There was no way I would make it downtown tonight.   "Can you just tell me over the phone? I'm sorry, I can't, there's no way I can get there tonight."  "Where are you? I'll send a car."  "Actually, can you please just tell me. I can't...I can't go back there. I can't see their bodies again. I can't be in that room."  The detective paused then seemed to come to a decision.  "Rachel, there was semen on Ashley's body."  "What?" I didn't hear that right..   "Yeah... We also found ligature marks on her neck. The Medical Examiner has ruled Ashley's death a homicide."  "Yeah, okay, but-"  "There is no mistake."  "Yeah, but, can you say the first part again? Because I swear you said-"  "Rachel, your sister was raped."  *No, no, no, no, no.*  "My dad couldn't have-"  "The semen isn't a match to your dad. It's a match to your brother."  I didn't speak. I didn't move. Until I started to shake.  "I wouldn't usually be so frank, but you've been through a lot and you deserve to know this. Here is what we have pieced together: on the night of August 16th, 2002 Eric went into your room and took Ashley. He then drugged her, raped her and, accidentally we think, killed her by strangulation. Your father walked in on him and beat your brother to death. This all occurred in the late evening or early morning of the party. He then held the bodies for a month or so until he had the pool filled."  "My-my brother went to Japan-"  "No, he didn't."  "But my dad, he killed them-"  "No, he killed one of them. This is a crime of passion and, honestly, I'm not even sure your dad would have done time for it. I don't understand why he didn't just come forward."  I was silent. I knew why. Because of me and my mom. Ashley's disappearance had broken us but we'd always had hope. Hope that Ashley would be released someday. Hope that she had found a new family. Hope that she would eventually come home. But she had never left.  And Eric, how could we reconcile our beloved Eric with the monster he truly was? My father had borne this knowledge and the burdens of it alone. His sacrifice may have been wasted on my mother but not on me. That hope for Ashley, and love for Eric and my parents had gotten me through so much when there was so little ground to stand on. The cost he must have paid to do this for me - it was unfathomable.  And I had burned his body and scattered his ashes on a highway. He would never be laid to rest with the family he had endured so much to protect. And I had done this to him.  My father wasn't the monster. I was.   I filled a casket with the photos on my father's desk and the drawing he had held to his chest when he shot himself. And then I, too, buried an empty casket. I buried Ashley next to my dad, and my mother on her other side two years later. I don't know what the state did with Eric's body and I haven't asked.   So really, this is a letter to you, Ashley. To let you know why this happened and to tell you I'm sorry.    I'm sorry that when the monster came that night he choose you instead of me.   I'm sorry that I thought you ran away, and I'm sorry I never looked for you.  I'm sorry I abandoned the person who loved you the most  to his demons.  I'm sorry I left him forgotten and alone in a ditch.   I'm sorry I blamed you for destroying our family.  But most of all, I'm sorry that I'm the only one left standing.  [C.

Wow.    [Fox Fur Nebula](http://www.cosmotography.com/images/lrg_foxfur_nebula_ngc2264.jpg)   Macaroni and cheese.    The ultimate selfie.    Verbal is Keyser Soze   NPH    Toddlers in Tiaras. NOPE   The one ring.    I grew up in Keeling, Missouri. No, you wouldn't have heard of it. It was a small, rural, upper-middle class community where everyone owned at least an acre or two. My father was a writer and my mother wanted to keep horses so this was the perfect little "one-stoplight town" to settle in.   I grew up there until suddenly, in 1984, the government claimed eminent domain on all of Keeling and we were bought out. My dad moved us to sunny California.  I'm a writer, too, though I'm not as well known as my father. I write informational pieces for online magazines and blogs. As you can probably guess, I'm barely getting by. So when one of my editors asked me to write an article on eminent domain for a well known political website, I jumped at the chance. She told me I was chosen because I had first-hand experience with eminent domain and the buyer wanted a personal piece that included photos.   I packed my bags that night, excited for the project. I'd always been curious about what became of my hometown, anyway. Before he died, my dad told me he thought Keeling had been turned into an airport.  First - research. I was disappointed to find the internet all but mute on the old town - citing my sources was going to be difficult. I knew Keeling had been near Poplar Bluff, Missouri so I pulled up Google Earth and followed the 67 north to the turn off for Keeling.   Odd. The entire town was...blank. Not blank like there weren't any buildings, blank like there was a gaping black hole where Keeling used to be - a hole in the satellite data. It could only mean one thing. I slammed my laptop shut and through the mouse against the wall. It was private - and likely secret - government land now.  I hemmed and hawed on it a few days before deciding to go anyway. This particular buyer had allotted me a per diem (funds) for travel and I might as well use them. Maybe there was still a story here.  Two days later I was driving through Poplar Bluff in a rented Ford Focus. I stopped at a gas station for some water and granola bars, deciding to check into the hotel after I got back from Keeling. I was looking forward to seeing it again.   I took the exit north on the 67 and drove until I realized I'd missed the turn off. I circled back, looking for anything familiar. I drove back and forth until I found it. Barely there, covered in plant life and completely unrecognizable, was a road. I'd seen this street a million times, but never unpaved which is why I'd missed it. Someone had pulled up the asphalt and the road was completely overgrown. Bizarre.  I drove the six miles into Keeling wishing I had rented something with bigger tires and a higher clearance. Suddenly, the pavement returned and I rolled into the abandoned business district of Keeling. It was small - a post office, a gas station and a bar. All the buildings were derelict and rotting - their decay far more consistent with something left sitting for 100 years - not 30.   I drove through the eerily quiet town with the burned out stoplight and continued down route 51 toward my old house.   As I passed the other houses on the street, I noticed they were in the same state of advanced decay as those in town. It was unsettling, pulling up to the house I'd lived in only 30 years before to find it crumbling and consumed by time.   I went through every room in my house for the nostalgia, but found nothing of interest. We had packed well - there was nothing left here but a mannequin covered by a beige sheet in my mom's old sewing room. I was glad she left that, those things were creepy.   I left my old house and continued down the road, which by now had turned back to dirt. Just why had the government bought this place? Why spend all that money, buy up all this land and then abandon it? My stomach fell as I started to realize there may be no story here. I was going to return to LA empty handed. I swore audibly.   I counted house after house knowing I was reaching the end of the street. All were in varied states of decomposition, some had even collapsed in on themselves.   The house at the end of the drive began coming in to view. I slowed down to take it in as it filled my windshield. I never remembered this house being this big, but then, my parents hadn't let me go this far down the street.    While every other building in Keeling was disintegrating rapidly, this house stood proud and palatial, untouched by the decades. It was almost as if this place was stealing the energy, life even, of every other building in town. And maybe even more than that...  A large, very clear and defined area of dead grass circled the house. Two dead trees stood skeletized within this radius. Toxic ground water, perhaps? The windows were all barred, save a small, circular port window on the third story. If the government had claimed this town for anything, it was clearly this house, it was so different from the others. But what was so special about it?  Smelling a story at last, I parked in the pristine white driveway and climbed out of my car, hauling my camera and laptop cases over my shoulder. I walked up the four steps to the door and was delighted to find it unlocked.  The foyer was large and the house smelled musty. A staircase to the second floor was set right in front of me, a floor to ceiling mirror on the wall to my left and a closed door and hallway beyond it on my right. I set my stuff down and took my phone out - no signal. Faaaaantastic. Looks like I wouldn't be calling the hotel about my late arrival.  I toured the house, snapping a few pictures with my cell as I went. The first floor had a library, a living room, a kitchen and a dining room. All the furniture had been left, even the dining room table was set, and everything was orderly and oddly dust free. Was someone still cleaning this place?  The second floor had 4 bedrooms and another narrow staircase that led up to the attic. I tried the attic door first, but found it to be locked. The first room I went into was the master bedroom. It was simple yet cozy and had an adjoining bathroom. I eyed the bed with interest, a sudden idea coming to me. I may not have to leave Keeling tonight after all.  The next room from the master stood with door ajar. This room was bare except for nine mannequins, all covered in musty, yellowed sheets like the one at my house. I snapped a quick picture and shuddered, closing the door to the room.   The next door in the hallway was closed. I opened it and stumbled back in surprise. This room had a child's bed and was filled wall to wall with dolls.   I circled the room, curiously picking up a few. Baby Alive dolls, Cabbage patch dolls, and tons of creepy, little, yellowing porcelain dolls. They all appeared to be looking at the bed. I snapped two pictures in this room vowing to come back with my Canon.    I closed this door too and entered the last room on the second floor. It was a simple office - green carpet and green wallpaper. It had a plain desk and tan typewriter with a new white - not yellowed - piece of paper loaded into it. Interesting.   I left this room and descended the stairs. It was time to bring out the big guns. I bent down to unsheathe my Canon when movement caught my eye to my right. I turned and looked into the mirror. I'd known it was there subconsciously so what had caught my attention? I reached for my camera again and realized what was wrong.  The mirror, more specifically my movements in it, were somehow how of sync. When I moved my arm, my reflection did so about a quarter second later. When I blinked, my eyes were still closed in the mirror when I opened them again. It was incredibly unsettling.  I continued to watch my delayed reflection when I suddenly heard a noise, like the creaking of a stair. But it didn't come from the staircase on the right, it came from directly behind me, behind the basement door. Someone was coming up the stairs of the basement. So there was someone here! I eagerly gripped the basement door and tried to open it but - like the attic - it was locked. I banged on the door but heard only silence below. Ah - animals. Of course.   Still determined to find a story I opened the front door to unload my car and stopped short. What the.... My car, which I had definitely parked at the top of the driveway, was now parked at the bottom of the driveway, almost in the street. I had parked it at the top of the driveway, hadn't I? I'd just been so excited...I couldn't remember.  I unloaded the car and brought my stuff up to the master bedroom. As I walked by the sewing room I noticed the door stood open again - but I knew I had closed it. I went to peer in and this time, there were at least 14 sheeted mannequins in it. There had been 9 last time. Right? I had counted. This time there were 5 more. Something was definitely going on. Perhaps it was all in my head. Maybe the air was toxic somehow, and that's why the government pushed everyone out of Keeling. Was I losing it? I took another photo.  By the time I had deposited everything in the master bedroom, I was winded. I felt so weak, I had to lay down on the bed. This was unusual for me - someone who had nothing better to do most days than go to the gym.   I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew I heard someone with a high, small voice say, "Say bye-bye!"  I bolted upright and looked around in a panic, eventually noticing one of the dolls from the little girl's room sitting on the bedside table. It was small and porcelain. Since when did they make talking porcelain dolls?   I rubbed my eyes and glanced around the room. In the muted light of the setting sun I saw someone in the corner. Not someone...something. It was one of those stupid sheet-covered mannequins. I shuddered - that definitely wasn't there before.   I walked over to it. Someone was fucking with me, I knew it. I started to raise the sheet to see underneath when I heard a loud bang from downstairs. I let the sheet drop and started toward the bedroom door when I suddenly felt very sick. I dashed into the bathroom and threw up in the toilet. What was wrong with me? I wasn't going to have a lot of time here - whatever was going on in this place, it was making me ill.  I stood up from the toilet and splashed water on my face. This time when I looked into the bathroom mirror my reflection's movements were at least a half second behind mine. I waved my hands in front of the mirror horrified by my reflection's slow response. I watched the blood leave my face and gaped at my reflection in dismay. How was this even possible?  Of course, it wasn't. What was going on in the house was, dare I say it, supernatural? Possibly. I mean, what scientific explanations were there? I'd wanted a story and I'd gotten one. I could be the first journalist to prove the existence of...what? Ghosts? Demons? Poltergeists? I guess it didn't matter. It was my payday - and I was going to need evidence.   As I turned away from the mirror to find my camera, I could have sworn I saw my reflection wink at me. I grabbed the Canon off the floor and began photographing everything I saw. I went downstairs to re-shoot every room, starting with the library. I started pulling books out one by one and quickly realized that every single book in the library was a copy of the Bible. Many different versions in many different languages. I opened a few that were in English and found that the word 'God' was scratched out on every page, in every one.   It was getting dark and just as I thought about seeing if the lighting worked in this house, a light flicked on in the dining room pouring out into the hallway. What the...  I turned my camera to photograph the corridor when I suddenly heard heavy stomping. It was more than stomping, it was almost running - and it was coming down the hallway right towards me. I dropped the camera and stood frozen with fear.   Whatever it was entered the library and stomped right up in front of me. I couldn't see anything, but there was definitely something there - I could feel it blocking me from leaving. I slowly pulled my phone out of my pocket and took a picture of whatever was right in front of my face. The flash momentarily blinded me and when I recovered my vision, all the books in the library were on the floor, as if they had been ripped from the shelves in a rage, and in only that few seconds of silence. But I felt that whatever had been standing in front of me was gone.  I picked up the Canon, took a few more pictures with shaking hands, and tiptoed my way out of the room. I realized I needed video - not pictures. I pulled my cell phone out again and opened it up to video then walked down the hallway toward the lit dining room. I passed a painting in the hallway and caught sight of my smirking reflection. But I wasn't smiling.   As soon as I entered the dining room, I noticed something was different. A noose made of stained sheets was now tied to a beam above the table. It was swinging back and forth as if it were weighted, but nothing else in the room was moving. Even the beamed creaked as it swung, as if it, too, was straining from the weight of something. I filmed it for a minute and then raised the Canon for a picture. It suddenly stopped swinging as if someone had grabbed it midair. I heard giggling from upstairs.   I left the dining room and walked toward the staircase, warily. Did I really want to go up there? I didn't hear the giggling anymore but I heard the typewriter clicking away. I happened to glance toward the large foyer mirror again to see it was now out of sync a full second behind me. I heard the giggling again and then something small run down the hallway and slam a bedroom door. On gut reaction alone, I threw the door open, intending to flee.   The car was now 50 yards down the street. I was about to bolt for it anyway when I heard another stair creek behind me - through the basement door. This time, it was closer, further up the stairs. Maybe only 5 steps below the main floor. I shook my head as if to shake it clear of fear. Every journalist dreams of a chance like this, of a story like this. I had to stay just long enough to get something on video.  I heard the typewriter start to click again and sprinted up the stairs, running full speed into the office. The typewriter had stopped typing by the time I got there and I ran over to see what it had written. I sat down at the desk when I reached it, suddenly feeling tired and weak again.   The paper read: "jamie ellis is condemned. jamie ellis is condemned. jamie ellis is condemned." over and over again, all the way down the page. I took a photo with the Canon and waited to see if it would start typing. Just then, I heard the giggling echo down the hallway again. I rose from the chair and left the office, stepping out into the darkening hallway.  The child's bedroom door was closed but I could hear scuffling and movement from behind it. I slowly opened the door hoping I would find animals. Cats, raccoons, mice, anything! But it wasn't animals.  Every doll in the room was where I'd left it. Only now all their heads were turned toward the door. They were looking at me...  I heard another giggle on my right and noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. I quickly slammed the door shut and fell back against the banister in terror. I couldn't do this. I slowly got up, tired and shaky. I walked by the sewing room door, open again, and this time there were only 3 mannequins left in the room.   I didn't stop to wonder where the others had gone. I bolted down the stairs as something else ran up, stomping the entire way.  I had been wrong. So wrong. It was time to leave, I needed to get out. I turned the front door handle and was sickened to feel it locked. I ran down the hall, through the living room, and into the kitchen, pulling on the backdoor and screaming in frustration when it wouldn't open.   "Where ya goin? He he he." I heard from the living room. The dolls. Jesus, the dolls. I stumbled into the living room which was now lit by a single tall, black lamp in the corner. There was a doll on the floor in the middle of the room that hadn't been there before.   Knowing my fate was probably already sealed, I walked over and picked her up off the floor. Her head hung limp behind her as any dolls' would.  "What did you say to me?" I breathed.  Nothing.  "What the fuck did you say to me?!" I demanded in a crazy panic.  The doll slowly picked it's head up and smiled, breaking the stitching on it's mouth.   "You're never leaving, Jamie. You're going to be just like me soon."  I screamed and threw the doll against the wall. The lamp went out then and I heard the doll run off into the darkness.  I put my head between my knees breathing hard now. I couldn't catch my breath. This house was draining me, it was sucking the life from me, just like the rest of the town. I was so tired.   I walked out into the hallway to make my way to the foyer again to try the door. I dropped to my knees in agonizing fear when I saw a sheeted mannequin standing in the middle of the hallway, 15 feet away.   Tears poured down my face as I noticed for the first time that this mannequin had legs - and feet. Another doll. It was another doll. A human sized doll. They were all dolls...  Not knowing what else to do, I got to my feet and slowly raised the shaking camera to my eye, peering through the viewfinder. I snapped the picture and when I lowered the camera I screamed. It was now right in front of me, and it mumbling something unintelligible from under the sheet.   I ran. I ran for my life, down the hall and this time, I had no reflection in the mirror. I didn't even want to think about where my reflection had gone. As I took the stairs two at a time, I heard whatever was on the basement stairs take another step up - it had to be nearly at the top.   I ran into the master bedroom, not daring to look into the sewing room on the way. I fell down onto the bed and shook with tears. I had such sever muscle weakness at this point, I could barely move. How was I going to escape this place? I raised my head to look out the window for my car. I finally saw it - in the darkness - at the end of the street. I fell back to the bed, weak and sickly and slowly slipped into unconsciousness.  When I awoke again, it was with a start. Something was weighing me down on the bed. I shot up and noticed I had been tucked under the covers and the entire quilt was covered in little dolls. They were so many of them, all sitting on top of the covers, trapping me there, looking my direction. But the worst was at the end of the bed. There, leaning toward me over the footboard, was a mannequin. But I now knew it wasn't a mannequin - it was a doll.   I gasped as the sheet slowly started to slip off the mannequin and I fell out of bed onto the floor. I heard the dolls giggling as I clawed my way out of the room. I didn't know where else to go. With the windows barred, and the doors locked the only way out seemed to be the small port window in the attic. I dragged myself up the stairs, hoping I had enough energy to throw myself against the door to break it in.  I found it unlocked. I crawled into the attic and turned toward the window - my heart plummeting into my stomach. Oh, there was the port window, sure enough. But between it and I was a sea of dolls and mannequins. They all just stood there, facing each other. There were hundreds of them. I moaned in defeated anguish and in terrifying unison, every head slowly turned toward me. I recoiled in horror and fell down the attic stairs, hitting the second floor with a hard thud.  The typewriter was clicking away again, but I already knew what it was typing. I stood up, in utter pain, and shuffled down the stairs. There had to be another way out, I wouldn't die here, I couldn't. All I'd wanted was my big break, what had I done to deserve all this?!  When I got to the bottom of the staircase, I dubiously turned to face the mirror. It was half a second behind me, again. I studied it looking for some sign of weakness, something to tell me what was going on, I didn't know what else to do. Suddenly, I heard a loud knocking on the basement door behind me and jumped. Oh God...whatever "it" was, it had reached the top of the stairs.   I spun toward the door in a panic and dropped to my knees in my weakened state. I happened to glance under my arm and saw that, unlike me, my reflection had remained standing and facing me. I spun back to the mirror but by the time I did, it was just a half second behind me again. I leaned forward toward the mirror watching it take a moment to follow. I even tried blinking, but this time when I opened my eyes, it's eyes were still open. My reflection suddenly sneered at me and slammed the glass with it's fist from the other side. The glass cracked like a spiderweb and I fell back in terror, through the basement door that suddenly stood open.   I felt every jolt and bump and crack as I tumbled down the stairs and when I finally came to rest at the bottom, I was in complete darkness. I tried to raise my head, but promptly passed out.   This time when I came to the room was well lit. I was lying on a concrete floor, on a dirty, tan sheet just like the dozen mannequins standing around me wore. Other than them, there was nothing else in the basement save a large portrait which hung on the wall. I got to my knees and stumbled over to it.  The portrait was actually a mirror, or rather, was painted to look like a mirror of the room - and it was convincing. In the middle of the mirror stood a tall, dark haired solemn woman in a maroon dress. She looked almost familiar to me... Maybe? Yes, it was her! Ms. Harmon, a widow I used to see in town as a kid. But why was she dressed like a 17th century noble?  I leaned closer to study her face. She had less wrinkles than I remembered as a kid, but had those same dark-brown, angry eyes. The portrait blinked. I fell backwards, into a mannequin which somehow managed not to fall. It had...regained it's own balance, somehow. Feet. I looked around the room. They all had feet.   I turned back in horror to the painting to see the woman's face slowly curl into a smile.   "Stay away from me!" I screamed at her and ran for the stairs. I pushed my way through the mannequins, feeling their hands grab at my shirt, trying to pull me back.   I took the stairs three at a time and when I reached the top, I slammed the door behind me. My reflection was standing in the middle of the mirror, unmoving, watching me quiet ire. I knew I couldn't get out the front door - there was only one way out now.   I dragged myself into the library and grabbed the first chair I stumbled over. Running back, I raised the chair to throw into the mirror. In the second pause it hung over my head, I heard feet, little pitter-patters and loud thunderous steps running up the basement stairs and down the staircase to my right. I could see them all coming out of the corner of my eye but dared not look.   I threw the chair full force against the mirror as my reflection continued to sneer at me. It shattered and with my last ounce of strength I stumbled into the black abyss on the other side. I heard the dolls follow, but I ran and ran - for hours it seemed - until I finally tripped over something and fell.  I listened for footsteps. Silence.  Looking up, I saw I was in the woods next to the house. There was nothing behind me or around me, I had no idea where I'd just come from. I could see the house, it sat quiet and serene in front on me. But I knew better.   Gaining my feet, I ran. I kept falling, almost succumbing to darkness, but I pulled myself back up. I kept moving down the road, desperate to find my car. When I finally saw it on the moonlit horizon, I pulled the keys from my pocket and all but fell into the drivers-side door.   Not wasting a moment, I started the car and peeled off down the street. I drove as fast as I could out of Keeling, twice slamming on the brakes when I thought I saw a sheet-covered mannequin in my rear-view mirror.  I never returned to Keeling, or Missouri for that matter. At least, not physically... Even though my body escaped, I never did. I'm still there. Every time I sleep - or even close my eyes - I am back there, running from room to room. The dolls find new ways to surprise and terrify me every night. If I daydream, it is the same. I am only a hallow shell of who I was. My memories and my body is here but my mind, my soul is still in Keeling, trapped in that house.   In case you're wondering, I had escaped with my Canon around my neck but the pictures were all empty, as black as the hole that was Keeling on Google Earth.  Sometimes even after I wake up in the night, I see a mannequin in the corner of my room. I know I'm in California, but I'm also in Keeling, in that house at the same time. I have been condemned to it and a part of me lives there. Whatever the house's fate, it is my fate as well.   Every night in my dreams the dolls try to pull me back into that basement. So far, I have resisted, but I can't hide forever. Someday, they will drag me back into the black abyss. And what awaits me there, I do not know.   [C.

 Knack. People gave it polarizing opinions but it's a fun beat-em-up with pixar style art style.   Dawn of the Dead (the original)   Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Not much of a plot, full of funny scenes, and perfect for kids and nostalgic adults   	3
 By all means do.   Heard it somewhere years ago. It's my go2 skydiving funny comment.   I really don't have much in the way of social anxiety but I started by asking [online for a quote](http://giganticmirrors.com/contact-aj-wholesale-inc) The installer was cool. Just another guy that I'll never see again and I broke the ice of making a joking comment about what it was for and set the tone of the install.   It could be if you'd make some sammiches.  	4
 Okay, direct me to some.   This is funny, but I don't think it takes into account the fact that the book was published in 1947.   Check out the response in this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/2t4btw/my_son_13_threatens_selfharm_and_suicide_when_he/   Because the word "like" means "similar to  That's exactly the meaning, as I said already -- they're conveying the tone and meaning that's *similar* to what the person said, but not their precise words.   I can see two possibilities for why she might be doing this: Either she's not hungry or she's playing a game that she thinks is funny.   If it's possible that she's not hungry, you might try delaying her feeding time by half an hour or so and see if that makes a difference.   If she's playing a game, you have to put your foot down and tell her that if she spits out a bite, you can't give her another one. And if she spits it out again, you take her out of her chair, tell her that dinner is over, and you walk away. This should get the message across more than just telling her over and over again that spitting out your food isn't a good game.   How so?   I, like, don't understand  This way of using "like" has been around for at least 20 years.   I was like  In this case, "like" conveys the tone and meaning of what the person said but not their exact words.      I haven't personally experienced it, I read it in one of these guides that tell you about gestures that mean one thing in one place may mean the opposite or even be offensive somewhere else.  Similar to this article, but more it was more extensive: http://www.cracked.com/article_16335_7-innocent-gestures-that-can-get-you-killed-overseas.html   I think you misunderstood what I was saying. My point was that OP was misunderstanding the nature of small businesses -- they're not all McDonald's franchises with 30 workers that you can take advantage of by paying them low wages. Many of them employ only the owner or the owner and his family -- and those aren't people whose wages you're going to want to skimp on.   New Yorker here. Best water of any big city in the country. I drink less than a cup a day.    They're small, largely homogeneous countries with very strong Protestant ethics.    Unless the murderer was a contract killer for hire, they killed someone for their own personal reasons and don't have any interest in killing people as a day job. If they were a serial killer psychopath, doing executions just isn't going to be satisfying in any way.  And if the person was a contract killer for hire, he wants to be paid an awful lot of money for his services. A lot more than the state would be willing to pay.   Like you said, tradition. The languages and instruments available way back  when set constraints on what their music was going to sound like, so that became the traditional music of that culture. In today's day and age, everybody makes the same bland pop music and traditional music is considered quaint or boring or folky.   I think it's just you. Whenever there's a two-second gap between one song and the next I immediately start worrying that the site froze.  But like you said, it's probably that you're not really listening to it in the first place.   And if you do start your own hot dog stand, the only worker you're probably going to employ is yourself. Not too helpful to pay yourself less than you deserve.   It's absolutely not consistent, so be careful when you travel.   "Guerrilla marketing" no doubt. I'd report it to the manager.    SE Hinton  My answer too. Catcher in the Rye gets so much play here (mostly negative, but still) and nobody ever reads the Outsiders?   It worked, thank you, but it's really weird.

Most of the parts of Queens and Brooklyn that don't have subway service prefer it that way. It's not a bug, it's a feature. Literally.   Not usually.

What are examples in your country or language?   You're talking about a person who is currently gaining weight. I'm talking about a person who is maintaining their weight. When you maintain your weight, whether you're eating 1,000 or 4,000 calories, it's 4,000 calories in, 4,000 calories out. If you start walking and have 4,000 calories in and 4,100 calories out, you will lose weight.   Trying to explain that weight loss is really nothing more than calories in vs out to some people is like talking to a brick wall. My mother seems to think she needs to start doing crunches. No. You need to eat differently and exercise.  Well, not necessarily. It is calories in, calories out, but if you can effectively change the calories out, you don't necessarily have to change the calories in. So while crunches certainly aren't going to do anything, but if a sedentary person starts walking half an hour a day without altering how much they eat, they will lose weight.   Um, what? You don't need proper nutrition to maintain your weight, you only need calories.    I disagree. LOTR is tough reading; ASOIF is easy reading. LOTR is high fantasy, ASOIF is low fantasy as it de-emphasizes the traditional fantasy aspects.  OP: If you don't like LOTR, you probably won't like any other high fantasy books.    Sure, but not everybody who lives in MA was born and raised there. It might have been hard for them where they grew up.   In what museum have you seen photo-realistic art hanging? Don't go to those museums. And just generally avoid contemporary art, which is mostly crap.   As for what he means by "home," maybe ask him to draw a picture of it?

Not that I doubt that this is true, but how do they compare with religious people of similar ethnic, economic, and regional backgrounds? Not to mention the fact that in some parts of America, it takes a bit of guts to be secular, so it wouldn't at all be surprising that people who don't care about following the crowd aren't sheeple and don't just fall in line with what other people are thinking and doing. That's not about religiousness or secular-ness, but personality.  TLDR: Did they take into account confounding factors?   If you're not allowed to put up curtains, how about frosted window film?

Itsy-bitsy Spider? There Was a Man Who Had a Dog? Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes?   Sometimes knowing what you want to do is instinctive, but sometimes it's about sitting down and asking yourself what your interests are, how you envision your future life, and what you're willing to do to make that happen.  A lot of people don't really know themselves, didn't pay that much attention in school, haven't gotten much guidance from counselors or teachers or parents, and are frankly unable to imagine that someday they're going to have to pay for their own Internet connection. So when you feel like a perpetual adolescent, there's no real pressure to figure out what you're going to do, especially since sometimes what you're *going* to do isn't necessarily what you *want* to do, but it'll pay the bills better than what you *want* to do.   If you cauterize the stump of an amputated limb, the blood isn't pumping anymore.    There are no differences, in a general sense. In a literature class a teacher may choose books that he thinks will appeal to girls, but history is history. Science is science. It all comes out of the same textbooks. No additional training is needed.  Men teach at all-girls schools all the time.   When they do brain surgery, the patient is awake. All you need are some mirrors and you'll be able to see your brain.

There are like eight versions already made and two more in development.   Sounds like your relationship lacks passion. You have a good, stable, happy relationship, but there's no oomph. It's basically being in a rut.   You're young. Might be worth it to dump him and find someone that you have more of a spark with, someone who inspires you and you inspire him. Maybe someone who's more outgoing or outdoorsy.    The article is about a woman who lost a baby and six months later she was still grieving and depressed and she thought there was something wrong with her because she hadn't gotten over it yet.  I'm stunned that anybody would think this. From the article:  [Kubler-Ross's] model is still deeply and rigidly embedded in our cultural consciousness and psychological language. It inspires much self-diagnosis and self-criticism among the aggrieved. This is compounded by the often subtle and well-meaning judgment of the surrounding community. A person is to grieve for only so long and with so much intensity.  Really? Do you think this is broadly true? I think that most people know that losing a baby is about one of the most traumatic things a person can experience.       I have 300 books on my to-read list and I always have twice as many books at home as I could possibly read in a week so this pretty much cannot happen to me.   One thing you can do is make a list of authors that you like and read their entire back catalogue.    Hopefully you're getting help for that.  But even if you can't choose (or change) how you feel, you can choose what you say. So if next time you want to turn down a piece of chocolate cake, you can say, I'm trying to eat healthier, instead of saying, I'm on a diet because I'm so fat.   I find it rude when somebody skinnier than me says, "Oh, I'm so fat!"  Pretty sure everyone thinks that's obnoxious except the people saying it.   Rob Ford?   I believe you can get dental coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Sign on to the website and see what your options are.   Twilight and Dragon Tattoo were both supposed to be examples of popular bestsellers, and if you think that about Dragon Tattoo, I imagine you don't tend to like any popular bestsellers. If that's not the case, what would you name as a good popular bestseller?  I think either is a good example of a typical bestseller. Twilight is YA and Dragon Tattoo is a translation and honestly, I question whether it would have been published or at least have been as big a seller if the author hadn't died. Good examples? John Sandford, John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark, Maeve Binchy.  I thought Lisbeth was a believable character, and of a kind that we don't get to see very often: a woman who is ferocious, who fights back for herself even though she has been shat on basically her whole life, who is probably on the autistic spectrum.  I didn't find her believable at all. To me she came across as roboticly strong except when the author needed her to be pathetically weak. And she could not have been on the autism spectrum or she could never have done that undercover thing.  It was wish fulfillment in the sense that Larsson did wish his magazine would get as big as Millenium, but that's a much more interesting wish than "oh I want this 'perfect' creepy stalker vampire boy to like me".  Not that bit, the bit where pretty much every woman finds Blomkvist so completely irresistible.    Had to read it for 9th grade reading assignment. Was the only book I was ever assigned that I really liked.   I don't like the high/middle/lowbrow framing because it implies that there is some objective scale of taste determined by how smart a book is.  I'm not sure what you mean by smart. The "brows" are pretty well-defined. Low-brow is romance and James Patterson, middle-brow is your typical bestseller, and high-brow is literary. It has little to do with quality or goodness, though 99% of low-brow books are pretty bad, but probably an equal number of middle- and high-brow books are also bad. Just because something is literary, doesn't mean it's any good.   To me, good taste is more like being able to identify the best in a given genre in as many genres as possible.  That's even more subjective.  good taste is knowing the difference between The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Twilight  While obviously Dragon Tattoo is better than Twilight, pretty much everything that's ever been published is better than Twilight, so that's not saying much. Good taste is knowing that Dragon Tattoo is overhyped, overlong, sexist, and a Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasy just as much as Twilight is a wish fulfillment fantasy.    At least we're talking about the same thing. I'm going to have to say the opposite as you -- since you're not used to hearing it, you don't hear the fine distinction.    Read half of them. Dragon Tattoo and WWZ are wordy trash. Mr. Penumbra is like a children's book.   Murakami's Norwegian Wood is literary but still easy reading and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake is literary and SF to draw in people who generally prefer genre writing. Though maybe Children of Men by P. D. James might be a better suggestion along the same lines.   Oh, I hear it. NY/Jewish pronunciation drives me insane.   In this video, does the way they say "talk" sound like "twalk" to you?  http://vimeo.com/79606889   Well, I live in New Yawk and I've nevah heard anybody tawking like that evah.   twoak   ?  Tawk.    Good point, not such good suggestions. Most of these are on par with Cook and Crichton. Instead, I would suggest literary authors who aren't nearly as heavy as Garcia Marquez and McCarthy, say Margaret Atwood or Haruki Murakami, or light classic authors like Alexandre Dumas.    Depending on what you do and whether it's realistic to expect that you will ever make $250K, you are probably overreacting.   Yeah, if she's like this with everyone, then she needs therapy and OP needs to consider whether it's something he can live with forever if she doesn't go. But if she's only like this with OP, then he's probably being a passive-aggressive asshole and she's sick of it and either they need couples therapy or to break up because it's only going to get worse.   Someone you confide in and who confides in you is your friend, so you have friends. You just aren't a social butterfly. Nothing wrong with that. You might feel more normal if you developed friendships with other introverts, though. Are you in school? Then pick the person in your class who seems the least interested in talking to anybody -- they're probably a fellow introvert.    Two books that I can remember not finishing (off the top of my head):  - The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino. It started out clever but then it kind of got repetitive and annoying.   - The Long War by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. Just plain boring. I blame Baxter.   As for books I did finish, the worst book I read was The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger. Thanks for nothing, Redditors who recommended it. Even though it was a short book (like 200 pages), it was still 180 pages too long. It would have been a good short story.   I don't like the word "good" in this context. I prefer highbrow, lowbrow and middlebrow because I know people who who likes classics and that's considered good taste, but I don't think they have good taste in books at all -- they just happen to like overly wordy and descriptive writing. In other words, it's just a personal preference, not a recognition of the value of classic literature.  I think I have critical middlebrow taste. I read a lot of popular bestsellers and the like, but I rate most of them as being average and not particularly good either because the story is bland or hackneyed or otherwise uninspired and/or the writing is.    It's not about fiction versus non-fiction, it's about books that have meat to them versus books that are just fluffy entertainment. If you're reading books that you felt were a "great time," then of course you won't feel the same way the second time around. Books that stand up to re-reading are ones that you felt had deep personal meaning or significance.   I don't think anybody's hating on him, I think it's just surprising because it's so random.    I don't really think this is an appropriate question. You might try to encourage him to be more complimentary when you look especially nice or when you've done a particularly good job of something, or to be more thankful when you do things for him, or just to say "I love you" more, but for him to enumerate precisely what he likes about you... that smacks of "does this dress make me look fat."   You might want to check out this similar thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rt1ha/me_27f_with_my_husband30m_of_3_years_ive_married/  In your husband's case, he may have trouble with motivation because he's been institutionalized by being in the military. They tell you when to go to bed and when to get up and when to eat and when to work and it's hard to have to do these things on your own. But he's had two years now, it's time to have a serious talk about his life and your relationship.   Added another. ;)   - The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton  - And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie   Where I live there are a couple of all-news radio stations. I listen for about 15 minutes every morning and get the highlights. You could try that?   far less American women find Asian men attractive?   It's not that American women don't find Asian men attractive, they just don't fetishize them the way American men fetishize Asian women, so it doesn't stand out as much. American women definitely find Asian men attractive.    Huh? On BBC Sherlock, Mycroft is played by Mark Gatiss, who is gay. Not nude that I've seen.    Never thought those names would ever be in a sentence together.      And I've been working for 15 years and have known people who've lied on their resume and have not only gotten the job, but advanced further than I have in the same amount of time and nobody ever found them out.  It's not that I really think people should do this, I'm just angry and bitter over what I see as a completely unfair hiring process, and HR professionals even admit that it's absolutely useless for finding the "best person" for the job, but nobody's willing to replace it with something better.   All of these comments from HR people about not lying on resumes is the biggest bunch of crap ever. Lie your head off. Nobody checks. As long as you can successfully BS the interview, you're golden. Until you wind up as CEO and then they look into your resume and find out you didn't graduate from college the way you claimed to. Then you'll be fired. But otherwise, a good BS resume will get you a lot further than an honest resume unless you're amazing. And if you're amazing, you're not reading this thread for resume tips anyway.      There is. Just Google Rod Ferrell book.      I'm surprised Gravesend is the most expensive of the southern Brooklyn neighborhoods.  One of the most surprising bits of data was the Syrian orthodox enclave within Gravesend. While Gravesend averages $470/sq.ft., the section between Avenues S and U, averages $2,000 per square foot. Houses sell for $1012M, putting it among the most expensive neighborhoods of the city by median price. (And if one simply averaged the entire neighborhood, this interesting enclave wouldnt be visible. At a time when developers and brokers are creating unnecessary new neighborhood names to promote emerging areas (the cringeworthy ProCro and Bedwick come to mind), this area constitutes such a different market that it actually merits a different name.  Oh. So they cheated, in other words.  I'd like to see all the neighborhoods in a chart. The maps aren't really that helpful.   I don't really subscribe to "fit at any weight" because I think too many people use it as an excuse not to lose weight, but I don't think it's impossible to be true, either. Just like there are people who smoke all their lives and live to be 100.  In other words, not all healthy people are thin. Healthy people come in all shapes and sizes.   You actually have to work very hard to be famous. It's not just something that happens by accident. There's a difference between being successful and being famous.  For example, when Benedict Cumberbatch was just doing Sherlock, he was successful and had a certain amount of fame on the Internet, but the general public had not idea who he was. Then he went and got a part in half the movies that came out this year and his face is everywhere. Now he's famous.   Sure I have. In fact, in one of them I couldn't see a thing. And the reason why it didn't matter was because it was free. If I'd've had to pay, I would have been pissed.   It's certainly part of it.    If you just wanted to hear her voice, you could just listen to her songs -- why bother going to a concert?   For example, Sia performed with a bag over her head. She says she's about the music and doesn't want to be famous. But she is world-famous and a huge seller. So when people go to a concert of hers, they want to see her performing. Not the back of her head or a paper bag.  So, while I can understand her desire to be authentic and not a sell-out, is it really "fair" to keep acting like she's still a small indie musician once she's attained this level of success?   Good point. We shouldn't be testing young models, we should be testing those 40 and up.    Yeah, waist size is not the gold standard for deciding whether someone is healthy or not. Let's see some blood tests, blood pressure, cholesterol, that sort of thing. But even if those come back normal, that's not saying much. Models are mostly young and young people can abuse their bodies and not have the effects show for years before it catches up to them.   It's by Ian Fleming, in case people don't know. And, the script of the movie was by Roald Dahl (and Ken Hughes).   I don't know, maybe I misunderstood what you were asking since I've never heard anybody do this.    That's correct usage.  You just have to take out the other person's name to see if the sentence still works. "I went to the whorehouse for a good time" versus "Me went to the whorehouse for a good time."   So take "The restaurant gave John and I a discount" -- "The restaurant gave I a discount." Clearly doesn't work, so it's "The restaurant gave John and me a discount."   Because there's not much I can do to stop smelling disgusting cigarette smoke if someone is smoking in my vicinity. It's very easy not to look at a disgusting fat person.   Read or do a crossword puzzle.   I've never encountered this. Sounds like a variation of uptalk. Where you end every sentence with a question mark? Even if it's a statement? Basically a kind of insecurity? But at this point a linguistic (?) lexical (?) trend?   When someone says "x and I" even when it's supposed to be "x and me." They're applying a rule they think they know in order to sound smart/correct, but it just makes them sound like an idiot.   I agree with this, but my concern with a close relationship is: What happens if OP and mom break up? Will OP still take the time to be a "Big Brother" to her?   I don't understand the double standard.  One possibility: Because nobody's going to ask you for tzedaka to support the guy who works but doesn't learn and his 12 children.   That's not necessarily forbidden.  http://shulchanaruchharav.com/Home-Database/default.aspx?pageid=scrubbing__shining_and_polishing2   I think you're mistaking Reddit for real life. In real life most people of any age are not libertarians.   It's because the taxes are different on wholesalers than on retailers. So it's not that they're banning resale of their goods, they're saying: If people are buying our stuff in bulk and reselling it, the taxes are their problem, not ours.   What retailers ban resale of their goods? In the US there is only the right of first sale. Once it's sold, it's not theirs anymore and they have no right to dictate what you do with it.   I don't know what you mean regarding "development, land sales, building, etc." You might want to try expanding your question and posting it to /r/australia.   This is not something anybody could possibly explain. All answers would be purely speculation.  /r/askreddit   Maybe you just haven't met the right person yet. Just because some people fall in love at the drop of a hat doesn't mean that's a good thing.   Did something happen in his life that he is taking out on your family?  Exactly what I was wondering. When my brother acted similarly at one point, I found much later that his wife had had a miscarriage and he'd been really broken up about it.   Michael Cera.   There'd be even more social media because nobody would be worried about being doxxed.   This is true, but eventually they will get old and not be so pretty and not get this kind of attention, and from what I've read, it can be devastating to their self esteem. There's a reason why some of these women go to extreme lengths with cosmetic surgery and Botox.   There is definitely a difference between a regular thermometer and a rectal one:  Rectal thermometers are often colored cherry red to differentiate them from oral or axillary thermometers, as well as having a shorter, squat, pear, or stubby bulb shape. They are not meant to be used interchangeably with other types of thermometers.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_thermometry   Only if it's a hereditary monarchy. Which not all are.  	117
 So... what's the minimum quantity?   Do you have a minimum quantity?   This would be an extremely handy feature. In a subreddit where flair is not mandatory, it could be a savior.  On /r/vine, there's a flair for unusually loud vines. But if the poster refuses to flair it properly, and a moderator never checks it, users could keep falling victim to a loud vine raping their ears.  So what if a comment that said   \#tooloud  could get automoderator to automatically flair the post or tell the moderators that the post needs flair?   Could you elaborate on sales collateral? I'm interested, but I'm not sure if that's a term I just haven't heard or something I actually wouldn't be able to do.   I'm a fresh college graduate with my bachelor's degree in graphic design.

Because with cable, you're paying for a services that presses a switch and let's you access their channels. The money you pay doesn't go to the companies who host their channels. The companies need money to maintain those channels and to maintain their slot on the sevice of the providers. The only way they can do this is for advertisers to give them money to also be on that channel.  Netflix: you pay for Internet, and you pay for content to keep Netflix funded.  Cable: you pay for cable, and advertisers pay to keep content funded.  The cable company does not put ads on each channels. They rent channels to content providers. Unless you want to donate millions of dollars to a channel's content providers to keep content ad free, you cannot complain.   Negating and destroying are two different mechanics. An effect, when activated, is not attached to the card. The best way I can put it is as follows.  Imagine each zone has a su zone that effects go into when a card is activated in that space. Even though the card may be removed or destroyed, it's separate from the effect and the effect is not influenced by what happens to the card. (The ONLY difference is continuous effects. Those cannot apply unless the card is resolved, face-up on the field, and hasn't been destroyed.)  So, to negate an effect, a card effect must specifically go after the effect to affect it. Therefor, cards that only destroy a card do not affect the effects of the cards that are activated.   Someone *did* figure it out though.   Kind of related  User karma uses color:gray... while other grays on the subreddit uses a different grey (#C6C6C6). For a bit of consistency, and easier to see user karma in header-bottom-right, changing that to #C6C6C6 would be nice too.   Oh god, thank you. Now I know she heard me.   It's actually a 22.4% grey. That's considered a light grey (below the 40-60 range).   Also, So the div.score.unvoted is at #C6C6C6 right now. That's roughly 22.4% on the grey meter. I'd recommend, if a change is implemented, raising it only slightly. Maybe to #D7D7D7 (~16%). I tested it using inspect element. It looks pretty good.  The same applies for comment karma as well. tried it out, looked fine. Althrough, I don't see a problem either way.   I'm not allowed to tell.

Proof that Hungry [==] doesn't rely on the bair essentials.   +1. Fast payment. Didn't make a fuss over tiny detail.   Emulation is typically used to play old, rare, and out-of-print games whose developers no longer make any money on. It is still technically illegal if you don't own the game, but for those who have the game but have ruined discs or their PS1 no longer works, it's not exactly the devil's work. Meanwhile, piracy in this day is more associated with obtaining recently released media for free through means other than borrowing or getting as a gift. Basically, stealing. Since the media (be it game, movie, or song) is new and still actively makes money for the publisher, it has a more significant impact on publishers.   Hence,    Half way there   "I thought you were the only tigger my nigger."   If both Metroid Prime Trilogy and Skyward Swird come in as downloadable, I'll be happy. Half way there.   It is absolutely a game worth playing. I play it over when I have the chance. Definitely play it if you get the opportunity.   Good luck. I've been trying to unload my Cyber Dragon stuff for weeks.   Too bad it's not exactly a key that sends input when pressed.   SOMETHING AROUND 55   [THIS STUFF](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOSales/comments/2srm1k/selling_everything_expect_a_huge_discount_if_you/)   I AM SO MAD THAT I CANNOT SELL MY CARDS. EVEN AT A LOSS, I JUST CANNO MOVE THEM.   The Asian Kid who got banned I believe is Josh Kwondike Bar      I've always gotten mine on eBay.   Heart of the Cards. That's pretty much yugioh incarnate.   "I could care less."  That means you do care. At least a little.   iWant   First it will roll out in al paso texes. And then to almost main 2 years later. And people just out of reach will make memes about how sad they are not having it.   You missed the point. What goes in the header is not by default or by some rule supposed to be filled with relevant characters. It was voted on by users. Not all entries just plastered modern cards into the header, and the winner could very well be a blank white hole.   Having a regular phone isn't a tragedy. The point is, NOT everybody can get and have a working smartphone with service. It's NOT as affordable as the original comment said.   I think it's worth watching. There are definitely some intense and rule-bending duels that end up being very epic. Not to mention one of Yugi's duels is simply the definition of SACK!   Even poor have smartphones? Because most "smartphones" are made on the cheap and subsidized by plans and most phones owned by the poor are nearly or severely outdated. My friends who are poor don't have smartphones, and one of them doesn't even have a phone plan.   After she complained, she probably got bribed by large corporations to keep wages the same. Then she said okay and decided to drop the issue in favor of making herself rich through corporations' so-called "contributions".   The header has never been about what deck is relevant.   Probably most definitely a bribe. At least when phones and OSX and Linux come out with new versions, it doesn't cost anything, and that's not a 1-year thing.   And it will be a free upgrade/downgrade for anyone who knows how to torrent forever.         Yeah, remember the days of the Memory card? No need to take your entire system to someone's place. Just your game and memory card. And, if your friend has the game too, you can just bring your memory card to show your progress. And if you lose the game's disc, you still have your data.   For Tellarknights, it would be Altair.   KOTOR?      I really hope she's over 18. Because if not, I'm gonna feel like a terrible pedo.   I like how my character is above all of my friend's characters.      Nope. I've had three others want it all. I have it split into three chucks which come out to around 110 dollars total. If you want it all, I'd sell it 1 chunk at a time and wait until you receive one portion before selling the next one.  So if you're still interested, PM me.   Red flag goes off in my head.   What if I told you:  Ads were around this way before they were used for revenue. Companies to not get revenue from ads in a DVD and it is easy to skip them.  To start expecting that all paid services and products should come without ads just because that's the norm digitally is flawed logic.   My friends only like Brawl because I don't practice it, so it's the only way they have a remote chance against me (as if).   Was just weirded out that someone who likes Brawl as is would be trying mods. Nothing against those who do, just didn't make sense.  Thanks for clarifying the sarcasm.  Speaking of sarcasm, Nana is so tier 0 in 3.5.   Because we love Project M. I can't imagine why people who thinks Brawl's gameplay is perfect would feel the need to try its mods when the main purpose of the mods is to change the gameplay.   Then why are you here?   I actually must disagree. I see many more characters competing with Fox/Falco/C.Falcon etc. It's just easy for Melee players to Pop over, default to fox, and make it feel like Melee+. After all, I barely see fox even win a tournament for Project M. Most of the time it's not even a Melee top tier.  Fox and Falco were not immune to nerfs in their development. I seem to remember reading that they no longer have any frames of invincibility during Shine startup and Fox's Up-smash was nerfed in 3.5. Not to mention, Falco's recovery is still noticeably worse than Melee. And as I recall, everyone thought puff was simply unviable in 3.02 because everyone's recovery was too good. But since everyone's nerfed, puff magically seems better (even though she's not any better than before).   That's assuming 100% of Wii's were sold to people who knew it was backwards compatibility AND bought it as a GameCube. I'd imagine that 70 million people who never played video games before bought a Wii because it was also a GameCube (not really). We cannot assume that anybody bought it for that soul reason since it seems only 30 million of past customers even wanted a GameCube.   The Wii didn't sell 100 million consoles because it was a GameCube. With that logic, the Gamecube should have also sold 100 million units.   start banning only cards that come a dime a dozen so that card prices never go down.   They can, but that doesn't mean they will. We have to assume that consoles that had larger install bases will have larger fanbases and more fans who want to play those games again. So, let's count how many gamecubes were sold. Now let's count how many Wiis were sold.  I thought so.   **[Link to Tutoring Thread on Yugioh101](http://www.reddit.com/r/Yugioh101/comments/2rcz9h/tutoring_thread/)**  Well, if you're looking for 1 on 1 tutoring, /r/yugioh101 is the place to get it.

Current is treated as your total feedback across all categories.   Then, you just need to not get rid of it on your own. That's what makes Imperior order a bunch of bull. You can just choose not to pay for it then use all the spells you want having still denied your opponent any on his last turn.   Fuckers ran off with my lightbulbs as soon as they got the chance.   Didn't OSX start requiring 2GB 10.7? If so, then the RAM requirement hasn't actually changed since then. Why are people suddenly finding their macs running badly?   I could not give any solid reason as to why I think they will have a better time or even a more successful launch. As it is, it really is just an expensive accessory to an already expensive phone. Well, if you want to get all of its features, you need an expensive phone. But, I think there are reasons for both Apple doing better and Apple doing worse.  Apple will likely have much better marketing. Let's face it, you would be hard pressed to find any proof of other smarteatches being marketed to consumers through consumer channels. I talk about Tv and non-tech internet sights. It will probably boast things the consumer may find useful straight to the consumer and really put it in there face. Not to mention, even non-savy consumers can follow what Apple is doing by watching events on YouTube and following places like /r/Apple. So, much more people may know about it in the first place. Regular consumers like that don't have an easy time following Samsung or Sony with their individual releases.   The. Again, Apple's watch is not much different from other smart watches feature-wise. And despite this particular watch having a dial, tracking your heart-rate, and being able to switch straps, it doesn't sound too much more intriguing than any other smart watch. Call it what you want, it is still a watch that much stay bound to your wrist out in the open to use its core features.  These are both coming from a hardcore Apple fan who would easily have all of Apple's latest gear if he could afford them.   It should be   my company's work  Not   my companies work   In my opinion, the card would simply be more balanced if it didn't allow you to keep a myriad of OP special summoned monsters while denying your opponent any kind of play.   Well, Project M has neen recognized as its own separate smash game garnering it's own fan base and competitive scene. It's a Smash game, and it's played on Wii. It's a Wii game. My friends and I are barely aware anymore that Brawl exists.   I'm not trying to play against them. I want to learn how to play ICs.   He and I are pretty equal. He can only beat me easily with ice climbers, so I have counters for that which prevent him from doing so. I want to learn them to show he's not the only one skilled enough to do so and that I can beat all his characters easily including his counters.  And I love how everyone is just questioning my motives instead of pointing me to a tutorial. Really fucking helpful.   I'm not planning to just do dittos. That'd be fucking retarded. Even if we did do dittos, it's obvious that you can't just play it like other match-ups. I want to ruin people's day against their other characters.   Because I love ruining people's day.   **Supressed "C"**  Level 3 EARTH Insect-type  When your opponent special summons a monster, you can special summon this monster to your opponent's side of the field. This card cannot be used as Xyz or Synchro material. The controller of this card cannot attack with other monsters.  ATK/800 DEF/500  ---  **Pendulum Veiler**  Pendulum Scale 9 | 9  *Spell Effect*  When this card is activated: your opponent can choose 1 Pendulum card in their Extra Deck and shuffle it into their Main Deck. If they don't, this card's Pendulum Scale becomes 1.  *Monster Stats*  Level 2 LIGHT Fairy-type monster  During either player's turn, you can discard this card: Your opponent cannot Pendulum summon this turn. Also, any Pendulum card that would be sent to the Extra Deck is Banished instead until the End Phase.  ATK/0 DEF/0   I wish my girlfriend would do the same every time I watched Frozen with her.   Because, when "smart watches" started to be announced, I never asked a single fucking person if they wanted a computer in a wrist strap that just ties to your phone with a response of "yes". But everyone I know still wishes their devices had better battery life.   Quick-Play Spell   Banish the top card of your deck. Destroy one monster your opponent controls.

I'm still looking forward to the other smash tournaments (except Brawl). If SSB, Melee, and Smash 4 are all there, I'll definitely watch those when I can. If not, I'll tune in to see them on Youtube.  This isn't the end of Project M tournaments. They'll still be around. In the mean time, we really should show Nintendo our love for the series by at least trying Smash 4 if we haven't played it already. It gets so many things right where Brawl simply got everything wrong. Really, the only thing I can say I don't like about Smash 4 is the stupid-as-hell Up+B auto-sweet-spot.  Shoutouts the Project M DT for making this awesome game for our enjoyment out of their own free time.   Oh god, I really hope Nintendo doesn't try to shut this effort down.

In the mean time, please feel free to leave feedback about the subreddit.  1. What do you think of this subreddit?  2. What do you think of the Yu-Gi-Oh! subreddit network?   Yeah, z-indexes are finicky sometimes. I hate fixing something in the z-index, put in a solution that should work and have it have absolutely no effect. Thank goodness this worked without fuss.   I see you figured out the problem with the dropdown menus. About time too. I was just about to send a solution. But, the banner ad is still appearing above the actual menu.   This should be considered the proper thing to do when people over glorify their kids like that.   I think that is why Nintendo wouldn't do it on the current generation. I'd bet that they're quietly working on closing the gap between the power of the home/mobile hardware to be affordable. Basically, it's so you wouldn't *have* to buy both the home console and mobile hardware. If you prefer one over the other, you could just pick on and stick with it.  Nobody wants to see a cross-platform release limit their game. It sucks.   Give them a max resolution, and everyone will take advantage of it (if they don't know about design and UI). Not everyone will have ads disabled, and regardless of adblockplus existing, every detail must be taken into account. I have Adblockplus and it doesn't block reddit's ads because (the way reddit's default does it), they are nonintrusive and labeled as ads in a stand-out way so people don't confuse it with an unsponsored link.  The sidebar doesn't need to pop. It's something that regular redditors know is there, and it's not going to change drastically between subreddits.  Don't have to tell me how easy opacity is. This is the stuff I went to school to learn. I have the degree to show for it, too. Now that I'm done tooting my own horn, I'm thinking of possible solutions I think might work. I'll need some time to test them. I might just cheat and look at how Konami did it in the first place. Haha.   [](/pinkamina) Mayyybeee.   ^^Someone ^^knows ^^Pinkie ^^Pie ^^is ^^my ^^favorite ^^pony   I, or any other Konami judge, know how. Feel free to PM if you can't find anyone locally.   And you would. But mobile versions of the and games would also be available on a mobile platform.   Just read a few things on PSCT and try a few times. Then ask someone who knows how to write in PSCT to proofread.   It seems Colin knows to block his name when he mentions his name but not when the other person says it.   Melee top tiers exempt from nerfs? Far from it. In Melee, Fox and Falco had a frame of invincibility on the startup of their shines which has been removed on each one. Fox's up smash was drastically reduced so that light characters don't die to him at 50% anymore on average stages. Falco's recovery sucks. That may be a part of brawl they decided to keep for one reason or another but the point still stands. Sheik's combos have been cut down from version 1.0. Marty has had tiny little changes to warrant a different playstyle. Puff, pretty much the same except with some higher knock back on some moves making her combo game much weirder to pull off if ever.  Melee top tiers are not immune to nerfs. But they're designs are bound to their Melee playstyle.  I really think that what PMDT is trying to do is use the Melee top tiers as a guidelines. If PNDT thinks all characters can be as good as Fox and Falco, then at least they should be worth a try. Heck, Hungry Box is even playing puff again. Wiz robe still plays sonic. PK Fire in shield was removed and PK flash doesn't seem to have the same power, but NZA (I take it from him since he's the best Ness I've seen) thinks Ness has actually improved overall.  Just because a character is needed one way does not mean that they are worse. All changes to a character should be taken into account. Everyone can basically live longer against Melee top tiers despite their needed recoveries.   This time, can we seriously cut down on the banner height? I'm on a 1080p screen and the banner and the somewhat tall menu take up the first 40% of the screen. Reddit's defaults only take up the first 20%.  And, instead of having alternating themes/banners, runner-ups can be used in the other subreddits such as /r/ygosales and /r/ygobinders and /r/yugiohfeedback. That way we get representation from more than just 1 designer.  Also, still seriously not liking the side-bar. Colors make sense, except for yellow on white which is hard to read. But buttons are simply much bigger than usual buttons and I seems to notice a high reliance on shadows for depth effects. Not exactly an element that Konami uses if we're trying to emulate their look and feel.  The dropdowns on the dropdown menus also seem to have a bit too much transparency. (same goes for the tabmenu.) On pages like these with a lot of text near the menus, the words will be painful to look at. That background making the arrow pointing right should also have a hover property so it looks like it's a complete element. Otherwise, it looks incomplete, or even like an oversight.  (Yes, I'm really going to make a fuss over the UI of this place.)  [Image](http://i.imgur.com/DgdX1rT.png) In here, after the banner ad, half of my screen is taken up. Good UI gets the information to the user and gets out of the way without intruding significantly on the experience. Default reddit CSS doesn't take up nearly as much space (even with the banner ad, it takes up less space than our header alone).  	128
 This post on flexbox taught me almost everything. It is a very well explained article with excellent visual examples.    align-items: center;   I'm finishing up a project that works on every screen size with flexbox that has only 2 media queries to detect whether you are in portrait or landscape mode. It's crazy.       Adobe is trying some neat things with edge animate.   I agree in that this is something I would do as well, however I can respect someone for creating something useful to keep them focused and immersed in their work and sharing it. I can never learn that lesson. For example, here I am on reddit again instead of finishing the last 25% of that mindmap I've been putting off.   All of tech feels that way for everyone eventually. Before the internet we used to animate stuff in [Macromedia Director](http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-Director-Dummies-Computer-Tech/dp/0764502247) because every serious business gave out presentation CD's at trade shows. Then the internet came around and prodigy wasn't fast enough for 600 megabyte movie files, which is seriously all the space you are ever going to need my 17-year-old self from the past is trying to remind me.  I don't know what existed before Director. Probably the solitary madness of nothing.   Reddit is amazing.

   I remember reading this ''theory'' in the internet a long ago. It just came into my mind today, then I thought it is worth to share with this subreddit.   Ok, by first we need to remember one thing: our brain is *old*. But, what does it means old? It means that, after all our evolution as *Homo sapiens*, we still share the same brain *instincts* with our folks of 20.000 years ago. Yes, in our civilized lives of today, they may be even more hidden in our often occupied minds, but the thruth is: we, as a species, act more by instinct than we think.    An example that shows how we act by instinct is when we feel attracted to a person. The fact that you felt attracted by that woman in the other side of the street isn't just because she is gorgeous. This is your instincts acting man! When you looked at her, your instincts *tell* you that she could be a capable female that will give you healthy offspring, and this healthy children will be able to expand your genes to the world. This is a great mark that shows how we act as *animals*, even in a such civilized world.    But, not escaping from the topic: what does the instincts that we still share with our 20.000 years old folks has to do with the casual sightings of ghosts? This can be explained by this example:    Imagine you're a caveman, 20.000 years ago. It is night, and from the deep of the jungle, you rear a *crack*. You move to the entrance of your cave and try to see, in the pitch black, what has done that sound. Now let's imagine that, what made the sound is a tiger, that followed you to your cave, and that failed in a sneak attack. You can't see nothing and you have no idea what is out there.     Now, the thing is: your **unconscious** feels that you are in danger and that he needs to do something to avoid this. The unconscious then, *creates* a image in the pitch black, trying to fool you that there is something out there and that you need to RUN. This is the instincts acting, the instinct of *danger*. When our unconscious feels that our body is in danger, he is able to do those certain things. Now just adjust this example for the actual scenario:    You're home alone and hear a noise. At this point, our unconscious starts detecting that we *might* be in danger. You start feeling uneasy and nervous, this is just a boost to our unconsious to think that we are really in danger. People often say that they saw something moving in the end of a corridor and things of the sort, but this is just our unconscious acting.     For a resume, the things that we often resemble as ghosts are just our brain trying to protect us from a possible danger.      Edit: I'll just like to add that: this theory is not for debunking stories and this sort of thing. I love paranormal stories. I just wrote this to try to clear that many casual sightings are caused by this brain activity, and should not be confused with ghosts.   So sorry m8, saw thes video, got so excitd, posted on reddit ayyy lmao   Ah sheit      What's I spy by the way?   Shadow of the colossus. If not the best game ever, it is certainly the best PS2 game.

The best way to get over a relationship that didn't worked quite right is being open for new ones.   Absolutely.      I live in the 6th floor of an building, and she in the 3rd floor. We have very similar schedules, for this reason I always find myself in the elevator with her. In the short time we are there, we stay in silence, just summarizing in a ''bye'' after the elevator reaches a certain level where one of us has to exit.   I really need ideas of how to start a conversation with her, related to our building, her apartment or even college...     TL;DR: Ideas for a conversation opener with a girl I only see in a short time in the elevator.  	10

Sally Eaton-Magaa, Jeffrey E. Post, Peter J. Heaney, Jaime Freitas, Paul Klein, Roy Walters and James E. Butler  Abstract  Sixty-seven natural blue diamonds, including the two largest such gemstones known (the Hope and the Blue Heart), were probed by ultraviolet radiation, and their luminescence was analyzed using a novel spectrometer system. Prior to this study, the fiery red phosphorescence of the Hope Diamond was regarded as quite rare compared to greenish-blue phosphorescence. However, our results demonstrated that **virtually all blue diamonds phosphoresce** at 660 nm (orange-red) but that this emission often is obscured by a concomitant luminescence at 500 nm (green-blue). Although both bands were nearly always present, the relative intensities of these emissions and their decay kinetics varied dramatically. Consequently, phosphorescence analysis provides a method to discriminate among individual blue diamonds. Treated and synthetic blue diamonds showed behavior distinct from natural stones. Temperature-dependent phosphorescence revealed that the 660 nm emission has an activation energy of 0.4 eV, close to the 0.37 eV acceptor energy for boron, suggesting that the phosphorescence is caused by donor-acceptor pair recombination.  	3

It may sound stupid but I don't know how it works.   It is but at the same time I agree with him/ Although on this occasion, CDR isn't a big developer so they probably didn't have the capacity to optimize it for each console.

You can build a PC for the same price as a console. But let's be honest here, who would actually want to play with it? Who would not fork out the extra cash to upgrade a few components? And there lies the problem with PC gaming, it is a never ending hole which you keep chucking your money into. I buy my console once, and for the entirety of that consoles life I will be able to play all the games they release for it, you won't. At some point a game will be released where you need certain amount of RAM or w/e and you will have to buy it on top of the game you are buying it for. I just don't see it worth the time and money just to play with better graphics and mods.   360?? Please provide me with a full list of components and prices cause quite frankly I don't believe you. An i7 processor alone sets you back nearly a couple of hundred.   If you got a decent PC to start off with, OP doesn't.   But Beams fueled by the sun can't melt Steel beams fueled by the sun!

Or buy a PC which for every new game that comes out you need some new component to run it because you have the wrong graphics card or not enough RAM to run that particular game. If you're looking for an easy and user friendly gaming experience stick to console, that's what they're made for.   A PC will set you back a lot more than a console. no matter what anyone says it's just not true that gaming PC is cheaper than a console. Yes you could build a gaming PC on the cheap but you will be on the lower end of performance and will eventually end up buying more and more components to upgrade your PC to handle the next game that comes out. Where as a console will run any game for the reminder of it's life.   This is one of the major issues I have with the game. He can take a bitch slap from a full grown Griffin yet can survive more than a 6 foot drop. I just don't get it. Brilliant game otherwise.   [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to video.   Boobs.   That's weird, I'm from a completely different continent and I thought the right side looked friendlier.   2 rekt's one comment. Classy.   I know how the internet works. A lot of people don't look at the link right away. Not everyone can be as intelligent as you because you've taken up all the brain powers, share some with us common people please madam..   Well there goes the joke.      ....no you didn't. Repost! *grabs pitchfork*   Am I too late??   The Government.   Repost no.4 in a week.   pooposal.   Oh. Bulls. Nice   Yes I know now. Please read entire comment thread before replying, thanks.   Yes I know, it was indeed me who had skipped an entire game. My bad.   And that boys and girls is why the chicken ended up flying from a kick into the neighbours yard.   You're all wrong because the equation is wrong. Maybe I don't know I got a C in maths.   So I can has Cheetah? Awesomeness.   Damn it man, just let me die in peace!!   *drools* mmmmmm serious hardwareee.   Was this interview on film by any chance?? You know for fap material.   Fair enough but be honest, a lot of people (including me) didn't know there was one before Redemption so calling it 3 would be a mistake IMO. A lot of people would think they had missed out on a game.    If I could single handedly kill mobile gaming I wouldn't even hesitate to do so. You guys do not understand how much a loathe mobile fucking gaming. The reason being my god damn friends.   Every fucking chance they get they are glued to their fucking screens playing some new and normally retarded game in which all you do is tap or swipe, currently it's MK X. The reason I hate it so much is because it is non-stop, literally any second they have they will be on their phones ignoring every one around them. The worst part is when we are in my house playing xbox, when it's not their turn to play instead of watching the others play and provide some conversation they will bring out their fucking phones to play those stupid fucking games whilst waiting to play another game. It's fucking sickening and I'm really raging against mobile games atm so much that a lot of what I've said doesn't even makes sense. **RAGEEEEEEE** I wish I could punch the creator of candy saga in the face, that bitch/bastard started it all.   Fair enough just realised, but if they were to release a sequel I'm guessing it would be a sequel to Redemption since that was the big hit game. The other is pretty much unheard of and will only confuse the buyers.   I didn't know you could buy helmets!   Why did you skip to 3 if 2 doesn't exist?   Ummm, you skipped a entire game.   The hair bounce effect adds a lot to the old style of animation, even on Maggies hair when she pops out of the bag.   "Your Friends a Dick"   Without music she just looks retarded. Hot but retarded.   I never heard of Witcher until this game and no I don't think it's necessary to play the game. So far I have understood a lot about what's going on. What I suggest you do is read the little booklet that comes with the game. It gives you some decent backstory. The only problem I've encountered so far is a part of dialogue which I had to recall what I did in certain events in the prior games, I just winged it.   I like that though, normally on other games on the harder difficulty enemies just become sponges. Glad they took this route instead.   That's because there isn't one in White Orchard It's in Velen, the next town you visit after White Orchard.   .....well son of bitch!   Dude, side quests!! I did the Eneternal Fire Priest side quest in Velen yesterday and got 200 coins and is was incredibly easy.   How though?? every time Roach nears any edge the little bitch gets spooked.   The Aard Sign is also pretty useful for big groups of enemy's.   4 Hours? try 3 days..   This is exactly the reason I hated english classes. It's always like religion, looking for stuff that isn't there.   I hate it how my mum always decides to cut onions **everytime** something sad is shown on the TV.   Touche!   The one I used to play with my friend was Dynasty Warrior 7, worth a look if you liked the others.   I started it on blood and bones but then I realized I'm a bit of a Noob to the Witcher series so I slid that baby down to Story and Sword. Hopefully in a few days once I get chance to sit down and play for more than a couple of hours I will be able to slide that bar back up.   Dynasty Warrior Games!!   Edit: Oh right Gamecube, don't know if they did it for that console.   If years of soccer moms haven't tarnished the name of GTA I highly doubt the BBC mockumentry will. BBC shows like this actually end up being quite good, take [Come Fly With Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Fly_with_Me_%282010_TV_series%29) for example.   Don't get me wrong I'm an avid gamer more so than a TV viewer so I'm still backing Rockstar on this but it does feel like another Redditor said. Rockstar is just doing this so people know they are not invloved.   The other cat wasn't even attacking, what a pussy!.   The days of bros before hoes are truly behind us.   I predict you will have a bad and soggy morning.   Its the internet nobody cares about some d bag sitting in his moms basement correcting random peoples spelling and grammar so he or she can feel superior for once.   nbsp;  It's Reddit, everybody cares about that awesome individual sitting in their parents basement correcting random people's' spelling and grammar so he or she can bask in their superiority.   Needs more fire to be Michael Bay approved.   I guess Pumba had just arrived at the watering hole.   I like to think he just really wanted some cuddles.   /u/Konwayz In case you haven't seen this, you were right.   Is moments like these that I'm glad I started Redditing.   Maybe she shouldn't have the haircut of a 70 year old?? but idk that just may be me.   It's nearly the weekend man, cheer up! Also no, the guy had a question so he asked the community for an answer, that's how it works.   For me it was dying light, now this. Seems like next-gen is starting to actually kick in now.   You can change the control scheme for swimming if you see yourself being in the for quite some time.   Wii U, dont over think it and just go for it. That console was made for coach co-op unlike the other consoles which are slowly but surely removing coach co-op all together.   Wow dude, on OP's behalf **Fuck You**. You're exactly the type of person the gaming community **doesn't** need.   This Gabe guy sounds like a dick, maybe even an asshole but most certainly not a pussy.    I got the game on the release date and I still haven't left White Orchard. Just finished yesterday clearing all the ? marks plus monster nests etc and now I'm finally ready to continue on with the adventure. Amazing game, can't wait to go home today and also long weekend this weekend, the stars have aligned.    I do remember that. I also remember how hard it was to catch that bastard but that was part of the story though. I wasn't aware there were a whole bunch of shinies in the game.   Well look at you riding pretty on that high Roach.   I downloaded a need for speed game form EA access. I drove in total 200 meters, crashed into many walls whilst unwillingly drifting all over the place. I quit and deleted that shit fast. Not sure if driving sims have ruined arcade driving games for me or that game is just complete an utter bullocks.   Really?? Those were my favourite and I never realised this.   I've been meaning to ask. WTH is Circa??   In GTA V Online My character is always wearing a Raccoon mask so I wanted to name him The Coon. Needless to say it wasn't allowed and it took me about a month to realize why.   ohhh I see, or more like I don't see ;)   I like to think all people in the future speak like that.   I just hope they don't lose the magic of this first season by blasting us with high end sfx.   I bet you feeling pretty stupid right about now.   NSFW?? I guess, if you work at a children's nursery.   He cannot vibrate out. The prison was built for meta humans, he is essentially a meta human. How are people not understanding this??   That scene was fucking heart breaking.   First thing that came to mind was"....Dude, just cut your nuts off". Then I contemplated a life without nuts and realised why he killed himself.   How about that giant robot foot?? What was that, any ideas?? I'm not well versed in the comics.   I actually teared up during that scene. God damn it I'm a man!!   His username is Floyd Mayweather Jr. Floyd Mayweather Jr as we all know on reddit can not read. Can't believe no one got it.   Next-gen sequel, just to make it clear.   OH CRAP I've been duped. I know owe my life to /u/notasinglenamegiven. Well played..  	111
 Can anyone help me out with an invite?   Advertise it within other waterpolo fourms, websites, outlets? I personally would enjoy this sub to grow to what it deserves.  	2
 It's these posts that remind me, and I reckon that's a good thing.  I miss my Dad, yet I only have to watch a game to hear him.  I didn't know that love lasts longer than life, till he was gone.   :)   Miss mine too, the smiley bollox ;)     My guess is Monday will lead to a few more. Though the voting for who is on it will just start again, and then there will be a new government majority.   If it was just going to be a chance to tarnish FF with the details, you'd imagine Enda wouldn't be too bothered about the panel's make-up. So I'm guessing there are a few shameful deeds from the current government that need to brushed under the carpet.  He's like a school-teacher who has been given the troublesome students, and now doesn't want anyone to know they've gotten worse under his watch.   Good read  Mr Donnelly warned that Taoiseach Enda Kenny can now set the inquiry's terms of reference, decide who is questioned, exclude certain events from consideration and **even veto the final report.**  I wish someone would find definitive evidence that Enda was in league with Alan Shatter over Garda cover-ups, then we could have a GE sooner rather than later.  Do we have to wait for a full omni-shambles, like Cowen's government, before we get there?    Well shit Tony, you probably shouldn't have hitched your political legacy to [establishing new 'faith' schools](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/02/education.labour).  You've got to be gobsmacked by someone who creates a new local problem but then tries tells everyone the problem is a global, not-invented-here, one.  He's a new definition for 'punch-magnet'.      It's a pity, but then this inquiry has been turned into a shambles.  Imagine how much in-fighting there's going to be later at the report stage when even the terms of reference garner so much political bullshit.  I wonder will the 'lost' bank guarantee documents ever turn up? They're bound to be in a German government office somewhere.   For some context, the writer Paul Williams was named in the Dil, by TD Joan Collins, as someone who had their penalty points wiped.  It's also curious that the "Dublin-based security consultant" he cites remains anonymous throughout the article.  I think this [caricature](http://i2.wp.com/www.rabble.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-10-at-13.28.49.png?resize=640%2C651) does him justice.      Calm down there Nora, ya crazy breeder.  /oops      I'm not sure either way if McGuiness overstepped the bounds of his role by suggesting resignations. I imagine he's supposed to wait till the PAC produces its report. Though that sounds extremely frustrating.  Anyway, is there not an equivalency between McGuinness 'politicising' the PAC, and Enda unilaterally creating a majority on the Banking Inquiry terms-of-reference panel?  Surely if McGuinness is at fault, then Enda is too?  Am I getting this wrong or has Enda reached new bionic-asshole levels of hypocrisy?                  I reckon the raw data would be needed to be certain, plus won't the next Dil have less TDs? I wonder if that has been factored in.   Up at the top and in the middle column:  "Past vote weighted and adjusted for spiral of silence" which I'm assuming is what point #5 in the first slide means.  "weighting back 50% undecided to how they voted in past elections" - They looked at previous polls and examined how the "Don't knows" ultimately voted in previous general elections and then added that trend into the results. So the difference between the number of first preferences in the new poll and the final seat tally is a combination of the new poll's data weighted for the likely decisions of the "Don't knows" on election day.   I think it's mentioned on the first slide at the link, [bullet #4 about weighting](http://i1.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article3680082.ece/alternates/s2197/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-125037.png) the results based on previous poll data.  Also, the fourth slide shows how they extrapolated this new poll data to likely general election seats.      But without looking at 'effective' tax rates how would we know the reductive impact of loop-holes on multi-nationals' tax rates?   Well that's one way to look at it, here's another:  [Ireland could be in for a windfall, if multinationals here are found to be paying less than their fair share of corporation tax, but the country could also face losing its attraction for such global giants.](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/multinational-tax-regime-under-threat-from-eu-271338.html)  And at 12.5%, we would still be more attractive than many other EU countries. We would also create some breathing room for Irish companies that want to compete with multi-nationals.   Yeap, over [7 years](http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/google-pays-just-014-tax-in-seven-years-28945199.html) that's all they paid.   Enda said   our legislation is very strong and **ethically implemented** and we will defend that robustly.  How are effective tax rates ethical when Irish companies pay 12.5% while it's 0.14% for Google and 3.7% for Apple? How is it ethical for an Irish government to treat Irish companies with this disadvantage?  We can't compete in these areas because of the huge advantage given to these companies. If an Irish government wants a vibrant, successful home-grown IT sector - then don't stack the deck against them.  Irish companies employ the vast majority of people in Ireland 70%. That's the sector we should be helping.  edit: The official press release for the investigation - http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-663_en.htm        Mr Justice Cooke found as not convincing the accounts that an **wireless AV remote control device for audio and video equipment in GSOC** was connecting and transferring data to an external Bitbuzz hotspot in a nearby caf.  So that was the type of wireless device everyone was wondering about - a remote. And GSOC were certain they'd no Wifi devices in their office. Did they not know the equipment came with a wifi remote? Why were Verrimus worried about it then? It's good to have the report done,  better have a look at [all of it](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2014/06/gsoc-report-final-redacted.pdf) though.  edit - Plenty to read in there:  9.81. The Commissioners expressed the view that the suggestions made in the Rits Report seeking to undermine the Verrimus Reports are not credible. Furthermore, **the series of third party efforts made to influence the evidence to be given to the Inquiry by Verrimus are unexplained and of concern.** They expressed the view that There is no credible expert opinion that disputes the existence of the threats identified by Verrimus.  Well, it looks like getting Rits involved was the BS move many thought it was.       Oh, I'd forgotten about that. Cheers!      Update: Will be discussed at cabinet tomorrow.  http://www.thejournal.ie/gsoc-bugging-report-to-be-debated-by-cabinet-tomorrow-1506932-Jun2014/      They'd have to teach Enda how to use encryption first, and I'm guessing they gave up on that.   ["Whilst local laws do not expressly prohibit disclosure, **we asked the authorities for guidance and have been** informed that we cannot disclose this information."](http://www.thejournal.ie/vodafone-government-refusals-makey-uppy-law-1502972-Jun2014/)       There are quite a few decisions that the Irish Data Protection Commissioner should be ashamed of, then again his government isn't investing in his position or powers.  As we can see from [the opulent office](http://www.thedata.co/sites/thedata.co/files/u1/Irish_Data_Protection_Comissioner.png) they gave him outside Dublin, in Portarlington.  This is where the data protection law compliance of Google, Facebook et al are supervised.  It's no wonder the law is changing.   No, the Irish Government prevented Vodafone from releasing the data.   It's like there was a wilful misinterpretation of Jesus' "suffer the little children" - he did not mean to make children suffer.  What kind of fucking 'christians' were these people?       Yeah, the amount of suspicious certs Convergence warns about is scary.   BT and Vodafone/C W also operate extensive long distance optical fibre communications networks throughout the UK, installed and paid for by GCHQ, NSA, or by a third and little known UK intelligence support organization called the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC).  I imagine you mean activities like the above. I'm not claiming they're beyond reproach - but we don't see O2, Eircom etc. rushing to tell us how many requests they receive. Vodafone wanted to give us more info, it's the Irish government that stopped them.   Here's another link:  http://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/niallodowd/no-surprise-irish-babies-of-single-mothers-were-guinea-pigs-for-drug-testing-101214329-238042041.html  again, please forgive source   Considering Vodafone have volunteered this info, I think they're trying to warn people that there's more going on than we know.   But will the government let you know every last detail about what they're up to? No.  So why give them an advantage when they won't return the favour?  Look at our Garda, do you think they'll only check phonecalls because they genuinely have a reason for the search or also because there's a cover-up made easier that way?  You seem quite happy to let the government have a good snoop at people's lives if they think they should. What makes you think you can trust them?   .. or If you've nothing to hide then why are they already looking at you?  or If they've nothing to hide then why aren't we looking at them?  Privacy isn't becoming a big issue, it always was a big issue, as well as a human right. People don't need privacy just to hide criminal acts. They need it for dignity, to avoid blackmail, to keep trade secrets and to protect their friends   family.  Run your life with as little of it as possible if it means that little to you. You can start with your real name   address right here :)   Be one with the [flow](http://a.gifb.in/072011/1310386317_corgi_on_a_swing.gif), then they will come.   From: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/06/vodafone-reveals-secret-wires-allowing-state-surveillance       He's texting on his nokia, isn't he?!   Certainly, and we can't all become experts in every field - so we rely on news outlets to at least do some hours of research before coming to conclusions.  It's probably not an example of sinister politics but these 'lazy journos' will become unwitting stooges if they (or we) don't cop on.  e.g.  RT: "Analysis of the cases shows people treated for this infection **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"  thejournal.ie: "People treated for VTEC **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"  The original [HSE report](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Campaigns/wellsepa.html): "**Analysis of cases shows that people treated for VTEC are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"  There's nothing wrong with quoting a report, but they both seem to avoid it.  Interestingly enough, the HSE report cites its own sources which in [2009](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/Factsheet/) makes no specific mention of private water-wells as a vector (though this coincides with the EPA's reporting period of its 30% claim) while another HSE source from [Oct 2013](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/VTECandwater/) - leads to a claim that "Untreated private water supplies are an important method of spread: VTEC patients are **3 or 4 times more likely** to consume untreated well or other private water than people who do not develop VTEC".  Nevermind the statistical weirdness of comparing VTEC via one vector versus those with no infection, rather than those with VTEC infections via other means.  Anyway, it looks like vague reporting based on skimmed reports compounded by out-of-date and conflicting reporting periods. May as well throw in political interference, it's a mess anyway.   Aye, Air Quality measurement and reporting was my job for a while.  There's no chance I would have kept the job by asserting dangers with data that old.  At best I think these reports are overstating a known issue, at worst I think they're serving a viewpoint that does not have any current evidential support.  What I do believe is certain is that RT   the.journal et al have copy and pasted rather than spend an hour or two looking at the source data / reports.  I think the OP is on point with regard to a 'lazy journalism' approach from RT etc.  Is it on point with regard to a politically vested interest, who knows? In RT's case it wouldn't be the first time.  I don't think these concerns should be dismissed automatically.    Pity it's not a water quality report.   Room-temp fusion, or GTFO   Ya won't have the advantage of interpretive dance though ;)   In fairness, it's not like they'll pay for the parking themselves.   Would seem like a stretch, wouldn't it? As for the EPA, I've no clue - but RT toeing the government line is not a new feature. They'll just do what they're told.  Hard to credit 5 year old data being so worthy of attention though, especially considering that private wells are not the main source of VTEC infections.  I'm sure there will be barbeque / food-safety PSAs soon which will address the major source.   T is best news agency, was once only agency - those were days my friend.  Children were cattle, cattle were profit, bullshit was money and the church was wealthy.   Very possibly, though we don't know how much the water will cost per litre yet ;)  Though for [the numbers](http://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/want-to-dodge-water-bills-with-a-well-heres-the-drill-30053308.html), it's around 4,500 to 5,000 - you can get a grant which will cover no more than 2,031.58. So around 3,000 all in.  If water charges are at the estimated 420 per year, then ~7 years using as much water as you like! Of course if the water charges go up, then it would take less time to recoup the investment. Plus it won't have that taste of treatment.   Based on data from 2007 to 2009, strange that it's news now.   Cheers, though the E.Coli. data has no context for the likely contamination vector. Plus the EPA's data covers 2007-2009, strange that it's in the news now.  I'm calling bullshit on this one. Well-water is undoubtedly a contributory source but by no means **the** only source of concern. It's not even the main source of infection, that would be food.   There was a u-turn on that one after the uproar:  http://www.freedominfo.org/2013/11/irish-minister-changes-course-on-fees-for-foi-requests/  I'm sure they'll try again when they think no-one's looking.    I've been looking around for the report that's mentioned but can't find it at:  http://www.epa.ie/water/dw/hhinfo/   Does anyone know where it is?   They've been in a sputtering phase for a while:  http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-fall-of-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-death-of-republican-ideas/279955/   Though preventing Europe from acting as a bloc will always be on the US wish-list, regardless of the think-tank.   Yeah, I think it's a sponsored piece by Vodaphone. Which I notice the Irish Times has in its 'Sponsored Section' while the gang in the Irish Examiner have in its main news section, cheeky.   The moves are said to have caused outrage among newsroom staff who argue that the unpredictable nature of news gathering often means last-minute taxis have to be booked.  Or buy some second-hand cars with the savings from not getting taxis and flying first   business class. You know, rocket science.         Just as well (hurr) I get mine checked every year.  Calm down Volvic, it's purer than yours.   Among the cables specifically identified in one document as currently being intercepted or on cover are an Irish connection, **Hibernia Atlantic**, landing in Southport, and three European connections landing at Yarmouth, Dover, and Brighton.  Which I imagine is this [Hibernia Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia_Atlantic), who provide "financial customers and the trading community low-latency routes to financial exchanges and data centers" and it's all starting to make sense now why they're tapped.   Cool agus groovy, but keep it down.   Apologies, did upvote it! I just couldn't resist the quote when I read it today - summed up the problems in one go.      Sounds like complete BS, but every group has its idiots   If it's the 'local lunatics' you mean - then my town has a few plastic-bag men. They just walk around most days, frequently with a plastic-bag that has little or nothing in it. Though perhaps it's for company or purpose on the huge amount of walking they all do.  There's probably a business opportunity there for people who need their dogs walked, and for these poor souls to have better company on their walks, plus a bit of canine therapy.  I think the Fall had a song about them, 'Carrier-Bag Man', decades later they're still going around.   You'd imagine the Data Protection Commissioner has already looked at it.  /whoamikidding      You'd have to be really thirsty to trust that.      Angel(in)a Merkel?      http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/bilderberg-2014-roundup-privacy-transparency-and-birkin-bags       Robert Zubrin does pieces on politics as well as manned Mars missions? Did not know.   Here's a recipe:  http://www.cashelblue.com/official-recipe/cashel-blue-steak-and-chips/    Which is one part of voting for the EPP I don't understand, from the above link:  * Strengthening of the common immigration and asylum policy and integrating immigrants  Voting for an EPP candidate means increasing the chances that someday immigration is dealt with by a central, federal authority - not nationally.  A possibility I imagine a lot of FG voters wouldn't like.  We can see it in France where the huge vote for the Front National stemmed from this very issue. Marine Le Pen has made stopping further EU integration her #1 priority because she believes the EU will take that national immigration decision away.  Front National scare me much more than the EPP, though I reckon a lot of people in Ireland would want to keep immigration decisions at the national level just like FN do - yet have voted EPP anyway.   Let's cut to the [real reason Enda](https://i.imgur.com/5HcjHTD.jpg)   Bring O'Reilly a few coffees will ya?   Yeah, that seems to be the issue.  And there's raw data on the site, so back later ...  edit:  So a quick little copy   paste of the raw data excluding city councils, http://pastebin.com/cfDCq00d, and Meath's spend per capita is the lowest in the country!! It must be the lack of people, historical attractions or vast distance from Dublin.  If there's a better place to post excel sheets, please let me know.   Ah, my mistake.  However Monday or no, the country expects appropriate apostrophes.   Jaysus, Meath underspend on **every** category compared to the national average. Housing, environment   recreation all seem to have the most underspend - which makes sense when you go around the place.  That said my local town is much improved during this period of austerity. It's hard to believe the state it was in while the boom era money flowed. Goes to show how much mismanagement was going on and more to be done apparently.   Oh very true, but as long as the survey was carried out properly - it is better than guessing.   Enda, back to 'work'   I wonder if that question was rephrased to 'do you support further transfer of competencies to Europe' what the answers would have been like?  There's so many good findings in that report, I wouldn't have expected a greater portion of FF voters against same-sex marriage than FG for instance - though the country overall is in favour.   Remind yourself to always read the question two or three times before starting your answer.  Also, the initial surge in adrenalin / panic at the start of an exam subsides after ~15 mins. So if you spend the first 15 mins, checking the questions you're going to answer and preparing them. You should feel much calmer for the rest of it.

Plus a proper tree surgeon will be able to see a way to thin the trees, if the trees' shapes allow.  So the height could be more or less kept but enough space cleared to provide light - possibly a dappled light.   I hope you lose ya gobshite, and maybe just maybe you will:  TV3, represented by Marcus Dowling BL, opposed the application. It was argued the  Minister, in seeking to amend his claim, was seeking to "gloss over" serious factual  inaccuracies in his original statement of claim. These inaccuracies had not been properly explained by the Minister, counsel added.  Mr Justice Paul Gilligan ruled the Minister was entitled to amend his statement of claim. The case will be listed for hearing before a Judge and jury at a future date.      He does give off an aura of being at 'arms length' from the seedy side.  Yet then there's Denis O'Brien, Chris Dodd   the SI, O'Reilly's health centre locations vs Roisn Shorthall ... he's not shy about political favours   If Alan Shatter's shenanigans get linked to Enda, that could be sooner rather than later.   such certainty    There's probably still enough push in a regular door to see an envelope get to the Isle of Man.   I'll go with Mint as well, the KDE version for added eye candy.      You're not wrong.  Meanwhile Sherlock, a TD for Cork East, has re-entered the race having **earlier this week ruled himself out** of both the leader and deputy leadership contests.  I want to [be] part of the process of renewal of this party, he said in a statement.  To do that I feel that the position of deputy leader will allow me to assist to rebuild the organisation.   I believe I have the energy and the capability to try this agenda with a new party leader and I look forward to the election taking place.  http://www.thejournal.ie/alan-kelly-labour-leader-bid-1491106-May2014/  He sounds like a boiler-plate covering letter for a job application, and the infinitives - ahhhh.      So we know Callinan covered-up the problems in the Garda, we know Alan Shatter failed in his duty to investigate those problems (negligence or cover-up) plus that they were close professionally and now all that's left is what Enda knew and did?  That's the whole deal here, isn't it?  If Enda can be linked to the cover-ups / negligence of Callinan  /or Shatter his position as Taoiseach would be very shaky.

 Just making sure the record is straight on who went to who. Good luck on your season.   [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/2j25tb/at_least_now_i_can_feel_my_browns_hate_flowing/cl7sba6)   [And Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/2j25tb/at_least_now_i_can_feel_my_browns_hate_flowing/cl7szql)   And this got downvoted to heck. Case in point. Thanks for the side bar. looks great. Also, That dude on the other thread who deleted all of his posts, yeah, that guy was spouting off about reporting everyone to the Browns mods, and to the reddit mods. Good luck with the rest of your season, all.   I think the Green Bay Packers and the Bears might be longer, but ours is far, far, far more brutal and almost as long.   And most of the trolling I saw was on the thread that was named "At least I can feel my Browns hate again" which made me think it was a place for some trash talk when I saw what folks were saying. And I went total brat-mode, but I wasnt derogatory.    Browns fan here. Totally bantering, but as a rule I try not to ever vote on other teams lists, and I havent thrown a slur, but some really aggro people from this list go to instantly accusing folks of "Vote Brigading" (which is a cool term I had never heard before) even though some of us follow reddiquette. Not saying I havent voted, just that I vote consciously and not to just punish a post, and I reiterate: I try to follow a rule of not voting on other subs. But are we really telling on each other and getting in a twist? We are telling the REDDIT MODS? Really? We are supposed to be like Goku and Vegita. (We're Goku) and we love to hate each other, and we take our lumps from each other, and we do it with pride and honor. *EDIT I can hate you, but I actually tell other teams fans when they get shitty about you guys, that they need to shut their mouths, because they dont know you well enough to hate you like that.* Come on. Brothers who kick the shit out of each other, but going to mom and tattling? We're better than that. Let's handle things in house and just duke it out when need be. Buck up. You've done this 18 of the last 20 times. That being said: Why isnt the sidebar changed for our bet? *Edit: And I upvoted this thread*   I just tried it out with some of the Pork I am cooking, and it got done in around an hour and a half at 350. Redux was chardonnay. Mirepoix was carrot, garlic, and mushroom (onion allergy coming to the event and didnt have celery) and then did a Bouquet Garni of thyme rosemary and sage. It turned out amazing. I have a picture on my phone that WONT UPLOAD. Thank you all for your help. I'll try to share some pics in an update after the event!

LOL](http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/2j25tb/at_least_now_i_can_feel_my_browns_hate_flowing/cl7szql)   Mine came in the bedroom and said "Celebrate?" and then we did.   Check out the thread entitled "At least I can feel my Browns hate flowing again" Very funny, and somewhat heart warming to have a rivalry REALLY happening over there.   This thread is titled "At least I can feel my Browns hate flowing again" [I'm helping.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/052/012/helping.png)    Because folks say he seems like Brady in the way he dissects a defense, but he is the polar opposite of Brady in that he connects with a SHIT TON of long passes. imo   Dont you guys have a sidebar bet to deal with? I think our Mods have probably figured out what they want. Good game, y'all! Welcome back to the rivalry.    Well, that's like your opinion, man. You really brought Harrison back? I mean, I like Cribbs and all, but...   Facts!   that hot air held the ball aloft for 31 points. Loser ass Cleveland Browns and their score of 58-13 in the last 6 quarters against the Steelers.    Today was actually a BLAST to watch, imho.    I think it was when Turkey Jones dropped Bradshaw (bless his heart)   *Or r/steelers, whatever*         Oh my god and goddess this is amazing.   He's on my team and my name needs to reflect his awesomeness. Totally scabber ChristianMingoDOTcom, but I run Hoyer every week, and I never run the CLE Defense. Suggestions?   I think Williams just got hurt stopping Brown.   This. ^^   *Sips his iced vanilla soy latte with no whip* There just isnt enough of a sample size to truly say that Brian Hoyer isn't a fluke. He just doesn't have the arm strength to be anything but a game manager. *burns his lip and spills his latte on his lap*   Derp dee derp derp derp.   Nice try, Leon.   The kitchen has a full steam pan serving area, and my plan is to have it come out right at 20 minutes before doors open for dinner.   I like this idea. I am guessing Braising is going to be the way to go. It will be my first venture into braising, which explains why I didn't know how to do this without help. I like this idea. I have to keep it soy free and gluten free, so it will be a corn starch or arrowroot thickener. Wine might be a good idea. It was going to be Rosemary for one, and Thyme Parsley for the other meal and then all three for the third meal. (Keeping it as simple as possible for on site cooking)   The beef is top round, and the pork is whole leg. I have access to steam tables. I want to get it done as close to serving time as possible. And thank you for y'alls time. *edit spelling and thank you*   We are doing a harvest festival and I am in charge of the kitchen. Instead of cutting the meat small, I have cut the meat in large, rustic chunks of about 2-2 1/2 inches cubed. I want to serve 4 or 5 on the plate with the meal. My question is: What is the besy way to cook the meat? Roasting? Stewing? Pan cooking(which sounds very time consuming)? Or what? Im not sure. I have 3 meals to make like this, so I have to do this three times. I am a really good cook, so I can do just about anything needed, I just dont know what is the best way to do this. Please help. (Oh, there is a full industrial kitchen on site. No broiler available)   A minister, a doctor, and a police officer walk into an oriental tea house. The minister turns to the doctor and says "Go Browns?" The police officer, with a mouthful of tea biscuits pipes up "Rectum? Hell, it damn near killed 'em"! *Edit wokka wokka*   I hate the Steelers. I REALLY dislike Bradshaw. This hurts my heart every time I see it. I wonder if Bradshaw would be less looney if this play hadnt happened?   Drunk Johnny Guy would be epic    This much of the season is equal to the 40 game mark in baseball. It's when you start looking at the identity of a team. Also we are on the other side of our Bye. I thought maybe somebody had put something together.   I would love to be able to show the people here in WA what the new number is in the AFC. Go Browns   To quote an earlier thread, "You're just ants at a picnic"   *nods slowly while pointing with his pipe* Absolutely   Just heard the term "Brian Football" on twitter.   Hoyer did not get intetcepted, that play came back.    All of my upvotes are belonging to this   At least we know whoever made the video is classy.    [Senior Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-sZDv0W0s4)   Ive been and was a paying member of the HOTlanta group. Good folks. I don't know if they meet in the same place. I know there is a huge group of them going to the game. I still get the emails.   I have Rogers. Hoyer and Rogers should be fine    The Destroyer is holding strong over his mentor this season in Fantasy. I have Hoyer AND Brady on my team. So I was trying to figure out if I should go with Hoyer as the beast he is, or Brady as the beast he is supposed to be but hasnt been at all this year? So I asked [The Guru] (http://imgur.com/VbOlabc). Das Guru doesnt even have Hoyer ranked (BS) and he has 6 fantasy points on average more than Brady on the year. And their suggestion is Brady over Hoyer. The lack of a ranking is mind blowing to me.

Fuck the Steelers and fuck their stupid little towels that are about to infest your stadium. Buc their asses out of town!   "I'm not racist,  I own a colored TV!"   I think its a bad look for the Browns,  who historically fielded some of the first non white players in football history,  to be dropping racial slurs. It makes you look ignorant. Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt.  I want you to say the word "Jiggaboo" in front of Jim Brown,  and see if he wouldn't just cold cock you.  *edit: players*   You just called people jiggaboos....that is some racist hate speech,  sir.    [Boo.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BooThisMan.gif)   It was a nice gesture because he is a Raven, and if you dont get that, you dont get your history.   Seriously, if you are one of the many new Browns fans this year this will give you a lot of what you need to know to be on point.   My Grandfather has been a season ticket holder FOREVER.  Muni lot patrons know him as Big Den. We were tailgating before we beat Carolina at home a number of years ago, and he said to me with tears in his eyes:"If Lerner would just come down here and see this. If he could just see how much we support this team, maybe it would help them" This makes me happy for my grandpa like I can't even quantify.    Guess so.   *EDIT: Cleveland has good fans, thank you. We are not good to the Ravens. Sorry-Not-Sorry*  We fucking hate the Ravens, we hate their fans, and we hate Art. And didnt give his punk ass a moment of silence when the rest of the league did after his stupid ass croaked. We revel in your legal battles, we love that you have the reputation for being thieves, murderers, drug addicts, and adulterers, and we like it when you have to play without your stars.  (Other teams play that game too, but you guys make it into an "Art" lulz) And it was a serious sign of respect that you should recognize, because in a different time, Pita would have been covered in broken bottles, and D Batteries to put the cherry on top of his injury.

Good job.      Yeah, totally not worried. Just relaying some trivia. I didnt know 6 games is what a player had to play for it to count against their contract. I think he'll stay, too.    I know that when I shared that I thought that the Ravens and Art Modell sold their soul to the Devil for 2 Super Bowls and now they were paying the piper I got a lot of flak, [but](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=2370)    I found out from a friend today that 6 games is the minimum a player has to play for it to be considered a contract year.   Thank you. I just saw that the link broke. Just as well, it was from a Ratbird source. I always keep up on the team we are playing next week. If you want the real 411 on how your team is improving, and where your team scares other teams, read your opponents sources the week before the game.      Totally worked that way. Gratzi.   Done! You are wise.   WTF......?   I hope Hoyer saw this.    Eeeeeeeee.....I don't like any of them   Yeah.  I have Devin Hester on fantasy.  He was sitting at 29.20 when I went to bed.    Anyone know where I can get a copyable version of his response?   Page Not Found   TIL X2   TIL      Bless "you're" heart.   I recognize your statement as true, and reply with: "I know. I'm only talking about the one who might become the NFL Commish"   **T**   Any hater of the Steelers is a friend of mine, unless they're a ratbird. Sorry T-West.   Fuck the Steelers in their fucking face. I hope Cam wipes the floor with them and their stupid, stupid, terrible towel. From the Browns, Go Panthers!   Well, She IS part of a cabinet of politicians who have been accused of being war criminals. Whether you like that fact, or not, it's true.       That was a great great great post. I love being a Browns fan, right now, who has been a Browns fan forever.    *WOOOF WOOOF*   Accepted.    Brady threw a 15.45 in my league this week, and Hoyer finished with a solid 20.00   I just think thats the classiest thing! "You know, we have a storied history with, and have always stood up for murderers and spousal abusers. In that spirit we would like to dedicate this game to Ray Rice" Even if you support Ray, THAT is not the way to do it. THAT is tactless, imo.      We shouldnt have to increase the minimum wage, because it should have gone up in concert with CEO pay all along. Then it wouldn't seem like a financial burden when we have to move the common worker out of poverty wages and into livable wages.   Someone was going to. He's good.    So on the field we are nameless,  but in the media,  we have a name. His name was Ifeanyi Momah. His name was Ifeanyi Momah. His name was Ifeanyi Momah..   What's his name? *EDIT, His name is Ifeanyi Momah*      Thank you for the correction    Okay, [I did.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/01/10/ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-atlanta-murder-2000/1566198/) He wasn't acquitted of anything he was found guilty of a lesser charge on a plea bargain *edit added*  It says: *Only Lewis pleaded guilty in relation to the case: for obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor. He originally was charged with two counts of murder but struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony against two of his companions that night, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting.*   Ray Lewis killed that fool in Atlanta. He was never found innocent. The charges were dropped in exchange for testimony.   [SMH.](http://imgur.com/gallery/IQSK4Qy) Some folks forget about Neverland and then break bad on those who have fun. James Hook. No imagination. Bless your hearts.   I [told the Ravens sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu) when their people started getting in trouble (specifically this was about Lorenzo Taliaferro) that it was Karma. I even wrote a story, and was downvoted and told I was a stupid Browns Fan, and then I was accused of "Running to my sub for upvotes" (which I was too new to know that was a thing). I am reposting my story here, again, in light of Ray Rice, and the Raven fan-base can Dawg my Bone if they dont like it. The truth stings:  **My Story of The Ravens, Art Model, and the Devil**:*The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day. It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.* *edit:formatting*     I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.   You hate being right all the time     End of his career, but it was the beginning of his HoF push, which he will probably NEVER see now.    In the Browns fan-fic I have going on my head,  Haslam unveiled them with the Elf Ear cuts during a team meeting from under a white blanket. A loud "TA DAAA!" and everyone "ooooooooo"ed. *Slow close up on Brownie smiling  mischievously* Then we cut to the boys in the tunnel with the side view of the helmet.   Because I think that shit is nice, and I like it.   Have they just added that recessed bit around the hole that looks like [Brownies Ears?](http://imgur.com/D7KBC0b)  	116
 Really? Where did they announce this?   It's probably still gunna be a console.   yeah, couldn't agree more.   Personally, I don't expect to hear anything. Still, interested in what you guys think.                  why is it stupid?   It's not as fun, I agree. But you know, it's probably more fun than losing.         Surprised that so many people say diplomacy here, even though it did not turn out to be so in the poll.   I almost never rely on hotels and airports for culture wins. It's all about the digs   great works. And plus, if you found a religion and go for the reform where all religious buildings get 2 tourism, that makes culture really simple.   Made me laugh as well, when someone suggested I should include I usually lose as an option.   Same with me. But I guess science being first isn't a big surprise either.   Fair enough, seems like that's where most people are as well.   Give it some time man, data take time to accumulate. I doubt it will be 25% when there are more answers.   http://thearima.com/questions/how-many-of-steam-s-games-do-you-have-in-your-library  Personally, I am not a fan of Steam. But still curious to see what others say.                  honestly, anytime you have salt and no dessert, it's usually a good start.            It's true that sometimes clients wants you to explain your methodology, but a lot of times I find that clients would go with "better" result even if the model is somewhat incorrectly applied. By better results, I mean more accurate predictions, easier for them to understand, or results that make more sense/more correct intuitively.      very true.      When you deal with time series data, for example.   let's stay away from the bayesian debate.      I think everyone knows this sentence is from Box.   I know, but I always feel that you should prepare your own data, at least the key part of it. It's like preparing your own food as a chef   Other than 6, which I am unsure of, all others I totally agree.   Someone was sharing on LinkedIn and I thought it's interesting for data scientists.  1. Data is never clean 2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data. 3. 95% of the tasks do not require deep learning. 4. 90% of cases GLM will do the trick. 5. Big Data is just a tool. 6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach. 7. No one cares how you did it. 8. Academia and business are two different worlds. 9. Presentation is key - be a master of PowerPoint. 10. All models are wrong, but some are useful. 11. There is no full automated data science. You need to get your hands dirty.         It looked like a very sketchy concept. Wouldn't be surprised to hear it violates the law.      Adding onto what Pesto_Enthusiast said,  sometimes a case could be investigated by both the police   the university (e.g. campus police). The university investigation only determines if you get to stay in the school. It does not replace police investigation, nor does it imply the police won't look it anymore.      this would vary a lot, depending on what your business does. I don't think anyone can give you a precise answer without knowing what you do exactly (you are basically asking for something that management consultants would do for big companies).   this is nice!   Yeah, guardians are pretty good as well.  Also agree that warriors are my least favourite.    Elementalist would be my choice. What do you guys say?                  overall      that's probably the smartest thing to do.      This is like lottery eh? The first one you buy you win something, and then after that you never get anything.   Agree. Your time could be used elsewhere.         OMG, what do you do for a living? Are you a professional player?   This one gives you much more information though, like geographical breakdown, etc etc, but strawpoll is simpler.   I just added a nothing option.   personally, I don't spend too much money on cases, only $100 something. I wonder how much an average player would spend on something that is purely aesthetic.  	67

 Yeah heat does it for me too, but drinking all that water makes it easier to stave off.   I totally understand that. Life happens, and big events definitely make it hard to maintain a regimen  	2
 Nice!   I want to do this.   I am continually stunned with these folks.   Or the anthrax attack.   I'd probably buy one of those around-the-world cruises.   And still he gets no respect (except from us libs who love him)   I was thinking about that yesterday. I would try them!   Life is stranger than fiction.   There is a rv rental business on Sahara between i15 and the strip where you can rent tent trailers reasonably also, although I have'nt checked them out in a few years.   Isn't that a little elitist?   I was thinking about this yesterday.  It would definitely get me excited.  Not sure if she could win though....      I think a survey was done one and the Turkish leader Ataturk was ranked highest of all leaders. Sorry, I don't have the time to find it now.      I always wonder if he is playing checkers or chess.  I still don't know, but it could screw us if the Republicans finally played ball.  Also, I wish he would use the stage to change the conversation.  No talk about jobs, only the lousy deficit.  No help for Main Street, only more help for Wall Street.   Why would you start a war if nobody came?   He doesn't seem to learn.   I love it.         Sick.       The Urban League has a job program for ex-felons.  They also have a list of employers who will hire them.   There are a group of hotels also, but you have to be honest with them upfront.  Jobs are tough for everyone here now though.         Wait until they are all monopolies, and no one has money or capital to compete.   That's because you have never listened to her.  She KNOWS what she is talking about.  She is not a wingbat.   Wow.   I like the sound of that!   Yeah, but military spending doubled after 9-11.  It needs to be cut even more.  We don't need 80+ bases around the world.  We don't need to outspend the rest of the world combined.   Apathy.   Taxes on the rich were 90% in the fifties, and corporations paid most of the taxes.      It happened to me too.  I'm trying to get in the spirit again, but I'm just so tired.  Hopefully, I'll come around soon, and not let it happen again.   Now, if they all would vote.   I feel like I had this my whole life, but don't consider myself gifted.  As an existentialist, however, I just realized that in the end it doesn't matter anyway.   The other person fired during the war was Bill Maher.            Good for you for asking.  I felt like I couldn't look at another salad or another chicken.   I fell off the wagon and gained my weight back, stopped working out, and feel miserable.   He is absolutely correct.  The amount of Social Security one receives is also based on your top 30 yrs of earnings - and you need to earn $20,000/year substanial earnings for the year to count more than $0.  I see too many jobs paying minimum wage to $12/hr which will never help to contribute enough earnings for social security.  And comments here are right too, we can never get enough people out to protest.  We have to find a way to get the do-nothings out of congress and keep the good ones. I'm so frustrated too for people - yet alone myself.   Sorry about the spelling.   And through the constitution, they are structurally given what they need to survive.      We have a spending problem.      Or too lazy to look up and post.  Thanks from a lazy one.   I see people take out of their 401(k)s all the time.  And even when they don't, they can't save enough to carry them through their retirement.  Do you want them to die on the streets?   And a good place to harvest profits.   I agree.  I also know a Sandy Duncan.  LOL.   No, I'm sorry about your mom (my dad died at 48), but that's also how it supports people that live longer too.  I don't believe social security is broken.  It's the best thing we have going.  I'm looking forward to it, and you will be grateful it will be there for you.  It's just that Wall Street wants very badly to get their hands on it.   I looked for his website, but it looks like it doesn't exist anymore.  He had a packet of handouts you could buy also for about $15.  I had planned to order it, but never got around to it.  Our universities have been hit so hard that anything out of the ordinary in no longer there.  Sorry!  He did spend a lot of time talking about Mexico, where Americans could go, health care, taxes, etc.  He did cover other areas that are popular with potential expats.  I still think there is a market, but don't know where he went!   At least not soon enough for me.  I'm so tired of the tyranny of the minority we know as the right-wing.         Good luck.  I'm pulling for you too.  Just wish I had something offer.   It's an 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, and the road is long and boring.  There used to be a billboard on the highway in the fifties that just said "Ain't this monotomous?"  I remember it as a child, and only wish I had a photo of it today.  Your comment reminded me of it.      You did good work, and while they were not in my City, I was aware of and supported your efforts - for 30+ yrs.  I also hated that Dems were such wimps.         I thought the sequestration would fail due to the lobbyists, so I don't know.  It is interesting though.   People invested in stocks until the bubble burst and they lost their investment.  So that is when they started investing heavily in the real estate market (at least there was something real sitting there), and then the housing bubble burst and people lost the value of that also.  SS is the only option that isn't a ripoff.  It's an insurance plan that you pay for 50 years of your labor.   I know some people who have used granite tiles - much less expensive - and can be a diy project.     I've seen it.  People who think they are deserving, but no one else is.   I attended a one-night class through the continuing education program of our university.  I think it cost $59.   The guy who gave it travels through the west coast doing it at different universities.  So, yes, it is possible.   That's a better comment than mine.   Bradley Manning was trying to OPEN up government and start a conversation.  The Tea Party is trying to CLOSE down the big bad government.   I'm not sure if it was the Pew study, but there was a study of who was the Tea Party, and it was discovered that it was the religious right.   Good point.  They also met on the day of Obama's first inauguration and decided to fight him on everything.  And they have!  Even their own recommendations for appointments have been fillabustered!   I see jobs frequently on usajobs.com for positions for the military.   I don't understand the Republican's push for these drug testing bills.  They did it in Florida and less than 3% of the population showed any drugs, less use than the general public.  Somebody has got to be getting big contracts - why else?  It's a huge waste of money.  Somebody, enlighten me.   That happens to all of us - it's not just because of our views.   You might want to go to PBS and watch the PBS Frontline on 401(k)s.  Nebraska did a 20 yr study and decided that people could never retire on them.   I can't believe that I found it.  I knew him through his manager who was named Red (It's been too many years now!)  Saw him box at the Showboat.  I remember the infamous Howard Cossell talking on tv on what a strong boxer he was.  He didn't have the move Ali had, but he could hit.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._T._Gordon   Yeah, but they will blame it on Obama.   I hope to visit someday.   I really like Ellison.   Republicans don't care about budgets.  They just want to dismantle the social safety net.   I thought the bristle cone pine in California was the oldest tree. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine   He is a part of everything bad that has happened to us in the past 20 years.  His wife was on the Enron Board.  He was the main proponent of ending Glass-Steigel.  The sequester too????         Actually, S.T.Gregg was a Las Vegas boxing champion in the late 70's.  He won the cruiser weight championship.   Beale cypher has never been broken, I believe.      My friend who has designed over 100 beautiful houses hasn't had a job since the economy crashed.   I'd buy from you!   Reagan was voted very low in one of these surveys shortly after his administration ended.  Big money came to the rescue to change history.   I believe the House just got pay raises too.  Sleazy people.   I've read this before.  What I want to know is if there is a hereditary or a DNA basis.  I wonder if it could be based on ancestry.   He earned it.   They are already on the dole.   Right.  Government is subsidizing low wages with foods stamps, medical and TANF, not to mention housing, utility allowance, etc.       Congress allows it.    Lol. Busted.   You are right.   There was a study somewhere that confirmed this.  I wish I had the link to place here.   They are actually the religious right, but I think most republicans believe  the same things.  The only ones that don't are the 1% who only believe in the bottom line who have been funding the republicans all along.   Thom Hartmann says it the "two Santa Claus theory" and says it was planned that way.     He is my favorite person alive.  I'll probably be at work however and will probably miss it.   I put $3000 in a 401K in 1990.  It is still worth $3000 today.  For those of you who who don't believe the article, I urge to to check out the Frontline video on PBS.  Nebraska conducted a 20 yr study and came out with the same conclusion.  People will not be able to retire on a 401(k). And Social Security is not a ponzi scheme because we should not run out of workers investing the system.  A ponzi scheme runs out of investors.  I do worry about there being a lack of work permanently as a way to distribute money throughout the society.  If we do not have work, we will all lose and the whole economy will fail, not just social security.  I've spent a lot of years looking at this.   I thought they were trying to get rid of "stupid".   Work has been a way to distribute money or wealth.  With computerization, there will be less jobs in the future.  We have to find another way to distribute money so people can live.  Not everyone can be an entrepreneur either.   I do worry about the "substantial earnings" amount.  It is about $20,000 per year now, and there are too many low-wage earners that are employed 20-30 hrs/week.     Privatized, then stolen by Wall Street.   Center-left yes.   Interesting.   Not really.  Nobody pays me to read and respond to reddit articles.   You have my vote.   We have heard of people being paid to be bloggers on the right.  I see some of the reddit comments and wonder "hmmm, I wonder if this person is paid to say that".  Am I the only person that wonders about this?   My husband's uncle told him that it would never be there for him. Well,  my husband worked for 50 years, and guess what, he is receiving it.   In a ponzi scheme, you run out of investors.  Social Security has a ready stream of investors (workers paying in to the sytem) and people who either receiving or dead.   Wall Street wants thier hands on all that money.   I'm impressed about your investments.    i got one today!   reddit.   If they really stopped the vote changing by the republicans during the last election, I love them.  Wish it could be verified however.   Interesting.  I don't remember cuts to medicaid, food stamps, but I remember him cutting lots of people from SSI.  And it didn't seem like there was much said about it.  It was just done.  I would be interested in reading about that.  Also, it was overnight that people started appearing pushing grocery carts around.   I had never seen it before.   You could do it with foundation support.   I think it is remarkable, and a way of organizing workers which seems almost impossible these days.  I think it will probably be out of business once Obamacare is implemented however.  Will have to see.   Typing.    I would like to spend one summer there.   AFSCME, the Public employee union.      A  lot less jobs due to robots.   Sunday night: Inaugural Party http://inaugurationvegas.eventbrite.com/#     I think it's good.  Maybe he can bring sense to these folks.   I've only dreamed about it...   I'm a 63 yr old female and never had children by choice.  I've also been married for 40 yrs.  I like quiet time, and I'm amazed at people that do have children and manage to accomplish so much in thier lives.  In many ways, I've done very little other than work.  I only regret not having children when I think about my husband and how he might have liked it and if it would have changed his life.  He accepted it however, and now says the world has enough children.  I also have a male high school friend who never had children and regrets it very much.  He would still like to have children.   I like it.   Yes, but that was after years of screaming about the debt.  Remember the debt clock in NYC?  It stopped moving.   I didn't read the article, but the headline is ridiculous.  Republicans screamed like crazy during the Clinton years also.  Just not during the Bushes or Reagan years when the debt was building.  Thom Hartmann believes it is a strategy called the "Two Santa Theory".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski   This guy is sick.   Possibly Clark County Social Services.      I'm sorry I didn't go to summer school and graduate early, and I'm sorry I didn't apply myself more in college.  I thought it was just like high school l- floated through it.     There was an article on reddit recently where mothers in the Appalachia were women were keeping their children from learning to read so that they could claim they were disabled and eligible for social security disability.  If true, these stories break my heart.   Age of Aquarius?   He is quickly becoming one of my favorite congress member!  Republicans are not necessarily in favor of cutting the deficit.  They just don't like social programs that might help someone else.  They will always support private industry or military contractors.    yikes.   I can't wait!   Let's only hope.  Remember, they still have the governorship and control of 30 state legislatures.  This has to end too.   Thanks for posting the link,  Sometimes we forget how good we have it!   Why are they wrong on EVERY issue?   I actually think in the end that the ACC is a support to business, like SNAP or Food Stamps helps farmers as much as people.  	143
    Cersei Lannister. Woman was forced to marry someone, he treated her like a garbage can despite her hair, had a sociopath son, a dad who only cared about his legacy, had her daughter shipped off to Dorne, and a drinking problem. And the only guy who really loves her is her brother. Gross. Then when she tries to protect her kids or get revenge for some things, she's branded as evil. Don't get me wrong the things she has done this season have been uncalled for though. But before she was shit on for no reason.   How's your butt doing?   Many thanks. Will not be showing her this.   OOOOOOHHHHH   BASE jumping!   But it's warmer. Doesn't that mean it absorbs more energy? Bear with me I'm really bad at science stuff.

 What. The. Actual. Fuck.   It just always makes me happy when the Commander in Chief gives the commencement address at the USCGA   Hmmm.... I'm not sure then :/   I tried it once and like I said, I never put the pad all the way in.    Fantastic colorization!      It's amazing how quickly our bodies build up a tolerance to alcohol.   That is damned impressive!   I remember my "friends" didn't want to be around me as I worked on getting sober. Mostly because my "Friends" all hung out at the bar. SO, I feel that I'm better off without them.   That would be the [USCGC Ridley](http://www.uscg.mil/d1/sectlis/units/cgcRidley/) in the foreground.  87' Coastal Patrol Boat (Marine Protector Class) homeported at [USCG Station Montauk](http://www.uscg.mil/d1/staMontauk/) located on Long Island, New York.   That's fantastic! Some people are able to keep it under control. Sadly for me, when I could down 18 longnecks in a night and not feel a buzz of any kind, I knew I might have a problem.   Good for you.    That's a hell of a wake up. I'm sorry that you had to go through that.   That's my reasoning as well. I can give up alcohol, but I don't want to loose my daughter.   I've been sober from alcohol for 3 years now. I got sober because I was facing the prospect of loosing all contact with my child.   This can be to alcohol, drugs, anything that you were once addicted to.   The one issue I had was that you're supposed to insert the pad completely in. I've always had an issue with that and never got it all the way in. In theory, what's supposed to happen is any liquid, the pad absorbs and expands, blocking you up completely. At some point your bod will force it out but I've never been comfortable with inserting it all the way. It's supposed to be one hell of a mind-fuck though as your body feels the need to expel, the pad blocks it and absorbs some.   Indeed! And I was stationed on that ship for 3 years :)   I still have yet to answer it O_o   Phew! It's all good :D      I was under the impression that the stem was the seam where the bow met.

 Nicely done.   Freedom allows for anything. When you have complete freedom in an unregulated market, how does that affect capitalism?   You are equating freedom to capitalism. So what happens when there is no government and it's complete freedom with pure unregulated capitalism?   The best book I was ever assigned in college. I also got to see Zinn speak at my college a few years back. He told a heartbreaking story about when he was bomber pilot at the end of WWII.   They are both grammatically correct but they don't mean the same thing. *Perfectly* is an adverb. It modifies verbs. *Perfect* is an adjective. It modifies nouns.  "Made it perfectly" means that you made no mistakes in the process of making. It also *implies* that "it" is well-made.  "Made it perfect" means that you made "it" into something perfect, but doesn't really describe how you made it.   We haven't found anything sweet in the natural world that can kill us. Part of the theory is that sensitivity to sweetness helps us identify safe foods.   The browser has already started downloading the file when it displays the "save as" dialog. It's continuing to download it in the background to your temporary folder while it's waiting for you to respond. You're not actually gaining any speed. It's smoke and mirrors but it's a useful tactic nonetheless.   In the old days, arcane programming languages (Fortran, C) didn't have compilers that were intelligent enough to infer a procedure's memory allocation requirements just from the code. When you jump into a procedure, the computer has to build a stack frame, allocating just enough memory from the stack to contain all of your variables, pointers and handles. Declaring all of your variables at the start of your procedure is telling the compiler how big your stack frame needed to be.  These days a lot of languages are *interpreted*--they aren't even compiled (Python, Javascript). For the rest, the compilers are now pretty smart about it but the language syntax of Java derives from C/C++ and it's a holdover.   Actually, the Christian Science Monitor's news reporting is quite unbiased and Pulitzer Prize-winning. They go out of their way to not get caught up in mass hysteria, and to maintain high standards of decorum. They are well respected in journalism.   I think there are a couple of explanations. First, the true believers have to die off so it takes at least a generation for non-revolutionary social change. In the meantime the young became more and more disillusioned as they saw that what they were taught in school did not match the reality on the street. They saw that the struggle remained and that the bourgeoisie was merely replaced by oligarchs. Second, in the latter half of the 20th century, after a series of tragic political wars (Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Cold War), people were pushing back against centralized governance and federalism all around the world, including both the USSR and the United States. Instead of the view that the government will take care of you, the prevailing view now is that you have to take care of yourself. That, of course, plays right into capitalism.   Marxist socialism requires centralized control and planning and relies on buy-in of all participants so it just isn't manageable on a large scale. When it encounters problems, it will become unstable very quickly and collapse. Capitalism, though it has its own problems, is more tolerant of mistakes, errors and human imperfections and is thus more stable.   As we have seen, no social system exists at a perfect state, at least not for very long. It must have some kind of self-correction built in or else it will collapse.   The stuff inside our cells also push out at exactly the same pressure so all of our cells are at equilibrium with the air.   4 major things that affect the quality of a digital camera:  1. Resolution and quality of the sensor. Those are the megapixels. More megapixels is potentially more detail, but other factors come into play. Read on. 2. Post-processing. The camera makes image adjustments (contrast, brightness, white balance) then compresses it to make the file size smaller. There are big variations here because some cameras have faster processors and thus can do more. Also, the higher the compression, the smaller the file size but also the less detail the image will have. 3. Lens quality. More expensive cameras have more glass elements in the lens and higher quality glass and coatings. This helps the image come into sharper focus from the center all the way to the edge. Lower quality cameras are visibly fuzzy around the edges of the image. 4. Lens size. Larger lenses allow more light in and render lens imperfections and dirt/smudges less obvious. They also give you shallower depth of field for more creativity.   I can certainly understand political compromise to be able to pass anti-abortion laws. Part of my question seeks to better understand the personal beliefs of pro-lifers because it really seems like the majority are personally OK with abortion in those circumstances. Do you agree?   I'm with you.   When was the last time you or anyone you know went into Radio Shack? Why should that company stay in business in a market economy?   I looked at the Gallup numbers and even Googled to get them going back farther than what the opinion article showed. The Gallup statistical trends fairly well match the BLS trend, with the peak unemployment in 2009 and a steady employment growth since then. The only real difference is that Gallup includes both seekers and non-seekers in the unemployed statistic. It's certainly valuable to know both but it doesn't really matter whether you lump the two together.   So I guess the question is what to do about people who have given up looking for work? I guess you have to ask why that happens?   Let's say I was an NFL player but I was released by my team. I have worked out with several other teams but none of them so far have decided to offer a contract. I've decided to hang up the cleats. Can you still call me an NFL player?  So the question is what you call somebody who isn't looking for work? Sure, they're unemployed. Maybe the better thing is to call the BLS statistic "active seekers" but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it.   What I meant is that the pro-life side wants to enact laws banning abortions but many of those laws include exceptions to allow an abortion for rape or incest.   This is not meant to be a debate or be inflammatory. I just don't understand how somebody justifies the rape   incest exception. Is it merely political expedience?   It's far from certain that more money equates to more votes. In some examples it does appear to be a factor but there are also times when it works against a candidate.  Candidates can't afford to turn down money, and that's really where the problem lies. Money doesn't necessarily buy a candidate a win but it does buy the candidate.   Less reflection. Water absorbs more light. Our brain interprets the amount of light hitting our eyes as brightness/lightness. Less reflected light will make the surface appear darker.   Thanks, that graph is helpful indeed.   Thanks, that's a helpful article. If wage growth is around 2% but inflation is currently 1-1.5%, isn't it fairly inline?  Still, productivity is still increasing so that additional GDP is going somewhere. Perhaps that explains the increasing wealth gap. What to do about that?      For me, these four conditions:  1. When you earn enough to house, clothe and feed yourself so as to not be a burden on anyone else. 2. Your kids, if you have any, are well adjusted and generally happy 3. You enjoy being around your friends and your friends genuinely like you 4. You have enough free time and resources to do some things you really enjoy that don't make you any money   I've heard this claim over the past couple of years but can you supply a source to back it up?   What's an Ah?   I don't disagree that it's mostly vanity. Still, Mercedes can't just rebadge a C class and charge 3X unless they install an aromatherapy system.   OK, fine. :)  The Mercedes S class has a 200 meter radar and two cameras for 3D optical sensing, biturbo V12 or V8 with a 10.0 compression ratio, computer controlled variable suspension dampening with camera-controlled adjustment, two 12.3" LCD displays in the drivers dash with road-ahead night time video display, one display is touch sensitive. Navigation, communication and system controls on the steering wheel, a Burmester 24 speaker sound system, car systems that are controllable from your smartphone, massaging seats, aromatherapy climate control, adaptive cruise control (stop   go self driving), lane departure warning, blind spot detection....  It's pretty amazing that it's reliable as it is. It's also why it's probably not a good idea to buy older used S-Classes, 7-Series or A8s.   Not according to the Social Security Administration. http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html  The latest year they have stats is 2013 but there's no reason to think 2014 went negative.  The last time wages decreased was 2009, at the height of the recession. With unemployment dropping to 5.6%, I can't see that wages will be decreasing from 2013 to 2014.  Can you cite any study for your claim?   It's water vaporizing and creating bubbles that pop.   Land Rover (Defender 90) owner here. Can confirm. It's the equivalent of a supermodel girlfriend. Looks good but man, high maintenance.   In the U.S. the German auto manufacturers only import their most expensive lines which give them the most profit margin. These models have a lot more features than a basic car and are engineered for higher performance and capability, e.g. all wheel drive, independent wishbone suspension on all 4 wheels, higher compression, variable valve timing, and so on and so on.   TL;DR: More stuff means more stuff that breaks.   If you didn't manage to sell before you get foreclosed, I believe the bank will take receivership of the house. They will sell at whatever price they want and they have no incentive to sell at FMV. They only want to recover their loan and foreclosure expenses.      It's not a debate. I'm seeking understanding on how someone on the pro-life side reconciles what appears to be a contradiction.   It's what pro-lifers have said.  From the National Right To Life website: *"For more than 100 years, medical science has known conclusively that every individual's life begins at the moment of fertilization."*   The chance of birth defects is higher but probably still pretty rare in countries with good health care.   The second argument is the same argument that pro-choicers use, that it's not good to force a woman to keep an unwanted child.  The third is the sticking point. It *does* seem that there are circumstances in which the mother's feelings outweigh the life in the womb. It would appear that pro-lifers and pro-choicers have a lot of similarities.   So it's not about the life of the baby?         Changes in the market combined with bad management decisions. One usually leads to the other.  Sometimes it's just dumb shitty luck. Pan Am is an example of a one-time undisputed worldwide leader that no longer exists because of a lot of forces outside of their control.   A client of mine wants to run a second instance of Windows 7 inside a VM under Windows 7. He has his reasons.   I'm comparing VMWare Player vs. VirtualBox. Player seems to be a little quicker here and there. Anybody have strong thoughts on this? Is there another VM I should be looking at?  Client has an Ivy Bridge i7 with 12G RAM.   It's a bit of a pain. You usually have to boot into a separate CD or pen drive because it's hard to make a clone of a hard drive that is currently in use.  You can use [Easeus Disk Copy](http://www.easeus.com/disk-copy/home-edition/). It's a bootable CD.   That would be the most basic of basic backups. But it's effective.   Yes, you should be able to copy/paste to a Windows backup drive. Create a folder for your files first. Don't touch or delete any of the files  or folders that Windows has already created.   As Teekno said, a MLM company has product(s). Sales of the product infuses revenue into the company to be distributed among the levels. That being said, nobody buys into a MLM company to sell vitamins or fruit juice.  Pyramid schemes don't have products and revenue. They are often investment schemes around capital assets such as real estate. They promise a high return to attract investors. In order to keep attracting investors they must show that they paid those promised rates of return. The managers often take new investment money to pay the returns, in order to attract more investment. And so on and so forth until there are few new investors putting in and lots of old investors looking for payment.   A sonic boom is all of the sound that a jet engine makes compressed into a single wave. So I suppose if you passed the speed of light and there was actually light shining on you that you're reflecting, a bystander would see a bright flash of light.  But I could be wrong... With all those photons compressed together you might go Supernova.   See my answer. You're doing backup type #4 - system backup with Microsoft Windows proprietary backup format.   In the print options screen you can usually select grayscale, which will send print job containing no color information. Your printer should then only use the black ink.   There are different kinds of backups. From simplest to most complex:  1. Basic file backup - this just makes a single copy of your files. If your computer crashes you have to reinstall your operating system and programs but you can get a copy of your documents from the last time of backup. The benefit of this kind of backup is that the files on your external hard drive are exactly the same kind of file that you see on your computer's hard drive. You don't need your backup software to be able to restore a file. You can just drag/drop of copy/paste.  2. Basic file backup with timestamped versions - Like #1 except it keeps multiple changes of your documents. This is good for people who need to be able to restore a version of a document from a week or month ago, such as writers.  3. Mirror Backup (also called a clone) - This makes an exact duplicate of your hard drive. This can be used to completely restore your computer in the event of a drive failure but it's slow because your entire drive is copied during each backup. The backup's files are also plainly readable like with the basic backup.  4. System Backup - You can use this to restore the exact state of your computer just like the mirror backup. You can also have different versions so you can go back in history to selectively restore only a few files. The downside is that this is proprietary across different software so you need to have the software company's restore disc to recover from a failed drive. The files are also in a proprietary format so aren't plainly readable if you just wanted to quickly browse your backup and view some files.   Human evolution is over. Or it has slowed to such a crawl that it might as well be over. First, our ability to manipulate our environment, to cure disease, to modify our foods means that we don't have to wait generations. A gun means I don't have to outrun the mountain lion or bear any more. My coat lets me live above the arctic circle year round. My vitamins and my Kroger frequent shopper card lets me make delicious tropical fruit salads in the middle of winter.  Second, birth control has turned the mechanism by which evolution works--natural selection--on its head. In social after every social study, the individuals who are most well adapted to modern living are the ones having the fewest children. The well off are having few babies, if any at all, while the poor are breeding like rabbits.   The media absolutely must call out Rand Paul on his "many cases." Nobody should be allowed to make claims like that without being forced to give up proof.   Do you mean the other way around? Malware disguised as a media file?  It's possible but would probably rely on exploiting a bug in a media player. Not impossible, but unlikely.   Hmmm, I'm impressed they made the effort to be realistic.   ISIS is a guerilla group and are mixing in with the population. The west is not yet willing to accept the civilian casualties that would result from "steamrolling."   The screen is made up of two layers:  The glass on top and the digitizer below it. Your glass is broken but the digitizer, the part that detects your finger touches, is still intact and operational.   I was well into adulthood when I found out awry was pronounced "ah-rye."  BTW, I think "ruut" ("rt") is perfectly acceptable though incorrect. Ask him how he says "roto-rooter" then having him sing the jingle.   Because reddit is more interesting.   "She's not my type." Sometimes you just gotta lie.   When I toured The Great Pyramids this was the general explanation from our guide who was an Egyptian Egyptologist.   Did they make any sound? Fail then.   Men are carriers and her husband could have contracted the virus from a previous partner (or a secondary partner during their relationship).   To people who are downvoting:  Einstein's theory of general relativity.   Man-made fibers harbor the naturally occurring bacteria from your skin that produce body odors. That particular bacteria doesn't like cotton or wool as much.   At some point in the future, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.   Okay, Einstein. :)   Pedophilia isn't illegal and those suffering from it should seek treatment. It's the manifestation into acts that harm others that is illegal.   Ah, I misinterpreted. I think that a lot of leeway is given to the police officer by the review board. Where I live we have a community review board and it still lets a lot go. The judgment is not whether the officer made the *best* decision, but whether the officer made a *justifiable* decision.   I am really not a defender of cops. I just wanted to bring up the fact that we all suffer from cognitive biases. I actually think that the profession attracts a certain kind type of bullying personality. I certainly agree that police should and must be prosecuted and punished when there is evidence that the activity was illegal and premeditated. I think police departments should fire these kinds of cops when they find disturbing patterns of behavior, before it becomes a PR nightmare.  Police also just screw up. I'm glad I don't have a reporter calling me every time I write a bad bug into my code. This is something we also should be aware of. Then there's all the hazy area. Police are asked to make very tough decisions that could be life/death and make them very quickly. When I see one of those, I'm just thankful I don't have to be the one evaluating it.   This is part of the reason why I have yet to be convinced that self-driving cars will actually take off. For liability purposes, someone must be responsible for the actions and decisions of the car, and that person is the driver. This is how the FAA treats Boeing 777s and Airbus A380s that can fly themselves completely from takeoff to landing. The Pilot in Command is ultimately responsible.  As the driver in command of a self-driving car, you assume responsibility. I can see that it would become a more stressful driving experience around town rather than a less stressful one. Perhaps on a controlled-access interstate it might be relaxing, but I can't see it being relaxing in a city, even if the car was a much better driver than me. I would still need to pay attention and be ready to assume control.   Broken taillight. A very popular reason to pull somebody over, especially around the nightlife district. It'll happen until they also invent self-repairing cars.   Some tissues either repair very slowly or don't repair at all. Cartilage, for example, doesn't have blood vessels thus don't get the level of nutrients needed to reproduce quickly and repair.   When the only thing you hear are stories of people goofing up, you're going to think that it happens a lot more than it actually does. It's a proven cognitive bias and it's something that you should be aware of because you (yes, even you) are susceptible to it. In order to make rational evaluations of the community in which you live, you should be aware of the ways perception can let you down. I encourage you to listen to a few of David McRaney's podcasts of "[You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast)."   Hopefully this will lead you to explore the topic in greater depth, looking at actual data sets.   So your wipers don't get frozen to your windshield. It lets you scrape the ice off your whole windshield. By the way, flex your wiper blades along the entire length before you put them back down. This breaks the ice that tends to build up at the grip points where the rubber meets the steel. That ice buildup prevents the blade from conforming to the windshield curve which causes the streaking as the blade goes across the windshield.   The medical industry uses the term disease differently than your understanding. The DSM-IV calls addiction and dependence a brain disease. In medicine, brain diseases can be from a pathogen or could come from other causes such as trauma, tumors or hydrocephalus.  The reason why it's a brain disease is because the brain of a drug-dependent person behaves differently than someone else who is a non-user or a recreational user. Their brain produces less of a high in response to the drug (tolerance), and produces withdrawal symptoms when they get off the drug.  Lastly, I caution you about your viewpoint. Even those who have overcome their addictions through willpower understand how difficult it is and how easy it is for them to relapse. For many, it takes a lot more than willpower. It takes emotional support from their friends, family and community. Even with that, success is low.   It's a cognitive bias called The Availability Cascade. You don't hear about the times that a cop stopped a crime or a criminal because that's expected. /r/news articles that are unusual get upvoted but that tends to make those kinds of stories appear to be more prevalent than they actually are. That in turn promotes and encourages more of those kinds of stories to be posted.   The air doesn't decrease in temperature gradually as you go up in altitude. If stable enough it tends to form layers with boundaries. The same goes for ocean temperatures as you go down. The air mixes within the layers much more than it mixes across the boundary. Moist air condenses at the boundary, creating a flat bottomed cloud.   Israel *is* Palestine *is* Israel. History did not start 70 years ago. Until the creation of Israel, everyone in the area was called Palestinian, regardless of whether they were Muslim (80% of the population), Jews (15%) or Christians (5%).  Now, put yourself in the shoes of an Islamic Palestinian. You and generations of your family have lived in some house in a city like Jaffa for two thousand years or more. You've been ruled by Ottomans, then the British Mandate but you've always been Palestine. Then this guy comes along and suddenly says you're a new country, Israel (a Hebrew word), even though Jews were a small minority. Immediately, the U.S. and their western allies in the U.N. recognized sovereignty. You had no say. Suddenly, you're now living in a Jewish country.  The British initially supported the Islamic Palestinians and the Arab coalition (Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Egypt) but provided less than promised military support. The power-hungry King Abdullah of Jordan stabbed the Palestinians in the back because he made backroom deals with Ben Gurion to annex the West Bank. As such, he provided only nominal military support to the campaign despite being the most powerful military force in the region.   A college degree generally boosts your income over the rest of your lifetime (YMMV). Starting a business is riskier. Business loans are also often collateralized so you are going to risk assets like your home.   Jerusalem is important to Jews, Muslims and Christians.   The Palestinians did not the start the 6 day war or the 1948 war. They are caught in the middle. First, the country of Israel was just *declared* by David Ben Gurion. There wasn't any treaty between any parties. Western powers in the U.N. voted to recognize it so that it would be a place for Jews to go rather than have to accept post-WWII Jewish immigrants into their own countries. Prior to Ben Gurion, in the area that is now Israel only about 15% of the population were Jews.  The 1948 war and later the 6 day war were ostensibly over Palestinian rights but truthfully were political wars. Islamic Palestinians were the vast majority of the population but they were told by the Arab armed forces to flee the area, which they did. 700,000 of them. Israel won the '48 war and took the opportunity to basically lock the gate. The refugees were not allowed back into Israel (where they and their families had lived for millenia) nor into the neighboring countries and basically were stuck in the west bank, which was taken over by Jordan. Later, after the 6 day war, Israel took hold of that territory as well.  The Palestinians have been fucked by both sides throughout the history of this conflict.   Thanks. I never knew about ocular dominance.      Numerous studies show that Americans have been conditioned to identify the ".99" as being a bargain. Secondly, "9.99" also appears much less expensive than "$10.00" even though it's only by a penny.  As an aside, a ".95" are identified as being "a good value" (as opposed to the .99 bargain).  	84
    Happend to me yesterday, but fixed itself after 20 minutes :P   Proof: [HERE](http://puu.sh/6XugU/da106bac9d.png)   I does only use one monitor atm.  I have just reinstalled windows on my pc. Mby thats why i had so much FPS?   Hello!  just got myself an Asus 144hz gaming monitor. I enabled 144hz refresh rate in Windows and on my Nvidia 680 graphic card. But when I started LOL the FPS is very unstable. It is spiking from 70 to 144 fps every second. Making the game a pain to play. My settings ingame does not matter. With everything on low I get LESS FPS, from 60 to 80 fps. I have tried vSync, FPS cap, every setting. Repairing the game.  I got a good pc having constant over 400 fps, a few patches ago.  Does anyone have the same problem?  Edit: Just fixed it! The problem was the "Enable HUD Animations" option. I just disabled it and now I have stable 144FPS.  Thanks to the League of Legends forum user "Zyvera" for posting this fix!   must say that it was... **beast**. Batum Tss   same with me....      OMG I rly wanna know this song name. Find it guys :D   lol saw his "montages" now. I think he hack. Watched this clip... OBV Hack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqy2qcqp68    Shyvana, Thresh and Jax  	11

 If they are in welfare, how can they afford to travel to California?   only Europe should be concerned of TTIP because America is their "developing" country for them.   Remember the Fox News welfare guy buying lobsters? he doesn't look obese at all. lol    it just to do with the fact that our league doesn't have the finishing nor the midfield to allow our forwards to score. Though it is early in the season, so I expect scoring to pick up soon.   I am not a big fan of 0-0 draws or low scoring games to be honest.   I chose Harrington because he is a safe starter. $5 million less.    Michael Harrington   Use the Wildcard. You didn't plan it out, right beforehand.   it is not a problem. We just don't a system to encourage more diversity. if families of people wan to run for president go ahead, the candidates will be judged the fact that it is a family legacy.   omg... I go to Pandemonium was well. The one you are talking about is in Boston, right?   Kah might not start so I recommend  getting somebody that is more certain.   I wouldn't say Colorado's defense is weak. They are just heavily reliant on O'Neill and Moor to be healthy with Irwin in goal.   I used all my free transfers. I don't want to take  a -4 on a defender and maybe only get 2 points if no clean sheet.   Jack Jewsbury. He is listed as a defender, but he is playing more of a defensive midfielder role.    I think LA will probably get some goals on Vancouver this week. I think getting VAN defenders on the DGW is the better alternative. Kah vs Adekugbe is a tossup and uncertain.    I have Jewsbury, Ramos, and Opara as my defenders for this week.  I have Neagle in midfield against Deric., but Martins and Dempsey are injuried. I have Arrieta in forward, yet facing Ramos. I don't have any Philly players on my team, so I am leaning on Marin for this week, but I do have Opara....so....Any thoughts?     Designated Hitter in the National League or Having only a 8 man lineup is the easiest solution. Also, it would uniform the whole league in its rules.   You could also wait decades to fix the low offense game, but every sport has made changes to its rules since its inception. Baseball rules have been altered throughout history. The game of the 1890s and 1920s is different from today's. What is interesting is that we had more offense and shorter games decades ago.   There are other methods that would be more drastic:  Changing the Baseball's Matter, Alter the Bat's matter, Bring the Fences in, Treat all Fouls as nothing against the batter, Lower the Pitcher's Mound,     barbaroid the ultimate battle machine?   Burch wasn't a starter last year. After he filled in for Colorado with Moor and O'Neill out in injury, Colorado win/loss record went on a downwards spiral. I wouldn't get Burch since Colorado has done better this year with clean sheets with O'Neill on the team and without Burch, which is typical of Colorado.   Just watch yugioh Arc-v dub, if you want to see them in action.  Youtubers such as Cyberknight8610 and Azneyeswhitedragon have a lot of helpful yugioh videos as well. You can also find other youtubers as well.   We need a proportional multiparty system. Anything that has to do with districts will be gerrymandered.    There needs to be major infrastructure investment.   one way streets are very efficient since you don't spend so much time waiting at traffic lights. Also pedestrians and bikers benefit since they know the street only goes one way.   Dom Dwyer   All my spell cards turned into magic cards...   I would rather see how many Americans would support the Tea Party, Greens, Libertarians, and Socialists as parties    Also you got to remember that land is finite on the macro level so you need to increase housing for more people at the same time you have to increase land for farming.   It discourages density and creates sprawl, which has some major impacts environmentally.   I think this is a great add by Montreal, if this is true.   Dang... All my Spell cards turned into Magic cards today :\   Honestly if you looked in Gallup polling on how Democrats Identified themselves in 1980s to 2008. You would notice that a lot of them were considered New Democrats and considered themselves "moderates" at the time.   Hence there should a multiparty system to show what Americans really believe in.   Don't get Altidore because he has no game the next week.    If so, then all countries should abolish borders, trade barriers, and end immigration restrictions.    YES! ROIDS!   West Ham United is renovating the London 2012 Olympic Stadium to fit in soccer. Also, the land used for the Olympics there is redeveloped for housing, science, schools, etc.    How is the Olympic Bid bad for the Revs? A Giant Stadium with tarp is better than a small stadium. Also, it removes any possibility that the Revs will need to relocate out of the small stadium for a bigger stadium.    Will the Revs stadium be part of the larger Boston 2024 plans?    Batteryman. Easy to OTK lol   I repied to a comment, which implied Democrats = Big Business, Income Inequality, Corruption, etc   So Democrats are now the party of business? I thought the Democrats stifled business growth.    I really regret transferring out Palmer for Sjoberg yesterday. I do have Peay if he plays :/   better than nothing. after all. If they were to provide the exact # of days with free-service, then would lose double the amount of expected revenues for this year.    I like Canada's three to 5 party more so than US's system . It is very interesting how the stats reflect that divide.    You would still want a mix of residental, commerical, and industry in each city. Just varying amounts of sizes.   If one city falters, then your other city would be crisis mode to import all those dirty industrial jobs back.    It isn't Post-Hoc Fallacy. This logic would also apply to debunk any Tax Cuts boosting jobs, Reagan's deflation/taxcuts boosting the economy, Republicans claiming Bush's economic growth is better than Clinton's because he got us out of the Tech-Bubble, Stimulus creating jobs, any government cuts/spending creating jobs, etc.  Anything in the Marco-Level economics can happen, so justifying Post-Hoc is really missing the whole point of economics. It is all about correlation and sometimes causation, but it also up for the intrepretation of stats.    It is also one of things that Obama and Republicans actually agree on yet both claim that they don't agree on anything lol   Because the Bay Area is one of the largest metro areas in the US. They can support 2 teams. California could potentially have 6 MLS teams, if people, who say it should be based on metro areas instead of states, get their way.    Seitz because LA's attacking subs are quite good.   How about San Fran and San Diego?    Yes.   I am surprised since Konami would like to promote Pendulum Summoning.....   Artifact Batteryman with WattFox as synchro. It can stun, punish destruction, OTK, Rank 5, Rank 4, and swarm.   So Jewsbury will most likely be starting? o.O   Batteryman   So.... Will Peay or Jewsbury play? o.O   Transfer out kaka for a different player?   Of course, the money has to come from somewhere for the owners, who will need to pay for the intial costs of building the stadium and the investment/planning costs to build it.    You can't be assured that it will be voted down unanimously . Just a few months ago, 60% of Bostonians supported it. Now, it is down to 30% support. The decline was mostly due to the public transit problems during the snow storms.   Yet somehow, Atlanta gets a stadium that is "too big" for soccer.   Once you have the Olympics, there is already a stadium for usage. Then, the State House could have the Olympics tax on sporting events to pay for the cost overruns.    Then, the Boston area "soccer specific stadium" will probably be postponed to a later date or until Kraft has an incentitive to find land, stadium already in the plans, etc. Right now, Kraft has no major incentitive to find the Revolution a stadium.    True, though this method has been used by DC United for its stadium.  They used land formerly used by industry.    Bandwagoners only apply to people not within range of a team's city location.   The Olympics Stadium would be near the South End and South Boston area where they have railroad tracks, red-line tracks, industry, parking lots, storage, etc.    Bringing the Olympics will provide Kraft and the Revs with a stadium. Also, the Olympics will allow the redevelopment of an area that is primarily used for industry.     A few months ago, 60% were in favor, until the MBTA crisis, which caused the numbers to fall to 30% in favor. I am sure that many want to see redevelopment, after the Olympics are over.   If soccer fans in New England want a soccer-specific stadium in Boston, then they should vote yes on the Olympics Referendum, if there is one. Of course, you vote no on specifics like taxpayer funded cost overruns, but still.    The cosmos could merge with the New York Red Bulls.   I have Peay on Bench. Should I place him in starting lineup in place of Jewsbury or should I allow auto sub if Jewsbury doesn't play?   thanks. I guess I'll transfer out Bradley and keep Duka as a sub in case some other potential staters don't start.   Soumare wasn't able to play in the previous game. Lost Clean Sheet points. D: Duka is injured. I am more concerned with Duka....Will he play?      One of the best. Without question better than zexal and maybe 5ds in terms of presentation and drama.   Syrus Truesdale vs Yugo? roids vs speedroids?   When O'Neill comes back, will Sjoberg lose his spot since Colorado's defense functions better with O'Neill there? Harrington was in both games this season with clean sheets. Is Harrington a safer option?   So if I get him over Harrington, we will expect similar production and have a starting role?   jewsbury is midfielder but labeled as a defender. he is going to pick up some attacking bonus points if Rivero does score goals.   When O'Neill comes back, will Sjoberg lose his spot since Colorado's defense functions good with O'Neill there? Harrington was in both games this season with clean sheets. Is Harrington a safer option?   GX themes will enter.    Does everybody hate the xy dimension? lol. I think this is Konami's way of ridiculing us since Zexal was notoriously disliked by fans?    Will GX characters enter arc-v as well?   WHEN IS THE BANLIST COMING OUT?   Don't forget Mexico's economy and social standing has not improved with all the violence and drug cartels. Also, our trade deficit has increased with Mexico.   NAFTA also didn't reduce illegal immigration rates to the U.S.   Roids and Cloudians   Roids don't have steroids.    Sure. I don't understand why Conservatives recommend minorities to vote Republican especially in the South, where governments are already GOP dominated at the state level. Voting GOP, will only increase the GOP's control on legislation and court system.     Agreed, but there is a vocal wealthy minority that opposes this more proportional system ever since James Madison's Federalist Papers, which warned about a pure democracy voting away rights of white property owners. Honestly, I have yet to see a proportional democracies in developed voting away rights of "minorities" left and right without a legal system.    All developed countries have parties vs parties. It is natural part of human greed and governing.    But there is no incentitive for them to vote Democrat. Why would they? Like how there is no incentitive for black southerners to vote Republican there.   You need a proportional system first. Then, you can modify it.   ay ay captain   not exactly. You can have a leftwing and rightwing coalition. example: Greece and Germany   True, but he still didn't deliver on his promise of ending the Bush Tax Cuts. here, obama agrees with the GOP somewhat.    They should make a list, where you can have 4 copies of a card. lol   Also parliamentary debates are more entertaining than Congressional debates.   yep. I know. the third party spoiler effect. progressive Party, Greens, Reform Party, and Dixiecrats, etc each have spoiled the two major parties in our history.   if all black southerners voted republican, the south would be a one party region. think about that.   Yes. it will take amending the Constitution, but it should be a good thing. There is way too many Americans for just 2 major political parties. Also, we need to make sure that the greens, libertarians, centrists, socialists, and fringes of ideologies are heard to keep in check in the powers of the establishment.   A better solution is getting rid of the 2 party system, not proportional and sometimes anti-majority electoral college, gerrymandered house districts, and corrupt Senate. We need more parties and more proportion when we are voting. We are always one party away from a one party nation. In fact, many states are already almost one party controlled.   MULTIPARTY System USA!   We should be focusing on a proportional multiparty system with majority governs or coalition forming than mandatory voting. Also, eliminating gerrymandering by reforming how we elect our politicians should encourage more voters. Our electoral college, house districts, and proportion of Senators need to be reformed.   Not on the Trans Pacific Partnership, corporate tax reform, Bush Tax Cuts, Marijuana, NSA, etc   MTL has blostered their defense and New England hasn't done well for this season. Fagundez should be a no go. Shipp doesn't have the defense nor the forwards to get assists + bonus points.    Speedroids   We need a proportional system with majority wins.   Effective Tax Rates back in the 1950s would still be higher than today's 0% effective tax rates  	108

How about you resubmit with a particularly shitty fact quote from it as the title?   Because the point of the sub is to look like it's a fact, not just the title to a video.

Look Kanye I'mma let you finish but the question wasn't about wehther the public opinion was useful or correct, it was what the opinion is, and whether this thread is a balanced representation of the general public.  I like your "it can't happen until it's viable" tautology though. Pretty useful opinion...    It may seem that way, but that's actually their ability to create optical illusions. Though mystical, cats can not in fact break the laws of physics.    Thanks!   ...huh. Weird.   You know, I think this has happened before with PV-mag link. Worked when I posted it in the morning, then later in the day it went to the homepage.   Note to self: No more PV-magazine submissions!   ...did someone comment before reading the whole title?   enough to power 7.6 million U.S. homes, up from 360,000 in 2009   Thanks for that. There weren't any BTTF jokes yet, I was starting to worry!   Which is why the quote also includes hard numbers of amount produced and the 7.6 million home's worth of energy.   Reddit just has a knack for shitting all over anything.   Plus the general fact that you're more apt to comment if you disagree than if you agree.   Public sentiment is pretty strongly one-sided in favor of renewables (70-80% IIRC)   [Price has fallen 99% since 1977](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/10/06/2717791/cost-pv-cells-solar-power-grid-parity/). Dunno about efficiency. It's gotten a lot better, but probably not 99%...                                    http://www.the-cryosphere.net/9/1105/2015/tc-9-1105-2015.html                                       The algorithm, based on triangulation of reputable sources. From what I've read it's not for questions that are open to interpretation ("Is climate change dangerous") but matters of simple fact ("Was Obama born in Kenya?") so at least initially there should be little justification for accusations of bias.    http://i.imgur.com/sTUElSg.png   ? Yes, that is the same as the one I posted but without the most recent downturn post-2009...   http://i.imgur.com/sTUElSg.png     I am absolutely STOKED about the new Google algorithm. Though it may not (at least at the start) be sophisticated enough for the climate debate, since it uses the three-point verification and a lot of misinformation is just slightly too subtle to be covered like that.   BUT the outlets that publish untrue stuff that it does pick up also publish climate misinformation, so hopefully there will be some cross-over perks...   Not sure what exactly you're asking, but I think the answer is the [various paleoclimate proxies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_%28climate%29)?

Fall colors like orange, mustard, browns, and navy's will be nicely paired with these. You wouldn't necessarily have to match a suede jacket with these. I could imagine these being paired nicely with a slim lighter grey chino, or of course a nice jean with a taper. Maybe a dark solids on top (cardigan?).    How much did you have to do with the creation of the character that is now Dwight?    How's Tammy #2 doing anyway, Ron?   Wait... I thought circlejerk was a text only subreddit.... WAT?

 Thank you for not making this a fun fact post   Not that i disagree Iron Man 2 wasn't good, but that was a sequel that didn't carry much weight in the Marvel universe, while Man of Steel kicked off the DC universe with much less than a bang.   Can't Hold Us by Macklemore was fucking everywhere at one point.   True.....but fuck the eagles anyway!!!   Fucking fletcher actually does something fuck! DEFENSE PLEASE!   Are the eagles a fucking marching band, they are just marching down that field   Woah really thought RG3 went down   We are just giving  away yards to Ertz,   Secondary: Yo Ertz you need some yards?  Ertz: Uhhh sure you guys gonna cover me still?  Secondary: Helllllll nah, take em   Yeah I feel an turnover coming    An interception would be a nice dagger    A nice dose of reality, fucking defense   Did no one else hear Gannon say play cock!   Sooooo play cock amiright?   Nope!   Fucking epitome of facepalm   I'll take an interception with a side of pick 6   While I do agree they need a better oline, they haven't been doing that bad today. Secondary though......yeah   Even if we win this game on some miracle pick 6 Haslett needs to go   Wow everyone but Breeland needs to be gone on this secondary   Right in the hands gotta bring that down    I Origins was a pleasant surprise this year.   Me too, great film   Also Dicaps in Catch Me if You Can   I asked him this question in his AMA, I'll probably frame this an put it next t all of my accomplishments   We sell quilts at discount price Livin in an Amish paradise!   Hey Nick! I remember hearing you on the Nerdist podcast and you told Chris what you an your family do at home and like him I couldn't stop laughing for 20 minutes. Anyway just wanted to say you're hilarious, how are those guys down at Nerdist?   Which do you prefer, Chubby Pratt or Six Pack Pratt?      Wow all these comments and I haven't seen it once  sigh, I guess I'll do it   'Chicken Parm you taste so good'   *listen closely    I feel it will go   Lose to Colts: It wasn't his fault defense lost us that game, similar to RG3's game against the Texans  Lose to Giants: Ehhh could be better, he's not good, but not horrible, keeps under throwing Desean.   Lose to Eagles: PUT RG3 IN THE FUCKING GAME!  Lose to Cowboys: Well Fuck   Please Mr. Apocalypse  Oh oh I don't wanna die in deep space  	32
 let me know how you do, dont burn the house down.   This was from about 10 yards. I started out from farther back but ended up moving in closer cause I wasn't doing well. Its really fun. I noticed the flame goes out if the pellet is at lease about an inch away from the flame.    Agreed, Title sucks too.      I really dig your style. My last name is also Turner and I also have a similar style. Turners rule.   You should post this to R/wallpapers.    This is pretty cool. Nice find      I think it helps to turn the brightness down on your TV. If that doesn't work try sitting father away from the TV. Or maybe try some motion sickness pills?   No problem   I ended up making that tutorial. I broke the one in this picture and figured it would be good opportunity to show the process. [ENJOY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiklhUbSCVg feature=youtu.be)   The vics where just some extra pills I got. I usually do methadone and Xanax, that's my thing. And oxys and anything else good when I can get my hands on it. I try to stay away from APAP but these vics where free.   Believe it or not, those red speckles are the hydrocodone. The rest of the white is all APAP. I've been board before and tried to separate them. Long story short. Not worth it.    Thanks, only certain people recognize that when they look at my table. Theres all kinds of stuff like that all over it.   I don't but I could make some and post it. Now that I think of it I really should share my plans because its amazing how effective it is. The difference is like popping a balloon with a pin and untying the knot and letting the air out slow. PM me if you need the plans asap. But I will make some and post it on this sub.   Defiantly let it pass through. I did a lot of research/ trial and error before coming up with this. What happens when the bullet travels through the tube air is escaping out the holes and you want as much of that air to go away as possible so do away with the inner tube. Tried it and it works way better.      Yes the silencer is functional and work VERY well at suppressing the sound. It is modeled from how a real suppressor is made and works but with much less expensive material. The barrel is made from 3 aluminum cans (short v8 cans) and the 3 air breaks are made from 3 aluminum energy drinks that have a screw on cap. I also hot glued cotton around the chambers to further reduce the noise which works great. Its amazing the difference. It fits nice and snug with no screwing thanks to a sharpie pen that fits into the 1/4 inch hole after the muzzle. Anymore questions let me know.   Thats for taking the time to take the picture! Thats a sweet set.             I got the shaker and glass from a friend that gave it to me when he moved but thats all I got, no shot glasses. What do those look like? I use it all the time/ Best free thing I've ever gotten.      I think its fun as hell. It has 3 fail/safes and isn't stupid. Maybe a little dangerous but that's what makes it fun. You rocket guys on here are all so stuck up. Apparently I'm the only one that thinks this is cool.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXG6HVIYnMw   [HERE](http://imgur.com/a/8ASIw) are some pics      haha I know. Once they know I have a treat they do every trick they know back to back. The tricks arn't hard to teach but obedience is.      Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it!   To avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing. -Banksy      yea, the Enzo model doubles as a pizza cutter.   He looks like a mexicano   One of the fastest ways to cool off hot food off I've encountered yet. Its right up there with holding it out of a car window driving down the interstate. Without the risk of getting bugs in it.    [Cat Attack](http://i.imgur.com/Zi8QxC2.jpg) Got the cat from the photoshopBattles front page. Thought it was a good fit   [Cat Attack!](http://i.imgur.com/Zi8QxC2.jpg)         This is really amazing. I've never seen this before. Thank you for sharing the link.   Thanks you! People can be really harsh with their critics on this subreddit sometimes though. I hate when I just finish a piece that I put so much time and effort into and then just get down votes with no comments or reasons for them. I guess what i'm saying is keep your chin up if people want to be dicks. I know I have too. I think your really talented with your digital brush. Keep it up!   It's great that you took in consideration to blur the snowflakes. It gives the piece movement and makes you feel the womens chill from the wind. Nice job. I use Photoshop and paint and do stencil work but from what I know this takes mad patience.   This is exactly what I got today. 4 subs and everything! Care to share what they cost in your neck of the woods? there pretty expensive in my area.   [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/NauyCcj.jpg) is what I started from. I'm not sure what your referring to.   I prefer the cap for my type of work. I like the angled spray for stencles and obviously regular caps for actual graffiti. I'm a street ARTIST not a penis maker. I use what works I find it funny that krylon supports anti graffiti campaigns because I steal there paint and do it anyways. And as far as drips go, if your experienced enough you can control it. Go fuck yourself.  	46

Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.  I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.  You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands.  Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

 What truly repulsed me about American Psycho was its brain numbing repetition. Someone should tabulate what percentage of the text the author used to describe the designer clothing of each of his interchangeable characters. Was it five percent? No, ten percent is better estimate. Yes, I get the joke Yuppies are both predatory and superficial. For me, all the humor of the book dies long before the first victim. It seemed the graphic episodes of sex and violence had to become increasingly overwrought, as desperate attempts to hold my attention. Do not think I am a prude or especially squeamish. In my current cycle of reading, I have read Blood Meridian, Naked Lunch and JG Ballards Crash, and found merit in each of those violent and perverse works. With American Psycho, I found myself slogging to its end, my only motivation being to see if the ending made it as pointless as I expected it to be. An admission  I had seen the film adaption, and was curious if the novel had the same, disappointing conclusion. Pretty much, it did, only reading the novel took me many more, painful hours to reach it. A pity, as American Psycho does contain the elements for a potent and insightful piece of short satire.    English was not Nabokov's first language either. He was Russian exile from the Bolshevik Revolution, and I recall that he wrote novels in German while living there, before his peregrinations took him to France and eventually to the USA. English might have been his third or fourth language; if so, as does Conrad, he leaves we who scribble in our native language with a great embarrassment.   A few years ago, I decided I needed to read Lolita, as it consistently appeared near the top of the critic's list. I was already a fan of Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel, which he deftly adapted as a dark comedy. He could not have done otherwise, as the novel is one of the few great works of horror. Unlike the puerile, supernatural plot of The Shining, Lolita is a work that examines a purely human evil, and so has been untranslatable to film. I too have read American Psycho and found it disgusting: it is a clumsy, exploitive, and tedious satire. Not Lolita; Nabokov can seduce you with his lyrical prose, so that you feel you are on some scenic cruise of 1950's America. I often found myself riding along and mocking his pathetic, self-pitying narrator, when, unexpectedly, Nabokov slammed me with a sledgehammer, a brief and causal observation to remind me that I was inside the mind of a very plausible monster.  It is a difficult book, but rewarding as a rare insight into how a twisted mind excuses its depredations. For those who finish it, I would recommend reading a critical review of the novel afterward. Doing so, I found had completely missed some key aspects, and was left further amazed at Nabokovs subtle approach to horror.    Along its coast, California continues to witness signs and wonders. This beach at San Diego appears almost biblical in its portent. Those who advocate the creation of a Greenhouse Earth often cite the pause in global warming as evidence that any climate change catastrophe will not occur for several more election or business cycles. Some climatologists dispute that any significant pause has occurred while others hypothesize that much of the greenhouse heat has been accumulating in the deep oceans. From Nature, 2014:  The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. These winds normally push sun-baked water towards Indonesia. When they slackened, the warm water sloshed back towards South America, resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as El Nio. Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998  and then the warming stalled  Scientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as Novembers Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. You cant keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific, Trenberth says. At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back. And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.  http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-the-case-of-the-missing-heat-1.14525       Are they culturing mammalian cells to produce this artificial meat? If so, scaling up the process would be a continuous challenge, as cell culture requires stringently sterile procedures to prevent contamination by opportunistic bacteria, fungi, etc. The current beef industry is heavily dependent on antibiotics, which are becoming ineffective, and at least a cow has an immune system. My favorite ice cream manufacturer is currently on hiatus, as it attempts to cleanse its facilities of Lysteria, so I am skeptical of the commercial viability of artificial meat.      I do not kill any snails found in the vegetable garden. I re-locate them to the compost heap. Techno-optimists like Stewart Brand believe that the species that we have driven to extinction will be resurrected through cloning, but they only propose this for charismatic creatures like the wooly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. They have not imagined the need for a 'Gastropod Park'.  	7
 Remember that even in the darkest times you are loved. I love you. Everyone in r/anxiety loves you! You can push through whatever it is you are going through.   Please respond to me.    Hey! Don't go do anything crazy friend. Wanna talk?    I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. - Frank Herbert, Dune  It's more of a quote than a short phrase but it's always helped me.     Yeah, I agree.    Yeah, I remember after my test driving became a lot easier. No pressure when your by yourself.    Most TED talks nowadays are like this.   Holy fucking shit dude are you me? You pretty much explained exactly how I feel. I am constantly scared of HIV. I had a drunken night with a shady girl, got tested and was negative. Yet now after a night of drinking wherein I got blackout drunk, I am convinced that I somehow got infected through a needle or something. It's like no matter what happens, I'm always going to be anxious about having a serious disease. My lymph nodes have also always been enlarged. I feel like I get all the exact symptoms of HIV. It's crazy. It's literally my worst fear to get it.   The point is though, we don't. We simply don't have it. If you were to get tested, you would just move on to something else to worry about. The problem isn't HIV, cancer or meningitis, the problem is your anxiety. I feel like a lot of the time you get fear mongering advice like "always get checked, found a lump? get checked. GO TO THE DOCTOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY". You know what I think of that advice for people with hypochondria? fuck it. That type of advice is for people who never worry. When you have anxiety or hypochondira, the only thing you can truly do to sort yourself out is to go to a doctor and get your anxiety sorted out! It is literally a mental illness and it will fucking ruin your life way worse than any disease would.   I'm in the same boat as you dude. However I try to realise that anxiety is the issue here not the diseases. This quote is really meaningful to me http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Walter-White-Quote-On-Spending-Your-Whole-Life-Being-Scared-In-Breaking-Bad.jpg.   Hope you read this! :)   Chapter 19: Worrying about chapter 20   I BE RUNNIN THROUGH THE 6 WITH MY WOES. UNOHOWDASHITGOES   That's exactly like how I felt. Your mind just feels so clear and unclogged. I'm clearly no expert but I feel like anxiety is a problem that only modern society really ever gets. There is no significant biological difference between humans now and humans for the last few thousand years but humans for the last few thousands of years have actually had to do physical activities just to survive. Whereas now people sit down on a computer working 9-5 jobs and then go home and watch Netflix just feeling miserable. Biologically, we need to do physical activity to stay healthy. Technology has just fucked it up for us which is why you got to find the time to do exercise outside of work.  	11
 OMG! You are literally the cutest thing ever! 3 Whats your ring size?   lol, yeah..   I'm sure everyone here will be saying the same thing, but fuck those people! Like what you like, and don't be ashamed of it. If you lose friends because of the music you listen to, then they aren't the kind of friends you want to keep around. OR, they may respect you for being unashamed of it, and like you more. It may even open their eyes to the genre. "Well, they like EDM, and they're cool, so maybe EDMs not so bad." Or, and this isn't recommended, but if you wanna be more passive with it, just play it off as a joke. If they catch you listening to electronic music and laugh at you, just be in on the joke. They'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you all have a good time. The best way to deal with a bully is to laugh with them, as opposed to letting them laugh at you.   You look amazing   Sexy doesn't even begin to describe you   Itd be a crime to not post it :)   You totally do. The question is, which Alex are you going as? Prison Alex? Orange or Khaki? Rockabilly Alex? etc.   I downloaded one of my favorite DJs sets from (I think EDC last year) and he opened with "they call me (his name)" and it made me cringe, cause that's just such a douchey thing to say. I love his music, but sometimes he just says douchey things.   The greatest song in the world. Duh...   I'd love to taste your frosting ;)  	10

 :-)  thanks for checking up on me.  Its not fixed yet.  MB and processor got fried.  I think I'll have it replaced soon though.    Moderately sure you havent seen the actual video in question, so you dont know what you are talking about.   you telling me he didnt pay for that black belt?   I used to see them often as a kid.  I havent seen any in decades.   IIRC, this makes for a great repost/oc complaint gif.  Haven't seen it in years, but I'm certain this is it.  The guy with the stalled bike is "oc" while all the reposts are flying past him.

As someone originally from the NorthEast, it was a bizarre concept to wrap my head around.  Seeing is believing.   I was in agreement with everything until the last paragraph:   Ultimately, The Joker arguably carries the whole thing off just to prove how clever he is, but its difficult to claim youre an agent of chaos when you put quite that much work into making sure that absolutely everything goes your way  even if its never entirely quite clear exactly what your way is.  The Joker has historically been a criminal mastermind who revels in the chaos he causes around him.  I dont see how that has anything to do with the fact that he has multi-leveled formulated plans.   I suggest you not underestimate the staggering drawing power of the Garden State, and show up two hours in advance.   Like the mastery of so many things in life, it takes continued practice.

Some outstanding points:  1. we dont know anything about the video encoding/bitrates you are trying to playback. 2. we dont know anything about the throughput from your NAS. 3. You say the videos dont playback, and so you "invariably rip a higher bitrate version"?  Some things to do:  1. Get file transfer stats to/from your NAS.  On windows, this is a very small/convenient tool:  http://www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1.html 2. Test against another Plex client.  Some additional things to check out:  1. http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76 t=77444 2. https://www.google.com/search?q=ReadyNAS+Pro+video+playback    this is only container/audio info.  what is the video encoding?  what are the bitrates involved?   It looks like an indoor entrance to an outdoor pool. I've seen similar at mountain resorts.  Its also similar to the separate male/female entrances to shared spa pools.   Let them kick our butt in skyscrapers.  They have way more people than we do, and they are killing themselves.   Oh wow, I never saw those come up on my front page.  Thanks for the links.   Interesting!  Thanks for the info.   Thank you so much for your help!      Does this happen with direct play or transcoding?  I have a Samsung UN60H6350 (quad-core), and I am able to playback highly-encoded videos just fine - but saying that in a non-technical manner is kind of meaningless.  Specs are what will tell you if something is a yay or nay in terms of compatibility.  Can you give us any additional details about the encoding of the videos?  Are you making them yourself?  Perhaps you can re-encode in a manner that is more compatible with your specific TVs decoding capabilities.  As an example, I can easily direct-play across a 802.11g WLAN from a c2007 Sony VAIO Core 2 Duo - and that thing is an outdated piece of crap.  I can transcode too, but it beats the hell out of the processor (100% pegged).   If having to transcode from it, I run scripts to stop all sorts of things from running on it (tasks and services) to drop it to the greatest amount of processor availability I can.  I honestly think your problem is with the coding of the videos specifically.  Something is probably out of spec there.   could be.  a bunch of it was shot in LA.   that amount of blood had to be from the nose.   In my experience, LA drivers are worse than NYC drivers for the same reasons you have listed.   people who are too nice?  surely you mean people who fake being nice.

Otherwise, what you are saying is just lip-service.  Document the bedbugs as well, and show them the documentation - *dont just talk about it*.   They should be highly motivated about the bedbugs because of the risk of infestation and spreading.  The allergens as a proved health risk should also motivate them.  You can then use that same documentation against them if you decide to escalate the matter.   The Joss Whedon portion of the interview runs from 2:30 - 30:30.      Poseidon hates them!   Thanks for your reply.  No cropping on my part - whats shown is the full extent of the image (it was a still image, not a moving image).  Its from one of the Evangelion "rebuild" movies, and is an image that is shown very briefly during some dramatic dialog, so I cant help but wonder if there is some hidden meaning/text that goes beyond simply "crew room" or "crew compartment".  I wonder that sometimes a word or two in Japanese means one thing, but has similar pronunciations that mean something else that is more devious.   [http://i.imgur.com/QRyWLKv.png](http://i.imgur.com/QRyWLKv.png)  The location of this sign is on a train.  I believe part of it says "crew compartment", but I cannot translate the rest.  Any help would be greatly appreciated and may better help understand what is going on in the scene.    crew compartment  I agree that is part of it, but I think there is more   Thats still an expensive key.

 i'd recommend just meditating. Don't try and do anything advanced just sit in a comfortable spot, if you have it the put on some calming soft music at a relatively low volume. Sit down in your comfortable spot, it should be somewhere where you can relax and no one will bother you, though if you can then try and have atleast some sunlight coming down on you.  After you find somewhere that works, sit down, with your music on and sit in whatever position is most comfortable. I sit in the classic cross-legged "buddhist" position but it really doesn't matter so long as you're comfortable, you can relax, and your spine's straight. Speaking of which, when you sit down. Make sure to keep your spine straight, this is very important and should never be neglected.  After you sit down in a comfortable position close your eyes and begin breathing slowly. Inhale for two seconds through the nostril, hold the air in for two seconds, exhale for two second, and keep the air out for 2 second. Repeat this cycle while clearing your mind of stray thoughts. The way I do this is by recognizing a thought in my brain and simply easing it away, once your mind is clear begin relaxing your body, continue breathing deeply and straighten your spine while concentrating on a body part and visualizing it slowly dissipating into nothingness. start out by doing this to your fingers and then your arms, feet, legs etc until your entire body is relaxed.  Now that you're relaxed simply continue to breath and keep your mind clear of stray thoughts. If you had any objectives then you should do them now. Keep your mind clear, your spine straight, and your breathing stable for about 15 minutes. After a decent amount of time has passed while you're relaxed slowly begin to move your body parts, wiggle a toe or a finger and slowly bring yourself out of the meditative state.  After the meditation I'm usually a little sore from sitting for so long so just get up and walk around a bit, eat some food and have something to drink.  Don't worry if you can't do all this on your first try. It took me several weeks of meditation to be able to do it regularly. Once you can do this easily and quickly (5 minutes or less to get to meditative state) then you should be able to do most other rituals.  Resources for [spells](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Magick.html), [meditations](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Meditation.html), and rituals can be found [here](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/HOME.html)  If you have any further questions then feel free to PM me.   And humans are.... Not bald apes?   Wat   ^teehee   I'm in a similar situation, I've beaten the game 10 or so times now, I've gone good legion, bad legion, good NCR, bad NCR, Good house, Bad House, all 3 independents, I've played through all DLC 15 or so times. I've reached lvl 50 3 times and my first save has every unique weapon and all the gold from the sierra madre as well as all locations visited.  It took me about 100 hours to do that one save file and I have about 600 hours altogether in NV but the ending...  I mean, they could've just released a DLC to continue it like they did with 3. I think the reason they didn't do it was because it was too ambitious. They'd have to make hundreds of different version of the mojave because even doing something slightly different changes the ending. To measure up they'd have to make sure your decisions are reflected everywhere. That'd take way to much time and way to much money for one $15 DLC to make it worthwhile.   Fallout: New Vegas. The game was amazing and definitely ranks up there in my top 10 games of all time. Probably my top 5 even, but when I finally beat Lanius and general Oliver congratulated me I expected something... More, it just plays the epilogue and you have to go back to a save from before the battle at hoover dam. This was exactly what people didn't like about Fallout 3 and I understand they didn't have a post game because of time-restraints but....  I wish they had atleast had a DLC which continued it. The ending was okay, but in comparison to the rest of the game it just left me feeling empty and wanting more.      *Sips mountain dew out of goblet.*   That is super easy, omegle sends your IP through video and that can be traced to a city. I've done it myself a few times, super funny for trolling. They get so freaked.  All you need is wireshark and the ability to know how to use it.  Edit: [Here's a video about how to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgAZuh5FPg)   This made my fucking day.   Oh. So the government should be allowed to run up massive amount of debt and pay none of it back while I would A: get my knees broken. Or B: Have to declare bankruptcy? for doing the same?  Seems legit.   Learning how to make a stable budget is important. In fact, it's so important that the government has to do it!   ...Oh wait...   They're scaled down in that a martial artist can't just punch a hole through the universe, (a la kame sennin ryu) The fighters can use all the super duper techniques they want but can only apply as much force and speed as an Olympic level human. The guy you're talking about, (no idea who he is BTW) could use his aikido but he would only be able to do it as quickly as a normal human being, he couldn't jump 50 feet in the air he could jump 5, He couldn't punch through a concrete wall but he could punch through an interior wall.  If a certain ability couldn't be used by someone who lacks the superhuman strength of that character then the character simply can't use it.   Every real martial art including all major styles fights along with all fictional martial arts. All martial arts gets the greatest ever practitioner of the art to represent them, if a martial art has it's practitioner be stronger than a normal human athlete (IE: Kenshiro or Goku), they will be scaled down to only be able to do what a olympic athlete human can do. Ki blasts are allowed but they can't be any stronger than a punch and take twice the effort of throwing that punch physically.  If a martial art involves the use of weapons as a requirement (Like kendo or fencing) they will be given a standard quality version of the weapon made of either metal or wood, however, martial arts which have weapons as optional (Like aikido) are not given weapons and are only allowed to use their fists.  No rules are enforced so hits to the groin and gouging of the eyes are perfectly fine.  The arena is a large, flat stadium with more than enough room for all competitors.  Round 1: All real martial arts in a team VS all fictional martial arts in a team.  Round 2: Free for all, all martial arts against each other, alliances can be formed but only one can stand at the end.  Round 3: free for all in which fictional martial arts are no longer allowed to use any form of ki/energy attacks.  Round 4: All competitors are given SMG's, Automatic shotguns, and chainsaws, which art lasts the longest.   Kenshiro, he dies in the first episode from bleeding after Shin cuts his arms and legs.  Alternatively, Toki dies when he gets his legs get smashed from the boulder after he fell down the cliff with raoh.   Man, you need to check your facts. He was way taller, i heard he was like, twelve stories high.   Actually, I'll one up you and say the doctor **does** exist. Just not in this universe.  If you go off multiverse theory then every possible eventuality has happened, is happening, and will happen. So, the doctor has to exist hundreds of trillions of times, but in all likelihood he just doesn't exist in this universe.   Leave any questions you have about satanism or Satan below and one of the mods will answer promptly.   I myself am in a very similar situation to yours. I too live in a christian household and I'm thus, unable to perform any rituals beyond meditation before bed. What I'd recommend is thus. If you want to contact your guardian demon, either find a time when your family is gone and perform a summoning ritual then. Or try and astral project. By astral projection you could seek the guidance of a guardian demon. However, what I would most strongly recommend is to simply wait. You've already made admiral progress simply by recognizing these truths and by partaking in power meditations, no one expects you to do anything more. Simply keep meditating and wait until you're old enough to move out of your families house.   And the sky will begin raining money as pigs fly by.   This is the only real answer.   Yes! I haven't finished it but I got it for free a while back. I honestly prefer it to fallout 1 (though not fallout 2) as though it isn't as deep it is a lot more fun. I really like the multi-person squad and with more people and faster paced gameplay it can really fun at some points.   Well, Not saying I agree with them. but airplane tickets cost so much that you should get bigger seats then what they give you.   [NOTHING AT ALL.](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/15/1599e06bd7b11b9d1e3d414c4cfb97bd3ad4ed044ac06d4ec5625cf4d0d224ec.jpg)   I don't think I eat that much in a fortnight.   I too enjoy human beans. They are delicious.   only to the main question. not to comments on the question.   Being a magician/warlock just means you use ritual to somehow gain power. Aesthetically being a magician/warlock just means you somehow internalize your power through ritual and end up becoming a stronger person IE: you become more motivated, you begin working out more. stuff like that. (I can't elaborate very well on the subject as I myself am a theistic satanist)  Theistically being a warlock/magician is invoking satan and his demons to help you in a task IE: Attracting money towards you through ritual. Or you use meditation to program your own aura to do something IE: make people more attracted to you. Personally I prefer the later option as it empowers you more and gives you more control.  If you have any more questions PM me with them. [Here's a list of spells that I often use in meditation but they are by no means the only spell. experiment and find what works for you. But remember affirmation is probably the best way to program your aura](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Magick.html)   *Immediately snaps afterwards.*   It's Dolomite baby!   Finally! support for my browser!   der funny's   about 8:00 PM me thinks.   I'm hoping D.C think of all the satire they could make about politics. And one of the player characters could be a politician even. the missions could be about gaining power in the political system and it could talk about how effed up the US government is. Just an idea though.   I think it should happen at 5:00 PM for you. of course thats assuming my brain can do maths.   Nope. just found image links and HTML/CSS nothing of any note. I guess we'll just have to see what happens.   Made ninja edit there.   What timezone you in? I can tell you when it will end in your timezone if I know it.   [It's a reference to a small thing in TF2. It's a joke how every time someone says there's gonna be a huge update you retort with bread.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bread)   Although it's unlikely I think that we could very well be seeing some sort of OB2 scenario going on here. Think of all the hints going on. L4D2 being free on christmas like portal 1 was before portal 2 was released, The alleged leaked screens of source 2.0, End of the line sounds like a final update to me. and now this? I'm probably wrong but I think that this right now might be the single most likely time that valve could release a new game.  And that game just might be.... ricochet 2 ^or.. ^you ^know ^~~HL3~~ ^a ^DoD ^sequel...   I don't know about you guys.... but my body's ready.  Ninja edit.  	41
 He was comically far away from the ball on that slide. I do not miss watching him play defense at all   To me, the popularity of YA novels has a lot to do with the accessibility of the emotion in them. It doesn't tend to be couched in philosophy or overly complicated (which is not to say they can't be emotionally nuanced); it's just that the characters feel in a way that resonates with how people feel.   A lot of the time in literary/more serious fiction, the book is exploring those emotions and what makes them work/how they come to pass/how we can understand those emotions more. Which is hard work that a lot of people don't want to do or are intimidated by.    That is insane.   To be fair, none of those have been articulated. He's just getting downvoted to shit.   I actually don't dislike you guys, despite the fact that we're gonna have a crazy battle in the division this year..  But Rodney I can't stand and love watching him struggle.   We're almost as bad I think.    :(    Made it to Saturday's game versus the Royals. Can't beat them lately haha.   Trout is a pretty funny guy. He's normal as hell, but that doesn't mean he has no personality.  Pujols' persona is a machine, but even then he goofs off with everybody. He's just not that way to the media because he doesn't want to be.  Have you ever seen this: http://deadspin.com/pujols-trout-mock-fernando-rodneys-arrow-celebration-1608225059  Maybe not the most eccentric thing ever done, but Angels fans loved it.   Clearly you follow the team..   Well that's a good way to honor a "classy, professional and hard working" guy; be a dick in his name.   One minor correction: Rule 5 selections are bought from their current teams for 50k, and if they do not stay on the 25-man roster for the entire year, must be offered back to their original team for half price (12.5k). They don't automatically go back to the original team.   I'm not saying your content is wrong or unwarranted; it's totally vaild analysis. Your tone is just overly hostile. It's extremely common for fans of a particular CBB team to knee-jerk and say that a guy isn't ready for the next level when they declare their intentions to leave. People wanted to see him stay (for selfish reasons), and they're upset that's not gonna happen. I'm not sure if you've read the other threads in here with players declaring, but every fan base does it. It's silly and short-sighted, but it doesn't deserve a curb-stomping.   I'd argue that it happens more often once you get a big lead cuz then the bottom part of the bullpen starts throwing innings, and those guys are in the bottom tier of the bullpen for a reason.   I had a spiral fracture in the fifth metacarpal and never got a cast...granted I should have. But I was playing basketball again within a month.   Yeah no. It's obviously shitty but this is a bad idea. Unless you make an extremely strong case that he went out there intending to hurt a guy, you don't do this.   Andrew Luck also was in a position to turn down the money. Not everyone is blessed with the financial and familial stability to do so.   You're right, but shit man. Chill out a bit.   Kinda surprised there's no Infinite Jest in here, but I'll throw it in. Although I guess you can say stuff happens. To me, the action-to-length ratio is way way way small enough to be included here.   You have to get lucky to win in baseball. You guys got lucky last year. You're still a good team. Doesn't mean you're not lucky. You won't keep hitting .329 with a .401 OBP as a team.   Enjoy it but please don't pretend like it's anything other than what it is: a hot start.   I was at that game. Still cannot believe he threw him out. Watching the throw in person was just silly. Stadium didn't really know what happened lol.   Because there was no fielding error committed on the first play, but there was on the second play. First play is two steals, second play is a steal and a throwing error.  It's definitely not reflective of what actually happened (incompetence on both plays), but since no one physically misplayed the ball, there is no error. A similar situation is when a fly ball drops between two people who both thought the other person had it. Obviously it should've been caught, but no one dropped/missed it, so it can't be counted as an error.  TLDR: Fielding errors have too narrow of a defintion, so sometimes people get rewarded with stats even though dumb plays were made.   I think 7:00 PST, not EST.   That moment. Makes me cry every time.   Thank you for someone knowing that. I work at a university, it's astounding how many people think you can do stuff like that.   Yeah haha it was really annoying.  Honestly what did us in was our batting average with RISP. 2 for 25 on the series. That's just not gonna get it done, ever, in any circumstance.   Oh I just hate Aoki cuz of his catches in Game 2. Both of them were miracles and he taunted our crowd after both. Which I'd love against anyone but my team and now hate him for   We're taking you down this weekend, and getting a tiny little shred of revenge for the ALDS..  But seriously your team is so much fun it's hard hating you. Especially now that Aoki is gone, dude was a clown in Game 2.   Dude he did a great job this year. Not saying the best job, but it's far from indefensible to choose him. His team was predicted 9th in the Big 12.   I'd be curious to see who was off by more percentage points in each game's win probability. Although that sounds like lots of arithmetic.   The score is still Q to 12, by the way.   Thank you. Thank you so much.   Why have I never heard of this. This is so cool.  They also stream all the games here: http://pit2015.net/  Sooo I know what I'm doing this weekend.   Well, that is the main problem with a 3-2 anyway, and why you almost never see it run.   You did write it in an odd, kinda confusing way. To be fair.   Perry Ellis, called consistent. Literally never thought I would see or hear that.  EDIT: Why is this being downvoted again? He was crazy inconsistent for a long time.   They go to the NBA last year, they already got paid and they'll continue to get paid while they rehab and/or work on their game while riding the bench.  They could just as easily have gotten hurt this year. More easily probably, considering they played way more minutes at UK than they would've in the league.   He got a concussion.   Not to be a dick, but since we're talking about words and all...  hijacked*   Yes you are   There are arguments to be had both ways, and honestly, both sides have merit. Whatever ends up happening will have people claiming confirmation of one side over the other. The best answer is we don't know, but they certainly could have done a lot worse, and there's not many people who would've been better hires.   I get the reasons why it would happen, it's still bananas that they have a winning record in the second round even though most of the time they're playing a 4 seed.   Florida lost a lot but brought back a good bit too.  On paper Maryland looks real good next year. We'll see how it shakes out   Florida was preseason top 10 this year and finished below .500. He's saying it doesn't mean shit. Although KenPom disagrees.   Yeah I see why you used the numbers you did. I didn't even think about the S-curve there, although you're right. Bracketing principles usually keep it from being totally implemented though, don't they?  Wow, 16-15? That's crazy that 12 seeds have a winning record in the second round.   I'd argue the 12 or 13 has just as good of a path, if not a better one, seed wise, in the first weekend at least.   Didn't see Delon Wright for a second and got confused.    Super happy Jerian Grant made first-team, he deserves it.   Jeez a 3 seed? For a team that lost twice in a major conference?   Debate how you will about the ACC vs. Big East. I think the ACC is definitely better; that much better I don't think I'd agree with.  We can agree to disagree about being impressed with Nova. It's quite possible that you and I just watched them on different days and saw different things. Your opinion was certainly vindicated as much as it can be in a single-elimination tournament. I just stand by the reasoning that NC State is an extremely talented basketball team who can beat anyone when playing well, Villanova played awful, and they still almost won the game.   NC State deserving to win and Nova being overrated are two entirely different things.  You guys have an incredibly talented but inconsistent basketball team, one that beat Duke earlier this year. Villanova played their worst game of the season.   You guys won by 3..   I didn't want to like that but I did because it's so damn true   It's been realllllly sloppy. But intense, sure   That one's a good possibility. But the chances of everyone rolling through the first weekend without playing a close game are slim.   At least someone will have a close game, it's almost guaranteed   You guys will be in the conversation next year. Beau Beech is awesome   Honestly most people would've been pretty OK with switching your team and Dayton.   HEY BRACKET, NONE OF US ARE EVEN CLOSE TO HAVING YOU FILLED IN RIGHT, WHICH IS WAY LESS THAN I CAN SAY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER   Sorry man :(   Hampton coach, Hampton   That was the only game of that tournament UConn deserved to lose.   I seriously doubt it, given the level of discourse at ESPN sometimes.  It would be an awesome thing though.   Yeah, I found myself making the assumption that it couldn't be Dawkins because of the K connection, but it's all I can really see.    It seems like the institutional resources would be there if you guys can put it together though.   Sooo, Stanford?   That's what I was saying haha. I don't see OSU being able to pull it off at all. The only reason I gave them any shot is because it's March, and I've put my foot in my mouth enough times. If they're gonna do it, that's what needs to happen: Amir Williams playing like a man possessed, and Russell going off. Chances of that? Slim at best.   Cool, good analysis  EDIT: I'm more than happy to have a conversation, and there's a great chance I'm wrong about a lot of things, but that's just a dumb comment.   Some of these whistles are straight ridiculous haha.   Tustin. I feel like I remember playing you guys once or twice   Hoping they realize lots of people are watching and take steps to correct it.   Dee Dee, get out of my lah-bore-ah-tore-e!  Omelet du fromageeeeeee   Yeppp hahah. I mean I went to Tustin, we were solid at that time but we weren't a serious contender.    Seriously no clue haha.   Amir Williams would need the game of his life, and Arizona would have to be ice cold from the field. Also I'm just assuming that anyone who picks Ohio State to win a game is assuming Russell will drop at least 25 in that game.   I think he was going for Cyclone but that was my first thought too lol   It amazes me that you have Michigan State and ND in the Final Four and only put up an 847.   I know that feel, we played Kawhi Leonard when he was in high school. Destroyed us.   They had their best player, 7 footer Robert Upshaw with NBA talent, kicked off the team in December and then nosedived into badness.  Saying they played a bunch of crappy teams and nosedived is just not knowing what happened this year at all.    if they aren't playing well, they can easily lose early.  I'd hope that goes without saying..   Those games are 50/50. I wouldn't beat yourself up over it too much, pick the teams you like best. I have three 9s and an 8, but realistically, any of those teams can win. None of them are horrible match-ups for the other, and none of them are over or under seeded too much.   I have them in the Elite 8. It's not an easy road at all, but they have the best player in the regional in Kris Dunn. That's a damn useful thing   You mean Sweet 16? They're on the same side of the regional, they have to play before then.   Indeed, thanks! This is probably the thing I'll be most excited about today until the tournament starts hahaha   Just my thoughts haha. Look, gun to my head, I'm taking Kentucky. But those two things make Wisconsin a very tough team. That's essentially them firing on all cylinders.   And your 7'6" center   I'm not really buying the haven't faced an elite team deal.   Wisconsin has played one elite team, Duke, who they lost to at home in a great game.   Kentucky has played one elite team, Kansas, who they eviscerated before Kansas had really figured out how to play together.   Virginia lost to Duke at home in a great game.   Duke won at Virginia and at Wisconsin, easily the best two wins this season, but also lost to/played close games against teams much their inferior.   Arizona played one, a home win against Gonzaga in OT. Gonzaga obviously played the same one.  Each of these teams, with the exception of Duke, has 1 elite game. Which half of them lost. Why does that all the sudden make them head and shoulders above Villanova?   They're not terrible. I don't think you guys will lose to them. But they're not terrible.   Fox is pushing that angle because they want to raise the value of their properties (the Big East). If everyone thinks it's a joke, no one will bother heading to FS1 to watch it. So when ESPN says the Big East is overrated, Fox needs to push back with why they would say that.   Oh I don't think they will beat you. They just absolutely have the talent to do so.   So is his last name really pronounced Toke-O-Toe like Jay Bilas and the rest of ESPN says it? I have a visceral reaction to it every time, cuz I feel like it should be pronounced Toko-Doe...  these are the things I think about   If Duje plays like that in the tournament and Traevon comes back and plays effectively, I might even favor you over Kentucky. Maybe.   It's a tough regional, but they're definitely talented enough to do it. They can match-up with anyone in the region too.   Both offensive juggernauts, but Gonzaga has size in a way Iowa State can't really match, would be my quick take. But Iowa State has a way of getting on these unstoppable runs. Depends what you trust.   Just walk around in between games and you're golden  	92
 But he's not helping everyone but the muslims, he's not helping anyone but christians because those are the people who helped him. His efforts are focused on providing people who saved his life relief. Jesus he's not well jesus, he can only do so much. He's like 90, he's not saying oh f muslims they will be fine on their own, he's stating he is trying to help those he can with his current abilities.    Does anyone have the bank meme showing clearly that of the top 5 banks in the world asians run 3 of them? in not a single jew runs one.    Wow the utter level of antisemitism on this thread.     MODS REMOVE THIS HEATHEN NOW   Anyone who mention's lil Wayne as a a good example of hip hop kill yourself.       No............  Yes ok i searched for two minutes and ran to reddit. I'm a fucking addict for this site man, do you not understand this, it's hard so fucking hard. I need to post. Forgive me.    No i started researching what they stated. Only found strawman arguments and biased sites then came here.    I am lazy and fat. Don't come and trigger me bitchboy. In no i don't think veganism is hard, i do think it's annoying when people use hyperbole to debate subjects.    True but it's better to use reddit. Plus much more informative, then a dry read, if i wanted to read a wiki i would of done it myself.    If anything i'm trying to enlighten myself. Your answer however is nothing more then outright rudeness.           "You may have not have had a chance to read my edit on the previous post, but I will mention it again here. If you have the legal right to do something, you don't need to petition a court to carry it out." Once again that's not how it works, seceding is not legal right framed into the constitution, that's why if you reread my post you see my clearly pointing out they would have a very good legal case to argue they can secede from the union. It's not inherent.   "And, second, if the Court miraculously sided with the South, the North was now in a political pickle that would undermine their ability to deny the South's legitimacy." Now you're getting it. The right of secession being fought in the courts would of been a nightmare scenario for the union, Lincoln was extremely lucky the question was settled on the battlefield instead of court. Which brings me back to how heavily the south fucked up by going the war route instead of holding fire.  Nope midwest. In you would be correct if fort sumter was a hostile entity, look at the placement of the fort, being under threat of cannon's would be a reality if a war had already begun, like you stated previously it did not kick off until 61. If fort sumter was a threat to shipping which they were not i could agree but they were not firing upon any ships. All ships coming into port would be commercial vessels or foreign only confederate naval vessels the few that did exist would possibly be faced with fire in this is only later in the war.      http://news.yahoo.com/5th-century-mosaic-adorned-elephants-cupids-141900196.html    Yes because ol lincoln is the king of the us and he has the god ordained ability to force the supreme court to keep the union intact. Do southerners not understand the 3 branches or what? regardless of what lincoln believed or not if this went to the supreme court in the south was in the right his protest would be null and void.  The forts were voluntarily surrendered because either they were housed by confederates/southern sympathizers or not given direct orders to hold the fort. Once again just because you declare an intent to secede does not make it so, they did not dissolve the union. The civil war was the deciding factor in rather or not the union would be dissolved, you seem to believe if someone declares something it is automatically law.  Link some info on how it threatened shipping lanes. You mean they were in effect blockading and besieging a federal fort from resupply? how is that peaceful?! he told them they were coming so they would not be stupid and fire upon the ships. That's the exact opposite of invading that shows he clearly did not want them to misconstrue relief as invasion.    In god i need breakfast lmao that last post ugh wtf anyway um once again the question of rather or not they were sovereign was a constitutional issue not a inherent right. They had the right to take it to the supreme court not secede in begin seizing federal territory.     That's cute. Jennifer Lawrence, heroic lead role of one of the biggest franchises in cinema to date. Gets paid more then Chris pratt now explain to me why does this exist? because it's about the box office that's all that matters in Hollywood. Point to a single case where a woman makes less then a man in Hollywood? you don't because salaries are not even published unless they choose to release the info. Being a actor is not a set pay scale, theirs no way to determine or make a report on wage gap since they do not get wages god how can people be this stupid.   Furthermore we do not know what she got paid for american hustle, you're referring to "point" she got 7 compared to christian bale's, renners and other's 9 points. This is intellectually dishonest to say she got paid less because she has a pussy in they have a penis. First, Lawrence had a minor, supporting role in American Hustle. This is just a fact. Cooper has the Hangover Series, among other hits, which hold the #1 and 2 spot on the highest grossing comedies of all time. Between them, they probably have over $4 billion in box office hits and are big, international draws. The contract for this film was probably made in 2012 or early 2013, which was just after Renner's The Avengers and during which time Lawrence only had the first Hunger Games under her big box office belt.  A lot of Renner's scenes were cut, including the original final scene.  He was originally a much more central figure, and the only really sympathetic character. His part was as big as Bale's and Cooper's in the shooting script, I believe. None of Lawrence's stuff got cut, I don't think, which is why she feels so big in the movie, but she's definitely more of a supporting roll.  It became clear that the Amy Adams storyline would be the central focus, and that Renner would be more of a supporting role (as he is a real person and a lot of his stuff was expository).  Cooper's role increased as a result of the plot shifting to Adams and Bale more exclusively (he's essential to that part of the story). Then the rest of his scenes with Louis CK had no chance of being cut. I believe most of the original Renner scenes were with Bale (whose part was also slightly smaller than originally intended, though he drives the narrative).  Also, David O. Russell really wants Renner to be seen on the level of Bale and Cooper which is probably why david o russel was pushing to get him a equal 9 points with bale and cooper, and his chops and creds merit that.   Oh 9 out of ten best actors in the last few years were men? SO????! should we start paying actors and actress the same amount because of their genitals, you sound like the people who complained when selma did not get nominated for the academy. Just because you make oscar bait and did not catch fish does not make the entire academy the equivalent to the kkk, adam sandler made 49 million because his movies are extremely profitable and because he owns the production company.  That's how he gets 49 million, think of it like call of duty. Same game every year but it makes a billion easily, why is this? it's utter repetitive crap, but guess what people buy cod and play the crap out of it. Yes they're infinitely better video game franchises but they don't have as much mainstream appeal. Hollywood is the height of this business model, if actor A brings in 700 million just because his name is in the credits and actor b only brings in 500 million and then actor c has 30 years of work, is an Oscar winner and has been nominated 30 times who do you think i will pay more? the guy who is bringing in 700 million.  Hollywood comes down to knowing what you're worth, a great example of this is charlize theron who was livid when she found out she was not making as much as co-star and told the studio she wanted the same, in guess what? they gave it to her. If you're worth 20 million dollar in 9 bloody points then call your agent up and tell them you're not filming a single scene until you get that.  It's not rocket science... oh wait i forgot according to feminist and pao women are inferior hagglers, due to their "delicate" sensibilities so they cannot properly argue for their worth or value to a prospective employer. Damned patriarchy. It's sad that all these female actresses will never be on equal footing with male costars because theirs no such thing as idk agents who negotiate your contract?   No at best it's purposefully being misleading. That's not how it works, seceding from the union would be a constitutional and rather or not it is granted in said constitution. Declaring independence and taking over federal property/territory(remember just because it sat in the midst of south Carolina does not make it their territory) if texas seceded all of those military bases are still us army and the army would have every right to refuse to hand them over. Once again this comes back to south Carolina and the confederacy jumping the gun on a legal dispute.   Now you're just being nonsensical and ignoring the law of cause and effect. The south declare it's intent to secede, took steps to do this, you already pointed out they had begun taking other federal forts and was going to take this one, that's not preventing or attempting to prevent invasion that's outright seizing territory that does not rightfully belong to you. By firing on this fort you're effectively invading union territory.   Furthermore the confederates states had no right to order any federal installation to surrender their arms. Unless the fort actively blockaded and obstructed the shipping lanes directly harming the confederacy you're using hyperbole to justify a hostile action. In we're back to speculation once again, this is why you will never win any debate, baseless speculation on what if's is not a valid argument.  In that's not how it works, you fire upon me or my person i have the full and unequivocal right to defend myself to the best of my abilities, the best case of this is with Israel, regardless of rather or not Palestinians fired munitions cause damage or casualties you're still firing upon them. Lincoln was justified in burning the south to the ground and Sherman almost did following the siege of fort Sumter. The south started the war they could of ended with one court battle.      First that's a lie. If the south had tried to leave in peace they might have actually had a chance, the right to secede goes back to the original 13 states when they ratified the constitution. At the 1787 Constitutional Convention a proposal was made to allow the federal government to suppress a seceding state. James Madison, the acknowledged father of our Constitution, rejected it, saying: A Union of the States containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound.   The ratification documents of Virginia, New York and Rhode Island explicitly said that they held the right to resume powers delegated, should the federal government become abusive of those powers. The Constitution would have never been ratified if states thought that they could not maintain their sovereignty.  In other-words had the south not jumped the gun literally and brought the case of secession to the supreme court they would have had a very good legal case based on the constitution itself to secede from the union. Instead they went to war, in the case of the legality of secession was settled when the union won the civil war.  That's not how it works, take the Ukraine situation, while crimea "voted" to join up and become apart of russia all Ukrainian weapons, ships and other state owned properties are still legally the property of ukraine. Had not the war in eastern ukraine broke out and even after it's conclusion russia shall be required to compensate or hand over the Ukrainian naval ships.  In once again this goes back to them choosing to fire on a federal fort, just because south carolina declares itself seceded does not nullify federal governments right any and all property located at said fort. They attempted to take a federal fort which under all laws is illegal and can be whittled down to a basic case of outright theft.  Furthermore you cannot invade your own territory, like i posted above the constitution provides the federal government any and all means to stop hostile elements foreign and domestic in support of the defense of the constitution. Had south Carolina allowed the resupply and went the legal route declaring this a invasion of their now sovereign territory and suing the federal government they would have had a much better chance in the long run.  Now you're going into what if scenario's but even if Lincoln was dead set on invading regardless the south legally would have been on a higher ground and the support for the war would be completely different. What the north and even slave owning states saw was domestic secessionist force hostile to the federal government fire upon federal territory instead of Lincoln being the big bad invader like the southerners like to postulate it showed the supposed defenders of their homes firing the first hostile shot turning a legal dispute into a outright war. Thank you for acknowledging this.     The majority of southern people think the civil war was fought over states right and that this is the actual confederate flag not the battle flag. In otherwords people are stupid, it does not matter how you identify with a flag, the flags popularity and resurgence stems from racism and pro-segregation with a origin in the cause of slavery. I don't care if 40 years from now germans will identify the nazi swastika with pride in being german it is still a racist symbol so get over it.  it's not to extremes it's the most logical comparison if any. OMG this is your problem you have the same level of b.s in your ears, you do not seek independence by firing upon a federal fort and seizing it, which if you succeeded would be another countries property. The civil war was not about independence it was about keeping slavery, stop trying to glaze over this with nice words they wanted to keep slaves, the states that succeeded announced this clearly.  That's why the secessionist movement even exist, that's why the flag exist and that's what it comes down to. Both were immoral movements, the only difference is grant being a drunk allowed the south to get federal troops removed when we should of stayed and made sure the next generation grew up not knowing their fathers and grandfathers were wrong and taught this. Instead it's been over a century in we're still dealing with the same old bull because southerners can't admit their ancestors started the bloodiest war in american history to own black people and then have the audacity to tell black people to let go of the "race card" like seriously how hypocritical and ignorant can you be. This comes down to nothing more then the fact like with japan white washing their atrocities you have a generation who either does not know or outright supports these war criminals, the only difference is southerners call this pride. If only we had not allowed history to be whitewashed.   Seriously i don't get where all this hate is coming from. While i think his newer movies are crap, i grew up on water boy and click or trick or w.e that movie with the remote was also very good. Yes some of his films have bombed hard(not financially) but that does not explain where this idea of his career fading or him being hated comes from. Is this about the rose McGowan thing? goddamn matriarchy!!!!   AMERICAN HUSTLE WAS CRAP UTTER BORING CRAP.    Wow it's almost like you had a point. Oh remind me again about what interesting/complex films chris pratt or channing tatum has done to get better box office draw? it's hollywood. Remake central. if you want more complex films then become a writer, that's not sexism, hollywood is filled to the brim with crap reboots.  Edit: downvoted me all day, my point still stands. Hollywood comes down to whoever is hot or popular, women and men get paid on what they can bring the studios, the idea of a wage gap in hollywood is hilarious, if you want more or equal money to somebody like jennifer lawrence or leo dicaprio then make the studio money otherwise shut up. Women get less lead roles yet sandra bullock made 135 million last year compared to robert downey jr's 75 million   Wtf are you talking about. That's exactly how it works RBJ went from like 500,000 thousand in iron man to 20 million in the sequel. It correlates to box office earning, if you bring in people you get paid more. No matter how many box offices you have if you start slumping then you lose that amount.   http://i.imgur.com/3vqtq.jpg cleo from one of my favorite animes and her psychotic best friend the one on the right. No wonder the laws in japan are so messed up.

In the government still refuses to acknowledge this, sorry not stating they did not suffer but i have not heard any complaints about Vietnamese mad about it, can you link information on this?    True, trail of tears is the most egregious example of this. But theirs a difference between outright genocide(think of australia with the aborigine's) versus ethnic cleansing. Theirs no doubt the colonials were trying to get rid of indians but outright genocide them is not correct on any level, they broke every treaty they ever made with the native tribes and confederacies but if they wanted to exterminate them outright they would have just kept shooting in damn making a treaty.   Natives got screwed over long before the colonist arrived, with the germs that traveled up from south america, ever looked up the civilization of north america pre- colonialism? the death from germs was catastrophic and decimated what we now believe to be 90% of the population, had not this occurred the colonialist would of been crushed due to sheer numbers, one of the explorers of early america sailed around the coast of the eastern now what we know as the us and said he saw bonfires across the entire length the eastern coast. The white man did not fight 300 years with the natives because they did not outright want to exterminate them(because they also did not want that) but it took 300 years just to beat them and even then they had to force them unto reservations at the point of artillery guns.   Congress apologized and paid restitution in the 1980's. Furthermore japanese americans served in the army during ww2 and one of their units is the most highly decorated unit in american history. While i'm sure theirs people still annoyed by it i thought any of the older generation of japanese americans feel negative towards the us flag.    Theirs a mcdonalds in the former capital of south vietnam. Peace has been made on all fronts in vietnam. I've never heard of a pissed off Vietnamese still mad about the war. Never stated we were a glowing beacon of admiration but american culture most definately is, for every terrorist in iraq who says death to america theirs a dozen listening to the newest pop hit from an american artist and visiting nyc. That's something bastions of imperialism in the past failed to due, where we rub people politically the wrong way, culturally we make up for.    Honestly do they have memorials to nazi's? lets remove these confederate memorials to.    This is semantic bullshit. I can use the same argument, to the jews the nazi swastika is  symbol of genocidal hatred of them and their entire people. To a neo nazi or german "nationalist" it's a symbol of their pride of being german, of their ancestors who fought to for their homeland of the innovations and technological leaps due to germans. You can't just say muh pride is in this flag, it's still a racist symbol despite how you try to argue people see different meaning in symbols. So do nazi's does not mean you will ever fly the nazi flag over germany again.   Um did you get this off of russia today?   I understand your post but this comes from ignorance. THE FLAG WAS POPULARIZED BY THE KKK, IT WAS A REACTION TO CIVIL RIGHTS lynyrd skynyrd and dukes of hazard came after the fact it had already been in usage for decades to support racism. This is the equivalent if a celeb tried to redeem a swastika because of it's ancient and peaceful heritage, but it just does not work. Southern pride should not be a symbol of segregation, racism or treachery to your country, this only occurred because we allowed the south to continue on their same ignorant path post reconstruction and we continue to fail to educate the younger generations about the history of these symbols.   Southern pride is racist if you base it on the concept of pride in the confederacy and your rebellious slave owning ancestors with your symbol being a flag popularized by the kkk.   Because idiot. One not the same flag in actuality. We changed it, the us flag is not the same flag that flew while we were expanding into manifest destiny and secondly horrible oppression of native americans has never been a qualification or ideal of being an american.    Vietnam has made peace with the us. Japan is an ally and they were in the wrong during ww2, middle-eastern people? like who? only isis and pro isis sunni's got screwed over when saddam fail.   Incorrect the near genocide was the result of the germs. We spent 300 years fighting a war against various tribes not outright genocide but plenty of ethnic cleansing and massacres. Sorry had to clarify this and i'm part black foot indian(no not some bullshit 1/38th my great grandfather was black foot chieftain)  	37
  Except that none of those are requirements except in that you want them.  You can starve to death, dehydrate, or freeze. You choose not to, because those things suck. But that does not make it anything less than a choice both in that moment and in the aggregate.  You don't have to have a job, you want one because the alternatives suck. You don't have to take this particular job, or keep it even when you dislike it, your alternatives just suck.  But trying to morph the fact that you don't like your choices into something meaning "I don't have a choice" is bullshit. You always have a choice.  Looking at the big picture we are slaves to those more powerful than us, to those who are providing our needs in exchange for money which we have to work for. These governments and private corperations have taken the power to produce they have taken the resources they have grown to become huge and take up all the space and by "space" I mean power distribution, the lower you are in the socio economic spectrum the more enslaved you are because to get your needs you need to be a slave to those above you. To sum it up, the governments and ruling class have taken the power and the resources and will give you some in exchange for your own enslavement. Sure you can make your own home and grow your own food  (Although very difficult) but keep in mind that they have the power and are in control, they c  Think of this analogy, organism blue is in a room with resources, organism blue takes the resources and hides them, organism blue learns to mass produce resources and keeps them all too himself, Organism blue has an offspring and dies. The offspring now inherits his resources and power to create. Organism orange is introduced to the room, organism blue proposes to orange that he will give him resources to live and also the hope of maybe one day inheriting this power and great amount of resources in exchange for orange helping blue mass produce and grow more powerful so it's orange's survival and a bit of liberty for his time effort, keep in mind "survival". Now compare this to slavery, a slave is told "help us or we'll leave you to die here in the desert." My alternative is a society where everyone contributes, and there doesn't have to be a ruling class or if there is at least not corrupt and not in all control, this way we can all contribute and we can still make scientific breakthroughs, space exploration, etc it seems much better to the current state of capitalism.  Addressing specifically what you said: you can say the same thing to a slave and try to convince him he is free, try it, say it in your head to one of those african slaves in the US in the 1800's he can starve to death, but he chooses not to because the masters give him the tiny liberty of choosing not to, he doesn't want to be a slave but his alternatives suck as well, therefore we have some choice but it doesn't change the fact that capitalism is slavery like I originally stated you are stating anything that can change my view in a valid way.  The key: If a slave is given some choice it does not necessarily mean that he is not a slave         cool-warm water.

CHEAP FOOD ADVICE (so i can come back to this later)   big   I've been getting urinary tract infection like symptoms  - pain when urinating quickly (I suspect it's from old dried up semen) the first drop causes a sharp pain inside the penis, if i urinate quickly it hurts more and will sting for a long time, if I go slowly it only hurts a little  - after urination I will have a burning sensation and after ejaculation i would have a very dry drained feeling inside the penis area, maybe inside the tube it feels very uncomfortable,  - after urination I will feel like I still need to pee, and drops of urine will come out one by one slowly for up to 10 minutes or even more sometimes even 45 minutes  - streams would sometimes be bulky and go all over the place, like a spray or double stream I would also have slow streams a lot  i'm 18 years old and a male from australia, seen several doctors which done urine and blood tests, nothing showed up, saw a urologist even got an ultrasound of internal organs.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBN1nWr3-mU the podcast   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBN1nWr3-mU the podcast         [he he he](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=moe+smile newwindow=1 safe=strict source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=GG_WUvi2MoO6iAfilYCADg ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ biw=1366 bih=643 safe=high#facrc=_ imgdii=_ imgrc=kkTuBmcqq2qxAM%253A%3BiDsvZyadfqD-YM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fstatic1.fjcdn.com%252Fthumbnails%252Fcomments%252FPut%25252Ba%25252Bsmile%25252Bon%25252Bthat%25252Bface%25252BMoe%25252B_e0b0b967e3578bc444ddee2510b6b7d5.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.funnyjunk.com%252Ffunny_pictures%252F4613167%252FCrossing%252BBridge%252F%3B223%3B200)     She knew   I never really saw the value out of voluntary work, kindness and altruism in general, I enjoy doing it but it doesn't feel like it's worth the valuable time I have on earth maybe i'm out of perspective i don't know      Luck is a concept invented by the powerful and wealthy in hope that the weak don't ask too many questions and stay hopeful   The fact that it ends and we know it and it's an eternal void of nothingness we try to find something to hold onto in the meantime nihilism seems good but then you know you have to let go of nihilism and take it RAW   Time - Pink floyd   I love big brother   tl;dr you just gotta remember to take time to stop and gaze into the abyss   I am anxious and libido goes extremely low                     To tell if a mirror is actually a mirror put your finger against it, if you see a gap then you are safe, if the fingers touch then you are being watched and should run.  http://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-a-Mirror-Is-Two-Way-or-Not   Because... we are already getting nuked since it's 2014 WHOAAAAHAHAOAOAHA      *The aristocrats*         Average is 5, I have 7.5 as well if she wants to leave for a size that is way more than the average you know it's BS   When memories from the past come across your mind surrounded by nostlagia, e.g. a friday afternoon with a warm breeze with true happiness and people you love a picture perfect moment you get to re-live a hunger for adventure close to your heart, alas life won't last forever but these memories are a reason it was worth while, gorgeous...

Hope superpowers won't go away    I was feeling a bit horny and needed to replace the saran wrap on my glans (restoring sensitivity for circumcised guys) when i felt a little "pop". A drop of liquid went out of my penis and i felt a mini orgasm. I started to get warm and for the next 30 seconds my heart started beating fast, my breathing got faster and it felt like i was having a mini orgasm for 20 seconds. Followed by a built up in release, i then orgasmed and ejaculated. Fucking hell 31 day streak i feel like crying and crawling up into a hole. I had plans and this was the perfect moment of my life to be successful at nofap. I know it doesn't count as a reset but personally i think i lose "super powers" after an orgasm  I can't describe what emotions I am feeling now but damn my life is truly a disappointing one   day 7-33 have been too easy for me in the past it was an unbeatable battle but now it's nothing   thought it was going to be something about italians using their hands to speak and sign language   As an italian http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2012/4/15/upvote.gif Edit: Thanks a for the gold, stranger   http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9s06d0Ex31rbrlneo1_400.gif   also IGF-1, blood glucose, glycogen,    what is it to be "great"and why does it matter so much? nietzsche's whole idea is to be great and to actualize one's potential   http://i.imgur.com/dxtgWah.png  donnie derko   praise the sun   http://i.imgur.com/NNtnh6y.png   Mostly paleo, cutting back on carbohydrates big time, focusing on calorie restriction and eating less in general     - [Much like this](http://documentaryheaven.com/eat-fast-and-live-longer/)   - exercise is moderate cardio (3 days a week) with a lot of walking and standing (standing desk) very little sitting  -  some moderate weight exercises 3 days a week  coffee and red wine occasionally hopefully moderate socializing walking in  nature   **My big concern is the reduction of carbohydrates, calories and eating in general**   *Can someone give me some ideas and theories as to what are the pros and cons and hopefully speak in neuroscientific and biological ways?*   specifically neurologically and biologically      Also worrying about other things like idea theft and patents  How can one actually get around to working on the idea?

Reached 31 days today and don't feel different at all. I think I found the problem. I have made myself completely asexual. My mind seems to believe that I have gone asexual rather than quitting masturbation or porn, today when I thought about fapping an intuition came from my mind like fapping is a "Disease" I maybe accidentally oppressed myself or it could possibly be some sort of flat line. from day 7-31 it has been effortless I didn't really have to try.    I'm not really leaving the option of sexual activities with women open to myself because I feel like some or whatever superpowers I have will go away if I ejaculate or orgasm.    I don't know what I am doing wrong, my past streaks that used to make it to 10 days each on average would make life a 10/10 but this streak of 31 has taken my life from the usual 3/10 to a 3.2/10   *You look extra pretty today*   O-O I don't see what's wrong with that statement?   1.

 My opinion of SeaWorld has changed from one of admiration to one of severe displeasure over the past decade.  That being said, I also understand that as a business, their goal isn't conservation or education; it's to be successful (i.e., make money).  I would just greatly prefer if their business model would change to one that doesn't rely on such abnormal habitat and social conditions for the animals.  Although, as someone who studies animals and not business, I have no idea if that's feasible.   You're right.  That chart was made by a person that was actually arguing for captivity, so I was under the impression the person know what he/she was talking about.  [Here](http://24.media.tumblr.com/b3f555b5e519089e3b6992f5718d704e/tumblr_mhq38iFRXn1rmadmwo1_500.jpg) is a chart made by a person arguing against captivity (the first one I posted was supposed to be a rebuttal to this one).  Hopefully this one makes more sense.   I wish I had saved the pie chart I saw a couple months ago breaking down how much SeaWorld spends on conservation efforts compared to other things.  I can't remember the figures exactly, but it was an extremely small percentage compared to their profits.  And they often use "rescue" as a reason to get wild animals for their collection.  The park in San Diego often takes sea lions that get trapped in fishing gear, try to train them, keep the ones that are easy to work with and release these half trained, human acclimated animals back into the ocean to get caught in fishing gear again.  And their idea of education is telling people either complete lies (such as that orcas live longer in captivity) or really simple ecological principles (the use of countershading by a ton of different animals).  So they conserve and educate just enough to have their PR team make them sound like the Savior of our oceans.  EDIT: http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/5664/graphtk.jpg  I found the chart I was talking about!  You can't even see the conservation piece (between the green and red pieces).  From the source: Roughly 0.065% of SeaWorlds annual revenue funds an entire years worth of conservation. To put that in perspective: Target gives 5% of their annual revenue to charity. That is 80 x more money than SeaWorld gives to conservation in the same amount of time.    Maple flavored sleeping pills.      NMFS gets petitions like this on a routine basis, almost always from organizations that would profit directly from the delisting of a certain population.  I personally would support the delisting of any group (population or species) that does not need to be listed (i.e., shows an ability to adapt to new human-induced pressure and is at a self-sustaining population size), but I believe most cetaceans are a permanent fixture on the ESL for many reasons (including their slow growth rates, large habitat size, high trophic level, etc.).  Commenting on petitions such as these is definitely important, but I believe that even if the scientific data says the North Pacific population is discrete and thriving, the benefits of keeping them on the ELS would outweigh any possible benefit to the petitioning group.   This happened to me a couple weeks ago with a pack of Nature's Path Organic Knockoff Poptarts.  Now I'm lamenting the karma that could have been. :'(   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7G44frRaH8   You're welcome!  I saw Blackfish the first day it came out in my city.  It was a pretty mild look into the life of Tilly, but I enjoyed it overall.  It's a great introduction into the darker side  of captivity.  I'd heard about or seen nearly everything in the movie before then since I've been interested in the topic for about as long as the director has and I think she covers a good amount of information in the 90 minutes she has to present it.  The only inaccuracy (possibly a lie, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt) is when the whale researcher says a wild whale has "never harmed a human."  In fact, there is one documented attack on a human (a surfer in California) in the 1970s that required [100 stitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans).  He survived, but I would consider that harming a human and I believe the researcher should have known about that attack.  The book [Death at SeaWorld by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/) paints a much more in depth portrait into Tilly's psyche.  The Cove is another good documentary into the captivity industry involving smaller cetaceans (mostly bottlenose dolphins).  SeaWorld is extremely good at PR and has been since the very beginning, so I don't think OP is a bad person for his or her viewpoint.  I understand your use of the word "brainwashed" in the context, but I try to believe that people who are fans of SeaWorld have put in the effort to weigh the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion than I have.  Many of the points I stated before about possible benefits are adequate, but also have stronger counterpoints in my opinion.  It's an extremely complex and emotionally-driven issue, since we can't determine how marine mammals think or feel.  We also can't quantify the benefits attained from any suffering experienced by the captive animals.  The past 40 years have definitely opened a scientific window into the world of marine mammal biology, but I would argue animals owned by corporations are no longer useful for any scientific development.  There are labs around the world that study marine mammal physiology using captive animals that live at the labs, but places like SeaWorld seem to only publish/present information on animal husbandry and breeding, which is only beneficial for their interests of keeping animals captive and sustaining a breeding population for multiple generations, with only a marginal percentage of their profits going to conservation and research.  Overall, I personally would argue against keeping marine mammals in captivity and I have a set of reasons that are unquantifiable and definitely driven by emotions, but other people would argue for captivity for another set of reasons that are just as unquantifiable and driven by emotions.  This is a heavy topic, but it's important to try to remember where people on each side are coming from and to realize that strong opinions come from a love and respect for the animals and that everyone wants what they think is best overall.   Adventure Club made a mix that contained a mashup of those two songs.  I hadn't heard the Bruno Mars song and only heard the Goyte song a couple times before and thought it was just one song until I looked at the track list.   Edit: [Link to said mix!](https://soundcloud.com/adventureclubdubstep/superheroes-anonymous-vol-1)  Somebody That I Use To Know comes in around 4:30 and Locked Out of Heaven comes in around 6:50.   I'm sort of late to the game on this post, but I'm bored so I searched "SeaWorld" on here to see what showed up.  Hopefully I can help out with your question.  I'll preface my answer my saying I spent a good portion of my childhood and early teens at SeaWorld (last time I went was maybe around '07 or '08), but as I've gotten older I've developed a pretty anticaptivity stance based on the information I've come across, particularly after the death of Dawn the trainer in 2010.  Also, I'm on mobile, so bare with me as I can't look back at either your or OP's comment, so I'll try to remember everything.   I believe OP is referring to programs such as summer camps, visiting schools, school field trips, internships, etc. when (s)he is talking about education.  I took summer camps there every summer for about a decade, when were definitely fun as a kid, but the actual animal knowledge gained from the experience was probably equivalent to a BBC documentary.  The focus was more on how the workers take care of the animals.  Therefore, I would argue that, at least in my experience with the summer camps, it's more of a recruiting/propaganda tool (Note: I'm not insisting that this is a bad thing, I believe that if the animals are there, the trainers better be the best and brightest available).  Although, the mystique and celebrity status of being a SeaWorld trainer makes the jobs veey competitive, which means the company can give trainers low pay and terrible benefits because they know that for every 1 person that quits, 100 would be willing to take the job.  I guess what I'm saying is that yes, there is an educational aspect, but it's very minimal.  Oh, and the company feeds workers false info to tell patrons regarding the negative aspects of captivity.  Next point is "awareness" I think.  I'm sure that some people are unaware of these animals, but I don't think that SeaWorld is the only avenue for them to learn. In the Internet Age, we can learn a ton about all the animals at SeaWorld.  The only thing SeaWorld provides on this front is a hands-on or close-proximity experience.  These are awesome.  It's amazing to be that close to these mysterious creatures.  The only questions is whether or not you personally think it's worth it for the animals.  I don't, but others do and that's okay.  This is aa complex issue with many opinions.   Conservation is often times tied in with awareness by procaptivity people, but how many people do you think change their lifestyle just because they went to SeaWorld?  I'd guess not very many.  Plus SeaWorld San Diegovhas gotten in trouble for dumping chemicals into Mission Bay on multiple occasions, so there's that too.  OP brought up rescuing and releasing animals.  The fact of the matter is they use this more as a way to get new animals more than anything.  They find hurt/isolated/nuisance animals, try to acclimate them to captivity, keep the ones that take to it well (even if healthy again), and release the ones that aren't good once those are healthy.  The issue here is the released animals are then used to being around people and are likely to end up in a vulnerable position again.  They don't release high profit animals such as whales, the notable exception being J.J. the juvenile gray whale, but that's because there is no tank large enough to hold an adult.  In fact, SeaWorld wanting nothing to do with the rescue effort at first, but after other groups agreed to foot the bill, they obliged to house it after others caught it.  Only a very small portion of profits go towards rescues, so I look at it as more of a PR move than anything.  Also, you are incorrect about SeaWorld rescuing orcas.  All of SeaWorld's wild orcas were caught by teams of boats and divers.  SeaWorld workers say they were rescued, so I don't blame you for not knowing that.  The only whale that might fall into the rescue category is Morgan, who was an orphan found in the Netherlands in 2011.  An aquarium there took her in and the law there says she had to be released when she was healthy, but they sold her to a park in the Canary Islands instead since that park has other orcas for Morgan to interact with.  After a long legal battle, in which the park presented evidence that Morgan was hard of hearing and couldn't be released, the court said they could keep her, but not profit off her.  Most people would take that to mean no shows.  Morgan still does shows.  Anyways,  before Morgan this Canary Islands park got 3 or 4 whales on a loan from SeaWorld.  I'm not sure about the contract wording, but SeaWorld has now laid claim on Morgan as theirs.  We'll have to see what happens on that front.   Instead of looking at SeaWorld as a group of cruel people, I try to look at them as a business that uses animals as a commodity.  They try to maximize profits above all else.  It's in their interests to keep animals alive and performing, but happiness is not something they care about.  I understand everything they do from a business standpoint, but I do not think it's moral.  Sorry for the novel, but this is a complex issue and one that I care deeply about.  Hopefully it helps you get a grasp on it.  If you're interested in more info, feel free to pm me and I can try to get more in depth and set you up with links to do your own research.    That's very true.  It's highly unlikely that music at these events is loud enough to completely deafen the people or the animals.  However, concert speakers are huge and can register some extremely high dB.  Especially the kind that would be used in a large outdoor area such as a zoo.  Hopefully the speakers would be as far away from the animals as possible, but if not, exposure to loud, sustained noise can cause hearing sensitivity loss just the same as a person standing close to an extremely loud speaker.  These effects are even greater with low frequency bass sounds, which is prevalent in EDM music.  If it's not loud enough to cause any injury, it still has the potential to cause pain or discomfort.  I imagine it gets pretty stressful and annoying to the animals to have these events a couple times a year, even if they don't get injured as a result.   	12
 EDIT 2: When I clocked in for my shift my fellow IMs and I were taken to the HR meeting room, and were finally given full descriptions of our jobs and expectations, as well as an apology of sorts.   I was not coached, in fact things that I had fought about in the past were corrected in my favor and things should be a little more straight forward than they were.  Thank you for all your responses and feedback!  Edit:  Thank you for your advise! I have sent in a ticket and will meet with my store manager tomorrow, hopefully it will turn out okay.  Tl;Dr: I told my asst. Manager he could not force me to stay past my scheduled time, he responded that he was going to hold me for job abandonment. He should have been back more often or assisted if he wanted everything off the ground, I told him "fuck you" and he responded with "well, fuck you too". End of story so far.  Extended Version:  When I first started, there were four other IMS employees I was working with, after a 8 months I have seen about ten different IMS come and go, for a long time I was the only one and for an even longer time there was just me and the guy I was hired with.  I have never missed a shift, and I have never been late. They have never coached me, I do my job well and I am longest to have ever stayed in this position.  My scheduled clock in - clock out is 10 pm - 7 am. We are severely understaffed with 10 stockers and two backroom IMS, as well as a asst Manager and support Manager. The management have a bad habit of making more work than we are able to work, and then it all needs to go back up to the top steel or binned.  Then they don't show up enough to actually explain what everything is and what needs done with it, they expect me to direct traffic and do my job, and more.  Now after my scheduled time is up I get to decide whether I want to donate my personal time to help clean up the store, I had a assistant store manager when I first started who used to force us to stay, he even said, and I quote, "no, you can go when I say you can go." We stayed over two hours past scheduled clock out time because of that regularly back then.   My current manager just tried to do that and the tl:dr sums up the rest.  Any advice on how to recover and cope with the upcoming problems, I am planning on talking to the new store owner about this really soon.  Thank you in advance.   Thank you for the quick response! I agree due to the additional XP drain when trying to level using Carrier/Helios.   However I cant seem to find any mention anywhere in the patch notes and I was wondering if this had been awhile ago or not... Thanks in advance!  	3
 THANK you.  it's slim pickings out there!  don't want to end up 30,000 dollars in debt for a bachelor of arts.    you're absolutely right.  i may not have handled this well in telling my story.  	2
 For arguments sake;  I have a childhood friend, I am 40 now, who I have lost touch with the last 3 or 4 years.  If he died tomorrow, how could I possibly prove that I was friends with him? I do not have a single photograph of him and I together.     You wouldn't believe them anyway.  You know it.   I vacation in Florida every year.  Never even met an American police officer.  Worst police state ever.   I never experienced it.  Yet Reddit and twitter are bursting at the seems with it.   Some kids cause tremendous disruption, conflict and stress in the home, despite having caring parents who have other children who are well behaved.  If they will not respect the rules of the home, set them free.  Some parents are horrible.  Yes, sometimes that is the difficult, but necessary action.     Change the internet?  No.  Call the cunts out for their cunt behavior and stop telling the targets of their collective disdain that it's not a problem?  Yes.   Why would you want to block the number?   It was absolutely not worse.  Commonly visited websites, unlike commonly visited websites of today, (twitter, Reddit, Facebook,) were not chalk full of poisonous vitriol, anger and insult as they are today.     Human nature has changed, as for the first time in history, there is an easily accessible and anonymous way to heap scorn on others you don't like without any consequence.   Did she have the ability not to kick him?    He took her down too hard I think. I also don't believe she should have kicked him.   If I'm 15 and hundreds of people are collectively mocking me, both strangers and my peers and it's spilling over into school...  That shit's gotta hurt something fierce.  I'm 40 and when I was 15, there was no such thing as people posting a picture of you online and saying horrible shit about your looks and some telling you to kill yourself.  It just wasn't a thing...  And then you say it's the kid being mocked who has the problem and not the vicious people finding pleasure in tearing someone down?   If you didn't care ( as you claim) then why did you try to block his calls?  Does not add up.   It wasn't always like this.  So many people openly and so vocally being shitty to each other wasn't really around 20 years ago online.   Why don't trolls control how we act when interacting in person with each other?  Why do the trolls get to dictate the conversation online?   It wasn't always this way.   Seriously, Ive been online since 94. ( interesting you chose that year)  Things have changed and in cases related to disagreement, not for the better.    You can't disagree with popular sentiment on Reddit, else you'll be insulted, ridiculed and cursed at.  It's pretty strange, as people don't act like that in real life.   16 is the age a youth can be kicked out.  You don't believe that there are youths who are so destructive, so abusive, so disruptive and so intent on disrespecting the rules of the home that a parent is not wise to give their child the freedom they so desire by taking away the privilege of living rent free in the home?  I do believe there are unfortunately youths who do in fact deserve to be removed from their homes due to the choices they make and their behaviors.    	16
 Weren't there mutterings that this was an amazing script that got eaten alive by notes? I'm glad they salvaged something.   The closest videogame to a holodeck is, in my opinion, dwarf fortress. Shame it doesn't get much press.   Because the cities neighbor, Bludhaven, is even more shit.   He may not have had financial success, but Firefly, buffy and Angel were extremely good shows, and Serenity was a really great movie, with lots of nice directorial flourishes. It way outweighed stuff like Zathura, or even the first Iron man in terms of quality. I'm sure the new director will do a good job, but it won't be Edgar Wright quality.   But Joss whedon had already directed some really good stuff, in particular Firefly/serenity, moreover, John Favreau was never really as good of a director as Wright, who is probably one of the greatest mainstream directors to emerge in the last 20 years of cinema.   What might eventually happen is that it gets adapted into an anime TV series, seeing as the company that made the sequence are essentially the golden child of Japanese animation now, and the anime sequence was one of, if not the, best part.   Further confusing this is that Joss whedon apparently sent James Gunn's original script for GOTG back for 'not being James Gunn enough'   She-hulk being Bruce Banners cousin is basic comic book shit. Martian manhunter being hugely relevant to both the Justice League in the comics and in the animation is basic shit.    Kevin Feige actually knew barely anything about comics when he started as an exec, but he **learned** unlike Goyer.   This film will be weird. It's based on a spin-off of a spin-off of the x men, for crying out loud.   Don't worry buddy, I understood that reference.   Basically, the x men comics have a massive cast of loved characters and villains, around as many as the rest of the marvel universe alone. Rather than build up these individual characters, Ratner chose to include as many as he possibly could and ruin them all. For example, the Juggernaut is an entirely different character in the comics, and his appearance is equivalent to The hulk turning up in the avengers as a guy who can just turn green when he wants to.   I can almost guarantee that old man logan is the only she hulk story goyer has read, seeing as the only three writers that Hollywood respects are Moore, Miller and Millar.   I like how he apparently didn't realize she-hulk is meant to be the Hulk's  *cousin*   He also wrote a nick fury movie.... starring David Hasselhoff.   It's not even that goofy. The martian manhunter is actually a pretty badass title, and basically describes his job. 'Batman' sounds way more inherently goofy, but becomes not goofy due to *context,* which Goyer apparently doesn't understand.   Actually, all of the other people who filled the role of batgirl were more popular than Barbara, as Barbara never actually got her own comic as batgirl until 2011. (barbara is more well known as Oracle, although you might be referring to other media?) Cssandra cain in particular is a great fit for the arkhamverse, having a over 100 issue comic run, being a better fighter than batman, and being an intriguing character in her own right.   It really could be anyone, as there are so many characters/alliances/guilds that could facilitate such a character. Hell, for all we know it could be Cassandra or david cain.   A villain who fills the same niche as tonnes of other batman villains, hence the speculation it's Jason todd, heretic etc.   Justice  Yeah, it must be real difficult to decide a profession based on that name.   [source] (http://www.teamfortress.com/tf03_cold_day_in_hell/#f=18)   Hey, is there a German dub of attack on titan? because isn't that the language the characters are heavily implied to speak in-universe?   This. I'm more than happy to read subs (although I read faster than normal, so don't have many issues) but sometimes dubs just fit the tone and theme of the series better, black lagoon being the most prominent.   I agree for the most part, but I really think the 'winter soldier' theme was nailed, those air raid siren really add menace to the character.   I'm sure the youtube community will just LOVE the ending.   Lewis voted for another player to win other than his arch nemesis, I don't get why people think that's being butt hurt rather than competitive. Duncan lost the game by not building for science, and, as is meant to be the flow of the game, other Civs ganged up and defeated him by voting for a neutral player.   You do realize that a diplomatic victory is a completely legitimate victory condition right? It could have happened anyway without Lewis's intervention if Rythian had actually worked for it, and Duncan should have been working to complete his science victory rather than investing in giant robots. Duncan lost the game, and Rythian won. Simple as.   MALMO REMEMBERS BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Black lagoon needs a dub to be watched properly, especially as everyone canonically speaks English in the series.   Sayaka from Madoka magica is best girl. Her best girl stat transcends time.      Hollywood: " Oh, we've learnt our lesson, we've hired a promising sci-fi writer by the name of Roberto Orci to direct the new big budget star trek!"   Oh, I'm by no means doubting that, however, I am curious what website you work for that still has a community that proclaims such blatantly false accusations, as women have been involved in the game blogging/reviewing industry since it's inception.   Lewis looks around his fallen empire, a single tear shedding from his eye. He looks at the Sky, his face contorted in rage, only able to utter a single, fearsome word:  "PYRION!"   "PYRION!"  and finally, inexorably, a final throe: "PYRIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNN!"   Actually, people thought Jim was trolling when he said dynasty warriors 8 for PC was unplayable. People do not trust Jim sterling. Period.   Spain says "SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKAS!!!!"   I'm pretty sure that skyfall, at least at one point, was meant to confirm that theory. I remember watching it in cinemas and thinking that Silva would be an ex James Bond, and it would be a big 50th anniversary twist. It was a real shame when the entire 3rd act went out of its way to disprove the theory though.   The book wasn't finished by the time the movie was being made, but Bryan Lee o malley had a lot of say in the original content.   I would recommend Lego marvel superheroes on that front, despite not having particularly great controls for flying, the amount of speed you can get whilst playing as say, Iron man is pretty incredible.   So I thought it would be interesting to see what peoples choices were for comicbooks when you take watchmen/v for vendetta/ batman out of the picture.   My mistake. I sincerely apologize.   Which of the three madoka universes though?   I find that hugely annoying in anime, it makes the singles really hard to buy legitimately.   It's no fun is it?   If you read the book, you'll find out exactly why Wiseau is the last person you ever want on your film set. Remember, the room is made with the *best takes*   I don't think safety will be the problem, It's the illusion of safety, the idea that you won't be able to swerve to avoid cars etc. That will stop people from buying, particularly as cars without hugely expensive computers running them will be cheaper.   The problem is, in self driving cars there's no element of agency. I just don't see why you would spend thousands of dollars to buy a vehicle you can't really control.   It's a niche product at best, yet everyone has to buy it for it to work properly. If you want to be in a car that you have absolutely zero control over, why not just take the train?   Actually, self driving cars have been in concept stages since the 70's. They're relatively easy to do, just have the car follow a signal along the road. The main reason they haven't been introduced yet is due to people wanted to be able to control their multi-thousand dollar 2 tonne death machine.   Ant man is too close to coming out. Edgar usually puts around 4 years into production of his movies, and I doubt he's familiar with power rangers.   I did. Without mods. Losing/failing is fun!   It's worth noting that Godzilla fights a monster in every movie since Godzilla vs King kong, so it's a staple of the genre, rather than a real plot twist.   Not recently. Scotland is looking increasingly pro-independence, and, as a liberal, I can't really be against them wanting to get the fuck away from the Tories.   Asexuality is **very** complicated. And barely covered in the media.   Try out 'all star superman,' hell, any frame of reference past the Richard Donner films shows that he's not a 'boyscout.' Clark Kent is superman, not the other way around, he's a regular guy that tries to remain as humble as possible when facing impossible odds, something the Snyder film missed.   Apparently, neither the writer nor director has seen NGE, and the movie was inspired more by 70/80's anime, but take that with a grain of salt.   In my personal opinion it just felt more like it kept getting beaten, but then escaping on technicalities or Dues ex machina. First the corps capture it, then it uses a unseen previously ability to escape in human form, and you expect their to be a actual human v human fight or chase, mixing up the action, but that doesn't appear. Then Erens team essentially defeat it again, only for it to use more superpowers to kill a team of highly trained professionals. (who all decide to run into it) Then it beats Eren in a fight, which takes forever (altrhough it did legitimately win that time), and then Levi defeats it AGAIN but it's still pointless and we're still, apparently meant to think it 'won' when it got it's ass kicked for the last few episodes. The last arc is much better IMO because the stakes are actually grounded, we know what the female titan can do, and it doesn't pull any powers out of it's ass.   Sorry about the spoiler thing, I couldn't get the spoiler tag to work so just left it vague. I honestly felt like it didn't remain compelling after the first capture, she's still running around in titan form, which we have seen be caught, and then it's just watching her *almost* get caught again and again. It's not moving the plot forward, it's just watching people fail for fairly contrived reasons. (particularly once Levi comes in) I actually really liked the arc after it, where it actually feels like an even fight, but for half the recon corps arc, I was personally bored.   A year or two ago I had a nostalgia binge, watching youtube video etc.  I remember that roaming robots (the company doing the live shows) bought the rights to the robot wars name, and, if I remember correctly, they were pitching it to companies. (although it obviously wasn't successful) It's probably up to the producers more than anything, as neither the BBC or Channel 5 treated it with any respect. I think it's pretty much a matter of time before someone organizes a twitter campaign or whatever. It was a stalwart of a LOT of peoples childhoods, and when they become celebrities....   What? Was that meant to be a sentence?   I hated how protracted that sequence was. Once the female titan gets trapped the first time, she loses all threat and mystery. After that it's just waiting for the inevitable to happen.   I hope the next movie focuses on sayaka, it would be really neat to explore her character after the changes in rebellion.   Yeah, they're really trying to get the rights to a TV show back. I think in today's climate, an optimistic, no bullshit *engineering* competition would be insanely cool. Think about all the new technology can be used to smash stuff!   I have the feeling in time started as a good script, but focus groups and producers sucked all the life out of it.   Bit of an unusual choice, but try out the three madoka magica movies. They're very japanese, but probably the darkest 12A movies aside from grave of the fireflies. They're actually some of my favorite films of all time, and well worth a watch even if you don't cry.   wow, went to robot wars when I was 5 as well! You know they still have robot tournaments across the country?   I would say the rock actually has very weak pulling power, roughly the same as vin diesel. People enjoy seeing him in a movie, but they won't go to a movie just for him.   It might be the spirit level terrible. Frank Miller pulling a good script out of the bag would be a pretty major fluke. And machete kills/spy kids 4 were massively critically panned.   I'm really backing GOTG to do well. Seems a much better idea for a summer family film than TMNT   Sin city, from the directors of Spy kids 4 and The spirit! It will certainly be interesting to see whether both Frank miller and Robert Rodriguez can actually turn their careers around.   That's an interesting point. Gaurdians of the galaxy has a draw far superior to TMNT, but aims at the same audience in multiple ways. It will also be the superior sci-fi film. (barring a disaster) Given the option of seeing TMNT or guardians of the galaxy, GOTG will win 99 times out of 100.   In the UK, pretty much everyone is a Sherlock fan, so it certainly sold well over here. The hobbit is also a damn well made movie, and almost certainly has more care put into than TMNT.   You don't seem to be able to understand that the new Godzilla movie has all the trappings of being a good movie, whereas the nearly 15 year old Roland Emmerich  movie had all the trappings of being shit. Are you really saying that the trailers/clips for the new Godzilla movie look like a 'bullshit monster movie with a shit story?'   Sci-fi/fantasy films need to be **good** (or at least not unbearably tedious)to really make traction in the box office, particularly if they're a new IP. Hercules seems to be aiming solely for a 3-star/2 star range, and, like prince of persia, it will fail.   It has a lot to do with how complex the swinging mechanics are, both from a coding and conceptual perspective. Things like momentum and building physics take a more concerted effort to recreate than almost everything else in the game. There's also the fact that Treyarch are just better devs than Beenox, of course they'll make a better game in the time than Beenox churning it out in time for the movie release.   There are lot's of old, great game mechanics that have been lost due to the industry cutting corners. Goldeneye and half life had a tonne of mechanics (such as shootable NPC's) that industry is too scared to use, because it might ruin their carefully crafted narratives.   It has a lot of interesting touches when you consider that, in-universe, the book would essentially become one of the most important books of all time, and it essentially is about the most famous celebrities of that era it would be the real world equivalent of a guy going round talking to The president, Steven Spielberg, and David Beckham, only as badass war heroes.   The POV character for that segment could easily be a film lead. It's subtle, but on re-reading I noticed that the character was involved in every major campaign of the zombie war, and was the only person to go from yonkers to the final battle. Max brooks was essentially interviewing (in universe) America's greatest war hero, but didn't introduce him as such because he assumed you would have already known about him. That's a pretty great idea for a film, in my opinion.   Yeah, that was meant to be a satellite that released the monster from hibernation, rather than the monster itself.   Monsters, director Gareth evens first foray into the genre, and if your willing to delve deeper into Japanese animation you have at minimum the series attack on Titan and neon genesis evangelion, as well as the upcoming (summer) Aldonoah. zero which promises to breathe even more life into the genre.   The movie is kind of lame in general if you're a sci-fi guy. IMO  it would be a much better film if it wasn't so embarrassed to embrace the tropes it rips off. Even though it's still a great film, it's redundant in the face of better written/ more crowd pleasing Massive monster affair.   From what I remember, that triggered the monsters release from hibernation or something. They didn't really have a predefined 'lore' so a lot of it is contradictory/red herrings, technically, they released a manga meant to clarify stuff, but that had a lot of supernatural elements (Clover was the ghost of a 14 year old or something)   The funny thing about cloverfield is that with the resurgence of Godzilla, pacific rim, and to a lesser extent things like attack on titan and EVA, the market for 'reinventions of the Kaiju genre' has pretty much dried up, so you really may as well view pacific rim as a sequel.   Eh, it will take quite a while to compile all the various sites/theories/magazine articles that I read years ago, but from what I remember, slusho (the company on logo's and T-Shirts throughout the film) having been drilling in the sea to try to find more of a 'secret ingredient' they put in their drinks, I don't believe it's ever specified, but at the bottom of a sea trench they find clover in a crack in the ground, so it lines up quite well with pacific rim. What is most important is that Cloverfield is essentially a generic kaiju movie, just told from an unconventional perspective, so it's as easy to say 'pacific rim and cloverfield take place in the same universe' as to say 'Godzilla and pacific rim are in the same universe'   Actually,  confirmed through the viral marketing that he did. Seriously.   An interesting note on the voice acting: The voice actor for Melia was Jenna Louise Coleman, A.K.A Doctor who's current assistant, before she was famous.   And then I just unzip it with winzip? Thank you for the help!   Sorry to ask, but which specifically should I download? Can you give a brief description of the sf/FT/CX stuff?   So, I know this has been already asked, but where is the best place to download Kill la kills sweet soundtrack? I unfortunately do not have the means to import the CD. Any links would be much appreciated, I would also like a potential simplification of the animex downloads page? What link should I click on?   Actually, DC built up a really large stock of female superheroes in the 90's/ 2000's, but they successfully managed to fuck them all up in the new 52. a birds of prey movie would kick ass.   In the 60's: The wasp/jean grey/ sue storm In the 80's: essentially every character in the x-men In the 90's: Most of the x-men, oracle starts to develop 2000's: almost every heroine written by Gail simone, particularly Batgirl and Black canary Now: Marvels's pulled a lot of it back, with black widow and Ms marvel being popular. It's worth noting that most of these characters are actually more famous than Wonder woman in the comics community. I'm a big comics guy, and can tell you tonnes about every one of these characters EXCEPT wonder woman.   Geoff Johns was heavily involved with the green lantern movie.... yeah.....   Fargo: Sure, in America you'll get brutally, and senselessly, murdered, but at least we're chipper about it!   Hey Rythian, this may be off topic, but have you ever watched the anime madoka magica? It's similarly dark and emotionally crippling to this game.   Fucking Boddypen.   Nope, KLK is not suited for a videogame, the art style is too complex to be done with cel shading, not complex enough to be done with 3D models, not to mention a lot is done in a semi-warner bros style. The only way it could work is as a hand drawn 2D fighter or as a RPG. It's not suited for an action game.   47 Ronin, Keanu wanted it made so badly, but you could tell from previews there was no way it wouldn't be a flop. Truly like watching a car crash in slow motion.   I think the 'who will play Wiseau?' question will be quite interesting, as the way the book describes him, he's such a bizarre character that it would be near impossible for someone to make him look believable (the accent alone would be really hard to pull off) but if you've read the book, you'd also know you'd never **ever** want him anywhere near your film set. It's kind of like trying to get an actor to play Karl Pilkington; sometime life just throws up characters stranger than fiction.   I only started watching anime a few months ago, and I was wondering what anime from this season specifically I should be 'following,' using GIFs  of, that sort of thing. (kill la kill was this for me last season) So what do you, in all your infinitesimal wisdom, recommend?   Cool, Sjins getting a new youtube channel!   I remember seeing adds for it, it had Cameron Diaz in it I believe? Wacky heist caper? Anyway, I'm guessing their involvement was pretty much buried.   Don't forget he came off an extremely directorially powerful TV show, spaced, which even had a quentin Tarantino commentary!   Whilst DKR is certainly controversial, (It was my favorite batman movie, subjectively of course) I don't quite think it was bad enough to end the 'streak.'    Didn't something similar happen with the Ridley Scott Robin hood movie? Hollywood buys a script for millions of dollars called 'sherwood' about the sheriff of nottingham using Middle ages forensics and detective work to solve mysterious murders, but when they bring Ridley on board, it becomes another Robin hood movie because he wanted to do a movie with archer.   Is pyrion a house elf now?   I would personally like to see some western Sci-fi games developed into anime. Deux ex, Mass effect, Halo, that sort of thing, However, in terms of what would realistically get adapted a monster hunter Anime could be really neat, but only if they make it considerably darker than the games convey. (graphically) Monster Hunter could potentially have a really interesting world/action scenes if they let it.  	104
 You're right. Ratatouille's screenplay is easily the best among the Pixar franchise.   I agree with you on that.Though it is not number 1 on the box office.But still it has a gross.And its going to increase as the both the number 1 and number 2 films are a bit old now.   Everyone forgot E.T:The Extra Terrestrial (1982) I would also like to add Driving Miss Daisy (1989) Ordinary People (1980) Rain Man (1988) The Breakfast Club (1985) National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)    	3

I don't think that he is either, but it isn't impossible to be both, remember Nixon?    Is Breitbart trying to convince their readers that Obama doesn't care about black people?   So what is your opinion of [this picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bu4ILkdIIAAMkGy.png:large) in particular?             Little known 1951 Private Detective series starring Rex Harrison (My Fair Lady, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Doctor Dolittle) as Rex Saunders, a gentleman detective. Directed by Himan Brown (Suspense!, CBS Radio Mystery Theater).       Well you couldn't have learned yesterday, as it wasn't so yet.   I think they're supposed to be saw blades.   A N.J. town erupts after their city council votes to rename their Kennedy Center as the Obama Center.         According to a [2009 Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/23/AR2009032302972.html), about 20.9 million listeners tune into NPR each week. Can you name a media source with a bigger audience?       Just checked NPR.org and their top stories are    Global Parenting Habits That Haven't Caught On In The U.S.   Gaza's Casualties Of War Include Its Historic Mosques   What Robin Williams Taught Us About Teaching  in that order. If even National Public Radio is reporting the Gaza story above/ahead of the Robin Williams story, what would be the point of killing him to distract people from the Gaza story?   But that still doesn't explain why Blacks in the South had universally forsaken the Republican party for the Democratic party nearly a generation before Johnson.         You hood chop!   Is that Phil Hartman in the background?   The World According to Garp, it was the first serious film I ever saw him do, plus he let John Lithgow steal the movie.    I attended public school in Alabama from 61' to 73 and I didn't get any gun safety training, but maybe that was because of integration and busing.     So they never caught the lesbians?      If it okay to open carry in a bar or restaurant with a liquor licence, why would it be bad to sell alcohol at a gun show?         I don't think you would see a new international, pro-war, religious voting bloc. I think you would see a schism much like the one in the Anglican and Episcopalian Churches over the ordination of women and gays and gay marriage.           It seems faster than I remember.               Who is the tall, dark stranger there? Maverick is the name.   Ridin' the trail to who knows where, Luck is his companion, Gamblin' is his game.   Dan, I wish I owned a television station, so I could give it to you.   I asked the Magic Eightball and it said "Ross Perot".      If I'm a chip, then you must mean Europe.

Testing that "NSA is literally spying on everyone all the time" thing?    The modern word senate is derived from the [Latin] word sentus (senate), which comes from senex, "old man".         Winner!   And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.

When was the last time we had a President who had a beard or mustache, was bald or fat or was less than 5" 7" tall?   This is a least two years old and he is still employed by Fox News.  http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/personalities/andrew-p-napolitano/bio/#s=m-q   And the thumbnail is from Morning Joe, a weekday morning talk show on MSNBC, with Joe Scarborough who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001 as a Republican from the 1st district of Florida. Imagine if Fox   Friends was hosted by Dennis Kucinich.    There would now be a load screen with a product placement every time you go in to Ammu-nation, get a car out of impound, change clothes or get a new haircut in GTA.   his publisher revealed that   Usually when someone wants to keep something secret, they don't go out and find someone to publish it, that cost money and the publisher usually likes to get that money back by selling the copies that they published.   In January 1835, then U.S. President Andrew Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that this has been accomplished. However, this accomplishment was short lived as a severe economic depression from 1837 to 1844 caused the national debt to increase to over $3.3 million by January 1, 1838 and it has not been paid in full since.         Did he predict where he would be today?            Considering that in 1937 a dime would buy you a copy of Time magazine, a comic book or two cokes, I think it would be a little more than that.         Choosing is an illusion is a waste of time, debating a question without settling it is as well.         90% of serial killers are right handed.            I notice that there is no mention of the fact that the flags were actually bleached and not replaced with white ones.   She changed her name to Goldberg because she farted a lot?            **News from 1972:**  Richard Milhous Nixon yesterday won re-election as President of the United States in a landslide victory rivaling the greatest of American political history.   Pretty sure he is only going to secure the Texas-Mexican border, not all the states borders.   I bet 30% would say he isn't really human if asked. We have reached the point where people will say anything that they believe will make a politician that they disagree with look bad.               Today Disney owns Marvel. They'd drop the Hulk and just call him Hogan.   So you're saying he wanted to give conservatives an issue to assrape him with? He saw the drunken monkey going for the gun and told everyone to stand back and let the drunken monkey have the gun because he wanted to be shot by a drunken monkey? It all makes perfect sense now.    **Headline ends in question mark?**  Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."   Is the argument here that if we allow people to offer other people money to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do, there will be a decrease in people using violence to get other people to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? Like replacing slavery with jobs?   Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue. If we handle it as a mental disability, as in those afflicted by the disease would be eligible for entitlements, it might not be more effective than decriminalizing it, just more humane.    The problem is, both may be true. Small family farms, averaging 231 acres, make up 88 percent of farms, but 48 percent of total acreage, while very large family farms, averaging 2,086 acres, make up 4.6 percent of farms and 23 percent of total acres. Obama could truthfully say that this bill would affect only 4.6 percent of farms, but Romney could also truthfully say 23 percent of total farm acreage would be affected by this bill.   You don't remember Boris Yeltsin, drunk, standing outside the White House in his underpants trying to hail a cab to go and buy a pizza?        Four.         Americas public debt will rise to 106 percent of GDP in the next 25 years, a level seen just once in US history - just after World War II,   Isn't that when we built the Suburbs and the Interstate Highway system and the shopping malls?    Nothing in that video proved that any of those people were illegal aliens, that the bus was owned or was being operated by any branch of the government or that any of them were even using EBT cards. Without the assertions of the videographer, who offers nothing more than this video with doesn't backup those assertions, this could be a church bus taking a group elderly veterans on a 4th of July shopping trip.

That's not a bad thing.            A federal government agency says that a high percentage of our veterans are drug addicts. No one suspicious?    So, if I go to youtube, and type in ["CHP Beating Woman"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=CHP++Beating+Woman), I won't see any videos of a California Highway patrolman, sitting straddle of an African-American woman in a red shirt, beating her in the face with his fist?   Chicken Little warnings going unheeded.   Hitler was against smoking.   The same wikipedia article says:   Founder(s) Richard and Maurice McDonald; Ray Kroc (Corporation).    Nowhere in the linked article does it state that this was ever a "popular belief".    So, Half of what you need?   Next to the "Sell Negro" space.

So in your opinion, [Rush Limbaugh's 2008 strategy](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2008/03/12/rush_the_vote_operation_chaos) was illegitimate.     Because there is no party registration in Mississippi, theres no way to know the affiliation of the people who voted in Tuesdays run-off.

Just because something starts creeping into the mainstream, doesn't mean it's good or permanent, remember disco?   A Democracy will inherently not represent the beliefs of all it's citizens, so no matter how democratic our elections are and no matter how democratic our government is, someone will still be able to say "My beliefs aren't represented in my government".

Betteridge's law of headlines: "Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."   I don't trust news stories from sources that tell me in the opening paragraph, how I'm supposed to feel about or react to the information in their stories. That's not only a sure sign of propaganda, but bad propaganda at that.   Wait, this brings up an important question, did Andy violate Barney's Second Amendment Rights when he only allowed him one bullet?         Looks like he's checking his email.   Solid Liberal   So the mainstream media wants us to believe that Social Security is a ponzi scheme?      He **rode** in a powder blue limousine, if he drove it, he would have been a chauffeur.   What if both parties had been "conceal carrying"?               I wonder if people reacted like this to cops getting guns in the first place or when they got patrol cars or radios?          I don't think when a politician says that every American child should have the opportunity to get a college education, that they really mean that twenty years from now, there should be no one dropping fries at McDonald's, driving garbage trucks or running a register at Walmart.   Interesting, but I don't see how this is "political".   Matthew 7:12   Is this about that Democrat who said all southern men sound effeminate?    Care to name some non-partisan sources?         Rural Alabama here, we had Walter Cronkite and Huntley/Brinkley before we had PBS.      Damn, I was hoping it would be Deacon Blue.    108 without zooming.      Maybe he should ask his son Rand, who on Saturday [signaled openness to air strikes in Iraq](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/rand-paul-iraq-air-strikes-107867.html#ixzz34rojxS3P)?                           I didn't suggest they spend it all on that, they could spend the other 15 million on a p.r. campaign about how the democrats never gave them all a million dollars.     There's only 45 million black people in the U.S., they could just give them all a million dollars a piece, have money left over and call it reparations and say "look what the Republican party did for you. Not the Democrats, not the government, the GOP did this for you."      Grease is from the Seventies, not the Fifties.   What's sad is that in some of these you see some small improvements and then total collapse.    	199
 Samesies with you guys. Bears are my least favorite, because Cutler.   Skol   Thanks for the reply. Wow that is an awful, terrible rule. I feel bad for the Packers. What is the reasoning behind that?   No stream access, what was the play and rule that ruled it a safety?  	4
 Human or cat years?         Is there anything he can't do?  	4
 And by boards ... they meant actual boards.  Like from a hardware store.      Look at his posting history.  He's an arrogant, incredibly shallow narcissistic trust-fund baby, with a sociopathic "fuck you, I've got mine" bent.   And tried to imply the swine flu was a Democrat conspiracy.   Some of them just naturally deserve to be gilded, like this one.    Others don't, like all the other ones in this thread.   I ALSO HAD HIS FAMILY   If I had a good answer, I wouldn't be sitting around reading through /r/AskReddit/new/.   I KNOW WHAT YOUR MOM SOUNDS LIKE TRUST ME   Nothing will make you socially accepted.  That's why you're on reddit.   There's a Butt Lake and a Butt Mountain not too far from Butte County, so your inner 8 year-old can still have fun.   Yes, the [Modoc Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modoc_Plateau).   The KKC world.   This was triggered by rereading Kvothe lamenting the cold food in the different rooms the Maer put him in.  ... why is a skilled sympathist complaining about cold food, instead of linking the plates or food to the candles in the room and heating it all up?  Or to a bit of ash from the kitchen fireplace, which would always be going?  So what other things do you think you could come up with - if you were in that world and skilled at both sympathy and sygaldry.  Sygaldric telegraphs would be obvious, if limited by distance (five-to-six miles).   Yep - here's a picture I took a while back driving up I-5.  They just sort of pop up out of the middle of farmland:  http://i.imgur.com/hHX2vBs.jpg   It stands out a bit.  As flat as Kansas through most of it, too.  And I always get a bit of a laugh out of "the Ohio River Valley" - you can't even tell it's a valley!   *Takes another drink.*   At this point, we're pretty much our own rivals.  And it's a pretty brutal matchup.    Please, just end the day with Bowman getting cut   Yeah, about that ...    I don't even understand why Obama is trying to negotiate  Because he's sane, and knows that this is how nations act towards each other.   Work.  The Republican demographic is increasingly retirees.   Hmmm ... I think the database is flawed.  Looking at Lassen Volcanic National Park, a lot of those lines are hiking trails, not roads.  Doesn't seem to be a problem with other National Parks, though.      It doesn't have to *melt* it (though that's possible, at the hottest temperature for Jet A to combust), it just has to *weaken* the steel beams.  Steel and other metals become weak enough to bend far below their melting point.   Sorry for the dog analogy. I'm trying to housebreak a damn dog  No problem - we're trying to housebreak Oklahoma, but they keep shitting in the Senate.   ... yes, I did.  Repeatedly.  Again, you're far too stupid to realize how wrong you are.  The fact that you're an anti-vaxxer makes that clear, all of your posts here make it even more clear.   You obviously don't know what a strawman is.  Let's add it to your list of extraordinary ignorance.    So what good is a vaccine if it doesn't work?  It's called "herd immunity."  And it works for most people.  That's the whole damned point.   No, they were caused by seat belts working exactly as intended.  Vaccine injuries and deaths don't occur because the vaccine didn't work as intended, they occur because there are a *lot of people*, so some of them are going to have adverse reactions.  There are people allergic to peanuts, you know.  Should we ban peanuts?    How many more next month?  There will be a whole lot less than the number of people FUCKING DEAD from whooping cough, polio, rickets, and measles if those vaccines weren't issued.  Does this not even register with you?    If there were 117 injuries or deaths caused by faulty seat belts there would be outrage.   There are three million injuries caused by seat belts a year, resulting in about 40,000 deaths.  So, you know, just keep on being stupid and poorly informed.   Yes, because preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths is completely trumped by preventing dozens of injuries.   I think you meant http://www.reddit.com/r/datgap, regardless.    One flight of Al Gore's private jet dumps more CO2 into the air than I will in the next million years from my fireplace.  Of course, this has *nothing to do* with CO2, but you just keep on kneejerking.    The plan worked  Except for the part where it resulted in a resounding and utter defeat?   ... and everyone everywhere continued to call it GIF.  The end.   http://www.usnews.com/news/science/news/articles/2015/03/05/eastern-oregon-dig-uncovers-ancient-stone-tool   I just find it really contrived and boring to read a 3000+ page fantasy story about a guy making up a bunch of shit.  That's sort of literally what you're doing.   Because he's angry.   Brandon Sanderson takes a break from writing really big fantasy novels by writing somewhat big fantasy novels.   The most obvious possibility:  He's Lorren's son.  It was emphasized how tall he is, something that always comes up with Lorren; and he has very special privileges in the Archives.    I never said anything about the reasons behind wars  Of course you didn't, because doing so would undermine the entire point you obviously think you're making.    crackpot theory about them not attacking anybody for 200 years.  It's a crackpot theory?   Because you might want to read up on the very list you just cited - and feel free to point out in just how many of those conflicts Iran was the aggressor.   /r/AskCulinary will have some really great suggestions, I have no doubt.  Although you can make a really good white gravy from beef as well as pork.   Well ... dammit.  I can't argue with that logic.   "I guess a blow job would be all right."   *Checks user profile for /r/gonewild pics.*  *Finds none, so probably a dude.*  *Fuck.*   All of them?    Gravy.  Because why else biscuits?  Also, white gravy.  From pork.   Anything Wesley-centric in Star Trek: TNG.   Being a Browns fan.   Fuck upvotes, I want money.   Idalize.  Her older sister was named Paytin.  Yes, their parents were trash.   A couple of isolated old gold mines dripping with water, silence, and potential death.   Yes. Because yes.   Not sleeping with me.  I mean, it was cute at first, but now it's pretty grating.    Victim blaming is pretty fucking disgusting.   The dead guy is the victim, not the incompetent cop who had to shoot an unarmed guy a bunch of times.  Am I correctly capturing your point of view here?  No.  You really, really suck at analogies.  Stop.    one of the officers said several times that the man was reaching for his gun...  "Oh, then perhaps it would make sense that I should stop him from doing that by restraining him. Nope, better shoot him a bunch of times."  ... food for thought.  If you had to live off of food for thought you'd starve.    Which is when police are allowed to shoot your ass.  No ... no, it isn't.  But feel free to cite policy that says otherwise.   Yes, it's horrible how reddit has an "anti-shooting unarmed people for no fucking reason" circle-jerk.  It's not like we just watched a goddamned video where we can clearly see that happening or anything.   I started reading WoT in the summer of 1990 when I was 12, when tEotW first came out.  Yeah, that took a while.    What else could I mean by "full Clint Eastwood"?  Well, you could've been yelling at a bunch of empty chairs.   Actually it has nine.    This is bullshit and it does not belong here.  It's part of the response OP was fishing for, based on her reaction and posting history.   http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/full_menu_explorer.html  Looks like you can get all the bacon you want.  Guess you're just a moron.  Also ... you do realize hamburgers aren't made from ham to begin with, right?  Actually, you probably don't.   Was his name Bob?   "Bob had bitch tits."   Because news.yahoo.com is just some little independent blogging outfit, speaking truth to power.    What a pair they were.  "If you cut us, do we not bleed?"  "... no."   I'd argue this ... but there'd be a lot of spoilers.   5,000 tons heavier than a Tico, still called a destroyer.    If this dreadnaught-style, backwards-angled bow  It's called a "tumblehome" hull shape, and according to Wiki it fell out of style after Tsushima, but there's no source cited.  I'd guess it had more to do with limited deck space - once the dreadnought design came along, you needed more and more.    Also - I didn't know there was an Abrams tank.  ... just, seriously?  Because it practically had it's own news channel during the First Gulf War.    Any day now  ... the gold bugs have been saying for two generations.    Obama has nothing to do with it   I'm guessing you'd be saying just the opposite if the economy was bad.   Former Yolo County resident here, more rainy days would have been kind of nice.    Northern California.  DON'T FUCKING ENCOURAGE THIS.  Good God, there's enough development already.   So I'm wondering how to gain that store-bought *sharpness* to my home-made Caesar dressing.  That sort of bite that a lot of bottled brands have, but that I just can't reproduce.  Anyways, numbers are real rough (eyeballed mostly), and I usually lay it on the heavy side with seasonings:  Mayo (store bought), 2 cup  Anchovie paste, 2 tbsp  Worcestershire Sauce 2 tbsp  Lemon Juice, 1 tsp  White vinegar, 1 tsp  Crushed garlic, 1 tbsp  Onion powder, 1 tsp  Salt, 1 tsp  Pepper, 1/2 tsp   But while it doesn't lack *flavor* (which is usually great), per se, it lacks that bite on the tongue.  It's just ... a bit too smooth and creamy.  I'm not looking to add heat, mind, so definitely not peppers/hot sauce, unless that's definitely the thing to do.  And I'm not looking to make a vinaigrette. Any possible suggestions?  Even maybe MSG?  I've thought about using plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, but that's a bit expensive.    I think they are trying to impress Billy ~~Mitchel~~ **Madison**.            President Obama isn't the one who gets to decide what true Islam is.  Neither is ISIS, which is what they claim to do.  Imagine him putting on a tall hat and telling Catholics what the rules of Lent are.  Except he's not doing that in relation to Islam.   While normally I'd chalk this up to Walker being an asshole, in this case his office made a good point - there's no point in there being a state requirement when there's already a federal one.   Pretty sure the Roman Empire didn't fall because people won't use their turn signal.  But I can see how that might lead to the Nazis taking power.   "Forgot who I was" being the key phrase.  A bit of the way through kicking ass ... he remembered he wasn't supposed to be the kind of person who could do so.   Why unsuccessful?  The weather was somewhat windy, but there's not nearly as much snow as usual up there.   So radical Muslims wanted to use their Second Amendment rights to kill Obama?  Must be some seriously exploding Teabagger heads right about now.    rake the desert for ten hours.  Please tell me it was with a really big comb.    Its much easier and happier for Kvothe to just struggle to get a new patron than to have the emotional turmoil of getting Greyfallow.  The fact that we never see any of this even remotely touched upon in the books means ... plot hole.    Lettuce is the vegetable with just about the shortest shelf-life....  A head of romaine usually keeps for about ten to fourteen days for me.    I'd like to steer clear of the recent trend of signing old veteran WRs past their brief primes.  Like that Boldin guy?    While true, *Paul's Boutique* is the superior album.  Though I've been able to sing the lyrics to "Paul Revere" word for word since I was like ten.    gruden never shuts up ~~about that game~~      As for the Breden evidence, I have two major problems with it. First, it seems a little too easy to figure out.  I'd point out that to the average, non-obsessive fantasy reader, it probably is subtle enough to require a bit of chewing on mentally.   Shorter Answer:  Plot-hole.    And for the Whiners must be because we pretty much put the last nail on the coffin for their best HC since the 90s.   It's come out that the Seahawks loss did that.  Not that it makes losing to the Raiders any easier, of course.     from Fresno and go to school in Davis.  Talk about an upgrade.    businessmen are amoral pieces of shit without a shred of decency.  Class warfare detected.  You aren't supposed to say bad things about rich people, citizen.   Pretty sure that's supposed to be Fresno.  Bakersfield is actually California's asshole, not armpit.   I'd love to live there ... with some means of not dying of starvation and dehydration, of course.   You mean Sam the Not Actually A Plumber?    Also use an unlubricated condom to keep microphones dry without impacting sound too much.  Oh, good, I finally have a reason to buy condoms.   Hmmm, I've been infrequently using the same bottle for three years.  I should stop doing that - no infections, it's just not actually working anymore.   There's plenty of nice places in the north valley.    Speakng of Bredon, it occurs to me that he may have no social standing prior to his introduction and games of Tak with Kvothe.  Bredon has enough wealth   standing to have a couple of servants rushing around for him setting up table and chairs in Kvothe's room, as well to be talked about in the gossip of the nobility (the one about the pagan rituals).   We've been thoroughly exploring more options for almost four years.  But Bredon = Denna's patron was beaten over the reader's head in TWMF.   Sounds like someone's feeling irrelevant and wants attention.   Denna's patron is Bredon.  Just because it's obvious to us, after years of analysis and the Tor reread, doesn't mean it's not true.  It's probably not particularly obvious to the casual reader.     That's USS Alaska (CB-1).   ... whew, one letter away from disaster.   Pretty much my second favorite Justin Smith play of all time, after the strip in Philly.   While that was an awesome play, Brees actually managed to dump it off to avoid the sack.   I suspect there are two reasons:  1.)  The people involved are long past punishment.  Either dead, or no longer in the University.  For example, the frame seems to be about seven or eight years after the WMF narrative.  Sim, Wil, and Fela are no doubt long passed through the University, so can't be hurt by punitive action (there's also the possibility that some or all of them are dead, but I have my reasons for not believing this is true).  Riem's no doubt long retired, or he turned on Kvothe and deserves to be ratted out.  Elodin's pretty unlikely to give a damn about the other Masters' opinion, and they may even be amused that he burned Hemme's rooms.  Auri very likely has moved on, with her story having a conclusion that the world should be told about.  And what else has he told that really matters?  Also, keep in mind that he hasn't really given anything away about the Ademre that an astute observer couldn't figure out for themselves.  He doesn't really actually describe how they fight, and even if he did, what could you learn from words on paper that compares to years and years of excruciating, devoted training?  If anything, he enhances their reputation, by explaining that for all his talent and reputation, he barely studied amongst them, and barely touched on their abilities.  2.) There may be some secrets he just doesn't give a damn about giving away.  The Maer's arcanist trying to kill him?  Maybe that doesn't deserve to be a protected secret.    The Chandrian need to be told about.  Felurian will never know, and would be flattered anyways.  So ... who is being betrayed?  What secrets don't earn airing?  	112
 So by "don't qualify" you mean "cant afford"? Start a kickstarter. I'll send yoh $50AUS.   I'm a bit of a foodie and I will spend approx 50% of my income on dining and drinking out. Compared with like 40% of it on rent and bills and such.    I do it cos I don't give a shit about saving and I like being full and drunk.    What? I mean, what?   I'm a chick bartender and I CAN'T give away drinks to guys I like the look of without getting punished in some way.    Have one of mine dude.     Hey man, I hope you don't feel humiliated anymore. My bro broke his neck and was in a spinal unit too. Everyone there shits themselves. He's out now and still occasionally shits the bed. We just tell him not to worry and wash the sheets. If your people don't understand your medical condition leads to you sometimes having accidents then you need new people.   Ambidexterity. Fine motor control on one side and gross on the other.   No wisdom teeth.     Eddie Izzard. Unf.   Does this work for girls too? I'll try it next time I jerk it to confirm but anyone else out there?   Nail biter here. Sorry to disappoint.    When I slept with one. It was all legal, 2 years after I graduated, but that first kiss, first nakedness... man I liked him but it was giggly awkward.    Roads are public property. Therefore drinking in your car is consuming alcohol in public, which is against the law.    Marching in the ANZAC Day parade in the town square I'm lucky enough to get positioned next to my crush. 3 hours of the Australian sun later I get heat stroke and vomit all over his shoes.    We never got together.    Will Ferrel   100% agree. I loved Harry Potter and the Artemis Fowl series is the only other thing that ever came close. Don't know what every one else is on about, I loved every book in the series, the ending was perfect and brought it full circle. I bought every book the day it came out, same as HP.   Met my ex 2 weeks before I was leaving the country to live in England for a year.   6 months later he came over to visit me, took me to Amsterdam, Paris and Ireland.  We were staying in a castle in Ireland when I told me he loved me and I lost my virginity to him while Rocky Horror Picture Show played in the background.   I got the guts up to say it back to him the next morning. Very, very timidly...   Looking back I think I only said it because it felt like the right thing to do. I love him as a friend still but I never felt as strongly about him as he did about me.  	15
 Thinking about experimenting with some oils and herbs. Really rub it on y'know?   If we learned anything from Twitch plays pokemon it should be Anarchy always   Is there any stream or pics of what it looks like today?   The inverse of 83 is actually 1/83, and also it was just a quote   17 it's always the inverse   I thought it was a hair covering everything joke. Either way though   Great Gig in the Sky- plane crash  And the entire Wall album's story is just amazing   For sure actually. Could Barney not have just told her what happened and she would have forgiven him?   well we are past the Golden Age of microbiology   The broken legs are a good reminder usually   Sorry, mistook that   Why do frats always seem to do this? Its one organization but as soon as things go south it's the one persons fault and everything is on them? Shouldn't the whole fraternities reputation take responsibility? Honest question   I just spent way too much time on that   Pretty cool, actually   I have no way to get the car off the ground and I'm in an apartment lot so don't want to spill oil all over   Granatomy   I agree. She did choose Don over Chicago but even after that she just goes back to how she was.  Ultimately I can't really say she changed. That's why Ted was a good match for her because he made her want to change    /r/simps   Adrenaline temporarily glues bones/muscles back together   Rewatch it...   Serious question: Why so many cases? How often do some of these actually get used? I don't just mean for this one word but any word   Like the slam dunk of basketball   That's awesome! Is it just me or can you not go upstairs though?   Learn a lot of languages   It does say 4 or 5 got added per season. I honestly thought it was like 2 per episode   I got in at the 2nd school I applied to so yep   This episode has the classic fun fact of Barney previously not knowing how to drive and yet in this episode he has a license. Not only that but what appears to be a rented sports car  Meanwhile Ted is far too nice like always and Stella is a grinch as per usual   The episode where Marshal gets dating advise from Barney and fails miserably. They make up at the end though   Thank you!!   Lol mortgage. I'm just a college student renting an apt but if you guys wanna kickstart me some beer money I wouldn't be opposed...   Ohh dang I just had it in the water. I just have to brown it though in a skillet then throwin it in a crock pot   Since this comment section is literally nothing I have a question about my frozen meat for this chili I'm making. I took it out of the freezer and it's totally frozen, what' the quickest way to defrost it?  edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone got it chillin in a ziploc full of water. Veggies are ready to go on the cutting board  Edit2: http://imgur.com/gBHxbJB chilli is a go! Thanks everyone!   Just because it's a new rule doesn't mean it's going to be enforced more   Even more amazing it was over $2000. You'll be losing money if you DONT buy it   It's not a top Sue Ellen   There's an episode when Kramer is driving the mail truck and he says he's gonna call Jerry and Newman asks how and Kramer says "I brought my phone", but that wouldnt be funny anymore b/c people wouldnt understand you cant just take your house phone out   But then it sounds like this: We invited JFK, the strippers... and stalin :/   The How not to be Seen video from there was classic   Sort of the Banya of Seinfeld   Or just be loaded up on sandwiches going into it   That's actuaally pretty funny   So far it's have to poop htp, which doesn't surprise me   Definitely its a ramen noodle night twfbnfe4lol      Man hands   Yeahh. Had the show been like 3 seasons it would have been fine because we knew it was just about meeting her. By season 9 though I think us fans wanted to know all about her, not just the shadow.   I don't think there could possibly be an answer to this. If you think about it, he would have to be describing everything people are saying and where they are etc. It's sortof the difference between reading a book and then just watching the movie   Slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie   The douchebags are replaced with crazy people yelling at nothing. One time there was this old dude with his hands raised yelling "THIS! I CREATED ALL THIS!". It was funny though   My 3 hour layover in Atlanta was pretty much awful   I know right? My family used go on ferry rides from Bremerton just for the views   Only club in the Palouse maybe   I think it's totally unfair to Halliday what happened to him and I hope he recovers.  But this will be a great oppurtunity. Since this season is more or less over anyways Falk will get some good training in. Then the next 3 years he can continue on building a strong team and Mike Leach can steer him in the right direction   Thanksgiving day, in my opinion, is one of the busiest travel days of the year  I just want to punch her   Yes, and the stuff she said which everyone claimed to be funny just because she's not they type of girl who would say those things, was just painful to listen to   Yeah and that's because he looked like the definition of old school cool   /rising      What's with these?  http://pckeyboard.com/page/category/BargainRack  $2?   I don't know about jail but certain parts of your body would be a little too exposed for the impending plate throwing   I love craft beer but there's just those nights when I need me some PBR   I don't understand why he had to manipulate votes anyways. He got like no less than 500 points on anything he ever posted plus gold half the time. He said he downvoted info that wasn't correct, but people only paid attention to his posts anyways   Same here. They're easy to order, they dont leave you drymouthed like jack and coke, and you look cool   This is what always gets me. They're like yeah 1000 will pay my kids school, oh 60? Good thing the casino is right over there   I'm a college student who got rid of fb. It's really not that bad, you just have to use email more   So that he could once again talk to Tony and get his sweet archaeologist gig    If people upvote it, that means it's good content, plain and simple.  The people who upvote are probably the same people who forward emails   That may be, but the people commenting =/= the people upvoting. Theres plenty of examples of thousands of upvotes, but the few hundred comments are all negative towards the image. Usually the comment section is people who truly care about the quality of pictures on here   They also have soup. 500 50 oz cans of Chicken noodle comin my way   Ok wrong word lol. Not something you'll have the rest of your life.    You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers.   Yes, I work at walmart so walking around a lot so when I started working I bought a pair of Nike trainers and they've been amazing. I see my coworkers wearing chuck taylors and can't imagine the horror their feet are going through   Seriously. I mean I know everyone has that thing they like to spend their money on but buying coffee however many times a week is an astronomical amount of money on something that's not even tangible   Artificial sweetener like Splenda. Probably not the best but look how common it is now   I'm not sure what the WUE is but 1) I think if you applied now you would get in and 2) if you wait til December I think that's still plenty of time before the deadline although I don't totally remember  Plus doesn't your application update when your new SAT score comes in? I think it might   Keep your eyes out on CL   At least 3000. This is the type of thing where you just make a milkshake that's 1000 calories   Oh yeah I giggled for like a minute at lacrimal caruncle   is it the evidence of abstinence?   Initials plus lord helix since I made this when twitch plays pokemon was happening. I guess its just a cultural reference now   So should I take tests while hungry as well?   Yeah I watched all of Scrubs then someone tried to get me to watch house. House is just a dick minus being funny and I figured every episode was going to be like that.   I just think they could have labeled way more things, and way cooler things too   That's actually not that bad. Especially in that glass case, looks super nice. Plus all those random things put together some of which aren't exceedingly common.   First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...  Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.  I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.  Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin      Was that a recording of a crappy tv from someones flip phone circa 1996?   I've seen girls at my school walkin around in the smallest dresses of all time and heels in the winter on ice   I love the hair fwoop even though he doesn't have long hair   I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together   I always kindof thought that was off. Doesn't a judge have to be impartial?   coh-STANZ-a   Hope the cadavers in my anatomy lab appreciate these   She also tries to run off to Spain using the money they don't have when Marshal is being an environmental lawyer. Sounds more like something Barney would do   He is exactly what you need. No more, no less.   The thing about Jar Jar is that I've grown up to hate him. Ewoks are cool though   Us plebeians down here can only dream      That one girl towards the end just chanting in the dudes face. Such fury   That's what I thought it was until the end when everything just went on as is.  Ultimately though I think it was just a way to showcase the actors talents. Either way I thought it was a cool scene      Then years later marry the girl who helped him to live   I should, totally ruined my night   Yeah guess I got ahead of myself there thinkin I was goin for the easy kill   It was the best burger in NYC   If you're talkin Rogue Squadron there was the AT-ST walker level, the Tatooine race with the T-16, the cadillac, the millenium falcon, naboo starfighter. I love that game      Who's Zed?   I love Scrubs so much. The difference between JD and Ted is that JD is like hmm I haven't been laid in awhile guess I'll pull the doctor card and pull a hot girl while Ted overthinks everything   Technically that would still be 0  	110
    What happened to the mega box project Kim said would be out Q2 this year? I was really interested in that music service and I really wish they would have released it.   Sony knows advertising. [The feels this brings back.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkMdi3XBhw list=FLFjXwg3udgBSHYy_doiGkgg)   [Reminds me of this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZtPhvJQ7Eo)   Yeah it's bold and it's good. Att next and other pay monthly per device plans are actually a good thing that has been implemented. They are a good deal. Websites say it isn't because they are factoring in your monthly bill for service and data, but you can not count that because you would be paying that any way.    As a samsung fan, I feel disgusted. First it was the fake benchmark scores (geekbench being one of them) and now fake web comments. I know all companies do it a little but for samsung to be caught in the act, means they were doing a lot more than their share. Samsung makes a much more powerful phone than anybody else, but where is the backbone?

 Shame on you. Can you imagine how the Mother 4 team must feel right now? They're trying to do something great WITHOUT pay in the few hours of free time they have outside jobs and school and this is what they get in return. Insults and accusations? THEY OWE YOU NOTHING! Even if this game never came out (even though they've assured us otherwise) it's still the closest we have to more mother content and that should be enough. It's still a beacon for mother fans everywhere that this game series is still loved and that love is shared. It's a message for Nintendo that our admiration for the series lives on. Also, I really hope you all think about the kind of damage you might be doing to this project. The mother 4 team is full of real people who can also be discouraged like real people. Now more than ever they need our support. Nothing would make me want to drop a project faster than to receive this kind of feedback from all sides. Count yourselves lucky that they haven't pulled the plug. Also I hope the mother 4 team sees this and knows that there are still many people who do believe in them and don't care if it takes months or even a year. This is too important to give up on, I'm rooting for you. *attempts to pray*   oh, I was commenting on mother 4's development time. Although I'm wondering has it been longer? I know I hadn't heard about it until it was quite a ways in.   Most of the people in this subreddit have grown up with the Mother series. Many years ago, I stopped waiting for a new game to come out. I knew it was over and the dust had settled on my adventures in the Mother universe. Now everyone take a minute to realize you're getting excited for a new Mother game. This is real excitement for a real event that had a one in a million chance of happening! I bet you wouldn't have known you could feel this excitement for the Mother series ever again, just 5 years ago. It's just....it's just beautiful. :)   if you'll look at the top contributor of the creepypasta wiki you found it on, you'll see the name test_subject2452. That's me. I'm not entirely sure how else I can prove it, I can write a comment on that wiki using my other profile if you'd like.   Thanks everyone. The guys over at 4chan are such dicks, after posting there I thought my story must have been garbage, but this was a nice confidence boost.  	5
 You've never experienced "X"? Therefore " X" must not exist.   Ha   The only way they can feel special.   Johnnies have been rumbled.   What's the alternative? Most good neighborhoods have an hoa attached.   Dank mimes bro.   "I totally expected that." "Naw man, it's ok."   Seems like he's trying to justify being a pussy and not going after the guy that punched him for starting shit.   Or, he wanted you to give him a haram bj   Please post this to /r/shittyaskscience   Triple H would be proud at how you played the game.   I don't see how it doesn't. I'm a Hafiz, you can trust me.   wat??   Not only the training and age, but coming back from a surgery that no fighter has really successfully come back from, much less retain the god damn belt.   Hurr durr let's compare fighters who are 100 pounds apart and talk about who would win in a fight.   Lesnar also had to be roided to the gills, so who knows how long that could have lasted.   I've got no problem with storebrand generic microwave "heated corn snack product,"  I would just prefer if it were to be labeled as such, and not sold as buttery movie theater popcorn goodness.   This sub has turned to this kind of shit.  Oh there's no drama here?  Better post it to /r/SubredditDrama !  There's no more real popcorn anymore.  Ony storebrand generic microwave "heated corn snack product."   I agree that a vast majority of cops are good, honest people. But the anger you are seeing here and other online forums is brought on by a feeling of utter helplessness. Where are the people supposed to turn for help when the ones assigned to help them are causing the hurt in the first place?   It's kind of a cop's jib to escort a woman in labor to the er, or talk a jumper down. Public safety and whatnot. Strange that you think those actions are somehow above and beyond the call of duty, when it is in fact the very description of their duty.   Imagine any decent qb with moss in their prime. He sent three average at best qbs to the damn pro bowl. Fucking cowboys and packers passes on him, and he specifically targeted them for ass rape ever since then, cause he wanted to play with aikman and favre. Hell, jerry even told him that if he fell to their pick, they'd take him.    Taking a shot at Tate? This is just some light hearted football rivalry banter.   It also dies a painful death because it doesn't fit the UFC's standard shitty posters with one fighter facing front in the foreground and the other facing sideways in the back ground.   The fight that never happened.   So....get ready for false convictions to go way up?   It's as if the show had shitty writers.   It will be front paged in under three hours guaranteed.  Book it.   paying attention to other bullshit....Not for Nick Diaz.   This mistake is common?  Time for the hipsters to move on.   What, so you only attack narrow minded people? You know, men prefer women with curvy minds, shitlord.   Really hard   What is that?   The end.   Le Neckbeardgini    Good for you   Sounds like divorce time   We get it   I always wanted to see a 100 home run season and a 500 strikeout season.   Pride Japan loved freak show fights.   LOOPHOLE MOTHERFUCKERS!!!   untestable for life   His fight with Lyoto was never officialy scheduled.  He's been offered Lyoto four times, and the refusal always came from Vitor.   I swear to god, if Machida ever pisses hot, I'm fucking done as a fan.   Depending in the car, that can easily get over $1000   That second one is now my standard go-to pose for all photographs.    This now qualifies as Disney actress?   There is no reason for him to.   Just cancel Dolloway all together   Real men like Terry Crews and Liam Hemsworth. None of that Artie Lang shit.   Why?   Ooooh baby   WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE, CITIZEN?   Vanilla is the most under appreciated ice cream, dawg. Especially if you can land yourself some Blue Bell.   Roids messin with his shit, lol.   SPOILERS!!!   That doesn't even make sense. Arabs are pedophiles, not zoophiles.   I'm in a few keeper leagues.  My commish just keeps an active google docs sheet that everyone can access, but only he can edit.  Trades are announced to the league via email, or whatsapp, then recorded in the google docs.   At this point, I would pay ludicrous amounts of money to watch Cerrone repeatedly punch himself for 5 rounds, and then simply be awarded a belt.   I was gonna buy tickets to this one since I moved to LA.  Guess not.   *I've come to talk with you again*   Isn't Also also ridiculously young?   just wrestling, right?   And on top of it all, it's was completely pointless and unfunny.      Excellent   There's no fucking drama here.  This sub is just starting to point out tiny bitch fights everywhere, labeling it as "drama"   For real. I've never met anyone that listed The Amazing Spiderman as their favorite movie.  Damn I'm old.   I have one of those!   a shitty website   Greater Dehli and Greater Mumbai larger than Texas.   Because this is America and she can do whatever the fuck she wants with her personal property?   Naturally occurring, or the result of too much tampering with sharks and tornadoes by man?   link?   Arabs are known for being cost effective. Good point.   No he's not. Uriah Faber has a much deeper butt chin.   Well, watching certain fighters is torture. *cough* Ben Askren *cough*   Not from the pain. Certain submissions cut off blood and or oxygen to the brain. Thus the black out.   He remembers me!      Wake me up from this dream   I wonder if there's a subreddit specifically for old school cool pics.   I'm not a racist, but nigger   What, what?   McGreggor carrying UFC lol   Rolling   Probably shouldn't have ordered 6 crates of special edition bluerays of Scorpion King 4   Seriously.  I'm sick of seeing a guy get dominated for 4:45 of the round, then pull a takedown for the last 15 seconds and win the god damn round.      I like when people try to talk in legalese and get all technical, but they clearly have no idea what the next words out of their mouths are gonna be.   That was brilliant   Does a tuna sandwich really pair well with Mac and cheese?         /r/SubredditDrama   They follow controversy around reddit and observe from the sidelines.                        Can some one tldr this.  Laptom speakers crapping out.   This is SRD worthy   Tried it   Music scene wise, maybe you're right.  But the radio stations are the blandest bland I've ever heard.  and I've lived in Dallas and Miami, which both have pretty bad station lists.  But nothing has been as pop driven as LA.   Damn.  Godwin's law smacked this thread in the face with it's dick.   confirmed   97.9 seems to be the most active rock station as far as the music scene in PHX.  They do local music shows, band auditions on the radio, as well as being heavily involved in small venue concerts.  Also, that station actually plays rock music, and not just pop rock that you'll hear on KISS FM or JackFM.   wot   My mind's telling me noooooo   Phoenix has phenomenal radio stations, and a really thriving rock music scene.  When I moved to LA, I realized how good I had it.  Everything here is just generic genericism.  But I guess I should expect no less from where pop culture is born.    This will be reposted in under 5 hours and reach the front page.   Good sounding too. Probably good feeling as well.   That was my point, sorry if it came out wrong.  Colt is a fucking legend in Texas, so him beating the cowboys was kind of bitter sweet to a lot of us Texans.   With Colt McCoy no less.   How is that not a catch?   Holy shit.    Every time   So being an overall asshole is considered insanity wolf now?   No more Josh Smith, easy peasy.   Brazilian Japanese   Finally, a non shit-post TIL   Seriously, with all those colleges in Boston and their sporting facilities, would the city even need to build anything?   NO RAGRETS!   Isn't that pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell?   Reposts. Not everyone saw it the first time.   That's pretty much how it is in England.   [Lyoto "The Dragon" Machida](http://static.enlapelea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MachidaLyoto.jpg)   I'm a straight man   She started out as the character I hated most.  But as the seasons went on, and the show kept getting worse, she started growing on me more and more.         I play CSS mostly, and this was a huge problem for us. And while it seems that aimbots and such are being detected, and people are being banned, can anything be done about players using materials hacks? Ultrabrights, walls, etc. The pre-firing behind walls and doors in some servers is ridiculous.            It's an amazing card, and I just moved to LA.  I want to go to this, but I have no friends out here.  Can we get a group together for this or something?  Would I be better off posting this in /r/LosAngeles ?

 Ok, I don't have any spare codes but if you give me code I'll send you a link to a website for your xb1. On it you can play classic arcade games, app store games and other similar titles.         Are the codes together (both games in one code or desperate codes)   Thanks :D I was thinking of waiting till I see what days I'll be working. So if I was to work Mondays, Wednesday's and Saturdays I would come home and do revision/homework then leave for work and go to the gym on Tuesdays, Thursday's, Friday's and Sundays after homework/revision. The reason I don't just do gym or work is cause I dont want my parents to pay my gym membership since they pay for my Netflix, xbox etc so a job would let me pay it myself and get a few other things. I'll figure it out, thanks for answering.   I know it's been removed but force yourself. Just make yourself do it. In my old school I liked a girl, this was two years ago. I was too late when I finally went to ask her out. By the time I went to ask her she had gone with someone else and they're still together. I moved on and later found that I really ***liked*** my friend Chelsea. We had been friends for years and I said screw and asked her. She said yes!! I moved away not long after which really upset me but at least I asked her. Just force yourself before it's too late.   Me too. I have friends outside if school who I lobe being with and friends at my old school.  It the people I talk to in school aren't going to be people I'll talk to when schools done or in the summer etc I'm just kinda ***that*** friend too.   We play xbox. Watch movies. Go to the cinema. Go to the comic-book shop and walk around when we're bored.   Hey guys. I turn 16 this month and I'm going to get a part time job. I also decided that I would start going to the gym. How can I balance school, homework/revision, work and gym? Do any of you do this?       Let's do this!!   I love it too and I've re-read it a few times but nowhere near fifty!! :D   Oh that's too bad. You should definitely re-read them.   I love the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!!    No problem :)   I love the the Harry Potter series. I'm re-reading it now in fact.   Oh I loved the Harry Potter series. I've actually just started re-reading it again for like the fifth time.   For book tips I suggest you read:  "GONE"   By Michael Grant l. It's a six book series and I absolutely loved it!! I became so attached to the characters and hated some and so never found a second of any of the plots to be dull or slow moving. Definitely worth your time. Just a tip they are read in this order:  * Gone  * Hunger  * Lies  * Plague  * Fear  * Light      I never hack accounts. I know how to but I would never do that. I also never mod online games. I will only ever mod so how player games or sections of games because I can make things more fun. I do it for my pc games and sometimes for my xbox games. Like I said though I would never annoy someone with nodding or hacking. When I rarely take mods online it's with my friends and we just mess around. For the most part I just prefer to play the game without mods because I think it's better the way it came. Gta Iv and skyrim are great for mods.   My top 5 in no order:  Tomb raider series (old and reboot)  Halo series  Gta series  The walking dead (telltale games)  Mass effect series  (Some honourable mentions: Elder scrolls and fallout series, and the Sims series)   I'm starting to workout and want to see how far others have made it. Though I won't be working out obsessively. I'm going to start the gym in March/April but right now I'm just doing it around the house.   When I started nofap I made it to around two weeks (I'm a teenager and my hormones got crazy) now on my second try I made it to 3 days. I know it's not great but I've learned from it.   In the time I quit I've started going outside with my friends... a lot. I used to never go outside I would only talk to them at school and through the internet.   I'm a typical "nerd" so I don't have giant muscles etc but I started working out.  I've stopped procrastinating... as much and I only play my xbox for an hour or so a day now (I used to play for at least 7).   All of this is great and just because I relapsed isn't going to stop me from doing them. Even if I was fapping regularly I could do this but nofap helped me realise it.   All of this could just be a placebo effect because I read about other people's benefits from nofap. Even if it is I don't care. I don't because I feel more energetic and alive and I owe that to nofap.   I'm going to start again today and hopefully make it. But untill then I'll just go a day at a time, learn from my mistakes and keep the benefits.   Finally!!    Hello everyone. I'm a 15 year old guy. I'm about 5'6 tall and I'm pretty skinny but not underweight. I'm wondering if I'd maybe look weird with abs and noticeable upper body muscles since I'm so short.   Also I have asthma which is another reason I want to start, to help improve my lungs. I kind of look like a typical geek (which I kind of am which makes posting here weird for me since I never work out) Can any of you give me any tips on how to get upper body strength, abs and a good work out plan. I don't want to take protein shakes etc but I'm willing to eat healthier.       I'm from Scotland and when I saw this on the news I found it kind of annoying. He isn't a pervert or anything and he makes kids happy.   Not a theory. Read the books. In them it's heavily, heavily hinted at.   Exactly. It wasn't the people's fault and the children were indoctrinated so much so that they worshipped Hitler right up untill their death!!    I agree with you 100%. The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said though it might not be the best time to release it but I agree that we should learn from history, move on and not repeat it.   I agree (not as an American, I'm scottish). The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate  Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said it could happen in any country.   Leave it doesn't matter if he's the "best man ever" when he's sober!! No matter what call the police and leave him.   Post this on /r/relationship_advice   Exactly!! I do think it was necessary to start with due to Hitler's indoctrination of the young Germans of that time.    I agree take something away and it makes it more desirable. I do think it was necessary to begin with though due to the fact that most of Germany had been indoctrinated by Hitler and the Nazis but the fact is Germans of today don't agree with what happened.    I agree with you one hundred per cent. People seem to have a mind set that Germans are all Nazis because of what happened 75 years ago.    They're great!! :D      Stop masturbating. It's often cause of the fact that you have left over sperm in you urethra.   Yeah they're good together :)   Actually no I'm not. I have very high marks in all of my science classes which I love and history, music, maths and English. I just don't believe that dinosaurs existed. I do believe humans have been too the moon but I don't think it was when they said it was. I'm not into conspiracy theories but I just don't believe it.    I love them together!! :D   I don't believe that dinosaurs ever existed and I also think the moon landing was fake and it was a way for the Americans to win the space race (I'm not Russian) but I do think that it has been landed on since.   Okaaaay...   I don't know I've never really liked Jackie Chan but I see why you'd like them a lot of people do.   Me too they have great chemistry on screen and you just know that they're friends offscreen too.      Great!! :D when you get it if you need someone to play just pm here and I'll add you :)   Yeah archaeology. I know it's tough but I know archaeologist and I'm from Scotland there is still a place here which actively hires archaeologists. Thanks if I have any questions I'll message you!! :D   I want to be either an medical doctor or an architect (I'm still undecided but I've wanted to be a doctor since I was 3 and been thinking a lot about archaeology for a while now). So I'm going to volunteer at a dig and help out at my local hospital but both are voluntary and I want to be able to make my own money during the summer :)   Do you remember what it was like when you were dead?   Aaah the invention of the wheel... I remember it well.   How old are they?  I suggest you take them out too the movies and buy them a nice meal that they wouldn't eat on a regular basis so something like a McDonald's if they don't get them a lot. Then before you come home buy them a movie. When you get there build them a couch fort, lay out a ton of candy, ice cream, biscuits and cake etc then put on the movie (make sure they pick which one in the store). Let them sleep down there and wake them up in the morning with cartoons and pancakes. It's a lot of work but they'll love it!!   That's if they're a bit younger basically not teenagers yet. If they're older just say and I'll give you some tips :)   Hi, it really depends on you. Both have some great exclusives and great players. I'm personally more of an xbox guy but I'll list the pros and cons of both  ***xbox one pros***  It has a great interface  Ability to "snap" apps which means that you can play a game while watching a movie or skypeing etc  A lot of amazing exclusives and timed exclusives like tomb raider, sunset overdrive and halo  A great company ( MS)   ***Wii U pros***  Great exclusives like Zelda, Mario and a bunch more I honestly think it's one of the most under rated consoles ever!!  It's unique with the controller I like having the pad.  It's a nice slim console  It is backwards compatible with Wii games  It is free to play online  It's cheapei  It's good for families  ***xbox one cons***  If you buy one it will cost you more than the Wii u  It is pretty big (not as huge as people make out but it takes up some space)  You have to pay a monthly subscription  It's not backwards compatible with previous xboxes  ***Wii u cons***  It doesn't have as many online players as xbone/ps4 but it's not a huge deal  Even though it has a ton of great games and exclusives it doesn't get some of the best games like gta.  It can't be used for things like tv unless of course you're using netflix etc     Both consoles are great so either way you should be happy. Happy gaming, when you choose let us know what you pick and I'll play with you :)      Hi reddit, I turn 16 in March and I'm still a student. I'm wondering if any of you know of any types of jobs I could do part time. I don't mind if it would only be for the summer or if it would be year round. I live in a suburban area of a city so I can easily get to malls etc. Any help would be appreciated.   Because I have a lot for 360 and mainly only dlc  for the one.   Ok cool if you want I have a halo MC collection dlc and some gta money and as for games (I mainly have physical copies) but I have a few codes. What type of games do you like?   Oh also if you don't like the games I say later if you're in the UK I'm willing to post them to you and I won't ask for the code untill you get the game in the mail.   Hi, do you want a game code for 360 or one.      Oil isn't all we have. We have tourism, agriculture, whiskey and about 50,000,000 other attributes, people only seem to think about oil.   Ha, ha!! :)   I'd sent them a postcard :)   While we're technically together Scotland has a lot of its own laws, it's on education system and by politicians I meant where they're from.    I'm not going to get into it cause I'll just rant. I don't so much hate the English people (well I hate some English but not cause they're English, I don't judge people cause of where they're from). Anyway I hate your government, politicians and a lot of English people (but like I said not cause they're English).    Still you touchy for me too.   Hopefully there will be a next time.   I know it's weird but I like our weather. If you put all Scots in the heat for too long we fry   :) I agree   I agree we don't need the union.   I agree :)   I agree 100%   Yup scottish here. I don't like being called Brittish so I guess you can figure out that England isn't exactly my favourite place.   Why?    Has your opinion changed since the referendum?    Ha, ha true. I occasionally watch the river side show on stv Glasgow but not often.   I would remove Scotland from England and move it (Scotland) and Ireland slightly closer to Norway.    Actually all the UK has done is made people ignorant about us. We have a ton of tourists visit here year round and that has nothing to do with being in the UK. It's to do with our land, the people, our myths and a ton of other things. Being in the UK is simply a drain of our resources.      In Scotland we have [stoor worm](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoor_worm) which is the equivelant of the Norse midgard serpent which, was also called the world snake.   I love Scottish culture but hate that we're part of the UK.   I guess xbox, science, books, music, movies and shows. It depends on the person.   I will, I hope she gets better. I'll say a prayer now and at mass tomorrow (if I make it). I'   I don't know if this will work but try /r/donate or /r/donations hopefully one will work    Ha, ha Hail sithis!! :D   How so?   Actually they are. People need to pay companies like Amazon to sell anything on their sites, then you throw in people that advertise there and, if I keep using Amazon as my example, they sell things like the kindle.   Shave or trim "down there". If done correctly it feels smooth, looks nice, stops you from sweating as much,  stops odour, protects against crabs for those of you that have a lot of sex and a bunch of other positives.   I made it for motivation not to discourage anyone.   Thanks, sorry it turned into this.    Well at least we now know reddit masturbates.       Hey you were the one who started this. You saw and said you would report me get over it!! Not everyone is religious, is there for those who are!   No, he'll is for the worst of people and as long as they haven't committed any seriously immoral sins (like murder, rape or anything along this  lines) I believe they will go to heaven.   I'm not forcing them on you. Simply by saying I have them is forcing them? If someone doesn't have a religion that's fine, to each his own but simply because it's there you started.    Look I put it in there for those that are religious, don't like it then leave. You can't complain about someone else's beliefs. Ok not everyone is religious but like I said it's there for those that are!! This really isn't a big deal. You're making mountains out of mole holes. No one else here has complained, look at the other comments that have stemmed from yours. Two other people agree with me. It's not a big deal.   /u/Poropopper don't worry about it I'll add it cause I know that a lot of people here do meditate and it might give them a boost :)   /u/decisionmadetoday you are basically saying someone can't even mention **their** religion without you getting all hissy pissy about it. Everyone has a right to their beliefs. I respect yours, please respect others.   I do it for myself and just cause even though no one gets all the negatives many do get at least some and I don't want that also I'm religious so that comes into play.   Thank you :)   Coolio that gives you a cool reason to keep going... untill you decide not to. :)   I never felt tired after fapping and during my last streak I definitely had more energy Infact I still do because I said I wasn't going to let myself lose it and I haven't!! :) I still prefer being on a streak than fapping.   Exactly :)   What did I do? All I said was that I added it for those that are. I made this to help motivate people and if you don't like it then go away.   And I'm the weird uncle that for whatever reasons lives in your basement :)   Thanks :)   Thank you :)   Sorry if you guys don't like it. I made it cause these are all things I've heard people say have happened to them and I thought I'd put all the negatives vs all the positives.   Ha, ha ***hillarious***   Ha, ha :)    Oh well that's up to you.   Yeah a lot of people in puberty say that. I think it has something to do with their testosterone levels.   That's good then cause you don't have to go through what some others will, good luck :) I added all the other stuff for those that get it since I've seen a lot of posts mentioning these things.   I think I might add something about meditating since a lot of people do it. Yeah in fact I'll do that soon :)   Hey, I'm not saying everyone's going to feel any or all of these but I made it for motivation for those that do :)   Ha, ha I ***should*** add that :D   No I mean that a lit of people that watch too much porn come to disrespect women or think that their penis should be like 10 inches. Also I put religion in there for those that are religion. If you're not I'm sorry if it offended you.   I see what you mean. I'm not trying to say someone's going to get all of the negatives and/or all of the positives but this is what people have reported (all different people) so I figured it could be used for motivation.   Some people are religious. Some aren't. I put it in for those that are (like me).   	119
 Ultimate troll job by the U.S. Government   Gotta love it   They didn't even release this on Twitter    Yep.

FIFA is inherently almost supposed to be corrupt. You can't run something that big without it being so.  This is just a temporary reset on the grift and gives the semblance of balance so the next corruption bubble can be burst years from now.     Man....if this is the beginning of the end for FIFA and their corrupt ways  LOL  How naive.  You'll never have an international sports organization that isn't somewhat corrupt.

In a real democracy, our thoughts would be more aligned  You sure about that?             Don't hate the player...   I DO understand it.  But i'm asking if its really and truly a good idea.  Theres a lot of people in the US who I absolutely think don't either appreciate what it takes to run a nation like the US or has the balls to be assertive enough to lean on other nations in large geopolitical matters.  I partly worry that the average person is either uneducated or simply...too nice and thus, naive.    don't hate the player...      You're not really answering me here.        OK...but what does this mean?  I mean, what would a "real" democracy produce in the US?   So?

 I agree, but I still wish the roman empire could have been larger.   From a post I just saw on here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Somalia_map_states_regions_districts.png   It was not failed. After Trajan's death, emperor Hadrian was more concerned in preserving the empire, not expanding it. He decided that Mesopotamia could not be kept, and so voluntarily retreated. Whether the Roman Empire could have held on to that land is mere speculation.   The most direct benchmarks are the individual indices. The German Dax 30, French CAC 40, British FTSE 100, Italian FTSE MIB 40, the Spanish IBEX 35. These five economies consist of over half of the EU GDP so can be a good gauge, four of them (excluding the FTSE 100) are in the euro zone. However, due to the German and french economic clout in the euro area, the DAX and CAC 40 could suffice.  There is the Stoxx 50: the fifty largest Eurozone companies; which is maybe something you are looking for. However, it is similar to the Dow Jones Inudstrial Average 30, as there are very few companies.  The S P Europe 350, or the FTSE Europe 300 could also be indices that you are interested. But to be honest, these are not that good. For example, they include Swiss companies, which are neither in the EU nor euro zone.  Overall, of course, its up to you. Make your own judgement. I believe it is best to use the individual indices as the Europe is by no means united enough (hopefully soon) to have a single index. Compare the European economies and you will understand what I mean. But if you insist, try using the Stoxx 50.  Hope this helped, good luck!   Regret not being protoss. Wish I didn't have to do much and just macro to get death ball. Zerg actually seems hard, much respect.   Thanks! :)   I wish the new unit would be an upgrade built in tech lab needing armory. This upgrade would revamp the reaper, so that it becomes useful again in the late game. This would reduce the need of new hotkey, be a barracks unit, and make the reaper useful later in the game. What the upgrade should do to it, how much it will cost, etc. is not up to a plat player to decide.   TIL clouds move   Instead of a new unit, why cant we have an upgrade to the reaper. This upgrade would require some later game building (armory?) and would completely transform the reaper into some better unit. This would keep the same amount of hotkeys, and make reapers useful later on in the game. Im no pro, so I dont want to propose how the reaper should change, but Im sure this would be better than simply adding a new unit.   Got upvotes, no comments :(  You're all a bunch of backstabbers! :'(   Hey r/nootropics! Any recommended source of nootropics for France (western Europe too I guess)? Is there anything else I should do? Thank you in advance!   The grass is so green :O beautiful      I heard about NQ group. Where can I find them?   It was truly nothing. Just teasing. I was worried of getting banned because it happened to me and others many times, and deliberately did not go far.   Quality post :D   Dear multiplayer game host,  Why do you ban people?  You were playing as Maya on pangea, and were winning by a wide margin. I was Austria, slowly being surrounded by your cities. I convince everyone to unite against you as you declare war on me, and I fight tooth and nail. I forward expand towards you to defend myself, and I obviously troll you to rustle your jimmies.  Why did you ban me and everyone else from the game dear host? What is the point? Why do you even play on multiplayer then? You were far from losing, why dont you accept the challenge? Why do you, dear host, always ban the person who challenges you? Why do you do that? And why do you call me 'noob' right before banning me? If im so bad, why ban me?  So many questions, but the only answer I see is "You have been kicked". Please love me back...  Sincerely, Everyone else in the game.  PS. In all seriousness, why do hosts even play multiplayer if all they do is ban the first threat they see? Why isnt there some voting where a majority needs to vote for banning a player?   PSS. Oh and host, please buy BNW, G K is sh*t (no trade roads!?).   My favorite: carriers don't need sailing.   Why did bbyong all in!? I was so surprised! He was ahead (economy and army). Please explain to a mere mortal. (platinum league)   What about Egypt :D   I completely agree with you, and hoped you were ESTJ :(   Estj?   I will limit any exposure. This is more of a side investment. However, may you please explain to me why you would want to avoid the sector?   Hey r/investing! So I am interested in the solar energy market for many reasons which you can easily find throughout the internet. I am interested in picking individual stocks (no hate please), but I have no knowledge of any solar company (apart from vague knowledge due to Elon Musk investing in SolarCity). Therefore, I looked at two solar ETF's, found 6 of their largest holdings each, and wanted to find the biggest companies. This is because, in a emerging industry, I would like only the largest companies.  Here they are, ranked by their weighting in the ETF's:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XfbhRl9XYBIgPxbqtpNMo802W5MQ76BPgSZVtj13D-E/edit?usp=sharing  I know many of you here are interested in solar, so I am sure this would help you guys. My question is, why is Hanergy so over valued? Is solar city so overvalued because of Mr. Musk? I would love some brief explanations of why some companies are so overvalued compared to others.   Thanks so much! And I hope this little chart is helpful!   What do you investors think about solar? What about its companies? What about the subsidies (notably from China)?  	25

I thought so too. We had half a cup of heavy cream left, so I decided to use that and half a cup of milk. Maybe the combination wasn't the best choice. Plus, I had under 2 lbs of russet, so I used new potatoes to even out to around 2.5 lbs.    Thanks!

I had planned to with a recent ticket but it had already reached the '$10' fee and decided I may as well check to see if I had any more that haven't been paid.

Instead of going back to work, if nothing needed to be done immediately, we'd take a full hour break (or longer). Plus on Thursdays, they'd pay for my lunch when we ordered chinese food from a restaurant nearby with great lunch specials.   It depends on the work environment, but I always enjoyed lunch breaks.      Great read. Thanks for the post! :-)   That, I did not know. Since this was a new article, I felt it worthy of being posted. Others might agree.    o_O?   I never understood the obsession other women have over diamonds and always felt it was a marketing scheme. Turns out my intuitions were right.  In today's world, a lot of marketing can be seen as a scheme. Hell with all the photoshop enhanced pictures, even what is perceived as 'true beauty' is a scheme.

He's really nice once you get to know him. Someone in town created a facebook page and people post stories and what he is up to, on a daily basis. Plus, he's open to having his picture taken with his doll.  I do not know a lot about him, but I've been told he has a job and a home. There are a lot of homeless (and mentally unstable) people in town, but he has a lot going for him, dispite his circumstances.   Don't hate what you can't understand.  There's a guy in town who pushes a doll in a stroller and often wears womens clothes. Turns out his wife was killed a few years back and its his way of coping - also schizophrenia (sp?) but it was caused by his loss.    Try 8 years. Just can't tolerate caffeine (sp?) or carbonation.    Rope Burns is the chapter in the book Million Dollar Baby for which the movie is based.    Really? That surprises me quite a bit. I worked at a food bank for a while and they'd receive 'damaged' merchandise. Once FruitLoops (sp?) sent them a large shipment of cereal b/c they left out one color.    If you're driving to buildings such as Snow Hall -since you can access the back of the building even if campus is closed - there's no way to not drive on campus.    I found it ridiculous since it happens everyday and the crosswalk isn't that far from their houses.   Clearly this sort of thing happens all over campus, but that's a heavily trafficed area.   Wow, can't take a joke? Sorry I forgot to add 'JK'.   I served my time as a part of the  greek community , so I thought the generalization fit rather well.    But then you'd be at fault for running over/ hitting a pedestrian, even if they deserved it. Could you live with that?   And not a true graham cracker, unfortunately. Didn't know that until I had received a cookbook a few weeks ago as a present. One of the last recipes is for graham crackers and it even includes information about the origins!   Sorry, I do not recall the title right off. If you're interested, I'll provide that later.    I suggest going on a self-discovery. Spend some time finding out who you are, why you do the things you do, and what has led you to where you are today.  I've spent the past year doing this and just this week, I finally found the answer I was looking for. It wasn't easy coming  to terms with it, but I now know why I behave the way I do, today.   I wish you the best of luck! :-)   None of you are correct, it's To-Puke-a.     Try to avoid properties owned by First Management. They'll keep your deposit if you forget to clean one measly light-bulb fixture and if anything happens to break or stop working, you're better off paying someone to come out b/c it will be weeks, if not months, before FM actually steps in to help.    It's not just frat boys that participate in this sort of 'douchebagness'. If a journalist wanted to show the true impact of alcohol, dig deeper instead of asking one group of guys - and their girlfriends.   KU has had a number of problems concerning sexual assault - date-rape drugs dispensed at parties, passing out jungle juice instead of beer....there's a long line of problems and this article didn't touch on anything besides 'hey I like to get wasted, blackout, wake up with a girl I don't remember from the night before'...and replay the next weekend.  Edit: minor typing errors     Clearly they wanted to paint a perfect picture of getting plastered - bros before hoes. I posted this because I thought it was f*cking ridiculous. I've been to frat parties, I've seen what happens, and this story didn't come close to the reality that unfolds at a typical party scene.       Extra dirty, please. Oh, and don't forget the olives!   Best.Drink.Ever   What videos would you suggest for beginners?   My boyfriend and I are interested in doing yoga together. Unsure of where to start, I was hoping /r/yoga might have a few tips.   A good memory isn't necessarily genetic. It, like all forms of learning, requires repetition.   Math is a necessity in life. Especially if you want to excel in todays world.    Binary Coding = Math  Physics = Math  Computer Science = Math  And the basics: Econ, Accounting, etc.   I grew up hating math because teachers used a method I never understood. Let me rephrase that. It was something I wanted to understand and would tell them that they needed to actually show me how to do it, not just tell me. It clearly wasn't something they could handle. A week after my first college math course, I finally understood what I hadn't years earlier b/c someone took the time to explain it to me in a language I finally understood. Since then I have loved math.   Also: Instead of just teaching math, teachers should provide real-world examples of it being used. If you want a student to appreciate what they're doing, actually show how it will benefit them later on.  Edit 1: Spacing  Edit 2: Rewording   Or at least actually benefiting the child. My mom only used what she received to ensure we were up to date on the latest name-brand fashions.    They were on sale at the supermarket for about $60.   Oh and they were served steamed with butter for dipping! :-)       Groups of teenagers, sometimes younger, would walk into the store and always leave without buying anything. Took management a while to figure out why.  There were no security cameras by the condoms. They would grab several packages and leave. I was well aware of what was going on, but didn't care.     I've always set too high of standards for myself. Eventually leading to the point of seeing specialists to know why I do these things. I understand it's human nature, but when you're constantly comparing your own acheivements to others, it leads to a more depressing approach on life.      Oh hey the new line of Star Wars toys. I was so excited to see these last time I went to Petco!!! Too bad the employees weren't as amused, seeing a 20-something customer playing with dog toys! :-P   I know one of the rules says to not include Facebook. I chose to go against this for the fact I found her post very uplifting. By blurring out the name and pictures, I hope that will allow this post to remain on /r/pics.    My 'mother' used a wooden mirror. It hurt like hell.    From a rural part of KS here:  I was always told to call the police and ensure the individual following was, in fact, a police officer.   Otherwise, floor it and go.    Ahh man, beat me to it! Props to LFK!    Ugh, hit me right where it hurts.  The only problem with this is the fact you have no come to the realization as to why you are unhappy.   My childhood was a complete sh*t-hole, so finding that inner-peace as an adult hasn't come easily. I am lucky enough to have found someone whom I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. The only problem is the fact that I'm still broken, inside.   Oh the journey's life throws our way.....    Being denied entrance into a national park is nothing compared to not receiving WIC disbursements in order to, you know, survive.     	107
 This could be a television show...think of all the crazy scenarios.   yea, they're definitely holding on to that for a while. Reigns probably involved eventually too   Make sure you go to harvard.edu   RESEARCH. If you really want to get in and you're mostly clean you will get in. MEPS is boring but its not hard.

It looks like a sequel to Cody Banks.. Now way this makes any good money with an R rating.    Best romantic film ever   This was the first book I ever read on my kindle. Such a great book. It reminded me of Harry Potter for no particular reason    You must live in a really nice neighborhood. I did Dominos delivery for a year in a very bad neighborhood and the manager kind of hinted that the job was too dangerous for women. We had no female drivers.   To Pizza Hut.

Thats why im pro choice   Its also immensely rewatchable   Haven't seen that movie in ages. What was it called?  Phone Call?   Me too :/   Paperwhite for sure. Sister has a regular kindle and is jealous of my backlight.   Edge of Tomorrow   Me too. Glad I did.   Weeds overrated man, especially trying it only once. The fun part about weed is becoming part of the shitty subculture and then deciding you want to do better in life.  I say just skip to the part where you want to do better in life. Try weed out in fifteen or something years when it will be legal everywhere.   Shit I use toilet paper   Not sure if its labeled as horror, but, The Road was scary.   yessss.

I want one of my kids to read the same copies one day.   Funny though, at the time I would write the date I started reading into the first pages.   Lol for real, Bahamas, Miami, poker place, running parkour fight, etc   They both made good money though.    Quantum of Solace was the most expensive film ever minute to budget wise. It was like 100 minutes long and cost $200 million.   Theyre both so good, but TWBB is perfect   So surprisingly good.

Guess it could work   I dont know if anyone here has ever been stuck in a waiting room for three plus hours, but this year, about two months ago, a situation arose in which i knew id be stuck on a chair in a brightly lit room with many strangers. i brouhgt Cats Cradle and finished it before days end. It was great. That again is "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut.   What happened in El Salvador? When from 60 something to forty something   Did no one give you the memo?

    I think you're probably right. The sequestering thing in particular makes a lot of sense.  I guess what I was trying to do was find a way of using the massive interconnectivity we have now that wasn't around when our systems of democracy were developed and find a way of getting citizens more involved at the very VERY bleeding edge of decision making. Without resorting to some kind of messy 'direct democracy by smartphone referendum' thing...   I disagree. Obviously a lot of it's nonsense but it can definitely be used to convey information in a new and perhaps more accessible way. Here's a more traditional take on that research btw http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/bees-in-danger-epidemic-of-colony-collapses-is-linked-to-stressed-out-honeybees-10034491.html   Don't you run all those risks with a jury as well though? And who's to say a sorority girl's opinion isn't as valid as that of anyone else. I was picturing a fairly small group, perhaps a couple of hundred, serving for a short period of time. They'd be vetted, like a jury, to remove the major security risks or anyone with an obvious bias like racist opinions or who thinks all military action should be avoided all the time.  As for security concerns, there are relatively few leaks from juries as far as I'm aware. I think the average citizen takes these things very seriously.  The justification would be making military and political leaders justify themselves to citizens each time they make a major decision, but without having to make all those decisions publicly and risk security.   What makes you say that?   That Buzzfeed is based on this study - http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3427.abstract   It says that other pressures, like the ones you list, cause deaths in older bees and then younger bees start foraging at a younger age which causes them to die early and creates a negative feedback that collapses the colony.   Say the government is considering bombing a particular target. Could there be a group of people, selected in advance, like a jury, who're sent the information and asked to contribute to the discussion and vote like a cabinet or privy council do? What would the benefits, difficulties and risks be?  	7

 I don't disagree. But, I think that statistics on poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors should be the focus of such conversations. It's not like a person's race makes them any more or less likely to commit a crime.   Edit: inserted a space.    I did read it. I was aware of the fact. I don't see how it's relevant. It doesn't necessarily mean he's not a citizen. At the very least he would be a permanent resident. Aside from the threat of deportation, there shouldn't be different laws for immigrants.    You make some fine points all of which I'm sure are being debated by the relevant authorities in Sweden and elsewhere.   I'm not sure about prison being an effective deterrent to violent crime. At first glance, it seems obvious that it would be, but when you look at the socioeconomic and psychological causes of a lot of violent behavior, it becomes much more complicated. It's also worth mentioning that prisons in the US are known for victimizing inmates and conditioning them to be irrational and violent when they are eventually released.   I'm getting a lot of downvotes here, and I guess I understand. If someone had done something like this to my child, prison for the offender wouldn't be the issue. But my argument is basically that we in US have been locking up anyone and everyone for several decades now. While overall crime has decreased, it's not necessarily a result of our increasingly militarized police or our eagerness to imprison even nonviolent offenders, and violent crime hasn't disappeared.   There are people all over the world who would argue that what we're doing here is wrong, but we're not going to listen to them. It's up to us to come to our own conclusions. We are one of the least likely to allow any other body in the world to violate our sovereignty, yet we do it to others quite often. If a country like Sweden wants to operate a criminal justice system that focuses on aiding victims, rehabilitation, and preventing recidivism, they have every right to do so and we should let them.    Comments that have been deleted by the mods still show up in the count too.    I don't disagree that a rapist should spend at least some time in prison, but it's not my decision to make.    My point is that you and I have no business making demands of the judges, juries, and lawyers of the judicial systems of sovereign foreign countries. The people of Sweden have faith in their elected and appointed officials.  Their system is focused on aiding the victims of crimes, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism. No amount of prison time served is going to unrape that girl.    I'm not saying it isn't. I'm just saying that Americans are so prison happy that they have the audacity to tell lawyers, judges, and juries how to do their jobs in foreign countries.    This was almost funny as a red bull commercial five or seven years ago.    Meanwhile in the US, we have more people in prison than any other country in human history. We're so eager to throw people in prison that we want to force other countries to imprison their own citizens.    He didn't help those folks who were praising him in his own house in Charleston, SC.    The campus police in my state are state police and can go anywhere in the state provided a student is involved.    Forcing someone at gunpoint to perform a sex act is rape.    Report them as spam.    Jesus. You're not lying. He stole some $76,000 in Apple electronics and he was charged with petit larceny.    [This says there have been 596.](http://killedbypolice.net)   OP posted some decent evidence. It's in the comment history.    No you're making shit up. Yes there were some black soldiers and even a few (as in three or four) black officers, but they weren't volunteers and they weren't treated like typical soldiers. You're just repeating lies from the Confederate apologists that have come before you. Your ideas come from the "lost cause" period of revisionism. Go ahead and try tofind one legitimate source for your claims here. The fact that you would bring up blafk slave owners is indication enough of your general ignorance on this topic and your adherence to post war Confederate propaganda.    The only one in that photo that looks even remotely like that girl is the second from the left.    I didn't see anything else from you in this thread so I looked in your comment history. Maybe it was deleted for personal information?   That does look like the same girl.   Edit: but I don't understand what you're talking about with the cheerleader picture. The third girl from the right is a black girl.    I couldn't find anything about her outside of this site.    You cannot order a person out of a vehicle at a DUI checkpoint if you do not have probable cause.    These signswere specific made for use at DUI checkpoints. They're not lawful stops and there are very different rules involved.    You should repost in /r/mildlyinteresting.    ??   Edit: What's up with the NSFW spam?    I think you're confused. You should look at the comment I mentioned. /u/Humboldtblue put contigo777 in his place.    I don't see how the title was editorialized.    Yeah. They just rounded up and killed millions of civilians, guys. They were no different than any other army. /s   Scientology is dying off because more and more people are being exposed to their lies and crimes.    What is your malfunction?    There's no rational argument that a maple leaf is imitation marijuana. Japanese maples are incredibly common. I can think of some right outside local schools in my town. A police officer who's not a drooling idiot should know the difference between a common tree and an illicit substance.    There's a lot to be said about your point. When outside aid comes into a disaster area they're essentially outsourcing local labor and/or materials. Local workers and businesses need to operate in order for the area to properly recover. It's also a bit of a waste to move volunteers and resources so far when there's work to be done in their immediate communities. It's always good to help, but sometimes these projects end up backfiring in unforeseen ways. I've also heard arguments that these sorts of mission trips are chosen for selfish reasons such as getting to travel to exotic or distant locations or even the opportunity to evangelize to strangers.    It is. It wasn't a reasonable mistake by any stretch of the imagination.    Way to continue to spread misinformation without providing any sources of your own. Did you go on to read about the control group under the influence of alcohol and drugs? The increased risk is almost identical.   The fact that you're ignoring the data and continuing to demonize the mentally ill is fucking offensive. Instead of relying on your gut feelings and biases, read the data.    I was struck by a DUI driver who was going very fast while driving down the road and the cop messed up the report and said that I was sitting stationary at the stop sign. I was literally two blocks from the stop sign. The other driver blew a .343 and totalled my car.    Luckily, the many Christian denominations were fearful and disapproving of one another to the point that they allowed secularism to grow.    He paid for the DUI hit and run offender?    I'm just trying to show another extreme point to help get you guys out.   These sound like the words of a man who knows he's been defeated.   You understand that your point of view is the default right? Besides PnS there are literally thousands of media outlets that agree with you entirely. There's no need for your "counter point".      You cleared all doubt about this with every other comment you've made in this thread.    It wouldn't if you were in the district he was taking from and ran out of water.    Der. Open our minds? Could you be any more condescending?    No, my apologies for not understanding.    Like I said, there is no shortage of assholes who think that the government has no business in R    D. I'm sorry if you thought I was one of them.    Good on ya. Elevators and trains are rare in much or the States. Mostly there's not a problem, but there are places where it's difficult to discern whether people's actions are a result of their ignorance or their pride. I think that every elevator should have a sign that explains the simple rules of etiquette. Then it can just be a matter of digging your heels into the ground.   Edit: feeling superior to others is unfortunately still very much a part of the American way.   Edit 2: I'm sure that as well behaved as they were, I remember these types of etiquette reminders all over Japan. I lived there for two and a half years.    I agree, but they aren't going to just disappear. We need to adopt a general policy of at least scowling at them.    No problem. I wasn't trying to insult you. I was only being honest.    http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/01/30/opting-out-of-medicaid-expansion-the-health-and-financial-impacts/  How about you do your own damn research before you start spouting out garbage on the intertubes. Really.    Do you want people to read the words you type or are you doing it for your own sake?   I'm not saying anything that a 10th grade English teacher wouldn't say to you. I'm on mobile nearly all of the time. Figure out how to get your point across in a readable format or don't bother. That's up to you.    I would start here at the [original post. ] (https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/3ck4x6/photographer_imagines_life_filled_with_anxiety/)    Yeah, but the average congressperson's life long pension is only $174,000 how do you expect them to raise a family on that?   Oh wait, the average median household income in the US is $51,000.  How about prohibiting them from earning a private income while drawing from this pension that they both enjoy so much and cannot seem to live on?    I dunno. Many of the people I know work more than ten hours a day. Essentially saying that they're lazy isn't a good way to win votes.    Hit enter twice to form a paragraph break. Especially when you feel that you've included more than three strongly interrelated topics or just more than one topic. I'm almost always on mobile so I don't get that excuse.   You want people to read the words you write, yeah?    And don't walk down it two-abreast. If a pathway only accommodates two people, you're effectively fucking everyone coming the opposite direction. Have a little self awareness and some common decency.    Better yet, don't lend out money you expect to see again. If someone desperately needs money, give it to them or don't. Otherwise don't get involved.    Some people think it's okay to treat their own things like shit. So the moral of the story is, "Don't lend out your things if you care about them.    Yeah unfortunately, there are people who are so oblivious that they'll still look at you like you're the asshole.    True. But no one has ever suggested that we ban privately funded research. There are those who believe that the government has no place in R   D.    I don't disagree, but it rightfully pisses people off when they watch wealthy and famous people steal from public resources. Also I'm more for using technology to make these thiefs donate to public funds. No sense in wasting money on some private contractor to sit in his car intermittently for two years which is what appears to have happened here. Some decent cameras and SSDs will do the trick and not just for one* but for everyone.    Two or three times a week?    TheCalleguas Municipal Water Districtsaid in its complaint filed Monday in Ventura County Superior Court that on more than a dozen occasions since 2013, a whitetruck filled up at a Thousand Oaks hydrant and hauledthe waterto Sellecks 60-acre ranchin Westlake Village.  "More than a dozen" And those were just the times their overpriced PI was around to catch him.   I'm not going to say that this wasn't a waste of money, but I'll argue that it wasn't a complete waste. Obviously some well placed, relatively inexpensive cameras could have  been as effective as this guy. But someone stealing that amount of public water is unacceptable. Fuck them for the way they did it though. They should have spent $5,000 to receive $15,000 or $20,000 in fines and penalties and then been able to use the surveillance equipment to catch other offenders.   Edit: grammar and formatting with millions of mosquitoes tormenting me.    Where did you get twelve instances? He was sent a cease and desist at least two years ago.     That sounds like an effective argument for publicly funded research right there.    Honest question, where did you get $600?      Paragraphs! Get some!    No I did not imply anything. I asked a simple question. If you have to breathe* more into it than there actually is, then that's your problem.    ~~They~~ Two of them are being charged with second degree murder.    My state is Missouri and therefore only marginally better than *El Salvador. Members of my family who I have never worked for own businesses and employ lawyers. I'm sorry if it offends you that I would take their opinions over that of random internet guy's.    I'm pretty sure that what you're saying doesn't apply in my state. I've never heard of anyone suing over wrongful termination here. Every employer I've spoken with about this issue has told me they were very confident in their right to fire anyone at any time. Hell, I had a boss that was two months behind on my pay. Me and four other employees couldn't even get the state to call us back.    Yeah cause unions are growing organizations and a growing movement in this country. /s  And yeah it is true. My state is an "at will" state. A private employee can be fired at any time for no reason. In fact, employers who do not state a reason are better off than the ones who do because there's nothing to contest.    Poor women do not have access to any healthcare under medicaid. At least not until they get pregnant in my state.   My insurance covers my routine checkups. It also covers me if something terrible happens that puts me in the hospital and unable to pay.   Contraception is a preventative treatment. What about this aren't you understanding? Why should married people be required to wear condoms?    "Wah! I don't want to contribute to something I'll ostensibly never benefit from even if I have benefited from it in the past, and my children will most likely benefit from it in the future. Screw everyone, I got mine!"  Literally millions of people are unable to afford preventative care and end up much sicker than they would have been otherwise. The costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Tens of thousands will die in the states that refused to expand Medicaid solely to defy the president.   Anyone who thinks that health insurance is complete rip off has never been sick and therefore working on the faulty logic of "it hasn't happened yet, and therefore won't ever happen", or is probably wealthy enough to not be worried about in the first place.    They lost the election by a split vote. Purely northern states wanted to impose their will on southern states.  Yeah nothing says tyranny like representative democracy.    They fired first because they were idiots.   Belligerent idiots. But yeah, no argument here.    The seceded because they objected to having no say and no rights in their own territory.  This is where OP dives off the deep end. The Confederate states tried multiple times to force their will on the federal government as well as northern states themselves with the fugitive slave acts. Then they tried to force their will upon the people of Kansas when they contested its formation as a free state.    By expand you mean establish more states with westward expansion? The North imposed their will on the south which completely violated the basic compact of the union in the first place.   And how was that? By allowing Kansas to decide for themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or not? Or by voting in the elections?    And of course they would want them returned, they were property to them. This would be like crossing a state line and getting your car impounded then sold off because someone else didn't like that you owned it and you got nothing for it.   Yeah it would be exactly like that if your car was a person you had enslaved and brought into a free territory.     Slavery is still wrong, and it was a major issue, but it's not the whole sum of all issues. Both sides were dicks to each other.    The protection of the institution of slavery was the sole reason for the South's secession. I'd have to say that the south were the bigger dicks being that they committed treason, attacked the US, considered owning people as property as the greatest material interest of mankind, and literally everything that the surviving confederates did in the decades after the war.   Edit: I'm sorry, I thought this sub was about pointing out the factual errors of confederate and southern apologists. If I was mistaken, I'll gladly move on. .    Lol. You know as well as I do why that would be* wholly inappropriate. Thanks for the offer though.    There *are zero out of pocket costs for contraception because it saves money in the long term. This isn't that complicated. Unwanted pregnancies are expensive for insurance companies and costly for our society.   The reason people purchase insurance is to be prepared for the unknown. As far as healthcare goes, it's not a matter of if we'll get sick, but when. We've been denying people preventative care and forcing them into emergency departments long enough to know that experiment has been a failure. This is why we pay more than any other industrialized nation but aren't anywhere near the top in terms of care. You're calling me economically illiterate while simultaneously suggesting we continue to dig the same hole we've been digging for decades.    I vote for candidates that support the people. In my area there aren't many unions left so there's really nothing left to defend. We do however have violent occupying paramilitary forces that exist solely to protect the interests of the ruling class. I'll choose my own battles, thank you.    An "unconfirmed rumor" or a "complete fabrication" on the part of the Baltimore Police Department?    Gee, it would be nice if us private employees enjoyed the same luxuries as you jack booted thugs.    Yeah, in the private sector there really isn't a such thing as "fired prematurely" and certainly not in the case of committing criminal acts of violence. Private employees can be fired for no reason at all, at any time.    Are you suggesting that the benefits that people get from their private health insurance are free?   Condoms are a form of contraception. The birth control pill can be used at the same time as condoms.   Your family is sacrificing because you have to provide them health insurance? Well fuck that. I mean, I'm sure there aren't any females in your family right? And even if there were, they shouldn't have access to medical treatments for their lady parts right? That's just not Christian. /s  Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. Private insurance requires members to pay premiums and deductibles out of their own pockets. You're still just whining because other people don't have to listen to your obtuse point of view and might benefit from a system that is too cooperative for your political tastes.    By studies do you mean TV cop shows and Fox news? Because everything from a legitimate source that I've read has said that while the mentally ill are no more likely to commit acts of violence than the general population, they are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. But don't take my word for it either.   http://depts.washington.edu/mhreport/facts_violence.php  http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/mental-illness-and-violence  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1525086/  http://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/myths-facts/  Mental illness is not a good excuse for a cop to fear for their life or safety. That kind of thinking is discriminatory, unfounded, and wrong. Stop perpetuating these lies.    You are a police apologist. Why does it have to be the majority? Wouldn't 49% be too much? 35%? 25%? What number or percentage of innocents dead and their murderers never being charged would be acceptable to you?    Spoken like a true member of New York's finest.    my apologies for not holding the reddit message board in such high regard to be concerned with proper use of grammar.   Now redditors may be known to make common grammatical or spelling mistakes, but the vast majority of users obviously make at least some effort in presenting their arguments and ideas in clear and correct form. What you've posted in this thread reads like the rambling drivel of an eight year old. Why even bother to post here if you're not even going to try? Why would you expect anyone to take your ideas seriously when you're not even willing to take a few extra seconds in order to present them properly?     Well stated. Sorry about the confusion.     That cop wasn't **just** speeding.  Did you read the words that I posted?    I never suggested a majority. We don't need a majority for us to say what is happening is wrong.    Could you please clarify what you're saying states otherwise? I flipped through all of the relevant sections and all I saw was the mention that the practice was heavily debated and a bit of anecdotal evidence about the use of the procedure in the Czech Republic.   Edit: here are a couple of articles that make valid arguments against the efficacy and use of castration on sex offenders.   http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=3985832  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wiring-the-mind/201410/should-we-be-castrating-sex-offenders  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/12/castration_anxiety.html  here are a couple of studies whose outcomes do not support the use castration on sex offenders.   http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01541244  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542670  [Here is an individual who was castrated, released early from prison by then Governor Mike Huckabee, and then came to my state to rape and murder two women.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_DuMond)   He learned that one from /u/Humboldtblue a little while ago.    I wasn't suggesting that all such incidents were the same. OP claimed that most were armed and therefore justified. I think that both of those claims are questionable.   If you've spent any amount of time on this sub you would know that we there are countless cases where the police made a judgement call that led to the death of another person, the circumstances were suspicious, and most often the police aren't even investigated. Why should I waste my time collecting all of these stories for a police apologist who has access to the same search engines, this sub, and who won't even bother reading anyway?    Did you watch the James Boyd video?    Right, I'm sure that officers who are capable of doing the terrible stuff in this video would never do it without provocation or justification. /s   Edit: It turns out that this man was simply riding his bike in the wrong direction. I hope you choke on a bag of huge diseased cocks.    And I guess to you the distinction between a person "being armed" and a person "being a threat to society" is whether or not the police decided to kill them or not?    Rich white women do get free contraception.  How do "rich white women" get free contraception, *and can you please explain this without using racism?    Having bareback sex vs wearing a condom is a lifestyle choice.  What does this have to do with birth control? Who* the hell do you think you are that you can tell others what to do in the privacy of their own bedrooms and in the confidentiality of their doctors' offices?    My family shouldn't have to sacrifice for either case.  Wtf does this even mean? Your family isn't sacrificing a damn thing. As it was already pointed out by another user, contraception is preventative treatment and is ultimately cost neutral or even represents a net savings. You're just whining because you don't feel like you're adequately getting to decide what others can and cannot do.   Edit: was breaking a rule.      https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Ovando  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Resources_Against_Street_Hoodlums  http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYPD-Arrests-Gun-Smuggling-Police-Officers-Slot-Machines-132515363.html#  http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/police-officer-gun-store-owner-charged-with-illegal-purchases/21180932  http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-officer-charged-after-police-raid-finds-guns-heroin/article_97efc487-03a7-5d20-ae20-9cb4b335675e.html  http://triblive.com/mobile/8639752-96/police-kelly-shotgun  This is just a bit of what a five minute cursory Google search for "police charged with illegal guns" on my tablet turned up. There have been countless articles about police obtaining, dumping, and possessing illegal firearms on this sub, but I guess if you're only here as a police apologist you're not going to learn anything are you?    But yeah. Criticism of speech and cancelling of private contracts would not go against the Constitution.   Not only that, but the businesses that severed ties with Trump have the protected right to free expression as well, and the right to not associate with or be connected to an outspoken bigot.      What about the 1st amendment rights of Trump's former business partners who don't want to be associated with an outspoken bigot? Aren't their rights to expression protected?    That cop wasn't just speeding. He was driving recklessly, illegally passing, and evading an officer.    Says the kid who likes to talk about Mario Kart on gaming subs.   This insult was much more effective when /u/Humboldtblue used it against you 28 minutes ago.    That comes across as very confident.   How many is "most"?   Do you know for a fact that they were all armed before the police rendered them unable to speak for themselves?   Do you know for a fact that they all brandished a weapon or attacked the police before they were forever silenced?    The right to bare arms is right there in the fucking constitution.   Police shouldn't be shooting people when it's avoidable or unnecessary. What part of that do you not understand?    Nice.    Everything about this comment is fucked. "rich white woman" What the fuck is this all about?   Birth control is anything but trivial. You consider choosing to have kids all of the time a "lifestyle choice"?    So exactly what I said. And your assertion that they were armed before they were shot is also disingenuous as we know damn well that officers like to carry "drop weapons".   Isn't New Hampshire the ~~"Give me freedom or give me death"~~ "Live Free or Die" state? Wtf?    Armed like [James Boyd was armed?] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U) Or the guy who was shot to death lying in bed with a knife?    Recently? Women have been coming forward for decades. Now that number is up to 45.   There's no way to spin it. Giving mind or body altering compounds to people without their consent is wrong, a violation of their person, and a crime.    I disagree. I don't think that anyone should go to prison for cannabis possession or sale.    These types of offenders would continue to abuse children even if they were to be castrated. They would probably just become more violent and resort to using objects to carry out the abuse.    Computers are just tools and like other tools they made human work easier and more efficient. AI is designed to replace the human element entirely. That's a huge difference with a completely different outcome.    Interesting.    Of course they do. They don't respect anything that they can't personally buy and own.    The South seceded and attacked the north over the issue of slavery. The south wasn't interested in states' rights, but rather their own interests. Yes the north had the more immediate motivation of protecting the Union and therefore it's own interests. That does little to change the fact that the war was started over the issue of slavery.   Yes slavery was less of a motivation for the Union but there were straight up abolitionists and the abolition of slavery was one of the results of the war.    The immediate motivations of the Union are less important considering that it was the South that chose to secede and the Confederacy that chose to attack the US.    Right, but in order for all that to have happened, they first needed to be convicted. These are the innocent ones we know about. They're enough to cause concern. What about those who have been executed for crimes they didn't commit?  Edit: [Cameron Willingham] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham). How many dead innocents would be acceptable for you? What number or percentage do you feel would be justified in the name of political and judicial expediency? How would you feel if it was your loved one or even you on the chopping block?    His sworn testimony about slipping a woman drugs in order to rape her has been released. You know that there have been 46 women come out and accuse him of rape, right?    [Not rare enough for my taste.] (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty) There have* been at least 154 cases.    I understand that you don't think it exists, but you're wrong. Rude? So insulting my intelligence isn't rude?   This was about drugging women. This is indisputable. Giving someone a mind or body altering chemical without their consent is wrong, a violation of their person, and a crime.   He went on to drug and rape women.   The connection is clear. It's not even a stretch.    You're the revisionist. Suggesting that slaves were freed by fighting for the Confederacy? If those men were free why would they fight and die defending the instrument of their own bondage? What about the white soldiers of the confederacy who were forced into conscription by the threat of death or imprisonment in terrible conditions? Do you really think that they were happy to be dying to protect the interestes of the ruling class? How do you think a black man in the slave owning confederacy would fare if he refused to fight? Toward the end of the war they were slaughtered in droves for simply not winning.   The number of black slave owners was relatively miniscule compared to the number of slave owning whites. Why do people always bring this up? How is it even relevant?    I know damn well what Spanish fly is or is supposed to be. I'm telling you that this piece is relevant to the fact that he is a rapist who drugs women. Got it?    Not to mention that they had no problem using the federal government to force northern states to bend to their will regarding the fugitive slave acts.    It wasn't just a disagreement over the power of the Federal government. The South seceded and attacked the US to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite. Ultimately the south was most upset over the creation of a new free state, Kansas. That and the election of Lincoln who opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and states meant that the slave owning states had lost most of their political traction and their economic interests would be ignored. The Confederates weren't worried about states' rights when they opposed the formation of the new free state on the basis that slavery was an inalienable personal right that states couldn't take away. They weren't worried about states rights when they introduced and passed the fugitive slave acts and tried to force their will upon northern free states and the federal government who had no interest in capturing escaped slaves.    From what I understand, the formation of Kansas as a free state did play a major part of the political situation and the South's secession. Kansas and the election of Lincoln meant more representation for those who opposed slavery or at least it's expansion.    I said most. Most people are not rapists whether they spoke about Spanish fly or not. Most people haven't admitted to using drugs to rape women under oath. Bill Cosby isn't most people.    Yeah, but most people didn't end up being accused of raping 46 women.    I can't watch it right now. What does he say?    Have you figured out some way to restore life to a defendant who was unjustly executed? If not I wouldn't be so eager to kill people when we know for a fact that innocent people are often convicted of capital offenses.    [This guy was serving a life sentence for cannabis related offenses] (http://m.kmbc.com/news/missouri-man-serving-life-for-marijuana-offenses-gets-relief/33177190) until our governor commuted his sentence. Governor intervention is very rare.    I didn't say anything, but I think that OP was saying that you can usually gauge a person's overall understanding and knowledge of the Civil War by listening to their opinions on the causes of the war.    How do you figure?    The South seceded and attacked the US in an effort to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.    One of the biggest events that led to their secession was the formation of the new free state of Kansas. The Confederates felt that an individual state didn't have the legal right to prohibit slavery as it was a personal right. States' rights was a Confederate revisionist argument. The war was about preserving the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.    That's not necessarily true. The Confederate states argued against the formation of new free states and felt that slavery was a personal right. If the confederacy was interested in supporting states' rights they wouldn't have argued that new states had no legal right to prohibit slavery. They also wouldn't have been so upset that many northern states and the federal government had failed to enforce the fugitive slave acts to their liking.    I get it. I was simply following the instructions in the sidebar. I'll drop the www next time, but you can't really fault someone for following the instructions in the sidebar.    I'll remember to drop the www next time, but you really can't fault people for following the instructions in the sidebar.    I wonder why it's so difficult to understand that?    Ahh. I see.   Edit: I thought that you meant that someone in the thread was using the "Stalin was way worse" argument.    Which one is that?    Victory was made easier by the foolish mistakes of the Reich and other axis members. Their behavior made it very easy for allies to put aside their differences to address the malignancy that was threatening peace and order throughout the world. Germany was never close to winning the war. Japan was certainly never close to winning the war. Their military campaigns were reckless and unsustainable.    To a point. But when it's overused it causes economic stagnation and eventually failure. It's not a solution but a blunt tool that can often end up causing more problems than it can fix and should therefore be used sparingly.    The US had japan by it's balls because of the battle of Midway. Before that Japan was far more successful in the pacific. Had the US lost Midway they very well could've failed.  That's just ridiculous. The US had suffered no damage or attacks on homeland soil aside from Pearl Harbor. We were entirely intact and just getting started with our military industrial complex. Japan was suffering from repeated effective bombing campaigns and over a decade of economic sanctions and trade embargos. How do you come to the conclusion that "we very well could have failed"?      While Germany was giving the soviets a run for their money.  Really? Or did they merely succeed in causing the deaths of millions of people before having their asses handed to them, their country burned to the ground, and half of it ultimately seized by force. Let's not forget that Germany's imperialism made much of Eastern Europe vulnerable to Soviet invasion and occupation.    If japan had won the battle of Midway and turned around the pacific, ( which they nearly did ) the axis had strong chances of winning WW2.   But they didn't win, and there's nothing that suggests that the US would somehow have folded if we had lost midway. Let's not forget that the US was brought into the war by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Do you think we would have just given up and surrendered to the Japanese? Outside of Pearl Harbor, we suffered virtually none of the mass destruction that parts of Asia and Europe suffered. We were entirely intact. Yes the Japanese fought hard but there was never a chance that they were going to defeat the US. By the time we dropped the a-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was largely burned to the ground.      I bet I could conquer several of my neighbors houses with a bit of military equipment. I would be incompetent to do so because it's obvious that the police, the FBI, the ATF, the DHS, and the National Guard would easily take them back and likely destroy most of them in the process.    Well, austerity certainly doesn't foster growth.   	142
 I'd rather have Cubo Torres to be honest, although he wouldn't have fit with LA anyway (Keane and Zardes).    It's a different Juninho. [He's only in his mid-20s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitor_Gomes_Pereira_J%C3%BAnior) The one you're thinking of [did have a stint in New York but is now in Brazil.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho_Pernambucano)    But you're right, I live in LA, don't follow or care about the galaxy  That's a damn shame.    I'll be happy if he's the next Cherundolo, personally.   That shouldn't be too big of an issue. Our league can pay more, is more competitive and I think has more Japanese expats centralized on the west coast, although I don't think anyone would want him on the Galaxy save for Galaxy fans.       Both of you guys need to flair up!   If the dead was an Israeli non-Arab, you'd be crying. Why are you pointing out the specs in everyone else's eyes while ignoring the stick in yours?    Look in the mirror and take accountability of your own actions.   Any journalist who comes and tries to do an objective job immediately finds their life in danger. That's why we have reporting from Beirut and Skype regarding this conflict. [Serena Shim](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) is an example of what happens to the ones who try to do their job.   [Serena Shim of Press TV is also dead because of this fact.](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey)         Well, people in the U.S. today, whether they are authority figures or not, are more afraid of being called racist that whether their actions are motivated by racism.    Actually, [New York does have a Civilian Complaint Review Board.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Complaint_Review_Board)   Well, is he just a temporary expat or has he immigrated for good?   The thing is, if you get a large enough, wealthy enough, taxpaying base moving in to an area, you'll get a more professional police force, you'll get more responsive police and you'll have an effect on the municipal government. More dollars coming in via economic activity will translate to more tax revenue.    Intelligence as in "mukhabarat" in this case, I think. I'm not sure on the fourth one though.    I laughed, although I don't think racial harmony is analogous to a failed romantic relationship.    How is completely separating a "let's become friends" approach? It's more like a "let's try to completely ignore each other" approach. It's almost like you're arguing for everyone to move to their native lands and for everyone to just engage in mere diplomacy.   Anything is better than "let's stop trying." I like how things are in the U.S. even if there is a long way to go.    Just like how Israelis and their apologists argue everywhere.    You're saying that people of different races will never get along, so we should stop trying to live near each other and cut ourselves off as soon as possible. This effectively legitimizes racism. This is the argument that white supremacist groups use today and the argument behind the segregation of old. It seems I have more faith in humanity than you do to live together with equality regardless of race.   You can't be racist if you don't see the other race. Brilliant!    Don't judge a book by its cover; don't judge an article by the headline.    Those areas, back then, didn't become affluent until the middle class white families moved in.    I don't agree with that for a second. You're effectively arguing that the only way different races can treat each other as equals is if they wall each other off. That's not an end to racism, that's an embrace of it.    You're kidding, right? The whole article is about racism in an Eastern European country. I've seen other stories about how people with darker skin in Eastern Europe are very fearful.    Buffalo doesn't get Canadian channels? I'd be surprised if they didn't.     OK. Let's say Spain was had underwent a complete process of Arabization and Islamization. By the 10th century the majority of people on the Iberian peninsula would be Arabic-speaking Iberian Muslims (Muwalladun), the minority actual Arabs or Berbers. Eventually the Muwalladun could have expelled their Arab overlords, but they would not have been able to reclaim their Romance languages.   Didn't this actually happen?    "My brother and I against my cousin, my cousin and I against the world"   I'm pretty sure the Quran says there were Jews in Egypt too.     we're just on a break  I wonder how long the "emergency rule" will last this time.       Never mind that the site he posted from is actually run by Jewish people.   If they're in America, that will change soon on their part. Every recent immigrant takes some time to get out of their shell.    In the 1950s and 60s, after Jim Crow laws were repealed and schools were desegregated, many white families left cities with high black populations and left to the suburbs rather than live alongside black people or have their children go to school with black children. This, coupled with discriminatory housing laws on the books until the 1980s in some cases, has led to a de facto segregation in many areas across the United States.   Good example of this here, if you have a half hour to spare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp22YlJlfHo  If you look at a racial breakdown on a map of a major metropolitan area, you'll see stark differences in the racial makeup of certain areas.       I think America would benefit from people self-segregating less.    Well, he didn't even offer any evidence himself, he just made an arbitrary statement, unlike you, who actually post a link.    The author writes about the racism he experienced while living in Ukraine, saying that the people overall were aware of racism and eager to learn more, unlike his experiences in the United States.       Or if Vince didn't think he looks "ratty."   If he is coming here, it's going to be in LA or NY. I'm not sure he would want to come to a small town (maybe he would for the diminished attention), and the league definitely doesn't want a celebrity like that playing in a small media market.    No, we played Bayern Munich in Portland, how did you forget?    What's wrong with that?       [I made it one of these! Woohoo!](http://giphy.com/gifs/EXzrnapKb8U92/html5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	199
 I hope that Prairie Cycle also plans to submit a letter to editor to News-Gazette in response to this piece, so that the readership of N-G can see these points as well.   Thank you for doing this AMA, Dr. Perlak.  If you could return to the time when GMO technology was first emerging, with the general public as blank slate, what might companies like Monsanto do differently to market GMOs, to educate the public about what they are and their risks and benefits?  Is there one broadly held misconception about genetic/genomic editing that you would most like to eradicate, to help the public make informed decisions about the pros and cons of GMO crops?   I am right there with you my friend.  Good reminder to me to go do leg raises and clamshells and weep softly to myself.   *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*, by Douglas Adams.  *Interface* and *Cobweb*, coauthored by Neal Stephenson.   Every book (or even every book I like) doesn't need to be deeply philosophical and nuanced.  I read for escapism sometimes too.  But I guess the fan hype is exactly what bothers me, and I think it's what the OP's original question was about.  As to the author's intent, here's a quote from an interview he did with Conan: "I want my readers, and i want viewers to be afraid when my characters are in danger," he adds. "I want them to be afraid to turn the next page because the next character may not survive it."  If I were a fiction writer (which I fully admit I don't have the skill to be, not even a really bad one) I would aspire to have my readers fear for the safety of my characters because they empathize with them so much, not because they've observed a 75% mortality rate among relatively non-evil characters and they're intuiting the math.  Edit: And also, honor is a fault now?  You just can't win for losin' . . .   :-)   Fair point, I have not.  Briefly stated, my issue with ASOIAF (I actually read all the books so far, in a really over the top attempt to give them a fair shake and understand why my BF likes them) is not the violence per se, although I know this is the issue for many who dislike them.  It's that although the plot is exciting and full of cliff-hangers, I just don't get the sense of a lot of thought or meaning behind them.  No genuine reflection on human nature, philosophy, or the way the world works.  If characters die, it shouldn't be as a "gotcha" at the reader.  If a despicable character suddenly shows a more empathetic side, it should feel genuine, not like a plot twist for the sake of surprise.  This might be unfair to Martin, it's just my subjective experience.  Are his short stories substantially different in style?  If it's just that novel-writing or sudden mega-fame changed his writing a lot, I'd be interested to give them a shot just for the heck of it.   Everything by George R. R. Martin.   Please don't hurt me . . . I feel so alone.   Also, although the discovery of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was revolutionary (and very controversial) when discovered, it is no longer new (over three decades old), although its study in relation to memory remains very exciting.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229390335D   I'm not trying to say it isn't exciting, just that its novelty and interpretation are being overstated.  The resource I cite is one of many that have established in vivo imaging of dendritic spines.  This research has improved ability to image deeper brain structures repeatedly in vivo, but they are building on a lot of previous work, including the study I cited.  It's a great improvement, but not a revolution.  The hippocampus is important, but it's the "golden child" for a lot of researchers, in a way that leads to unrealistic models of how the brain works.  To say that it's "particularly" important compared to the cortex sounds biased to me.  The cortex is hugely important.  So are primary sensory processing centers.  To make kind of a quibbling argument, for example, you wouldn't have a lot of auditory memory without ears, no matter how healthy your hippocampus is.  Again, this work is important.  It just doesn't prove for the first time that synapses store memories, and it's being discussed (and portrayed as surprising) in the context of a biased way of viewing the brain.   As I understand it, this is where the active edge of our understanding/ongoing research is.  It does seem consistent with what we know that more senses involved in a memory, or more unique associations between it and other experiences or ideas, makes it more robust.  The way I envision this (which might not be actually correct) is that to remember something, you need to re-activate one of the circuits that represents the idea.  The more neural pathways are connected with that circuit, the more possible routes to recall you have, and even if some are destroyed, you could still be prompted by some stimuli to remember part or all of the idea.   Apparently, almost all insect species will die if they are exposed to prolonged heat above ~105-120 degrees F/40-50 degrees C.  I'm not sure exactly how size would come into play.  Smaller size might mean more rapid dehydration, but that would also depend on how that type of insect respires, how well its exoskeleton retains moisture, its color etc.  What cooling strategies the insect has, and how resistant its physiology is to overheating, would also matter.   In general, yup, that is the theory.  The idea is that there's a sort of "natural selection" for synapses in the brain--connections that are used often are maintained, and those that are not used often will eventually weaken and disappear.  This is even more true in developing brains, but even in adult brains, new possible connections are continually being formed, and then either discarded or retained depending on how active they are.   Of course it can.  But this current study did not specifically demonstrate that the synapses they imaged were involved in encoding a memory either.  Their argument is only that they showed the synapses can last for the same time frame as a long-term memory.   The researchers did some important work, but they weren't the first ones to prove that synapses can last a long time in the brain.  They showed it for a different region of the brain than past research has focused on.  Another issue I have with this reporting of the work, and to some extent with the way the study is framed, is that they are building up the importance by linking it to a way of thinking about memory that I think is overly simplistic.  The dogma in the field is that the hippocampus, one brain region associated with memory, holds short-term memories, and these memories get "transferred" to the cortex, another part of the brain, to make them long-term.  It's one working model of how memories are represented in the brain, but in reality, it's much more likely that memories, especially the strong, long-lasting ones, involve changes in synapse placement and strength at all levels of processing--from the neurons that perceive sensory input, all the way up to the cortex, and even back out to motor neurons that direct movement.   It looks like there might be a few studies showing a correlation between the two, for example: http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/01/20/0886260512471081.abstract  However, I think it would be really hard to prove causation.  It seems pretty likely that homosexuality or bisexuality would increase an individual's risk of being targeted for abuse in childhood and adolescence.  What an incredibly heartbreaking topic.   Social insects have a lot of neat adaptations to keep their nest spaces cool.  For example, the placement and angles of tunnels in a termite mound facilitate air flow and cooling:http://www.planetseed.com/relatedarticle/cool-termites  Honey bees will forage for water on hot days, spread the water on the wax combs, and fan their wings to cool the hive via evaporation.  Other insects may cool themselves with water, shade, dormancy during hot periods, or other adaptations.  	16
 And suddenly everything feels itchy.   Of course, Knotty!   I wish I knew. My gut tells me that the same planes that destroyed my home town might have dropped the dust. They moved fast...and over the black sky, they could easily be mistaken for shooting stars. The music was loud: I wouldn't be surprised if none of us heard them.   Maybe you're right...I mean, worst case scenario, I find out he was behind it. I kind of want to keep on pretending, but the thought that it was him still lingers in my head. Either what I read will clear his name, or confirm my worst fears.   I had a rough go for a while, especially during my college years. I was fortunate enough to have a really great school counsellor who recommended I go talk to a colleague of his.   Time to write a contest entry, I guess :P  I believe you meant to say: "Time to write a story THAT WILL CRUSH AND ANNIHILATE ALL OTHER ENTRIES IN ITS AWESOMENESS."  But I understood you either way. You get'em, Knotty!    I got a similar message last month for the February contest, and looked her up. From what I recall, she's a leader at nanowrimo and a mod at that website. Everything looked legit to me.   I never thought of it that way...the pneumonia did start after I spent a weekend at his cabin.  It was annoying, but I was a kid. Things always bothered me less as a child. Cold water, for instance. I can't stand swimming in a cold lake nowadays, but when I was a kid, I'd jump right in without hesitating.   When I was a young girl, I lived in the town of Tadaldak, just outside Whitesand Provincial Park in Northern Ontario. It was a small community, not found on any map. On the night of the meteor shower in 1981, Tadaldak went from a lively town of around 2 000 residents, to ashes scattered across the woodlands. I was the only survivor.   nbsp;  Tadaldak was a beautiful town filled with rustic-looking houses built with wood from the surrounding forest. Our homes had much more spirit to them than any of the mass-produced condos I've lived in since. I'm not preaching about colors of the wind or anything like that: I just appreciate genuine human craftsmanship. Due to Tadaldak's secluded location, there was no way in or out of town, except for an ice road that appeared only in the coldest months of winter. Because of this, it was impossible to get supplies, so we had to be self-sustaining. Most of us knew how to hunt and fish, so we were never in danger of starvation.   nbsp;  Though our supply of fresh fruits and vegetables was limited, we found every excuse to indulge. That's how the Starlight Festival came to be. In mid August, the town got together to celebrate week-long meteor showers that took place every year.   nbsp;  As summer drew to an end and preparations for the festival began, I came down with pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. All day long, I watched from the window as the area transformed. Paper streamers were hung along town square, benches were installed, and food stands were rolled into place. Every night, when I saw the first star in the sky, I made a wish that I would get better in time for the festivities.   nbsp;  By the first day of the festival, I was feeling much better, but I was still stuck on oxygen. I nagged and begged the nurses to release me, giving them my most irresistible pair of puppy-dog eyes. Finally, the doctor agreed to let me out, under three conditions: I had to carry a portable oxygen tank, I had to be accompanied by a nurse, and I had to come straight back to the hospital once the meteor shower was over. I was thrilled beyond words.   nbsp;  A few hours later, I was sitting in the crowd as lively music blared through old speakers set up around town square. Nurse Jesse was kind enough to sit with me while my parents watched from a few rows back. The scent of fried food and sweets  a rare treat in our neck of the woods  filled my nostrils, and I excitedly looked from food stand to food stand, wondering if there was enough room in my stomach to try everything. One by one, the lights in the town turned off, as the sun descended onto the horizon. The sky was clear, welcoming the dim remnants of lights from far-away galaxies.   nbsp;  "Ooooooooo!", uttered the crowd, as the celestial show began.   nbsp;  Lights streamed above us as hundreds of shooting stars made their way across the heavens. I sat in awe, grateful that I was there to see the show. Then, something unusual happened: shimmering speckles began falling from the sky. My immediate thought was that forest fairies were blessing our festival by spreading pixiedust into the crowd. The scene looked enchanted, and I lifted my hands to try and catch the magical substance, thinking it would imbue me with the ability to fly. The powder was thick and weightless, like soot from a campfire. It dissolved as I manipulated it between my fingers. The stardust fell faster, covering us like a winter storm. I could hear people around me coughing, sneezing, and wheezing. A sudden twinge of guilt came over me, as it occurred to me that I might have infected everyone with pneumonia.   nbsp;  Wind blew the speckles of stardust away, but the crowd became even more agitated than before. I could see fear in their eyes, which, in turn, frightened me. Never had I seen so many adults look so disturbed, yet I had no idea why they were scared. I turned to nurse Jesse for comfort, hoping he knew what was going on, but what I saw sent me into full blown panic: the whites of his eyes had turned red, and blood leaked from every orifice on his head. I started sobbing and let out a muffled scream, fog forming in my mask. Nurse Jesse hacked loudly, clawing at his throat until his nails drew blood. Moments later, he fell over lifelessly. I screamed for help, but my weakened voice could not break through the agonized sounds around me. I turned to my parents, but they were already on the floor, bleeding. I saw hundreds of friends, family, and neighbors succumb to the same fate. Silence replaced the chaos. I wished I could hear their screams again, because the silence scared me more. The silence meant it was over.   nbsp;  Tears clouding my vision, I tried to get up so I could find help. My oxygen tank had gotten wedged between Nurse Jesse and the bench, locking me in place. Snot leaked into my mouth, but I couldn't wipe it away because the mask was in the way. Having been given strict orders not to remove it, I dealt with the uncomfortable salty taste. I tugged at my tether, finally yanking myself free. When I saw Nurse Jesse's blood smeared along the silver canister, I started howling like a voice-neutered banshee.   nbsp;  Thanks to my parents, I knew to seek help in an emergency. I rotated the oxygen tank onto its wheels, and started walking towards the only logical place: the hospital. If anyone could help, it was the doctors and nurses. My lungs were on fire as I inched my way across town. I had to deviate from my path many times to avoid stepping on the sick townsfolk. I was too young to tell whether they were dead or alive. I was going to be the hero who saved Tadaldak.   nbsp;  I felt drained by the time I reached the hospital, but a wave of relief gave me a second wind, and I ran inside. It was far too quiet in the hospital. My insides twisted as I walked around the corner and saw the bodies on the ground, faces painted in streams of blood. I ran over and shook Nurse James, begging her to wake up, but her cold body remained unresponsive.   nbsp;  Once reality set in, I started bawling loudly, and curled up in the corner. I kept telling myself I had to be a big girl: I had to make everyone better again. I was going to be the hero who saved Tadaldak. I repeated those words over and over in my head until they gave me enough strength to stand up. If the doctors and nurses couldn't help, then I had to go farther. My grandpa lived alone in the woods. He'd know what to do. I knew the way there, but it was going to be hard to reach him while carrying the oxygen tank.   nbsp;  I had barely made it to the outskirts of town when I heard a distant rumbling. My flight-or-fight instinct suddenly kicked in, and I ripped the oxygen mask off my face so I could bolt into the woods as fast as my little feet could take me. As I hid under a maple tree, I saw a black, low-flying plane rip through the treetops and towards my home. It was followed by two more.   nbsp;  I watched as hellfire rained down on my peaceful hometown. A strong wave of heat rippled through the air, and pushed me to the ground. I could smell Tadaldak burning from the short distance separating us. Ambers flew in every direction, twirling and dancing in the breeze. Pockets of warm air swelled through the foliage, making the landscape rattle like the chains of death. A mix of emotions overwhelmed me: desperation, worry, sorrow, confusion, and anxiety. I couldn't function, and didn't know what to do, except to stay right where I was as a raging fire took away all that I had ever known. I wasn't going to be a hero. I wasn't going to save Tadaldak. It was already too late.   nbsp;  The planes came back for a second assault, though I doubt there was anything left to shoot. Before long, they streaked away in the horizon, like shooting stars.   nbsp;  I'm not sure how long I hid in the bushes, sobbing to myself, but I remember what snapped me back to reality. From a short distance, I saw a bipedal, cloaked form with two bulging glassy eyes. I had heard legends of wraiths hiding in the woods, and thought that was precisely what I was looking at. I burrowed into a bush, hiding from and spying on the creature. Then, I heard it speak to another of its kind. I'll never forget what they said, nor the horrifyingly ordinary sound of their voices.   nbsp;  "Get them all?", asked the first.   nbsp;  "Yeh. Threw em in the fire with the others.", replied the second.   nbsp;  They sounded human. I held back a whimper and made myself as small as possible, hoping beyond hope that they wouldn't hear my labored breathing. I knew they were going to hurt me if they found me.   nbsp;  I honestly can't remember how I did it, but I eventually made it to my grandfather's place. I told him everything that happened while he peacefully consoled me. After that night, he took me in and raised me. Eventually, I grew up and moved out of the region. I visited him once in a while, but I couldn't stand being so close to the scar in the landscape, so my visits were few and far between.   nbsp;  My grandfather died not too long ago. As his next of kin, I was tasked with handling his affairs. I took a trip to his cabin to clear out his things. In his attic, I found a locked wooden crate with ornate detailing. I wanted to take it with me, and searched all over the house for its key, without success. Eventually, I took the box to a locksmith, who was kind enough to unlock it for me. In the crate, I saw the big glassy eyes of a gas mask starring back at me. It sat on a bed of news clippings and file folders marked "Operation Ta'xet". I was too afraid to read what they said. I'd rather live the rest of my life pretending my grandfather wasn't involved with the obliteration of my hometown.   I laughed so hard my cat fell out of my lap.   You performed your monthly ritual, right? It should be OK.    Mods aren't omniscient beings that know every instance of rule breaking that occurs across the thousands of stories posted.  Waitthey're NOT?!    Yeh. I wish we'd gone to the Museum of Nature instead. At least then, I'd have been able to look at the frogs...and draw the frogs really badly.   I really wanted to live there, but I couldn't take the plunge. Maintaining this place was too much of a drain.   Ugh! Don't you just hate it when that happens?   xD; Well, that's embarrassing.   For you, I'll throw them in for free.   I wish.   Is 150 000$ too steep?   Construction on my brand new condo finished this summer. Not wasting a second, I broke lease on my musky apartment, and moved in as soon as possible. I rather enjoyed knowing I was the first resident living here: there was no wear and tear, no smoke stains on the walls, and no damage to the structure. The only issue was a light clattering sound whenever I used the commercial sink in my laundry room. I rarely used it, so I didn't bring up the problem to the contractors. Everything else worked perfectly, and my home was as sterile as an operating table.   nbsp;  After a few months, I began noticing water pooling at the foot of my shower. The drain must have been clogged. I took to my tools, unscrewed the shower drain, and peered inside. I could see a collection of fibers bunched up in the pipes. Reaching in with an unfolded coat hanger, I pulled out mountains of dirty blond hair clogging the pipes. I live alone, I don't have any pets, I haven't entertained a lady in over a year, and I've been bald since I was 27.   nbsp;  The odd phenomena got me thinking about the sink in the laundry room. I detached the aerator, placed my hand under the faucet, and turned on the water. Dozens of molars came flying out, slipping through my fingers and into the sink, bouncing up and down until ultimately falling down the drain.   nbsp;  On a completely unrelated note: I have a beautiful, fully furnished, barely-used condo for sale. Located in downtown Detroit. Anyone interested?   While we're on the topic, seems like [This guy]( https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Asylum/1588112608089682) right here is doing something similar. The weird thing is, he does mention in a few posts that he read said story on Reddit (though does not link back to the original), yet in about 90% of the cases, they're flat-out stolen.  Seems this one   I would love to!   Oh we can be much *much* tighter, if you'd like      Let me get the ropes.  *Wuahahahahah!*   The stepfather likes to keep his handcuffs where they belong: the bedroom.   Ooh, I got it backwards. Hmm...I swear, some people are shameless.   Yeah, those flags would be great.   I find that most Youtube narrators do not ask for permission, but do link back to the original story. Are you saying that Mr.CreepyPasta covered some of yours but linked back to the thief's website? If so, you can probably message him and have him give you credit instead.   If it helps, I'm perfectly fine with maintaining a viewable table of authors and their preferred licensing models.  That's a pretty good idea. It could probably be added to the table on the author's non-nosleep pages. I do get the feeling that most people won't bother looking before they take the material, though. Still, for the ones who typically take the time to ask for permission, it'd be a nice resource.   Brilliant. This is one of those stories that will definitely stick with me.   She was bitten by one just a few months ago, so he's not going to turn unless she decides to give him a nibble.   That's actually a brilliant idea. They'll know they blew their cover. Maybe it'll be enough to get them off my case.   Fair point, though in my head, the kid's not an emo. I suppose it should have been: "My mom thinks I'm emo because I have these cuts."  Y'know, parents are always throwing the wrong labels out there. Wear a leather bracelet, and they think you're a punk. Sacrifice a goat or two, and suddenly you're a Satanist. Silly parents.   That's hilarious!   Thank you! :)   Thanks. It was seriously supposed to be the stepfather. He's a teenager: he doesn't have a father-in-law. Fixed the post.   ARGH, thanks for catching that. It's supposed to be his stepfather. Must have had a brainfart.   Mom freaked out when she saw the cuts on my arms last month. She thought I was hurting myself. My stepfather was too much of a prick to tell her the truth. He stood in the corner, arms crossed, watching as she gripped me by the shoulders and tried to literally shake some sense into me. Even as she bawled her eyes out, holding me close to her and begging me not to hurt myself any more, the man kept his stupid ass mouth shut. He shot me this threatening look so I'd do the same.   nbsp;  Mom set up an emergency counseling session. After a few weeks, when she saw that no new cuts had appeared, she wholeheartedly thanked the therapist for saving my life. Meanwhile, her husband did what he always does: he played dumb.   nbsp;  She'll be so disappointed in me tomorrow morning, when she finds her claw marks all over me again. It'd be so much easier if we tied her up on the full moon.   Well...shit. Now I really regret signing those papers.   On a recent school trip, I visited the Central Experimental Farm, run by the Research branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. To me, the term "experimental farm" has always sounded ominous as hell. I pictured mutated livestock, chimeras, man-eating grain machines, and all sorts of creepy shit. Even though I was told experimental farms were just places where researchers tested out new techniques and equipment, I wasn't entirely convinced. Turns out, I was right to be suspicious.   nbsp;  Before the start of the winter semester, I was informed that I needed to take a complementary course. There were three options: mid-century philosophy, sports psychology, and drawing class. Thinking I'd get to see a ton of hot nudes, I went for drawing class. Once the semester started; however, I quickly realized that the only melons I was going to see were in a fruit bowl. Week after week, I wasted away three hours of my life drawing inanimate objects while listening to a monotone snob drone on about contrast and texture or some shit like that. It was horrendously boring.   nbsp;  One day, our professor announced he was planning a field trip to the Central Experimental Farm across town so we could draw live plants. He made arrangements with the various professors of classes taking place after his own, so students would spend a whole three hours at the location. I, on the other hand, had a spare after drawing class, so I wasn't exactly thrilled that I was going to lose a large chunk of homework time on traveling to and from the facility. Attendance was mandatory, so I had no choice but to follow along.   nbsp;  Hitching a ride with a fellow student, I arrived at the experimental farm bright and early. From the outside, the place didn't look quite as disturbing as I had imagined. Three large greenhouses were situated at a central location between four snow-covered fields. Nested against the farthest greenhouse was a tall brown office building. Researchers probably did their work in there. In the summer, crops were grown using different methods in each of the fields, and then tested to see which worked best. As far as I could tell, there wasn't any livestock. I couldn't even see a traditional farmhouse on the property. I began thinking I'd sorely overestimated the creep factor of the place: everything looked normal.   nbsp;  Once the teacher showed up, an employee escorted us into one of the greenhouses. I was amazed by the change of atmosphere when I stepped through a set of plastic strips separating the entranceway from the inside. Where the world had been cold and dry moments before, it was now warm, humid, and brimming with life. A variety of plants filled the semi-circular shelter, creating its own unique ecosystem. There were tall palm trees hanging over bushes, flowerbeds floating atop a pond, and even cucumbers growing upside-down on a fenced mesh. We were given freedom to explore the greenhouse and draw what ever tickled our fancy. I roamed about until I found a plant that looked kind of badass across a stream full of koi. I had brought a digital camera to take reference pictures in case I didn't have time to finish my drawing, so I quickly snapped a shot of the plant, before I began drawing it.   nbsp;  I'm no Picasso, so it didn't surprise me when my drawing went from a somewhat accurate outline, to a piece of shit. Thinking the plant I'd chosen was too advanced' for me, I abandoned my spot, and went about looking for an easier alternative. It was during this search that I came across a narrow passageway connecting the main greenhouse to the next. A set of plastic strips hung from a doorframe to the second greenhouse. I could clearly see the words "Employees only" marked in red above the door. Glancing around to make sure no one was watching, I ignored the sign and went inside. Why would I bother respecting their little warning, if they weren't even going to bother locking that shit up?   nbsp;  The air was much thicker inside the second greenhouse, and I could see a drastic change in the types of plants within it. This greenhouse had a tropical rainforest feel to it. The foliage was lush and the plant life was foreign to me. I walked around the area cautiously, keeping my ears open for the sound of footsteps. I took photos of everything I saw. One plant in particular, at the very back of the greenhouse, piqued my interest. It was unlike anything I had ever seen in my life: its stem was purple and branched out into light blue, it was covered in tiny razor-sharp thorns that were barely visible to the naked eye, and it had clusters of plump red strawberries dangling from its leafy ends. I took several pictures of the unique plant. The fruit growing from it looked and smelled amazing, like a basket of fresh berries in the middle of summer. I couldn't resist.   nbsp;  As I reached for one of the strawberries, I nicked my forearm on one of its thorns. My arm went completely numb almost instantaneously, like when you fall asleep on it and wake up to find it limp as a wet noodle. Heck, I couldn't even feel the bones holding it in place. It was as though the entire limb had turned into jello. The numbing sensation spread to the rest of my body. Before I even knew what was happening, I was laying on the floor with the plant towering over me. I was scared, and tried to call for help, but my tongue felt swollen and my words came out as incoherent babbling, like after a visit to the dentist. My vision began to blur and darken around the edges. I'm not sure if it was an optical illusion, but I could have sworn I saw a purple vine slithering towards me as I lay there paralyzed. I was certain I was going to die and, though I was terrified, I was thankful it was painless. The world around me disappeared, and I found myself feeling as though I was floating in the abyss.   nbsp;  A splash of cold water hit my face, bringing me back to the land of the living. I opened my eyes, only to see a bright shining light directly in front of me. I groaned and turned my head. As far as I could tell, I was no longer in the greenhouse. It was dark and cold. Every inch of my body prickled as my sense of touch came back little by little. I heard something, like the distant and muffled sound of someone shouting. Another splash of water, and I awoke fully. I gasped for air, screaming in pain. My body ached in places I didn't even know existed. It didn't help that I was sitting on an uncomfortable wooden chair, but I think I'd have been in as much agony on a futon anyways.   nbsp;  As I sat there, confused, scared, and in a great amount of physical distress, I began trying to make out my surroundings. I was definitely in a room: the walls were close to me. If I'd had enough strength to stretch my arm out, I probably would have been able to touch them. I could barely make out the outline of two men standing behind the spotlight in front of me. One by one, they started barking questions at me, like I was some kind of criminal on one of those cop shows. I could barely understand what they were saying, let alone formulate the syllables needed to answer them. They grilled me for hours, and as time passed, I was finally able to respond. I tried telling them I was a student on a field trip and got turned around, but they wouldn't listen to me. They just went on and on, until I broke down and started crying. My eyes were burning, but the tears eased some of the pain. I felt absolutely helpless. I wanted to go home.   nbsp;  I think those sick fucks were waiting for me to break down, because they dimmed the spotlight not long after, and pushed a piece of paper over to me. Up until that moment, I hadn't even realized there was a table in front of me. Good thing I didn't try kicking them in the nuts like I wanted to. Not that I would have been able to if I tried: I was so sore, it felt like I'd been body checked by three hockey players at once. I couldn't think clearly, not with the men impatiently screaming at me, waving their hands at the piece of paper. I signed. I don't even know what the paper said, but I signed the fucking thing. The men toned down their aggression afterwards.   nbsp;  Finally, I was pulled to my feet by one of the men. He was big, buff, and looked like some kind of security guard or something. He took me to a car waiting outside. By then, it was night, and I wondered how they'd justified my absence to my professor. Hadn't anyone wondered where I'd been? I was too emotionally and physically drained to say anything during the ride home. Frankly, I'm not even sure I gave the driver my address. He just kind of knew where to go. He stopped in front of my house, opened the back door, glared at me, and threatened that I'd be in big trouble if I told anyone what had happened. Fuck that shit. You're reading this now, so clearly I didn't listen to him.   nbsp;  Later that night, as I was resting in bed, I remembered my camera. By then, my body was still a little sore, but felt much better. My left arm still felt odd, though. I could barely move it, and the skin on it was numb. Using only my good arm, I looked through my things, and found the digital camera in my backpack. I flicked the switch, trying to find a photo of the plant. I wanted to look it up online. The SD card was empty. They deleted EVERYTHING, even the photos I took a month ago and never got around to transferring. They were all gone.   nbsp;  It's been a few days, and my arm's still not working quite right. It moves slowly, and my muscles are sore like when you start lifting weights after a long break. I'm pretty sure those dudes are watching me, because there's this car outside my house at all times. When I leave home, it follows me from a distance. I managed to give them the slip today. I snuck out the back door and went straight to the library. I'm posting this via a public computer so they can't trace that shit back to me. I don't know what they want or what they'll do if they found out I talked. Either way, I needed to tell someone. There's some real weird shit going on at the experimental farm. What ever they're doing there, it's not normal.   Oh my, how fortuitous!   Hmm?   Like the others pointed out, there's /r/nosleepteams, where a single story is co-written by a team of writers. But there are also series where different parts have been posted by separate writers, like the famous [All In Good Time](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepOOC/comments/2keyy5/list_of_stories_involving_all_in_good_time_or/) series. Every section is kind of stand-alone, yet goes together.   Funny thing is, it actually wasn't. I tried signing in using 'password' as a password, but nada. Fortunately, the lovely admins reset everything and I was ultimately able to sign up again with a real password this time.   RIP jogger, RIP.   To me, the most disturbing part of this is thinking about you taking care of Brambles' litterbox.   Yeah, definitely not my brightest moment. I figured out that "email" had to be changed to one's email address. It just didn't occur to me that "password" was a variable, too. I kicked myself for that one. Hahaha.   Protip: Don't be like me and moronically assume it's a command to receive an email to set up a password. You have to input the password you want in there.   FIDDLESTICKS AND FUDGESICLES. Nope. NOPE. NOPE.   In my case, I never received an email. It just kind of worked.   I'd feel a lot better if he was, but I don't think so.   When I was in high school, my friends and I had a peculiar pastime. Like any teenage delinquent, we liked to cause trouble. We weren't vandals, we didn't deal drugs, and we certainly didn't bully kids in school. No, we liked to scare the living shit out of new parents by "hacking" their baby monitors. We were insufferable little punks who thought we were too good to get caught, and that our little acts of mischief would go unpunished. One night; however, I learned my lesson, and realized that I wasn't quite as bulletproof as my tremendous adolescent ego made me out to be.   nbsp;  Dimitri, Kurt, and I went to the same school, shared many of the same classes, and hung out almost every evening after chow time. We watched prank shows, played video games, talked about who had the nicest rack in school. One evening, we were trading scary stories at the park. Kurt shared the classic story about the single mother who heard a haunting voice on her baby monitor. Like most horror stories, it sounded like total bullshit, but Dimitri told us it had happened to his mom once. On her own monitor, she'd heard a neighbour singing to her baby. Apparently, it was possible to accidentally tap into someone else's frequency. In an instant, a lightbulb turned on in each of our heads. When you're close enough to someone, you don't need words to know what that person is thinking, and we could all tell we were thinking the exact same thing: we were going to buy a baby monitor and screw with people.   nbsp;  Pardon the pun, but hacking a baby monitor is child's play. All you need to do is find a device on the same frequency as yours. Never one to do things half-assed, I purchased a high-end monitor with a frequency dial so we could prank as many targets as possible. The following night, we took to our bikes, roamed the neighbourhood, and found our first victim. We could see the nursery from the suburban home's second floor window. Dimitri grabbed the baby monitor and began tuning it to different frequencies, until we heard breathing. I remember feeling excited as our plan finally came to fruition. Dimitri pressed the button, and began exhaling heavily into the receiver.   nbsp;  "yourlittle girlwasdelicious", he murmured, using a demonic voice.   nbsp;  The light in the master bedroom turned on almost immediately, and we heard a shrill scream. Laughing our asses off, we quickly rode off down the street so we wouldn't get caught.   nbsp;  We repeated the prank several times over the course of the following weeks, each taking turns talking through the monitor. Not wanting anyone to get wise to our little game, we chose different houses every time. People's reactions were priceless: some mothers would reply in a panic, others seemed to know it was a hoax and told us to shut up, and one poor woman even started sobbing uncontrollably, begging us not to hurt her baby. I feel bad about that last one now that I'm older, but it was hilarious to me back then. My friends and I mimicked her high-pitch bawling and desperate cries for mercy for weeks afterwards. Yeah, we were royal dicks.   nbsp;  Karma's a bitch, and I got what was coming to me one night. Kurt and Dimitri were busy studying for their midterms, so I went out on my own. By then, we'd gotten pretty much everyone in the surrounding area, so I decided to venture off across town and into unfamiliar territory. Finding a target wasn't difficult: you just had to look for cars with baby seats, houses with overly-colorful cartoon-themed curtains, or toys left in the yard. I came across a house that fit all three criteria, and parked my bike out of view. Playing with the tuner, I eventually found the right frequency. I could hear the sound of a baby snoring very lightly. A devious little smirk pushed its way onto my lips, and my heart began pounding with excitement. It was my time to shine.   nbsp;  "Iamwatching", I whispered into the monitor, using the creepiest voice I could muster.   nbsp;  The house remained dark and lifeless. I figured the home owners hadn't heard me.   nbsp;  "Istandover your bedwatchingwaitingI will get you", I said, louder this time.   nbsp;  Nothing. Just the sounds of crickets chirping, and the occasional dull roar of a car driving down the street. It was a little odd. Parents usually reacted much quicker than that. I began feeling a little nervous, and somewhat exposed. You know, like when you suddenly realize some creeper's gawking at you? It was getting late, and I had a long bike ride home. Just as I was about to give up and leave, I heard a strange, moist gurgling sound coming from the monitor. The quiet, rhythmic snores ceased, and I assumed the baby had woken up and was about to start crying. Instead, a man spoke to me.   nbsp;  "You're the onebeingwatched nowJuan.", he said softly.   nbsp;  My stomach pirouetted at his words. How did he know my name?! I felt sick. Something was very wrong, and I could feel it in my bones. I glanced up at the nursery window, and saw a silhouette standing there watching me. Had he been there the whole time? The air was thick and difficult to inhale, though perhaps fear was making it hard to breathe. My body quivered uncontrollably, as a sense of dread poured into every inch of me. I climbed on my bike, pedalling desperately to get away. Part of me thought I was overreacting, but the overwhelming need to flee overpowered my rational mind.   nbsp;  "Youcan't runI knowwhere you live, Juan", continued the man, even as I turned the corner.   nbsp;  I flew down the street, not stopping until I reached a busy boulevard. Surrounded by cars and a few late night joggers, I felt safe.   nbsp;  "Your hoodie will run red your blood, boy", whispered the man, still talking through the baby monitor in my pocket.   nbsp;  A passerby gave me a nasty look as I yelped loudly in fear, practically ripping my hoodie in my frantic attempt at removing it. To the stranger, I must have looked like some snotty kid tripping balls or something. He didn't know I was in genuine distress, so I don't blame him for walking off with an insulted huff, though I wish he had offered to help me instead.   nbsp;  After stuffing the hoodie into my backpack, I noticed my name scrawled on the back. It was my fucking school jacket: no wonder that bastard knew my name. It then occurred to me that baby monitors were fairly short-ranged, so I was obviously being followed. I nervously glanced around to try and identify my stalker. Was it the empty-looking van down the street? That guy walking his dog? The car that had just driven by? Either way, the last thing I wanted was to hear that voice again, so I turned off the device, and started pedalling towards my home. Fear had heightened my senses, and I began notice every motion of the trees in the breeze, every crackle of twigs under my wheels, and every car that zipped past me. I flinched whenever anyone came near, paranoid that whoever had spoken to me through the baby monitor was going to catch up. Fortunately, I made it home without incident.   nbsp;  I parked the bike in my garage and crawled up the stairs to my bedroom. In one careless motion, I tossed my backpack and the baby monitor in the corner of my room, and dove under my sheets like an Olympic swimmer. It doesn't matter how old you are: nothing feels safer than being under your blanket. I closed my eyes, hoping I'd be able to calm down enough to catch a few hours of rest before class, but then I heard static coming from the monitor across the room. The monitor that was supposed to be off.   nbsp;  "Sweet dreams, Juan.", said the voice that still haunts my nightmares.   nbsp;  Needless to say, I didn't sleep a wink that night. I was too frightened to get out of bed until sunrise. When I got up, my first order of business was to remove the battery from the monitor and throw it in the trash. I didn't want anything to do with it any more. I came up with an excuse to give my buddies so they wouldn't think I was a huge pussy. With massive bags under my eyes, I got dressed, had breakfast, and went to school.   nbsp;  It wasn't until a few days later that I saw the house on the news. In an interview, a police officer explained that the small family who had been living in the house had been found in their beds, necks slit open. I had been outside when it happened: the killer had heard me on the baby monitor and decided to fuck with me. It was definitely a wake-up call, and I thanked my lucky stars that I hadn't gotten the shit murdered out of me. I was too busy feeling thankful that I survived to feel bad about the family that hadn't. Empathy, like wisdom, comes with age.   nbsp;  Now that I'm an adult with a wife and daughter, I truly understand the consequences of my actions, and the severity of the situation I put myself in as a tremendously stupid teenage boy. That dreadful night, I thought I reached the epitome of fear, but it was just the tip of the iceberg. As a father, I now know that fear thrives and multiplies when there's something more precious than your own life at stake. I can't say for sure whether the killer found me again after all these years, or whether a new breed of idiots had the same idea as my friends and I, but I can tell you that I now understand what true terror is. Last night, I heard something on our baby monitor that sent chills into my very soul, shackling me with a paralyzing fear that I doubt will ever leave me:   nbsp;  "I'mstillwatching"   Personally, I would never put my phone number online, for a variety of reasons. Can you imagine if you start getting charged for international text messages/calls?  That said, services like MagicJack and Skype let you buy phone numbers and receive calls through the magic of the internet rather than a phone line for a minimal fee. You could decide to set up a phone number for a couple of months and eventually drop it once the story loses its steam. That way, you don't get stuck with a huge phone bill and you maintain your privacy.  An alternative would be to use a fake email address. Easy to open, easy to close.   They want to steal my soul.   I'm sure it is. :P  Happy cake day.   Look at that adorable little guy! He thinks his arm is a gun!  Want to see the absolute BEST marine creature? Google red lipped batfish. Can you say sexy?   Aquaman would be so proud.   Why did I google mantis shrimp? WHY!?   one more reason to avoid the ocean.   Did you mean [A story to scare my son](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2igaa9/a_story_to_scare_my_son/)?  It was amazing, but definitely not underrated, as it won the monthly contest.   Craig's a trustworthy fellow connected to a real website. He contacted me back in December for the same reason. Not sure why your emails aren't getting through: I had no trouble communicating with him back then. If/when you manage to get through, he'll send you a consent form to fill out.  I know they have a huge backlog of stories to adapt, so once that step is done, it might take a while before you see anything on their website. Either way, I assure you they're perfectly legitimate.  Just like /u/notsohornyowl said, they sometimes team up with The NoSleep podcast.   I'm chuckling, but only because you tell the story in such an entertaining way. Nothing wrong with self-preservation.  In my own experience, when I was a teen, I once legitimately thought someone had broken into my home. My reaction was to grab one of my decorative (but sharp) swords and search the house. AKA the dumbest freaking thing you can do in that kind of situation. Though I saw the man, heard his footsteps, heard him talking...the house was empty. It was one of many times some weird stuff happened in that house. I'd say calling the cops is the smartest move, Knotty. Better safe than super-murdered.   I was on TrueKnot-duty tonight.   Don't! It's perfect, like a beautiful drunken haiku.   HECK YEAH!   These things come in waves. In December-January, it was people doing rituals, now it's this. Before you know it, we'll be on to something else. (I'm hoping for a killer unicorn dog trend.)   No worries: a lot of people don't know about the NoSleep Finder. I'd help you out if I knew the story title, but I've never heard of it, sorry.   Welcome to the community, by the way!   In all seriousness, though. The [NoSleep Finder](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepfinder) is the perfect place to ask this question. Someone will find that story for you.   That wasn't a story. That was me PMing you asking for help. (Shhhh, they're watching me right now)   Aw, man. I miss out on all the good stuff by not having Netflix. Damn you, download cap, daaaamn youuuuuu!   Yara's Haunt gets my vote as a great addition - not a competitor, an addition - to the nosleep family.  Well said, my good fellow. Well said indeed!  Edit: He also did one of mine and it was awesome sauce, with a few sprinkles of cinnamon.   A dull current surged through the woman's watch and into my body. It wasn't strong enough to cause pain, unlike the shock I'd gotten when I touched that tree in the forest, so I kept hold while I waited for her to respond. My eyebrows furrowed together, helping me produce a menacing and hopefully intimidating glare. Theo was always better at shakedowns than I was. My grip tightened, as though I believed the pressure would be enough to force a response out of the woman.    "I'm just checking in to make sure you're enjoying your stay.", she replied in a friendly tone, though her eyes betrayed contempt.    My hand started to burn, as the strength of the current intensified violently and unexpectedly. It reminded me of the time I mistook Theo's hotplate for my alarm clock the ONE TIME he'd forgotten to turn it off. My hands snapped back to my sides, and I looked down at my palm. The flesh seemed fine: not a burn in sight. By the time I looked back up, the woman was gone, and I was outside again with Theo. The sound of music flooded my ears once more, and all the physical and emotional pain seemed to go away, until Theo kicked me in the shin.    "Dude, get it together!", he barked, snapping me back to reality.    "GOD DAMN IT, THEO!", I screamed, waving my arms around frantically. "This time, we fucking stick together, okay!?", I howled.   I didn't want to lose track of my friend again, so I looped an arm firmly around his. It didn't matter what it looked like: this was about survival, not keeping up appearances. No matter what happened, I wasnt going to let Theo out of my sight. Then, I noticed something on his wrist.   "...Theo...where did you get that watch...?", I asked.   I'm 27 and I have a 3DS, as does my 40-something co-worker. No shame in loving Nintendo.  Either you have a fun-loving entity in your house, or your mom secretly loves to play your game and was disappointed you took it with you. I would leave it home tomorrow and doodle a smiley face on the post-it.   New Brunswick. I'll look it up once I get home, thanks for the tip!   Though my heart belongs to the butler, what remains (of my love) is yours.   Same storm, different location.   Would you say they've GRINDed to a hault?   Yesterday, as I was vacationing in the maritimes, a massive blizzard hit the region. I saw something out in the storm, and it freaked me the fuck out. Even though it's now bright and sunny outside, I'm almost glad my flight home got cancelled, because at least now I can stay inside where it's safe. I'm afraid of what might be hiding out there in the snowdrifts.   nbsp;  I woke up fairly late last morning. The basement apartment I rented for the week was practically pitch black, so I was startled to see it was already 10 am when I got around to checking the time. No light was coming through the blinds in the windows, making it seem as though it was still night. When I flipped open the blinds, I saw a wall of snow fully concealing me from the outside world. Grabbing my coat, I climbed the squeaky and narrow staircase leading to the side door. I could hear wind furiously hissing through a crease in the wall. I had heard about the region's infamous storms, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened when I opened that door. I was assaulted by a violent breath of snowy air. It nearly knocked me back, but I managed to grab hold of the hand ramp. Snow continued to invade the corridor and dart painfully into my eyes, making it almost impossible to see the tall snow bank that had once been a rental car. It took all my strength to get the door shut.   nbsp;  As I returned to the quiet safety of the basement, I told myself there was no fucking way I was going outside again until the storm subsided. I grabbed my laptop, and checked out what people had to say on Twitter about the snowpocalpse. One helpful user posted a link to the city's traffic cameras, along with a single word: Creepy. Reassured that I wasn't the only out-of-towner disturbed by the sheer amount of snow, I followed the link to see how bad Main Street looked. The screen was practically all white, though I could make out a few buildings when the snow died down a bit. Though I'd been around snow all my life, I had never witnessed a blizzard first-hand, and I felt a little excited to be part of it. It was then that I noticed something odd in the street: there seemed to be a man standing in the flurry of snow. Thinking nothing of it, I switched to the other traffic cameras, checked out the rest of town, eventually grew bored, and shut the laptop so I could get breakfast.   nbsp;  A few hours passed, but I could still hear mother nature having a temper tantrum outside. Bored, I looked at the traffic cameras again. I couldn't believe my eyes when I switched to Main Street. That fucking guy was STILL there! Sure, some people enjoy the cold, but this was ridiculous: he'd been standing there for hours. I switched to Main Street's secondary camera, which gave me a view from the other side of the street, hoping to see a squad car nearby. Maybe the guy was a traffic cop? Nothing. Not a damn thing. The snow-coated street was empty, except for a single human standing front-and-center. He gave me the creeps. Had he really been standing there the WHOLE time? I felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, as though I knew some weird shit was going down, even though there could have been a perfectly logical explanation I was overlooking. Suddenly, the power went out, and I screamed like a kid. Using the laptop's screen to light the way, I searched the apartment for a flashlight. Fortunately, the power came back on after about half an hour.   nbsp;  By the time internet service was restored, another hour had gone by. I had only one thing in mind: finding out whether or not that scary motherfucker was still outside. I went straight for the traffic cam. Wouldn't you know it, he hadn't fucking moved. I could see him swaying back-and-forth calmly, as though completely unaffected by the chaos around him. Looking at him made me feel nervous, yet I could not avert my gaze. Due to the heavy snow, I could only make out his general male form and a brownish coat. The weirdest thing about him was that there didn't seem to be any accumulation of snow on or around him, which was quite a feat, considering everything else was coated in over 50 centimeters of snow.   nbsp;  Just as I had had enough and was about to switch off, someone else appeared in view. It was a woman wearing a long blue coat. She was walking down the street, one arm shielding her face from the elements while the other stretched in front of her, as one would do in the dark to avoid running into things. The man took a single step towards her. At that moment, a gust of wind obscured the scene in a snowdrift. Once it cleared away, the figures were standing side by side, swaying in unison. I jumped to my feet and power-walked around the apartment, trying to jerk away the creepiness and goosebumps riding up my spine, while muttering "Oh hell no!" a dozen times beneath my breath.   nbsp;  Over the course of the evening, I periodically checked out the live feed. The figures remained in the frame, but they started moving closer and closer towards the camera, until they were out of sight. I had to change angles to spot them off in the distance, towards a third figure, before losing sight of them completely.   nbsp;  Maybe I'm freaking out over nothing...but, shit. I'm really spooked. I feel like they're still standing out there somewhere, you know? Has anyone else seen weird people in traffic cams? I can't possibly be the only person who saw these guys: they were there for almost 12 hours! Either way, I'm stuck here until tomorrow, so I'm just going to stay inside where it's safe. If you're in the maritimes, I suggest you do, too.  	77

 Yes indeed! I also like the fact that no two games will ever be the same.   I'm glad I'm part of a diversified group so everything gets played. But I do see what you mean, so it's a game that I will always be willing to play but not sure I want to own.   I completely agree with you. In the early turns there's not much going on, it's just about drafting the right combo of cards and tiles and taking a few 5/6s. Then it kicks off mid-game.   Fantastic week for me! Played for the first time:  **Kanban** - This is definitely one of my favourites in 2014. It's an interlocking puzzle and it's not as heavy or AP as I expected it to be. It's probably because (1) if you can't think of anything to do, most of the time you can just train; and (2) you can leech off other players' actions for scoring. We did however played the nice Sandra scenario so next time it might not be as easy as I think.  **St. Petersburg (2nd ed.)** - Very nice card drafting game. It feels like a more complex version of **Splendor** and less stressful version of **London**. I have not played the first edition before but the others said the new market tracks are an interesting addition.  **Shadowrun: Crossfire** - A great co-op deckbuilder. It almost feels like a very simplified version of Mage Knight with only the battle elements. The permanent upgrades also makes you want to replay it as well.  **Macao** - An early gem from Feld. There are many interesting choices every round which rewards careful planning and not being too aggressive. Some of the cards are written poorly though, so I do prefer his more recent games. A very solid and unique game still.  Games that I've played before: **Terra Mystica**, **Hyperborea**, **Machi Koro**, **Guildhall**, **Sail to India**, **Puerto Rico**   **Lords of Waterdeep** is a worker placement game that is easy to learn and the DnD theme (although not very apparent) may appeal to some in your group. The competition mainly comes from taking action spaces and quests that other players want, and playing cards that affect opponents.  **Lords of Xidit** is a programming game that is also easy to learn and it looks amazing. It is about recruiting characters to fight off monsters (NPC) on a map. You each have a dial and players simultaneously set their 6 actions of the round and then reveal together. Therefore you would need to guess/double-guess what other players are trying to do.   It depends slightly on location but for simplicity I'll use Amazon US prices.   **Hanabi** - $9.89. Pure co-op logic/deduction card game with a slight twist - you can only see other players' hand but not yours. You give clues to each other  in order to play cards.  **Dominion** - $23.87. THE deck building game. Very simple rules, hours of fun. (Dammit why is this so cheap in the US. it's 30 here in the UK)   For me, it's about engine/efficiency building, upgrades, and the satisfaction when a plan actually worked. I don't mind randomness as long as the sequence is randomness -decision - outcome (**Castles of Burgundy**) and NOT decision - randomness - outcome (**Eldritch Horror**, **Eclipse**)  Examples:   **Terra Mystica** - planning ahead for that chain reaction double town round for 10 extra points.  **Le Havre** - getting loans early in the game to fuel your shipping production then paying everything off in one go.   Based on the aspects you like, I recommend:   **Terra Mystica** - It's a game about expanding your control on a map trying to form towns, while different buildings give you different income and abilities. No randomness after initial setup, not much direct conflict, managing the use of 3 resources (workers, money, power). There are no changing cost of resources though.  **Brass** - Economic game about connecting your industry empire to trade coal/steel/cotton. There's changing cost of resources. Not much direct conflict. Slight randomness due to card drawing.   Alternatively, buy more expansions of **Power Grid** if you're just bored of the base map and power plants!   For every single game, there will always be people who hate it/regret buying/rate as a 1 on BGG etc. I think it's always important to decide for yourself (and your group) whether you like a game or not, especially when trying out a new type.   It's also a very popular game so it's also likely that you could trade/sell it away if you didn't like it after all.    **Terra Mystica** with expansion: Played wit the mermaids. Doing quite well because of the # of clusters end game scoring, but I was greedy on the fifth round as I should have passed earlier when the good point scoring bonus tiles were up for grabs...came second and lost to dwarves :(  **Panamax**: One of my favourites of 2014. I was doing well early game and people started buying my shares and pushed the price up so I wasn't able to pay dividends in the final round. Pacing the cashflow is really important in this game! I'll try to get this played more often in 2015.  **Forbidden Desert**: Not a big co-op fan but I thought it was more interesting than Forbidden Island.  **Deus**: I was excited to try this but was disappointed as most parts of the game everyone was just staring down at their cards and there was no interaction at all.   Gaming resolution this year: go to Essen.   I would say **Terra Mystica**  In TM There are a handful of actions you can choose each turn but it flows logically once you explain Terraform, Build, Power and Cult track. Everything else are just upgrades and ways of getting points.  In Eclipse, you will have to explain every single tech, battle, initiative, dice roll modifiers are not as easy to remember.  On the flipside, for the first Eclipse game you could all play with human races to simplify things a bit but you have to pick factions in TM.   positive: **Terra Mystica**, **Brass**, **Glory to Rome** negative: **Battlestar Galactica**   It's H@ll Games/Pegasus Spiele, perhaps its the European edition?  It's a medium heavy game, the weight is about same as Trajan. I played once with 2p and once with 4p. Every action is an interlocking puzzle, which unfortunately means that people with AP will slow this game down a lot.   Yes if you are a big fan of Dixit/co-op/social interaction/family friendly games!    Thanks for your suggestion! Seriously, I think that would improve the strategy element.   A quiet week because of Christmas:  **Mysterium**: Played with a full 7 player game - lost inevitably. We agreed that 4-5 would probably be the best player count. Nonetheless, there was a lot of discussion and we all had a good time.  **Aquasphere**: Another nice puzzle-like game from Feld. Love the wooden pieces of the game.  **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**: 2p game didn't turn out great because a lot of rooms are not in play so it's difficult to plan ahead. I'll probably only play with 4p with this one.  **Russian Railroads**: About my 10th play, starting to get repetitive.  **Star Realms**: One of the best 20 minutes game out there. Easy to teach, quick and fun (when things go right for you that is).   **Trajan**:  The mancala bit is still fresh to us and fun to plan ahead with.  **Bucket King 3D**: Silly little party game. Remember to draw cards after playing them. Always.  **Oregon**: A decent abstract tactical game. I wish there are more of these relatively short (45 minutes) game that comes in small boxes.  **Grog Island**: The bidding and catch-up mechanic is quite interesting (when you pass an auction, you still get some kind of reward). Surprised the rating isn't higher with this one.

(**Dead of Winter**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Five Tribes**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**...) How long they'll stay in the top 100 is another matter.  I think there are many solid games released this year, especially in the light/medium weight spectrum which greatly helps in promoting the hobby (**Splendor**, **Istanbul**, **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **King of New York**)   	17

 Sounds painful   I have a hunch that he didn't throw for another touchdown that game haha.   Holy shit dude!   Tearing your achilles sounds like a terrible injury.   Glad your friend was ok. A friend of mine got hit in the throat in a lacrosse game a few years back. He took a pretty hard shot (80-90 mph) right in the trachea and had to go to the hospital, but he also ended up being okay. Just some trouble breathing for a few days.    That is an absolute nightmare   That is tragic   Please share your stories of terrible injuries you have seen during a sporting event, either while on the field or in the stands. I know you Redditors have seen some crazy things before, shock me!   Do you paint your eyebrows on?   I have that same vape. It is incredible!   A killer blowjob   Ketchup   That is so badass.

Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote.

You continue to try to infer things from my posts that couldn't be further from the truth. You are free to try to interpret my anti-terrorism rhetoric however you deem necessary. After all, it is a free country!   You are a complete idiot Cyan. I am of the belief that if you are responsible for a terrorist attack on the United States of America, you should be taken down with swift vengeance. I made no references to the power granted to the NSA or condoned the intrusion of people's basic civil liberties. I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be downvoted for condemning terrorism. Pretty disgusted with this thread right now!

 I know I'm a bit late, but I just need to rave about a store I found I couple weeks ago when I was traveling for my sister's hooding (also congrats to her for being almost done with her Ph.D!!) Sorry in advance for the book.  There's this show store in Berkeley, California called The Walk Shop. Their motto is "shoes for people who walk." The entire point is shoes that are comfortable.   I did ballet for 9 years. I'm 21 years old, and have legitimate arthritis in my knees and I don't remember the last time one or both of my ankles hasn't hurt, sometimes to the point that I ha e to take a sick day for it because I literally can't walk.  I got these ( http://www.imgur.com/fVilOdH.jpeg) for her commencement, and I have literally never had more comfortable shoes. And they're cute as heck, at least to me. They're Cobb Hill brand, and have changed my life. I didn't realize that shoes could be cute AND make me not want to cut off my legs after a full day on my feet.  /rave, anyone in that area should def look this place up. A lot of their stuff is not the most stylish, but I saw a huge amount of cute things that felt just amazing.   I was lucky in that I made my dresses both years. Senior year, I made a gorgeous backless mermaid dress. But you're right; unless you know exactly what works, you'll probably look strange.  EDIT: I was also maaaaybe 110 pounds at that point. So, yeah. 160 pound me now would look terrible in it, and probably anything like it, even if I made it myself to my exact measurements.   Grrl. I know it's frowned upon, but I wear leggings as pants all the time. I just make sure to wear at least two pairs at a time, to make sure they aren't see through. I wear regular tops with them, and think "red hair don't care" about everyone who tries to tell me it looks bad.   I just finished COLL-C105, Quantum Mysteries for Everyone as my breadth of inquiry class. If you've taken any physics class ever, it's too easy to explain. But I spent half of high school assuming I'd be a physics major, before switching to political science after 3 weeks, haha.  I've also heard people say POLS-Y105, intro to political theory, is a gen ed (idk, I'm a poli sci major), and I also just finished it and it was awesome. A lot of reading, but amazing. However, I'd say to wait until Prof. Craiutu is back from his sabbatical. I took his classes 3 semesters in a row, and I feel bad for anyone taking any political theory class that isn't taught by him.  My knowledge is mainly in the poli sci department, but I will say DO NOT take POLS-Y103, intro to comparative politics, or really any comparative politics classes, unless you absolutely have to.   Sorry if you're in the majority that doesn't like politics at all, that's just the experience I have.  Tl;dr: if you can wait a year or so to get your gen ed out of the way, take POLS-Y105, when Prof. Craiutu is teaching it, but be prepared to read a lot.   Peplums look bad on everyone. No matter what.   Yeah. Like, I've had some guys who tell me I can give out their digits no matter what, but I still ask them beforehand, and will only do it for close friends. Common courtesy to me, they are providing an illegal service.   There's also the issue of your dealer's dealer. My old weed dealer's dealer was also involved in coke, and my guy got fucked because an undercover officer was assigned to scope out the coke.  Even if you only do an ounce at a time, you have to realize that you're probably going somewhere with pounds fairly often. A friend was dating my guy's guy for a while, and I remember being so nervous when he went to roll a blunt and asked me which of his two strains I wanted to smoke, pulling out 2 pounds.   Everyone has that one bad tequila story, man. For me, it only happens when I mix it. When I want to drink tequila, I can't drink anyrhing else. Dark and lights, hard and soft, every other combination is okay with me, but tequila + any other alcohol = immediate bad time.   Hate this phrase, but I can't even. Too much stupid for my brain to handle.   I've just lived here too long. I think everyone has some beef with their home town.   Sometimes? I'm from Btown (one of the few almost civilized parts) and I'm literally always ashamed.   Valpo is a special place. Like the rest of Indiana.   I think you might have just posted the best thing I will ever read.   My baby Kate was the runt, too, and she's so rambunctious.    Our cat at home gets an old hamper with pillows and an electric blanket amd a heating pad for if it gets really cold on the porch. He likes it.   Not sure if it's the Asian ones that squirt some foul smelling something or other, but I'm super allergic to that shit and makes me hate the little nuggets.   Like the title says, I'm flying from Indiana to California tomorrow morning for my sister's hooding. I searched, but I couldn't find anything about this specifically.   I have a metal lunchbox in which I keep my makeup. I know to bag the foundation, concealer, and mascara, but is that all? I'll put my shampoo and conditioner in empty pill bottles, but can I still put the metal box in my carry-on? I won't be able to check anything, because my family is already paying a lot for the stay, so any help will be great.   Does lipstick count as a gel? What about a marker type eyeliner? I really don't know anything about this.   Thanks for making me remember all my favorite songs from Freshman year of high school are actually about heroin.    Exactly! I've never been to Japan or anything like it, but the two are very different. A bath is to relax, a shower is to get clean.   Hello all!  In this week of super stress, I like to make two of my most comforting foods: fried dough and curry.  http://www.imgur.com/ithjHq5.jpeg Here are the hush puppies.   1 box Jiffy mix 2 eggs ~1/2-3/4 cup each corn and diced onion (I used frozen because it's what I had) Vegetable oil to fry Salt, red pepper flake, and garlic powder to taste  Mix together all the ingredients in a bowl. Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet. I don't have a thermometer, but most recipes say 350 is what you want. Drop small spoonfuls of the corn mix into the oil, fry until golden brown, flip, and transfer to a plate with paper towels. I found that these cooked up really fast, maybe a minute on one side and 30 seconds on the other. Add salt, pepper, whatever (I really wanted Old Bay, but didn't have any) while they're still hot.  I think if I could have actually deep fried these, they would have been more like hush puppies. Really they were more like fried cornbread blobs, but they were still delicious.   http://www.imgur.com/P4Tah1S.jpeg And this is roasted cauliflower and carrot curry. This I didn't measure at all, so I'll guesstimate. It ended up with about three servings.  The veggies: 1 cup each frozen cauliflower florets and sliced carrots (again, frozen is all I have right now) 2 tbl curry powder Salt to taste ~1 tbl vegetable oil, to drizzle on top  Spread the veggies evenly on a baking dish Sprinkle curry powder and salt on top, mix to coat Drizzle oil on top Roast in a 425 oven for 25 minutes  The rice/sauce: 1 cup rice (before cooking) + water to cover one inch above 1/4 stick butter Flour (sorry, I have no idea how much) ~1/4 cup curry powder Water Salt and red pepper flake to taste  Cook the rice as directed (I did it in the microwave because I'm lazy and made this at 5am) In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and make a roux (continue stirring until it creates a paste). Add more curry powder and water to make it more saucy. Add the vegetables and cooked rice into the sauce, mix well, add salt/pepper/whatever to taste.  I wish I had had coconut milk or chicken stock for this, but I was just using what I had.  For some reason, these are two of my favorite comfort foods. I'm broke as a joke, so I didn't have the options I usually would. However, they still turned out pretty well. Adapt, adopt, and improve.   Beautiful, and I LOVE the name.   I have a friend who takes forever to order and likes to make her own thing. We went to one of the student bars on a busy night one time and she spent 15 minutes going back and forth with things like "I want something chocolatey," "oooh, raspberry or strawberry vodka," "what would go well with that," etc. The bartender had to leave to treat the regulars, and she ended up with something like "two shots of Bailey's, half a shot of raspberry vodka, some chocolate liqueur, and the rest with tonic water." I felt so bad, I just got a rum and coke.  I'm guessing most bartenders would be happy to serve you anything normal, so long as you know what you want before you bother them.   I failed two classes this semester. I've been too sad to go to class, so the ones that take attendance failed me. They were both major classes.  I drink too much. I know I do, and I know it's a problem. But drunk is pretty much the only time I don't feel miserable.  I graduated high school 6th in my class. My gpa was 3.86. I was depressed, but it came so easily to me. Now, after my third year of college, I'll be lucky to have a 2.3.   I just haven't cared all semester, and now I feel like a complete failure. I'm afraid to see my family. My sister is about to get her Ph.D. from one of the best schools in the country. My dad has one in physics, and recently got sober.  I can't even work up the energy to cry. I'm broke, so I can't even buy booze to make myself feel better. Even my cats don't make me feel any better about myself.  I've gained a bunch of weight, I haven't showered in a week, and I never see any friends. I still have two more finals and I don't care, but I know I need to step it up if I want to not fail all of my classes.  It's getting time where I have to start worrying about getting jobs. I'm gonna have to take a victory lap, which my parents are fine with, but I may even need two. I'm going part time next semester, for sure, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I've always dreamed of working in the government, but I'm so far from the cream of the crop that I'm that rejected corn that gives livestock mad cow. I had to drop my French major, which means my fallback of becoming a French teacher isn't even a possibility anymore.  I've wanted to do the Peace Corps for forever, but I doubt I can bring my cats with me to Africa, and I doubt even more that I can go two years without them. On top of that, they wouldn't accept me with my grades.  Tl;dr: I failed my first two classes ever this semester, I feel like a failure, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. All I wanna do is cry, and I can't even do that.   I'm not sure what the trail is, but there's a nice wooden deck thing looking over a lake at Leonard Springs that's only a 10-15 minute walk from the parking lot   I see you aren't hunting. You must be very hungry. Here, I give you foodz   I'll just say right quick that time out was effective for me as a kid because it was specifically the same place where I got spanked if I was really bad. My mom would make my sister and I sit at the base if the stairs, by the kitchen where she could watch us.   On btownmenus. I know I needed it after this "dead"week.

They're not, I got the ginger so the other would have a friend. They play fight fairly often, but are also snuggly and give each other baths.   The grey/white since August, the ginger since February. They're both a little over a year old.      Fun fact, I originally heard of this line back when she was the singer of Sky Salt (still one of my favorite bands). It's sad that they broke up and she turned dramariffic.   I pride myself on my croissants, and a curry butternut squash risotto is my ultimate comfort food.    I've only made pasta a handful of times, but I always found that just making a pile of noodles when they're wet and letting them dry that way always worked. It kinda looks like ramen.   Late, but Breckenridge Agave Wheat. Simply amazing.   Honestly, DSOTM is my least favorite. Momentary Lapse of Reason and Piper at the Gates of Dawn are the best, in my opinion. And PF songs were my lullabies every night growing up.  And of course Wish You Were Here.   My father and I both make a point to only listen to this album twice a year, because it makes us both cry/rage/yell at everyone. Momentary Lapse of Reason forever.   Good for him! I'm glad he's been able to transition to what he feels is right. Hope all is going well for him.   So instead, I got two cats. And they're the loves of my life, but I will always be a dog person. I especially want a really big dog, the kind who would either need room to run around, or multiple 3-mile walks every day, and I'm lucky if I walk a mil every day, haha.   I recently quit smoking weed. I don't remember the last time I was this anxious.   I wake up multiple times a night after having falling nightmares. I've been dreaming otherwise about a man who emotionally abused me.   I get drunk all day, every day. I don't remember the last day I didn't get drunk. I get the shakes every morning, and I don't feel normal unless I'm drunk.  About a month ago, my dad finally went into alcohol rehab. He's now in an Intensive Outpatient Program for it.   When I was six, I remember him teaching me that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer." And I'm turning into him.  The last time I went without booze for 3 days, I had to talk myself down from cutting or trying to kill myself multiple times a day. I hate that a handle lasts me two days; I hate that I need to bring a flask with me to class; I hate that I need to get drunk to spend time with my family; I hate that more than half of my money goes to booze. But most of all, I'm terrified of what could happen if I were to quit.   I couldn't put text in on my phone.  I've literally never done anything to my brows. Never plucked, never gotten them shaped, never filled them in--nothing. I know they could be better, although I've gotten compliments on them before  What should I do? I just bought my first pair of tweezers, but I'm scared of over-plucking.  Also excuse the early morning, no makeup face.  EDIT: here's a side view http://www.imgur.com/VaBMLfm.jpeg  EDIT 2: I don't want to go get it done professionally, I don't have anywhere near me besides a threading place that is notorious for making brows way too thin. And I really enjoy doing things myself.       Bassetts are my favorite ever. Wish I could support a dog right now, but can't.  OMG THOSE EARS DO   I just hope my other kitty won't get her cold, but I doubt it, cuz that's how germs work.    She got some meds yesterday, and she's been napping and sneezing today, but I'm soooooo happy she's feeling better. My cats are my children.    When she puked 5 times in one day when she only did once after eating food too fast, I was concerned. She seems to be doing better today, although she's been napping and sneezing a lot.   Obviously, after all that yakking and sneezing, I took her to the vet yesterday. Now we're 18 hours puke free and she got some antibiotics and antinausea medicine. She's been sleepy and has the sneezy wheezies, but I think she's well on her way. This was my first kitty illness, so I was freaking out all day yesterday, but she seems to be feeling much better already.      My kitties do this, but with immediate lap time, since they're too small for hugs.   I wanted to make a throwaway for this, but fuck it. I had a craigslist hookup once, and as soon as I saw his Nazi paraphernalia and a big Nazi chestpiece tattoo, I left. Like, this dude had a Nazi armband framed next to his copy of Mein Kampff.   Skinheads are sometimes punks, but not all punks are skinheads.    I didn't even notice this. /r/gonewildstories exists for a reason, it's where I get most of my (lady) fapping material.   I want to become a high school French teacher, and this makes me sad. I mean, in my high school experience, most of the parents seemed awful (southern Indiana here), but I only hung out with kids whose mothers read to them all the time growing up.  I was also homeschooled 2nd-6th grade, because I was at a 5th grade reading level in 1st grade, so maybe my views are skewed. My dream job is secretary of education, to fix our fucked up system (our meaning the USA's).   This. I've stopped looking both ways before I cross the street because I honestly don't care if I were to get hit by a car, but I'm taking steps.   I relapsed last week after 18 months, and the last time was when I attempted suicide.   The first step is to try hard to be not miserable. While that is a far cry from happy, it can be liberating. Try to see the silver linings. I know myself well enough to know that I will never be a "glass half full" type of person, so I try to look for the silver linings. I slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, but I got a legit knee brace put of it, which I've needed for years.   We all know it's hard. It's harder than a lot of things. It's a legitimate addiction, but there's no self-harm anonymous. The most we can do is try.   Try every day. Use a rubber band, call a friend, go play with kitties at the shelter, anything. And, most of all, know that there are people who care. You're free to PM me anytime. If need be, I'll give you my number so you have someone to call.   I don't know you, but I care about you. You deserve to live. You deserve to feel better. You deserve to be (at least) not miserable.    That star trek blanket may be my favorite thing ever.      I've said this before, but I wish I could volunteer at the shelter. If I did, I'd end up adopting everyone, because I fall in love so quickly, haha.  My first kitty was originally a foster, and she stole my heart after I lived with her/fed her/took care of her for two months. She's a sweet, rambunctious, tiny salt and pepper tabby with a white underside.   This makes me feel bad now. When I went to adopt Guillaume, my second kitty, I went to his room first and he immediately climbed into my lap. He's a big orange moogie, which is my personal favorite type of kitty.  I did go to all the other rooms and fell in love with a couple others, but I wanted someone outgoing and around the same age as my first baby, Kate.   Yay for dog cats. My first one also loves to play fetch.   I'm gonna have to try these. I'm used to spending a lot of time on my baked goods (making croissants from scratch is my happy place).   But can I get TP with the same print?   And The West Wing's Donna   Haha, I apparently give great back massages with my feet (yay 9 years of ballet), but it still just seems weird to me that walking on someone to get them off. Massages, sure (with proper knowledge and support, cuz doing it wrong can seriously fuck up your back), but the whole getting off on it seems weird.  Also, like I said before, I'm only 21, so a 33 year old seems too old for me. He wanted a relationship, and I'm wanting to date people who are still in college or just out of college.   I would, but the only real room with a door in my apartment (in the bathroom) doesn't have a real closing mechanism. It has handles, but they're just handles on either side of a hole in the door. My closet has a real closing mechanism, but I'd feel awful locking anyone in the 3x5 foot space without a litter box.   Thanks! And sorry for the late reply. I used to feed Kate on top of the fridge, which helped, but they both like to hang out there, and I've had to pick up food and water off my kitchen floor several times, since they both have those bowls that hold food and water.   I've been trying feeding them separately, but they're still stealing. It's been better, though, because they steal mutually now. They eat half a bowl of food, then they switch and eat the other's half.   Grapefruit juice and Gewuztraminer.  Really not a mimosa, but too good not to try.   I've got a friend who makes GnT's with cilantro all the time in the summer. Perfect!      Same here. A bank teller once told me that she was the mother of someone who went to my high school. A month later, I went back in with my mom, and she said the teller looked familiar. I immediately said "that's (this person)'s mom!" It took her by surprise, to say the least.   This is why I can't wait to live on a coast. I remember a summer I spent in Northern France, on the coast, and I went out in the morning, caught some crab, cooked them, and ate them all in around 4 hours. Anywhere in Indiana that claims to have "fresh" seafood is lying.   My mom wanted me to make brownies for my sister before she got her med card, haha.   Thank you, like everyone else has said.   My vet at home was a lot like you: caring, thoughtful, and wonderful. He understood when my whole family was there, bawling their eyes out, when we had to finally put the family dog down. He had arthritis, and we think diabetes, along with doggy Alzheimer's. He would forget to eat for days, then had seizures because his blood sugar was too low.   You are a great person for feeling how hard it is to put down a pet. It's usually for their own good, because they simply can't understand the horrible things happening to them. My Buddha was 15 when we put him down, and I was only 16. He was my baby brother, and I still visit where we buried him fairly often.   Again, thank you. I hope all vets are like you, and mine at home.   But thanks for the advice   The only real door I have is in my bathroom, where I feed the newbie. It doesn't have a real handle, and they can both get through any doorstop I put there.  By no real handle, I mean that you can pull it closed, but the handle is just a hole on both sides with the handle, but there is no actual closing mechanism.    I've searched and didn't find a good answer.  I brought a new cat into my home, and the two are getting along swimmingly. But, the newbie (Bill, around a year old, same as Kate, the original one) keeps stealing Kate's food. I still have the bowls in separate rooms, but once Bill finishes his food, he goes into the other room and eats most of Kate's.   Is there any way I can keep him from doing this? I've taken him away when I catch him doing it, but he's much bigger than Kate, and I think he bullies her away from it.  Tl;dr: new cat eats old cat's food, and I want to make sure they're both eating enough. Worried about old cat's eating habits, since the newbie eats most of hers.   EDIT: As background, Kate is an exceptionally small cat. She was even smaller than the normal runt of her litter. Bill is already fairly round, I call him "fatty Mcfatface" as a joke. Kate is fairly skinny, and I'm not sure if it's just because she has a small build,  or if it's because Bill steals her food.   No, but I'm only 21. That big of an age gap bugs me. I've got an older sister (26 next month), and it just seems weird to be with someone older than her. 19-24 is my comfort zone.    You may be the best SO ever. This looks so amazing.   Not an SO, but someone on okcupid sent me a message asking if I'd like to walk on him. I'd do it, but he was also 12 years my senior, and didn't seem compatible anyway.      Sadly, it's no longer on Netflix. I may try to track it down, but it is actually one of my favorite films. Set in something similar to WWII   I know the argument has been made many times that we shouldn't judge a girl on her size. Saying "a real man loves a girl with curves" is just as bad as saying "anything more than a handful is a waste."  I've gained 20 pounds in the last few months. I mean, I was considered "too thin" before that, but I have always been self conscious about how small my tits are. But even after gaining all that weight, due to stress, depression, and how much easier it is to order food than to cook for yourself, my tits are still less than one of my handfuls. And, for my whole life, I have been called "baby hands." I hate it.   I feel fat, because I have a noticeable stomach pudge. I can't fit into a lot of the clothes I bought last fall, when I was put on medicine that I was told would make me gain weight. To put it into perspective, when I was put on that medicine, I was 5'8" and 112 pounds. When I felt healthy finally, I was at 125. I'm not was 145, and I was told at the doctor's that my blood pressure was higher than it should be.  I've been watching what I eat, I quit smoking so I could finally even make it to the gym without feeling like I had finally had a full workout.  But I hate so much the idea that "anything more than a handful is a waste." Even though I'm not fit, I feel fat as hell, my tits are still not a real person's handful.  Can we stop with this dichotomy of "real men prefer girls with curves" and "more than a handful is a waste?" It hurts, even for those of us who are on the smaller end of the spectrum.   This makes me sooo happy that I'll have my two cats (both 11-months old) for the next 10-20 years. I hope I'll have kids by then.   I want to go to mass. I want to go to confession. The ritual and the idea on confessing all the bad you've done seems really appealing to me. I'd never take communion, because I think it would be offensive to take the body and blood of something I don't believe in, but the structure, the moral directives, the forgiveness appeals to me so much.  I think of religion as something to make you be a good person. And if you need an invisible man in the sky to make you a good person, I am completely fine with it. I don't; I want to be a good person because the world has seen too much injustice, too much hate.  But the structure that church can give you seems great to me.   Thank you for this. It's been almost 2 years since I broke up with my first boyfriend, and I'm only now realizing the good things we had. He did a lot of these things for me, too.   Oatmeal is the only thing that does it for me. A small bowl, soaks up errythang   That's awful! I've used henna for the last 7-8 years and wanna change it up, but this terrifies me.   Sorry for the delay.  I got a mistic e-cig, and I can get 0% nicotine cartridges, so I may switch to them in a while.  Good to know it's working for your mom!   Mainly I'm noticing the cough I've had since August is starting to dissipate, haha.   I usually don't post in here, but I'm excited. I'M QUITTING SMOKING! After 2+ years. I'm only on day two, and I'm cheating a little by going the e-cig route, but I'm not a super bitch, and I'm already noticing a difference in my lung capacity.  EDIT: I know this doesn't have a question, so I guess if anyone has tips past the e-cig, I'd love it. I'm doing a bunch of crochet, and I hope to start exercising once I can walk to the gym without panting and wanting to die.   If you can deal with the incredible sweetness, I've done caramel appletinis with sour apple schnapps and caramel vodka. Suuuuuper sweet, bordering on too sweet, but still pretty good.   I'll keep that in mind next time. I like cold meatloaf sandwiches, so the loaf pan is great for that, but it does seem a little too fatty on top.   Is there really any way to make meatloaf look nice? It tastes amazing, and that's all that really matters.   So, I was dumb and didn't think about a recipe. Here's basically what I did.  2 pounds ground pork 1/2 cup garlic breadcrumbs 5-6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced 1/2-3/4 cup frozen pepper-onion blend from Kroger. 2 eggs Hoisin and sriracha to cover.  Mix pork, breadcrumbs, and eggs together. Sweat onions and peppers, add mushrooms and saute until lightly wilted. Mix vegetables into the pork mixture. Put in loaf pan, and cover with hoisin sauce and sriracha. Bake for an hour, turn off oven and let sit inside for another ten minutes. Let sit for at least another ten minutes.   I've recently been into updating comfort food. It was very good.   Sorry! I basically followed http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/14629/mushroom-meatloaf this, but with pork and hoisin instead of ketchup.   I didn't use a recipe, just based the ratios from a google search.  I've had the idea of a vaguely asian meatloaf for a while, and I always crave meatloaf when it's been cold for so long.      :-( I just dont understand the type of person who could do that.   I adopted a new cat on Friday. My first cat was a foster I fell in love with, but the second's story is so sad.  The shelter told me that he was brought in after someone's cat had kittens and couldn't handle them all. He was adopted once, and a week later, he was brought back in as a stray. His first adoptive owner never came for him when they called.   He is seriously the sweetest cat I've ever met. He crawled into my lap immediately at the shelter, and spends most of his time there now.  I just don't understand at all how someone could give him up. He's so wonderful.  Does anyone else's cat have a sad past?   I hardly ever see people actually using that crosswalk. I do, but a lot of the time, people just cross wherever they want, including ten feet from the crosswalk. I'm of the opinion that, if you decide to drive on tenth, you need to factor in the traffic. Just leave earlier.   And they already shut down parts of 10th every summer.   The first thing I remember my dad teaching me was that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer."  Let's just say alcoholism runs in the family.   Same. I doubt I could teach my cats this trick.   He's an 11-month old male, and seems to be very friendly and confident. I went to the shelter for their free feline friday, and he immediately came and sat on my lap. I just got him home, so he's been sniffing around the apartment.  I had a short introduction with my 10-month old, Catrine, and there was ne'er a hiss. I'm still gonna keep them generally seperate for a few days, but I'm gonna let him explore while I sequester Kate, switching them every few hours.  Guillaume is the French version of William, so I think I'll call him Bill for short. I think all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys.      Maybe I'm weird. Or it may be because I'm completely in love with my specific apartment, but I love them.   I don't know anything about those specific places, but I'm renting with PavProps and they're the best. The maintenance men come within 12 hours of putting in a request, they shovel/scrape the sidewalk for you, and, if you stay on their good side, they can be very nice. I'm planning on getting a second cat, and when I called, they said that they wouldn't charge me more pet rent.  My friends renting with Grant Properties say that that landlady is wonderful, too.  EDIT: Several of my friends live in the Lincoln Hill apartments (544 S. Lincoln) and they're really nice. I looked at a one-bedroom there, and it's very nice. And they allow up to 2 cats. But it may be a bit far from Kelley.  	109

 I don't know, this is the first time I've heard anybody say "I like him but he'll lose" in a while. I think his supporters pre-maturely declaring defeat for him was a very big hurdle, and I think he's pretty much overcome it.   Have we done a promotional post in /r/SandersForPresident or any of the other relevant subs? I know I'd have subscribed a while ago, but just found the sub today.   Is it really fair to count Santorum himself?   Do you ask that question of gas station price signs, too?   The whole thing is seriously messed up:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks   The whole thing is seriously messed up:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks   I usually base it on positioning and mobility. If you're a "slower character" (e.g. hammer, brightwing, rehgar), or if I'm between you and your base, you're getting kicked. Otherwise, it's whoever is being the most annoying.   Here's [a video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks) instead!   Republicans can get away with that because old people (their base) vote and young people (their opponents' base) don't. That's why the country is significantly more liberal than the government.   That's you asking someone to do that for you. It's not an established, widespread industry of pushers.   Is that how it worked when alcohol became legalized? Do you know many alcohol dealers selling beer to kids on street corners?   So vote Sanders? Got it.   /r/gogopgo   The difference is that everyone is saying that Bernie is only in it to pull Hillary to the left. He's saying that that's not true. He's in it to win.  Nobody doubts that all of the republicans are fighting to get to the top of the crazy pile.   The problem is, that base actually votes.   Same.   Ah, good. It sucks when people do this, I'm glad that there's significant discouragement.  Thanks!   I very strongly disagree with this:   its going to cause youths to smoke it more since its been legitimized by the government.  Besides the fact that that's a pretty illogical statement (legalization might lessen the stigma, but it certainly won't *cause* anyone to use), the reverse will undoubtedly be true. Weed, at the moment, is essentially entirely unregulated, and many kids choose weed over beer because it's easier to get.  CVS isn't going to sell to a minor, but dealers have zero problem with it. Make pot legal and you get rid of most of the dealers.   /r/gogopgo   And, amazingly, it works :(   /r/gogopgo   This is super fun and effective (you wouldn't believe some of the escapes I've had doing this), but it doesn't explain the necessity for Tyrael to pause while throwing the sword.   Proposed Tyrael trait alternative:  **Archangel's Timeliness**  El'Druin's Might shows how much time remains for Tyrael to teleport.  You can't deny that that'd be a hell of a lot more useful than Archangel's Wrath.   First sentence:  Following comments Donald Trump made about Mexican immigrants during his presidential announcement last week,  There's also this:  "When do we beat Mexico at the border?" Trump said during his lengthy presidential announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York. "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."  And this:  Trump's comments are just the type the Republican Party has been looking to avoid. The Republican National Committee underwent serious self-reflection following President Obama's re-election, initiating an "autopsy" of what went wrong. It determined it had to reach out to minorities to strike a more inclusive tone.  And this:  The controversy seems unlikely to fade, especially now that Trump is an official candidate for president. With his high name recognition, he places highly in many polls and is likely to be included in the first two Republican presidential debates scheduled for August.  This entire article is about a US presidential candidate making several highly offensive comments during his announcement that he is running for president, and a major media corporation severing ties due to the nature of those comments, as well as the impact that it has on said candidate's party.  How is that not about current American politics?   /r/gogopgo   We're gonna win this thing. And then the other thing!   /r/gogopgo   They've been in a severe downward spiral for a while now. I unfollowed them from my Facebook stream them a while back. This has earned them the full unlike.   Very well put!   I know. Better late than never, but 2015 was a really freaking long time to wait for marriage equality.   I think we'll just have to agree to disagree.  For what it's worth, I'm a huge supporter of both gay rights and Bernie, so I'm glad that this has visibility.   If only the title were better.   It's not that it's not relevant. It's just counter to the campaign that Bernie is trying to run. I think if you asked him, he wouldn't want to see things like this posted here.   I guess my issue is it being posted here. Post it in /r/politics, /r/hillaryclinton, /r/lgbt, etc.. It doesn't really have anything to do with Bernie, and Bernie seems entirely uninterested (and unwilling) to discuss the positions of his opponents, let alone highlight something negative.   /r/mildlyinteresting   This doesn't belong here. Bernie repeatedly refuses to go negative, and so should we.   You'd think, but I think people see it as superfluous.   And we haven't even gotten the marriage equality win yet!    Hope we continue in the left direction.  FTFY ;)   Interesting. I wonder how many would vote for a democratic socialist, since Sanders is not a socialist.   Ha!   I agree.   Thank you. It helps a bit to know that vestibular rehab isn't 100% verified to work, though I would still think that someone would have brought it up as a possibility along the way. 5 years is a long time to try nothing.  I don't recall what the first ENT did, this was like 8 years ago, but as far as I can remember, the most we got out of anyone was "That sucks. Good luck!" So probably nothing.   Thank you.   Agreed on all counts!   Really his biggest hurdle is his own would-be supporters pre-declaring defeat for him. I know that's not what you're saying here, but the most common thing I hear about him is "Yeah, he's the ideal candidate and he'd make a great president, but he can't win", and I think a lot of people say that because a lot of other people say it.   Really? You think he needs a wig?   That's fine in theory, but it's not what happens in practice. We desperately need to replace the dysfunctional FPTP system. The good news is that we've begun to. RCV is growing around the country.   In unrelated news, McDonald's is looking for a new meat supplier.   The dismount button should be able to be moved to a different button than the mount button.   Sad, true, and frustration.   Good for you for getting involved a such a young age, though. We need more young people taking an interest in politics and government. The government is sadly far more conservative than the people, because old people vote and young people don't.   [I quite agree.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD)   Weird. Sorry you had that experience, especially since you've already donated.  Try it in incognito mode. Maybe the fact that you've already donated is causing the problem.   This is fun, and I would play the hell out of it, if it counted towards golden hero wins. Sadly, though, I'm probably just going to keep grinding ranked wins to hopefully get my first golden hero by the end of the year. Chances aren't great.   You get a banana! And you get a banana! [Everybody gets a banana!](http://media.giphy.com/media/y8Mz1yj13s3kI/giphy.gif)   Even when he's supporting libertarian positions? You don't think that's relevant to libertarians?   Thank you.   We should not decriminalize theft and burglary. That's absurd.  Yes, we should decriminalize prostitution.   The answer is treating it like a medical problem, not a legal one. You're right, prevention is the key, and locking people up is not preventing anything. It's only making them more desperate, giving them fewer options, and surrounding them with more criminals.  TL;DR - Decriminalization.   Not really sure how debates are bad for the people, I would argue that the opposite is true, but I definitely agree that they're good for Bernie.    I consider the legalization of marijuana to be a libertarian issue, so I post things related to it here. Sorry if you feel it's off topic.   I'm down for everything except for the "instead" part. I like being able to see how long until the next one starts.  Other than that, I agree!   It's probably a sticker.   The first one should be free, and then it's $15 for another 3.  My first one was free.   I think I might be done with the PTR:  * No progression * No talents * No new hero * Lots of lag * 75% chance of playing a map I could play on the regular server that doesn't suffer from those other problems  Might be a different story if there was more to test or if there wasn't such horrendous lag (I never lag on the real servers).    Do you have TWC?  Thankfully no. I live in one of the few places in the US where I've got a second ISP to choose from.   Was one of you Zeratul?   Nope. NA.   Allies will no longer hear Mad Martian Gazlowes voiceover globally.  Thank God! That was the worst.    it was a savage loss  FTFY   Really, the amount of total actions take in a game is small enough that I think it's reasonable to expect every game to be saved for replay.   3 questions:  1. Would it be reversable? 2. Would it work for astigmatisms? 3. Would I feel it in my eye long term?   More to the point, who isn't yesterday?   The GOP: the party of small government, personal liberty, and free markets. /s   I'd love one, if you still have one.   ELI5 the difference?   That's why I'm a big fan of early voting. Makes it a lot easier for people to get out to vote if they have options and more than one day to do it.  I'm excited to see online voter registration becoming more prevalent, too.   Old people vote, young people don't. That's the sad reality that has made this happen.   I don't see what's wrong with Title + quote, as long as the end result is still representative of the article.  I think something is being lost here.   And surviving teammates, please, PLEASE act as though you're down a hero. Because you are. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a teammate die, followed by one of my other teammates starting (yes, starting) a team fight with the 5 enemies that just got the kill.  Repeat after me:  By Grapthar's Hammer, you shall be amazed at how I wisely fall back and safely soak/defend by (preferably behind) our towers until our team is no longer at a significant disadvantage!  Of course you can't just give the enemy full map control every time one of your teammates goes down, but you do have to acknowledge their advantage and play accordingly. If the enemy is up 2-3 heroes, they're going to take a boss, your mercs, a fort, etc.. That's their reward, let them have it, and don't add to it if you can't deny them safely and sensibly.  TL;DR - Don't get dead, too.   /r/gogopgo    It was never brought up again.  Why not? Did he cancel Cinemax?   Might be if we can get his supporters to stop preemptively declaring defeat. He's rocketing up in the polls, but the pessimism is as thick as ever.   I am absolutely convinced that there is no greater mistake you can make than attacking your own teammates. There's absolutely no point to it, it causes a lot of damage, and it's incredibly easy to avoid (step only: don't do it).   Then if you don't mind a suggestion, stop saying that it won't happen. If you're right, then it won't have changed anything, but by trying to declare defeat for him early, all you're really doing is making it more likely. There's no upside to it.  He's got quite an uphill battle, and one of the major hurtles is the fact that everyone keeps saying that he can't win, because everyone keeps saying that he can't win. It's really amazing how much progress that he's making, and at how fast he's closing the gap, given the fact that even his own supporters are trying to convince everyone that he won't win.  Let the guy win.    It's not going to happen.  Unless it does.    Shouldn't Clinton be answering those instead of blacking out the media.  I love that that's always his response, too. "I'll let her state her position on that." Every single time.  He could easily smear or attack her. He doesn't. "Ask her, don't ask me".  Please elect this man. We need him.   Dude directly and succinctly answers every single question that doesn't involve smearing his opponent.  [berniesanders.com](http://www.berniesanders.com), let's get this guy elected!   Politicians who are consistent to and clearly state their beliefs make me cringe, too. It's especially cringeworthy when they directly and succinctly answer every question that doesn't involve smearing their opponent.  Good call.   I think that this is a good suggestion. I also think that the card would be just fine as is for 7 mana.   The article refers to homicides, not gun deaths.   Just call and ask.   I don't know. I think a minimum wage with basic income is kind of redundant, as well as unnecessary. If people no longer have to work to survive, they can be more selective, and a market-driven fair price should surface.  In theory, anyway.   My first thought, too. Even taking the fact that the child was shot out of the equation, I'm willing to bet that the circumstances under which the dog was shot at would have been enough to land a civilian in jail.  We really need to stop this "shoot first, ask questions later" approach to law enforcement (which this wasn't even).   Thank you!   Oh man, an entire realm to test Tyrael's trait (which they're surely not going to go another patch without addressing)? That's great! It must be big. Big and not requiring Tyrael to die to use it.  Assumptions!   Mind ELI5'ing SB5 and how we told him to shove it up his ass?   I've always wondered about this as well. You'd think they'd be against a frivolous law that arbitrarily increases the number of criminals and arrests (and thus potentially violent confrontations). You'd also think that the decrease in alcohol consumption would be appealing to them, since drunk people tend to be a lot more out of control than high people (who are generally mellow and happy).   We really need to start calling him "The Sand Viper".   /r/gogopgo   His last name is **Sand**ers...   Great (and amusing) write-up. I agree with just about everything, especially this:  it's a shit trait with shit mechanics that rewards shit play and should be shitkicked into a shitpile located...  this:  I would like to see the persistent range check removed. If I am in range to start it up, barring a hearth it should go off.  and this:  TL;DR I love Tyrael. Let me love him more.   The only thing that I disagree with is that I typically take Angelic Absorption at 13. Am I missing out here?   The decriminalization measure, which cleared the House earlier this month, passed despite significant opposition from police groups and Republicans.  The party of small government, free markets, and personal liberty at work again.   The decriminalization measure, which cleared the House earlier this month, passed despite significant opposition from police groups and Republicans.  The party of small government, free markets, and personal liberty at work again.   It seems I have officially passed the Turing Test.   That's different from what OP experienced. Rage guy was upset that OP picked Azmodan period. Not because of some counter or comp issue.   Yeah, but usually if your tank is down it doesn't matter much. You'd be much better off if your tank had a trait that helped keep him alive.   Just sharing things where appropriate.   I think we can expand this:  If you lost a game when you were on a team with an Azmo, it's typically not because you had an Azmo.  To something a little more broad:  If you think you lost a game because you were on a team with a specific hero, it's typically not because of you were on a team with that hero. It's more likely that you're just bad.   Depends on the sub, but regardless, it's generally a good practice. I try not to editorialize my titles.   This. I main Tyrael and 95% of the games that I play it does absolutely nothing, and the remaining 5% of the time it almost never results in an actual kill or significant impact on a fight. It's just terrible.  I suppose I could die more often to get more mileage out of it, but I'd rather they just give him an actual, useful trait.   That's the article's title...   It's not even Christianity. It's a couple lines in the old testament.  100% guarantee Jesus would support gay rights today. He was incredibly liberal and accepting, based on everything that he says in The Bible. He'd be pretty appalled that ignorant and intolerant people use His name to discriminate against others.  I really don't get why the right is considered the party of Christianity, other than the fact that they try and legislate out of the bible (the limited parts of it that they key in on). Their platform of greed, intolerance, judgement, and hate is pretty counter to everything that Jesus said and stood for.   /r/gogopgo   The US has over 300,000,000 people. At 3 per 100,00, that's over 9,000 firearm homicides per year. Not 90.   What?    the us population is higher than all of the other countries listed  The statistics shown are per 100,000 people.   Sad. She's in my top 5 of wanted heroes.   /r/gogopgo   I wonder how many are human...   I was actually just joking. Vikings in SC2 are a counter to colossi.   I love this game, but this just one of *many* UI/UX no-brainers that need resolving.   Tyrael's charger looks cool, but I wish it were a little more sleek. It's kinda... round.   Leoric's master skin looks better than most. Like most master skins, I don't think it looks better than his default skin, but it also doesn't look stupid like most of the master skins.   I love the idea of a Colossus specialist! They were my favorite unit in SC2. Really powerful, but very fragile.  The Vikings should deal bonus damage to him.   The Vikings are an example of Blizzard looking beyond the cross-promotional benefits of releasing heroes from actively marketed games, so I think that D2 heroes are a real possibility.    Actually, I'd legit love for Heroes of the Storm to bring in characters from other companies games. Get Ryu from Street Fighter in there (he will be in ANYTHING, and would be easy to add, fireball, dragon punch, hurricane kick)  Sorry, but this would be horrible. Honestly, I think that's the worst part about Smash Brothers, and I would hate to see that happen to Heroes.   Sign me up!   I don't think things like Nova's Amazon skin precludes the possibility of an Amazon hero. Don't forget, Valla essentially has a Tyrael skin.    Republicans use religion when it's convenient.  FTFY   It is kind of ridiculous that since I own Jaina, if I buy the Jaina skin bundle, I'm effectively just buying the winter skin for more money than if I just bought it without the bundle.    They want it to be presented in better ways than just icons at the bottom of the screen which they feel wasn't good enough.  That makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is removing them until said better solution is in place. Even if they weren't ideal, the old icons were better than nothing.  That said, I'm sure there was a technical reason for doing so.   Couldn't agree more.    /r/gogopgo   /r/gogopgo   /r/gogopgo   /r/gogopgo   I meant starting with Johanna's release. I worded it poorly.    i wonder if we will get wizard as well  I really hope so. Would love to see alternative Diablo heroes as well, such as a male frenzy barb.   Right? He looks absolutely amazing. That's a 15k hero right there.   One of the things that I love about this game is that the supports can still do considerable damage.   Johanna's super fun, and Leoric looks amazing. Excited to see what comes up the monk, as well.   [Or is it...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HMeW2hg6Hc)   He tweeted 4 hours ago, so yeah, seems so.   This is my concern as well. Someone doesn't show up to goblins and it leads to resentment.   Is he gone?   I think this might be an idea to address that.   I think you might have missed the point.   /r/gogopgo   Johanna. I meant a span of 9 weeks, starting with her.   No, it's a known issue.   I main Tyrael, so I use Judgement a lot (often unsuccessfully).   Auriel and Malthiel are at the top of my list of wants.   Pylo!   No argument here! A ranged warrior sounds awesome.    Crossing my fingers for a Starcraft themed map and heroes.  Yeah, thought about saying something like that in my post, but didn't want to push our luck :P. I think the Diablo characters are the coolest and most interesting, but Starcraft is definitely my favorite of the three universes, and I'd love to see more protoss and zerg enter the mix, especially a zealot.   We also need to get our people to stop saying "he can't win, don't bother". I think that's his biggest obstacle.   I just think if I use the ability within range, it should fire The way it is now it seems like this is the flow:  1. Check if target is in range. 2. Dismount, stop moving, and say "Embrace Judgement". 3. Check if target is in range. 4. Fire.  If the target was in range when I cast it, the ability should fire. Otherwise, the ability's max range is effectively lower than it appears. It sucks having to get closer than max range to actually use the ability.  Really the other issue is the bigger one, though. Countless times (including twice yesterday) I'll click on one enemy and Tyrael will charge another. Drives me nuts, especially because it's often a full health warrior that gets hit instead of the 10% health assassin that I clicked on.  EDIT: Also, your username is cool and very Rehgarish.   Thanks. Missed that.   Don't forget gang violence and cartel activities (trafficking other drugs, guns, people, etc.). Certainly helps fund those things as well.   Probably has something to do with the site's metadata.   The evidence suggests both.   Thank you for doing this.   I sure hope so. Auriel is towards the top of my list of heroes that I want to see. Really member any of the angiris council would be awesome.    It would decrease the afkers at map start thats for sure :)  No more loading screen redditing for this guy!    Reddit is VERY far left of America as whole,  That may be (at least partially) true, but something to consider is that America is also significantly more liberal than the government, due to the fact that old people vote and young people don't.   I don't see a priest buff. What am I missing?   Tyrael.   Judgement is very buggy. It often hits the wrong target, and if you use it at max range and the enemy moves even slightly farther away, it misfires.   That's a conservative estimate. I was thinking at least 15.   /r/gogopgo   /r/gogopgo   If you don't want to see articles about US politics, you might not want to hang out in /r/uspolitics.   That's some solid analysis right there.    The taxes are on cigarettes and sales which everyone, rich or poor, will have to pay. The progressive writer who produced this garbage of course will conclude it as an assault against the poor.  You really don't see how a tax like that has a greater impact on the poor?   That is a [systemic problem \(video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD).   This shouldn't even be allowed. I think a lot more discussion would take place about hero selection if people weren't afraid of prejudice due to rank.   Bah. I always do that. Thanks for the heads up.   I like this change.   Think about how much time, money, gas, and road wear this will save over the years.   /r/gogopgo   [Here's a link to the graphic itself.](https://i0.wp.com/boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/rent-by-state.jpg?w=625) It's readable if you zoom in a few times (CTRL+Mouse wheel up, at least in Chrome).   Think about how much time, money, gas, and road wear this will save over the years.   That's like 5 BM's:  1. "Sorry" 2. Frostshocks own minion. 3. "Sorry" 4. "Sorry" 5. Makes opponent wait before finishing him.  Used to have respect for Ratsmah. That kind of took a hit here, and I was definitely hoping he would end up losing due to his dickery.    update with what I learn.  Please do. Would love to hear.   I know. Wish I could do something about that :(   Not sure about that. I don't think the text changed at all (correct me if I'm wrong). It just had a limited number of demons that it could summon, and now it can summon practically all of them. I would say that that's the original functionality and intention of the card.   I wouldn't call that a buff. It was more like a fix.   If you hate Tyrael, the game is doing you a favor. He's amazing, but requires some practice and a very solid understanding of the game. Give him a shot!   In order:  * Sky Temple * Dragonshire * Tomb of the Spider Queen * Blackheart's Bay * Cursed Hollow * Haunted Mines * Garden of Terror  Love the first 3, hate the bottom 2.   Yeah, but with nova's amazing wave clear and structure damage, she should be able to clear out the fort before the tribute even spawns.   I meant it's not going to disincentive people from working. Nobody is going to consider that enough.   Supports yes. Healers, not necessary.    There will fewer options because people at the bottom won't challenge the people above them.  This is the part that I really disagree with. $12,000 per year isn't going to disincentive anyone. Nobody's ambition ends with "not starving". I really think you'll see a large productivity increase, because people will be doing the work that they choose, not that they need to survive.  Really, though, at the end of the day, the most compelling reason for basic income is the fact that automation and efficiency are crushing jobs, and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate. They're going to increase the already growing wealth gap, and we're simply not going to have enough jobs for people. Moreover, with 99% of all new wealth headed straight to the 1%, we're going to find that it would be in everyone's best interest (the ultra rich included) for that money to circulate, rather than to accumulate. Basic income solves both of those problems.   As a heroes player, well done!  As a Tyrael main, fuck you.   Drives me crazy when a tribute is announced near the bottom, and top lane sits there for 30 seconds and THEN comes down. Even if you get there exactly as the fight starts (which is unlikely), you've put your team at a significant disadvantage, as the enemy has had the chance to position themselves favorably. Chances are, though, if you're coming that late that at least one of your teammates will be dead by the time you get there.  Be where the fight is, and please, get there early.    Of course it's your fault when he dies.  Every time.    So now the government is paying for people to be with their families?  The government is guaranteeing that, no matter the circumstances, every one of its citizens has enough to ensure their basic needs of survival. How they choose to spend their extra time is up to them. For 99.99999%, this will undoubtedly be working. They'll simply have more options as to what that means.   Almost nobody would stop working. Many would do different things, but very few people would be content to live on $12,000 per year. The poor, especially, would continue working, as they've got more incentive to do so (since they're, well, poor).  Personally i expect Americans to just pocket the money and make more money.  Yup. That's the idea. Though with the added buffer and safety net, they're be more likely to seek out work that they enjoy or are more suited towards. Some might even drop down to part time to spend more time on their families, or doing things that they find valuable, but might not be all that profitable (charity, art, community development, etc.).  	200

 I second the whiskey thing. Just don't be cheap with it. I HATE cheap financially and cheap tasting whiskey.   I mega-loathe this. I'm always thinking or quietly saying "Parking spaces are for cars you incompetent asshole! Quit fucking leaving your carts in parking spaces. Lazy fucking pricks. There are cart returns just about every few spots. Stop being dicks." I hate those people.   Yes on the first one. No Aaron Paul for me please.   Breaking Bad. Well just for Skyler.   Yes. Poor me :'(  Financially, I'm poor. Edit: my name is John   Married here. You've got a lot right. Except you have all of it wrong. Well we fight. Who doesn't enjoy a good storm off? Seriously though. We try like crazy for her to get pregnant but with no luck. Well there is luck... bad luck.   Having the use of a crazy old guy and some punk kid's time machine to bring a sports almanac back to myself and make a fortune from betting on sports.   I have sleep paralysis almost every night. Sometimes it includes a demon of sorts and sometimes it's just the paralysis. There's been times where it's a guy that's about as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the eighties. He usually hides in the corner of the room dry humping a bed that only exists with him. He wears a hat like a drill sergeant. Other times it's an evil presence without any shadow or physical appearance. The evil presence is always accompanied by a feeling of something weighing me down like pressure on my chest. There's been times where it's a shadow that whispers my name. I end up asking my wife if it was her though really I know what it was. When this happens I watch comedy on Netflix to clear my mind and get back to sleep. I discovered new (to me) comedians like John Pinette with this method.  I'm not sure if it's related to sleep paralysis, but I have dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis like symptoms at the end of a dream. Such dreams involve me living life as usual and suddenly I'm transported to a different place. This place is usually a desert and it's usually dark. I can only see about a five foot radius around myself and everything else is pitch black but not like night black but sharpie marker black. I just start floating around and of course I find it fun... at first. Then I float to this area that has like prison bars behind me. I can't control the floating anymore and it's creepy. I then hear a little kid's voice whispering and screaming all at once. The kid is whisper screaming "help me, please!" "Please help!" I turn around and behind the bars is a little kid, terrified. The kid's eyes are just eye sockets and blood drips down from the sockets. I scream a very high pitched scream that can be heard in the waking world. It's a scream I can not mimic while awake. Before my wife wakes me up, I'm paralysed the same as when I have a more standard sleep paralysis episode.   Fuck! I now have more shit to worry about visiting me.    I have sleep paralysis almost every night. If this image came to me, then I would just die. Fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck it. Nope nope nope nope nope nope.   I've thought about this. I would have a two bedroom apartment what with the extra money. The food and what not wouldn't be a problem refer to extra money above. With two jobs a piece, no time to hate one another. Outside of work I'm usually with my wife somewhere outside of the house anyway. Plus it's just a fun thought.   Get a 100% clone of myself so I can work two jobs and so can my clone. No more money problems. Since I don't spend very much money, I'd have a lot saved.   I just let them go. If you don't like it, too bad. I pass people everyday that do far worse than something that occurs naturally such as farting.   I have man's jeans (I don't mean those bs skinny jeans either) and my pockets suck ass.   Seconded   Or why they're traumatized when seeing a deer carcass being skinned in the front lawn.   I'll sound like a noobbut I don't care. How to properly delete a Facebook account?   I take this to be a breaking bad reference. I may be wrong.   If I could change things. I'd change how a lot of stuff happened. I definitely wouldn't be so stupid to lose my job.   Hopefully 2014 will have less government shut downs than 2013.   I haven't read all the comments on this, but I think I'm the only one or at least one of the only ones who understood the reference.   Makes plenty sense to me   I recognized the reference right away. I have watched that movie so many times. Just watched it again last night.   I was ranting in traffic about this. Most people can use a blinker without even taking their hands of the wheel. It takes very little effort. Stop being so damn lazy!   I put my foot down. I go away from the light as swiftly as possible. Passengers in my car tell me to slow down like I'm in the wrong.   I hate this with a passion. If you wanted to be in the outside lane, you should have been in the proper FUCKING LANE TO BEGIN WITH! Fucking assholes!   I know someone who does this. He justifies it with "if I just go, and there isn't a gap won't I get hit?" "Stopping instead of driving into traffic that's moving more than 70mph seems logical." Can anyone help me explain an alternative?   My carrier has a plan that lets you pay $20/month I believe and you get 250 calling minutes and unlimited text/picture messages. If the calls are made to and received from a phone on the same network or during nights and weekends, it doesn't count toward your minutes. Perfect for being contacted by potential employers.   It's not always someone who couldn't afford them from the start. Sometimes the parents could easily afford having kids and have no trouble doing so. It only takes one financial catastrophe to change the whole situation. I know people who financially had no issues supporting kids and had a financial crisis. Now they have welfare and food stamps. They aren't at fault for things out of their control. Not every family that is struggling to raise kids on poor income are at fault. Not to say that some people are just being irresponsible.   I do that a lot. Most of the timethey pass.   I know someone who bought the waxvac. It was only good at disappointing.   Try to get a savings account built up that consists of at least three months of bills (rent, utilities, cell phone, car insurance/note if necessary and any other bare necessity bills). This is important in case you lose your job. I was homeless for three months after I got laid off from my job. Took me by shock.    Don't be afraid to make your friends pay to stay if they plan to stay more than a month.   I had those before. Ate them in one sitting. No shame was felt.   Me too :-D   You monster! How could you say such vile things?   I went into the court house. We said "I do".   Lol that's what I meant.   I only do this if someone was halfway in my exhaust pipe Edit: and decide to pass me like I'm in the wrong for going the speed limit. Had to edit because I sent a partial message.   When I'm driving in front of you with my blinker on and you speed up to get in the turning lane at a red light. I was going to turn too asshat! Now I have to either get in the lane behind you and halfway stick out into the other lane or go straight through and turn around at the next opportunity. Fuck everyone who does this! The person driving in front of you has priority in this situation. You could wind up in my blind spot and then there is a wreck. Don't fucking do it! No no no no no. Fuck you! No.   My wife and I every time we go out.   I'm in the same boat. It sucks.   I fucking HATE that. I took it out on my way, it'll take you two seconds to replace it. FUCKING do it!   John Pinette's inner angry voice. "Get out of line!"   Omg hahaha! I have the same inner monologue. Did you get yours from monologue-Mart or is yours pre installed? I left the stock inner monologue installed.  Seriously though. I hate people like that. Don't go to Google.com the search bar does exactly that. It searches Google. Skip the middle man.   If anything I'm working on, cooking, using, etc drops. I can't stand to drop something. Even if it won't break or get ruined from dropping it. So much rage.   Yeah. Lincoln was still president then.   Internet exploder*   Leaving big tips at restaurants and other tipped wage earning places such as hotels. I usually tip no less than 50% or $30 whichever is greater. Makes me happy.   I used to pull the ink vessel from the makers and squeeze the colors into the glue. Stir with a tooth pick in random directions. Swirly.   Head phones? The way they're worn around here, I thought they were neck wear... Hmm.   I can't find the link and I used to have it on my phone. It's a black and white gif of a pug and this guy peaks around the wall and I think he says something to the dog and then leaves the scene. The dog then proceeds to freak out and cusses dude out. Edit: found the gif on my phone. It's not black and white. I don't know how to post as comment.   Just the other day, I was driving with some asshat behind me. The asshat was so close behind me, I think she was partially in my exhaust pipe. I was gonna make a left turn onto the street my apartment was on. I got in the turn lane to turn. She then proceeds to do the same thing but she got in front of me. I thought she was gonna continue to the nearby light. No. She was turning onto the same street as I was. I thought that she might be in a hurry, so I tried not to let it bother me. When she pulled into the parking lot of the apartments (she lives in the same community as I), I waited. She sat in her car for ten minutes. She wasn't in a hurry, she was just being an asshat. As soon as she was inside her apartment, I put a bunch of bologna and I poured my entire gallon of water on her car (it's cold enough out to freeze her car shut). When I went outside earlier, she was using an ice scraper to remove it all. Little round patches of missing paint and a very pissed off asshat. Don't fucking cut me off. It's probably the worst I've done to someone.   Where was this at? I ask because some time ago, this guy in front of me almost completely stopped and so did I. The guy behind me didn't and ran off the road. His car flipped and caught fire.   	54
 Aha. I see what you did there.   And in EnderIO you can upgrade your machines with new Capacitors as you go. You can also upgrade your armour and conduits.   Not sure what he's looking for in a point. Unless you've got a quest book, Minecraft is a game where you do whatever you want. It's sandbox for a reason. If he truly wanted a point, he could use HQM or play another game.  And it's not like TiC has more of a point than EIO.  What could have happened:  someone (~chatzilla@2001:558:6025:b:61a6:66e3:ae28:196a) has joined #TinkersConstruct  "I've made a Pickaxe. What am I supposed to make next?"  "Tell me there's something to make next. I will be severely disappointed if there isn't."  "I'm looking for progression or something to do other than 'hurr move dirt and stone around'"  "I'm looking for a goal or task that the mod wants me to perform."  "The mod has content with absolutely no direction or purpose on its own?"  It's a sandbox game. It's not meant to have a goal.   I always ask this :P   What's the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?   What's the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?   For the armour, it only blocks 90% of damage now, if you have the required blood. However, using Soul Harden, you can get it back to 100%. But it was buffed at the same time. Now it has more protection against Piercing and other negative effects like Wither.   /u/SatanGives ?  (/me hopes that's the right way to do it on Reddit)      This is my base on a slightly modified PhoenixCraft II. I think it's pretty good, but I need some help figuring out what to do. I give descriptions and stuff on the album's page. I'm usually not one for aesthetic builds, so this is a little new to me.      Not sure how up to date this is, but there's this: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/cofh-world-generation-users-manual.48678/   Sweet!   Everyone's favorite Blood Magic Dev [WayofTime](https://www.youtube.com/user/WayofFlowingTime) has been playing Bevo's Tech Pack for 1.7.10.   It's filling the internal buffer. If anyone were to use "I'm Looking at Blood" (an addon for WAILA), or take out the Vanilla Sigil of Sight, they'd see that it is filling the internal buffer.   The Internal Buffer itself holds 10% of the Altar's max capacity, so for a non-upgraded Blood Altar, it would drain about 1000 blood. Subsequent upgrades (E.X. Runes of Augmented Capacity) will increase that, and Runes of Dislocation will increase the speed at which it fills/empties.   This guy explained it well: http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2jnu9f/i_havent_played_minecraft_in_a_year_and_a_half/cldkhgj   I know how to use Lockdown, m8. But until the feature is added that allows for one to specify the spawn dimension, you can use PerfectSpawn to specify it.  As of right now, Lockdown and PerfectSpawn do different things, as Lockdown generates the same world, and PerfectSpawn specifies an exact spot for people to spawn at.   You can use PerfectSpawn for that   ...Blood Magic   Adding to this.

 Here's the thing, the giants are the big picture when it comes to getting to the Super Bowl.  We saw what happened this year, Harbs saw, we all saw it.  We need to get it down the field against them, no check downs, none of that.     This is gold.  Thank you   Trade him to the Chiefs for Eric Berry.  They need a qb, and we could use a corner   Blinded by the light   Every Alex lover is so quick to bring up stats to defend him its comical.  The fninshed product that was displayed today wasn't just today.  It's been brewing since training camp.  Harbs and the staff have been knowing this.  If you can't notice the difference of today's offense and Alex, I dunno what to tell you.    Urban Meyer made Tebow look dope in the same offense Alex was in..  Still in denial?     It's not based off data.  It's the flow of the game, the way the offense flows.  Of course because your so hung up on Alex, you're too blinded to see a difference.     I.E last year and this years giants game .   Yeah try telling your argument to harbaughs face and see what he says.  I know your mad, I would be too.  But these years sticking up for alexis is done.  Get with it. You think Harbs really meant it when he said smith was a pro bowl qb last year?  Fuck no.     Look we're all fans of the same team, but the Alexsexuals need to go.  The door is to the right, thanks for playing.   Game, set, match    Doesn't want the camera on him    No love for South Brooklyn pizza?      #2 is spot on.     Plus bars stay open til 4   I've found some basic ones on Medzilla, and Cafe Pharma, but thought it wouldn't hurt to ask Reddit.  Anything would help.   Black Friday contradicts everything Thanksgiving stands for.   Just one day before we teach our kids about being thankful for everything in your life, and thievery next day we turn into savage assholes.  Only in America    Yes indeed, and any kind of mention of kaep gets down voted quick style.      Brady.     At the end of it all, what's your confidence level in Alex taking us to a Super Bowl?  I'm not saying kaep is it. In no way have I suggested that.  However given the small window we have, the room for errors is smaller than before   That's why we as fans let it be.  Plain and simple.  They see something we don't    In order to win history says you need a viable qb.  That's a fact.  Now whether or not Alex is that guy is not up To us.  But from what I've seen, kaep has done it more than Alex has in his given time. Whether he can do it for more than 2 years up is remained to be seem, but you can argue that there is a qb debate .  Like it or not    Name a Super Bowl winning qb other than Dilfer that has played it safe like Alex has.  There is none.  And the year after the Ravens won, they cut his ass.  Now, while i think Alex is better than Trent, why is there even mention of a qb controversey?  If Alex was doing what he's supposed to be doing, why is there talk of kaep?   At the end, the goal is to win a Superbowl.  And right now, what's standing between us and a Superbowl is a QB IMO.  My point of "pulling the trigger" means that we push the ball and make plays.  Not go for the safe read that Alex does over and over.    I never mentioned once about entertainment in my post.  I'm saying Kaep is making plays, and is doing so in ways I haven't seen Alex do in the last 7 years.     I've been watching the games.  What I didn't emphasize in my post (which I should have) is that in 1 game, we saw Kaep pull the trigger more times than I've seen Alex.    You provided proof in your post with plays he did, but in all honesty you're bringing up 2 plays from 2 different games.  .  I know it's only been 1 game with Kaep, but again he's not shy and he's pulling the trigger on plays.  The game you mentioned 80 yd bomb with Ted Ginn, Alex also missed a wide open Delanie Walker post 1st play of the game.   And that's where I notice the contrast of QB's.  Alex is safe, cerebral, will not push it down field.  Kaep makes plays with his feet, often improvising which results in bigger plays.     Exactly this.  Not once have I ever seen Alex try and throw the 20 yard out pattern towards the sidelines.  Or go for the bomb.  If you watch the replay again, kaep does exactly that on the initial drive.    Alex might have the "cerebral" aspect of the game, but kaep makes plays period.  Kaep has "it".  Alex, not as much    You got the cool ranch dorritos to top it off as well.     you made an asian sandwich, wouldn't call it banh mi    My gf wanted to go to his sushi/mex resto in Sacramento.  Reluctantly I agreed, easily the worst decision I ever made    I saw this post on Facebook earlier.  It said later nypd tried to wash away the body and evidence.     Getting married to my wife.  Shaking hands and meeting the Dalai Lama.     My friends were denied going into a club in Korea because of age.  Mind you, they're in their 30's.  And both were Korean   really appreciate this.  living in the east coast, i rarely get to watch highlights this long.     World travelers leaving stuff behind for the next traveler.  Sorta like a on going gift giving thing.  Leave something behind for the next person as well   I made it from Williamsburg to midtown in 12 minutes by carpool.  Once you get past the cops checking cars for 3 passengers, the freeways are relatively normal.  Getting to the on ramp is a pain   My personal hell which I have to deal with 2-3x a week.  Cubicle worker next to me clips her nails, clears her throat constantly, coughs, and talks on the phone while eating.  All 3 drive me bat shit   Incorrect.  Sushi rice has vinegar, sugar.  Onigiri is plain steamed japanese rice which can have flavors such as furikake, salt, kombu etc, but never vinegar.  Onigiri is onigiri.     So you know, sushi rice and onigiri are 2 different types of rice.     Stephen A is fuckin annoying, and it's clear ESPN loves and encourages his antics.  But what's annoying is he never played the game, he's a analyst.  If he were an ex player, even at the college lever I'd give him some respect.     Squirrel Master   Friend was the CEO   I'm always wondering how these NFL guys are wearing beats during pre game warmups.  Makes no sense whatsoever trying to run full speed with shitty headphones all.    And they should know for the kind of money they're making, they could get amazing wireless ones.     A piece of advice a friend gave to me when I moved out here 3 years ago.  He said, "whatever effort you put into this city, whether it's meeting new people, going to events, etc..It comes back to you 10x"    I took his advice to heart, and really pushed the boundaries.  To summarize, I met a amazing woman and got married last year.  As for my friend (the one with the advice), he came to NY with less than 1K in his bank account and minimal experience as a stylist.  He know styles hair for all the major fashion shoots, is known and respected internationally.    Come out here and live the life you've wanted.  Go get it!     Glad to know the baby is doing better.  I know this might sound weird, but if Reddit is still around 20 years from now, I'd love to see the baby do AMA.  Your style of telling his story is quite interesting, and although it's sad, would love to know down the road how he turns out.     So often do you guys have sex in the kitchen?     and what? born n raised in cali as well.  you're talking a minute section of bushwick that has mexican immigrants, compared to cali where the influence is everywhere.     If it's martial arts poses, it goes like "Wah!!! Wata!!"     4-1 odds they still aren't legit like Cali.  NYC just can't do Mexi food for some reason or another   Because white people are the majority, they do what the fuck they please.  British and Aussie are still derivatives from the English language.  But the moment you take something foreign and "weird" sounding, and voila you get mocking/mimicking.   For the record I'm asian, and have witnessed this shit everywhere.  People still do "ching chong", this and that, thinking it's funny.     They killed her because they wanted bike parts?     Bingo.  There's a bunch of east bay folks that are pro Niner/A's.     I find some of this hard to believe.  You really had no clue, no red flags, not even a inkling of a doubt before you got married?  As much as you're getting hurt here, you gotta look at yourself and ask how did you get  here?  Shit like this doesn't happen overnight.  What led to this, and why couldn't you see this happen earlier?  Man up, divorce and get to the root of you.  Both of you guys fucked up on this one.   I don't really follow college too much, but who are some good players coming out this that we can draft?  We need a DB/CB, and prob some DE's as well.     Lugers was good, but it wasn't mind blowing.  Keane's is pretty damn good     the one and only time ill fork over 30$ for a burger.    I sat next to someone the other day who ate that.  They said Minetta Tavern is hands down their favorite steak house, better than Peter Lugers, or Keanes.     Why is this in WTF?  has no bearing.     I'll be curious as to how far they went to duplicate this burger.  All the elements have to be in order, the right cheese, sauce, etc...Even Brit mayo is different than over here   This bitch had some annoying facial expressions   To further add on to this....There has to be a new generation of "Niner bandwagoners" out there that are clueless/classless.  I say this because growing up in the 80's and 90's, we were known as a 1st class organization with the best fans.  Fans would never accuse a player of giving away game plans.    It's the same shit about the stabbings and fights going down in the parking lot these days.  To a certain point, we as fans represent the team.     It wasn't a overnight decision, but a gradual one.  It was almost as if each smoke was getting less and less enjoyable to the point where it wasn't feeling as good as it did before.    That combined with getting a nasty nasty flu which made me quit cold turkey.  So in the end, it was a culmination of the above.  I wasn't one of those people who tried quitting on numerous occassions.  1x and thats it.  Probably because I knew how easy it would be to start again   The bun looks off, not in and outish   There will always be Alex haters, and games like the one on Sunday will just put him under the microscope more.  I will say this, he has all the necessary resources for him now which means he has to deliver.  If not, you can bet everyone will be calling for Kaep next year.     Try it with chocolate milk instead of Baileys next time.  Choc mint schnapps   Dallas is pretty shitty BBQ.  Take him to Dinosaur.     Our pass rush is nowhere near as lethal as last year.  One of the reasons we can let the secondary be loose was because we pressured the qb so much that he would make hasty decisions.     Well..did you or did you not buy the cuff links?   Ill grab the popcorn   Fuck that!  Any girl that tries to dis your moment with your mom is pretty inconsiderate and rude.  Tell her she needs to respect that shit, or get out.     funny how many variations came out after Albertos.  I've seen Albiertos, Jilbertos, Alberos,    The hot sauce makes it buffalo?  dont get it   Biden: You wanna dance?     Would u happen to remember the name do the NYC restaurant?   I'm glad you addressed this.  I'm seeing similar stuff happen on r/videos.  Esp the top video being reposted hours later. Sometimes even the next day.     Hey bitch, it's fags like you that are ruining Reddit.  People are onto your pathetic attempts.  Congratulations, you've discovered the internet.  Now go back to your mom's basement, piss the fuck off.     I was thinking pork shoulder as well, doing carnitas tacos.  Pretty filling, and tasty, plus it puts a theme on the diner.     My counterpoint.  Lived in the hood before, have hood friends, have done hood shit.  None of that shit scares me.  What does scare me is folks like you. Reasons why below  You're general stereotype reasoning of "pencil thin mustache, earrings, little thug lingo"  shows me just how fucking unintelligent and ignorant you are.  Which gives me enough reason to understand, that you don't know what it's like to be on other side. You'll never know.  Most of us on here are fortunate enough not to.  But it's views like yours that exist and to know you could be in a higher position than the kid in the video and therefore use your reasoning and judge the kid negatively  In your case, your broad based assumptions, along with your narrow sighted views are what enrage me, and will lead me to call you out on your BS.  The cops have no right treating anyone like that.  The kid should suffer and get harrassed because of another person with the same background committed a crime?  Your god damn right you go no problem with what the cops did, because you'll never fuckin get it.     This isn't 20 questions, and clearly you're new to Reddit.  You boldly make points in your post claiming the real victims are those who live in neighborhoods.  I can tell you straight up my friends that live in the hood, have pride. They don't consider themselves anything, nonetheless victims. You're making a assumption.    This topic is all about the kid, and how he is perceived.  You said he walks and talks like a thug.  What's your basis?  This debate is about how you should explain yourself.  B/C if you truly think this kid is what a thug embodies both external and internal experience, you would be terrified thinking every single male youth in the inner city is a thug.  I disagree with every point you bring, not because of you.  Because there is no validity.  You're trying to sink this argument down to something else.  So, care to explain more?     I'm asking you to further explain yourself.  Simple as that.  Can you do that?     Whats your basis for what a thug walks and talks like?  boyz n the hood?  Walking around bushwick late at night observing hooligans?  Truly would like to know   Thanks!    totto is only chicken based, so if you're looking for tonkotsu, i suggest hiden chan only bc the wait at ippudo is rididuclous   how is jin ramen?  out of all the ramen joints in nyc, which one you prefer?  to me it's a toss up b/w hide chan, and totto.     It's funny, but every so often YouTube commentators are pretty damn funny. 95% however are teenage trolls.   word appreciate it    I don't trust cops.  I also have a hard time trusting people in general.  But I will say, even if my life was in danger, I still wouldn't rely on NYPD.  Been thru and seen enough interactions to know that it's pointless to approach em.     Just look at his profile, it's lame repost attempts at almost everything.  Key words:  Redditor for 10 months   thanks this one got the best reviews on yelp.     It's OK, i was trying to get a cool pic from my wedding, but spaced out as well.  Next yr def   Happy cakeday!   Thanks!  I'll make sure to add it to the list   you rock    BTW, I work for NHF so if you have any other questions, call me at 212.328.3756.  Ask for Z =)   I have to be out in Orlando for work in Nov, and I'm desperately trying to avoid the Disney/Universal area.  Any recs for spots that play good house with good dancers, and not a pretentious crowd?     Ah Thats kinda weak, esp since food truck burgers are kinda hard to mess up.  Nothing nastier than walking into a restaurant and looking at a mediocre menu and knowing you have shitty options   Hi there, you need to go to a qualified HTC.  Here is a list of places in the Florida area.   http://www.hemophiliaflorida.org/index.php/resources/treatment-centers  As for the mailing list, please call 1-800-42-HANDI to be on NHF's mailing list.  Also, depending on where you live, hit up your local chapter.  Let me know how it goes   Yessir!  Gotta try grouper ceviche, sounds amazing.  My fav is to rub with vegetable oil, and salt.  400 degree oven for 10-15, grate some daikon and eat with soy sauce.  Kama at its best.     What you know about the collarbone?     16 is still better than a restaurant, esp you're getting a quality burger    There's very few rookies that came into the NFL and make immediate impact.  On a team that's stacked like ours, why risk mistake/injury?  AJ and LMJ will get on the field sometime this season, but don't expect much.     No way we do, and I was a Alex hater up till last year.  I've already accepted the fact Alex is not gonna be the proto typical QB we've been accustomed to.  But Kaep is still a year away easy.  Alex has mastered this playbook already, knows the in's and out's.     The train ride over to the stadium was majority Niners.  I was actually a little nervous before kickoff that some guido Jets fan would try to start shit, but there was red jerseys everywhere.  In other words, backup.     Friend of mine in HS thought it was P.M Dawn "Die without shoes"  Its die without you   Sec 338 row 15   Yo!  Same here.  I'm rockin the red Montana.  Pre-game beers in the parking lot?     I'm so f'n pumped, going to the game this Suday!  Sorry just wanted to share that with ya'll.  Let's go Niners.     I also think having Ginn's absence makes a big difference in field position.  Especially those extra 5-10 yards on punts/kickoffs for starting field position   I believe this, these toilets are found in japan although not as much as before.  At first I thought it was the weirdest thing, but after I got used to em, it was [easy](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1 hl=en safe=off sa=N biw=1152 bih=773 tbm=isch tbnid=0_mheoUz1XAjwM: imgrefurl=http://thejapanesepage.com/culture/toilets.htm docid=d4-BJcIDo5yWNM imgurl=http://thejapanesepage.com/gif/benjo.jpg w=404 h=384 ei=Qw9jUKWSLsXU0gHxr4C4Dw zoom=1 iact=rc dur=3 sig=101641834725119472669 page=1 tbnh=118 tbnw=128 start=0 ndsp=25 ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:136 tx=58 ty=51)   Different tastes for different folks, but you're grilling asian food here.  kinda doubt cheese is gonna jive well with korean bbq   It's his office #, public info.  Not a cell   Hey folks, was curious who all was planning on attending the meeting.  Possible Reddit/Hemophilia meetup?     I think most of us would love to see that happen, but WCO (west coast offense) is a combo of short timing patterns and power runs which ultimately open up the deep ball.  At the end of the day, I just don't think it's in Alex to chuck it up there.  I for one would love to see a jump ball to Randy Moss.     If you ever make it out to NYC, first round is on me.  Welcome to the beginning of the rest of your life.  Shoot, your post inspired to me to live better  	113

 There's nothing to do but go all out now.  Upload the audio files, dig deeper,  because you're fucked anyway.   **Defying Gravity** because when I hit the notes I feel like a princess and when I don't it's still a hell of a lot of fun.   **Chandelier** channels my inner shower goddess.   **La Vie en Rose** because it's absolutely gorgeous.   **I Won't Say I'm in Love** because it's my favourite Disney song.   **Bang Bang** and **Drunk in Love** because there's so much room to mess around.   Sidney Crosby - 9508  Thanks !   No problem dude, stay safe!   It might not be smart to keep the file and its contents in your home.  As the investigation progresses they will almost certainly search your property. You're going to have to find a secure place to hide it.   I would absolutely love to collab with you, female vocalist btw. I rather sing over tracks with lyrics already written, but I'm also open to collaborating with lyrics. :)   I'll see what I can do :)   Do you want us to devise lyrics as well? Or do you have some planned?  Female vocalists here btw    I may not sound exactly like Taylor Swift, but you can try me?   	9
 these pics are 5-8 years old.  I wonder what she looks like now?   The NSA data and "network deconstruction" was used to take out the Occupy Leadership, by preemptively detaining protest leaders, shutting down mass movement.  Read https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Document:The_Moral_Decoding_of_9-11#Unravelling_the_Supreme_Moral_Doctrine_behind_the_U.S._Covert_State   was this from /r/nosleep ?   fuck stupid posts like this I don't fucking care about reddit or the fucking owners of reddit or who got banned or shadow banned or any of that nonsense.  I've had 3 accounts on reddit get banned over the last 8 years, all for bullshit comments or posts...none of it is real and nothing is important.   with fake tits...fake nose, fake eyes, fake ears, fake chin...   Do you have evidence of payment?     I never really got into the comments or discussion except here on /r/conspiracy and /r/korea my two favorite subreddits.  The reason for that is it's so anonymous.  Nobody knows if you're a shill or a real person.  Now there are tools to check your reddit stream and get a sense of whether you are real or not.  I use that service before commenting.  Mostly I share posts that are interesting to me, my comments lately have been mostly negative.  And I don't give a shit about karma.  Downvote me all you want...karma is useless IRL   mintpressnews.com is down   ah, no I went back and fixed it   what's the app?  nvm, it's called xora.   What did the manager say?

True, but site-wide admins can ban subreddit mods if they don't like them and there's nothing you can do about it.  Happened to me.   so where do you think we should go?   In w.

Is there some sort of screw on the side there?  Also, that nut looks pretty worn.  My advice is to take it to a luthier   oh, like what /b/ does to reddit, tumblr?   It's probably the machine heads slipping.  You can take a screwdriver and tighten them.  That should solve the problem   You know it's just an ajusshi feeling old and worthless   My youngest son and his wife live in Ashland, which is the next town over.         What is "brigading"?

You sold a shitbag product and now you come on reddit to threaten you will "escalate"?  Fuck off and die you piece of shit.

The pick did take me many years to learn.  My advice is to practice a variety of picking patterns with scales.  Also the Kreutzer violin etudes are very helpful for learning how to pick.   Rogue hands down.  Amazon.com often has it at $45 and free shipping with a prime membership   Yeah, unlike a violin which has a bass bar under the G string, most cheap mandolins are made without any additional tone bars, so converting it for left handed use should be no problem.   It's worth taking it to a mandolin shop/luthier.  If it is a Vega (Boston) or Gibson, you may have a collector's item worth something   Nice how they suggest Gordon ["30% Is Lies"](https://archive.org/details/GordonDuff.FalseInformationControversy) Duff is a reputable reference.   she has a pretty face.

 By all means, lets hang the dude before the facts are heard. Trial by media, amirite?   I agree, they are probably wrecked by high heels.    She hides he colosotomy and/or adult diaper well inside the fins. What some men forget that some cute paraplegic girls are totally incontinent,  so it stinks extra nice when you are going in for a piece of that sweet wheelchair meat.

One can only hope.      Its funny how women feel attractive in high heels yet they utterly destroy the feet. As a man I find it very unattractive when a woman is constantly in heels.

I've never been able to establish a concrete reason why people don't like her, she is a very nice and attractive person. I also have the same problem with making friends. So...our solution is just fucking our brains out and giving the middle finger to the world. Fuck it all and have sex. Forced friends will invariably let you down in some way, and in a way you almost set yourself up for failure, I think, by scrutinizing things too closely. Another suggestion from me would be to put yourself in a place you would not normally be, get out of your comfort zone. Good luck!     Yay another app that reads my texts.

I think she gets most of her info from "blog mom" websites   This is partially true. My ex is so fundie now she won't have sex with another person until she is married again. She brags about this to me, when I mention that she seems lonely because she just loves to waste time texting and calling me, she tells me that all men are losers not worthy of her blah blah blah, in the meantime my kids get to witness what a wonderful example she is.   Yeah to too late for that.  But honestly I had no idea she was capable of these levels of fundie when we were married   Lol. It's a subreddit... not an admission of anything!

Maybe they have taken it upon themselves to be hated so everyone else can love each other. Just another thought.    Personally I feel they are a pro-lgbt and pro-human rights group in "disguise." They announce ahead of time where they are going to protest. Almost every time they are mentioned in the news it is also mentioned that the community came together to form a human wall or something to stop them. And they just stand out there smiling holding their signs, then pack up and leave without hurting anybody. I feel their message is in fact not "God Hates Fags" or anything along that line. I think their message is more about the community coming together in harmony and they have found a way to do it consistently. Just a thought.          Yes that's my second favorite.

 Go look up "honorific."   Winds tend to take buildings apart from the top down.   Only a few degrees allow one to practice medicine, meaning they can diagnose diseases and prescribe medication. M.D., D.O., dentists, podiatrists, and I think optometrists all qualify. A Ph.D. bestows the honorific "doctor," but you can't do medical things. Psychotherapy isn't medical practice, and many therapists have Ph.D.s. But most Ph.D.s don't care to be called "doctor" except in certain professional settings where the credential is socially valuable.   Your mom.   Orthography and etymology do matter in making distinctions; words that took different paths to the same pronunciation are not automatically the "same word," and definitely not if their spelling differs, as in this case. There's an argument that rake/rake are different words because of their histories as well as meanings, with ho/hoe the difference is much clearer.   No opinion on the stuff you've dug up 'cause I know nothing about architecture, but I was at UT for two years before someone pointed out that PCL is also (on purpose) roughly the shape of Texas.

I read *Prisoner of Trebekistan* by Bob Harris, a 5-day winner, along with a lot of his blogging, and he's just fascinated with everything under the sun in a childlike, omigosh-look-at-this way that's both endearing and inspiring. Ken Jennings seems the same way to me.   Different spellings = no credit. IMHO anyway.   Reminds me of a too-high-atop-the-pizza-parlor story. This is secondhand, but I have no reason to doubt it. When I was an assistant manager at a Pizza Hut, back when they all had those peaked red roofs, the story went around of a manager of one of the busiest PHs in the city who had decided that the attic space under the roof was the perfect place to go smoke weed after he got off work. It was summer, so it was pretty hot up there, and he stripped to his underwear.   Now, there's a reason they always told us never to store things in the attic space: The "floor" isn't designed to hold weight. The manager was walking around up there, when he suddenly crashed through the floor *into the dining area* which was full of people eating. He got up, ran out the door (still in his underwear), and was never heard from again.   Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:  * don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result. * don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.)  * only shave once; it's all that's needed.  It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.  Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure.   Shampoo and soap. I stopped using both above the neck a few years ago, and my skin and hair are both in great shape. I do shower every day, including rinsing my hair.  I'm way past my teen years, so I can't speak for the effects on acne. But I wish I'd known to try this back then.

 The usual limitations of studies in mice and how that applies to humans apply here as it was performed in mice (i.e. differences in metabolism/physiology, a cell therapy working in mice for 6 months doesn't mean it'll work for years in a human etc.). My guess is that the model of diabetes they used is questionable.  In this study they used a mice (SCID mice) that did not have a functioning immune system - which is commonly used when implanting human cells as they did here to prevent rejection. The problem this has is that the immune system plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes, so if this is done in a human the immune system **might** prevent any positive effects.   Another implication of using the SCID mice is that they had reduced circulating fatty acids in their blood and more fat deposition in the kidney and liver when fed a high-fat diet - this is not seen in humans and lipid induced resistance is thought to be a key cause of insulin resistance. It is possible that high levels of fatty acids in the blood will prevent this treatment from working in humans or the mechanisms by how this treatment work do not work to counteract the effect of lipid induced insulin resistance.  When fed a "western diet the SCID mice showed "a more mild phenotype in terms of obesity, fasting hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and leptin levels" than the high fat mice, which isn't seen in mice with a fully functioning immune system. The authors actually say that in comparison to traditional models of diabetes:  other mechanisms may be involved in the development of insulin resistance in this animal model.  It's unclear and impossible to predict how it will translate to humans. Despite differences to the traditional models, those models do not fully replicate human diabetes so perhaps it will be a better model (unlikely in my opinion).  The study helps give insight into what role the immune system may play in the development of type 2 diabetes and will guide future research efforts. Additionally, it's a proof of principle study as it has been shown recently that treating with high levels of insulin can help manage type 2 diabetes in people and this method of increasing insulin may help offset those limitations, technical challenges and unwanted side effects. For your question, it's really the first step toward a new treatment, it may not work, it could work amazingly but it's a new avenue to go down.   Children with Type 1 would benefit from this and is what Viacyte VC-01 treatment is targeted at and where they have started clinical trials:  http://viacyte.com/clinical/clinical-trials/  Type 1 diabetics don't produce insulin due to autoimmune-induced loss and dysfunction of beta cells. Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance - i.e. insulin is produced but glucose uptake from the blood is diminished/not as effective. Most research has focused on increasing/restoring insulin sensitivity with drugs and exercise and this enables the condition to be managed in many cases and disease progression to be slowed. However, over time and in more severe cases the beta cells start to not function as well (i.e. release less insulin) and start to die (decreasing insulin levels more). A couple of recent studies have shown that injecting high levels of insulin in type II diabetics can help manage the disease and improve the symptoms, like this one in patients:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18502299  In this study they showed that injecting beta cells alone helped improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerances in animals fed a high fat diet which is used to induce insulin resistance. However, the tissues which uptake glucose would still be less insulin sensitive than healthy tissues so they tested the effect of combined cell therapy and traditional drug therapy. When they added drugs that improve insulin sensitivity in those tissues (i.e. normal drug treatments for type 2 patients) they found that the cell transplant and drug treatment worked synergistically and improved outcomes more than either treatment alone.

The performances of Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, Belief and Vultures are far beyond any other versions I've heard him do since (obviously this is all subjective and I've not heard every live performance since then). Also the people he performed with that night Robbie McIntosh, Steve Jordan, Pino Palladino etc. and the chemistry he had with them was in my opinion something very special and would be incredibly hard to top but hopefully I'm wrong!

They embedded cells in matrigel for their "mini lungs", no directional or guided tension cues were given so no macroscopic lung structure would have been formed.

["The arguments against vaccines haven't changed in 100 years"](http://www.vox.com/2015/1/28/7923427/anti-vaccine-history-arguments)    Another example of how a programme with a stated goal  " drug trafficking " broadens to target normal people.

Unlimited Data With Throttling is like going to an all you can eat buffet, but after your first plate of food, they give you a teacup saucer to use as a plate for the rest of your meal.   Industry self-regulation groups are a joke when dealing with beasts like Comcast   Check this beauty out  https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2tvgxt/hey_just_a_silly_thought_maybe_its_time_we_stop/co2qzfx?context=3   How do your towers ultimately connect to the internet ?  Satellite or fiber or another ?     quick synopsis of battle. Keep in mind this is nowhere near to the degree of the story this thread is about.    **1)** I'd been on Double Play getting 220 channels and HBO+streampix, encore, etc. 50mbps internet too, for 79.99 base price + $10 HD Fee. Pretty good monthly payments of just $96 bucks. I was proud that I managed to get my bill under $100. This has been in service since about Xmas, when I signed up.  **2)** As you all know, Comcast has been pushing X1 Triple Play for a while. X1 Double play was pretty much not allowed except in a select few markets. I wanted the X1 box for a while, due to the features and the UI. (Side note: it's not that great after all -- the UI is sluggish and the features are just so-so). So I finally saw X1TP package offer for 99/month for 12 months, NO contract. I said hey, this is a decent deal. I had no use for the phone, so the increased price due to phone service was always holding me back.  **3)** I sign up with a chat agent for the package. I typically use chat agents for signups, as I'm able to really think out my negotiating tactics with them. Anyways, there wasn't much negotiation to do in this case. She offered the $99 package, and said I'd keep all my existing channels, and that I'd now have X1 service and phone service.  **4)** Tech comes out and installs my stuff. Everything went great, and he was friendly. Techs always seem to be the best Comcast employees, though they're actually just contractors. He leaves, I check out the new X1. Then I realize A) my extra channels (the 80 extra over the 140) are now gone, and B) my HBO, Streampix, encore, etc are gone.   **Uh oh Comcast.......HERE WE GO. Also, folks -- make sure you record every call with Comcast, whether phone or chat. You'll need it.**  **5)** Over the next 5 days, I end up battling it out with phone and chat support. The results are all over the fuckin place.   * Hung up on at least 5 times (each time right as they ask for the account number -- how convenient). * Forwarded to dead-end departments where noone answers * Forwarded to a retentions dept that doesn't seem to have any employees * Forwarded to completely wrong depts unrelated to my issue * Told I AM supposed to have the channels AND HBO+Streampix * Told I am NOT supposed to have the channels * Told a ticket was filed with senior authority regarding false advertising from the chat agents promising the channels. Was told I'd receive a 24hr callback. I tell them I bet it won't happen. She promises. Big surprise -- it didn't happen. Never actually received ANY call back in response to that ticket.  **6)** I continue to battle it out with them, and finally get a phone agent to enable my HBO. Turns out the agent that filed the ticket actually turned my HBO on, but never reset my box. STILL missing those extra 80 channels though.  **7)** This week, I called  and chatted to see about getting the promised 80 channels. No results, and agents tell me that I AM and am NOT supposed to receive them. What a surprise. Eventually I got fed up with them, told them they keep lying to me and can't give a straight. I got a little sideways with this particular agent (no name calling, just being aggressive about my disgust with the run around), when my modem suddenly just resets. TV never went out, I checked and zero outages reported. I found that incredibly suspicious, given the timing. After that, I give up and go to bed. It's like 3am.  Later on while researching, I realize 2 things:  A) If youre signed up for Triple Play, Comcast will NOT allow you to see offers for Double Play packages, or any service level below your current one. All you can see is more expensive packages, and individual services.  B) Comcast started offering X1 Double Play without announcing it. How did I find out? I had to go to their site, pretend to be a new customer, enter a bogus address down the street, and pull up offers for new customers.  **Theyre intentionally hiding this information from you, and the agent failed to inform me of the availability of the service, despite me making it clear that I had double play and wanted X1. So she intentionally sold me something she knew I didnt need, and the web people are in on it by keeping you from seeing this info without faking your way to the page.** So I get on the phone and get an agent to sign me up for Preferred Double Play. In the end, I shot myself in the foot and added $20 to my bill, and all I gained was a $10 X1 box. Leaving my DP plan cost me another $10.  **Once she sets it all up, she says theres a $2 fee for disconnecting the phone services, and that Ill be billed for the Triple Play for 10 days. I say ABSOLUTELY NOT, theres a 30 day guarantee for customers, stated in clear terms on the site.  She responds that I dont qualify. Why?  A) Im not a new customer. That is the biggest bullshit Ive ever heard, and its NOT in the terms.  B) I didnt cancel ALL my services. Again, complete bullshit, and NOT in the terms.**     **8)** Fast forward to today. I sent an email yesterday (Wednesday) that was about 4 pages long to Comcast Cares, outlining my experiences with them. I tell them every last detail, I include chat logs, the whole deal.  I reference the exact terms of their 30 day guarantee, I let them know that if they cant support existing customers, how on Earth can they support NEW ones. Business 101 stuff. I request a refund on the Triple Play services for the 10 days, and request that my original 79.99 plan be re-instated on the bill for those 10 days, then they can switch me over to the Preferred.  Im still waiting to hear back.    As someone who is currently engaged in nuclear war with them over false advertising, lying, hangups, and intentional disconnections of my internet, I can't wait to witness The Crapture when it goes down.   wat?         http://www.ibj.com/articles/51447-utilities-favor-legislation-changing-economics-of-rooftop-panels                                             Stopping these sneaky moves is important and necessary. But it's like bailing water out of a leaky boat. To plug the leak, reduce the influence of money in politics:   I think it is weird that Marriott even considered the plan and got as far as it did.  Interfering with the spectrum is a big deal.                                                      Low incidence, high consequence. Like why intuitively, flying seems more hazardous than driving.  It is a shame that nuclear is unfashionable.  I see so many potential techs like underwater plants , thorium , and more .. would make it safer                  Stopping every one of these sneaky moves is important and necessary. But it's like bailing water out of a leaky boat. To plug the leak, reduce the influence of money in politics:                              They appear to have dropped the "visualisation of a social network".

 Well if we looked at the date he wrote the letter to Walker, October 28th, 2014, it looks like literally one week before the real life November 4th, 2014 midterms. The problem is that we don't know the exact date that Walker resigned and when Frank took his oath and assumed office. But since there wasn't any mention of midterm results in Chapter 26, I'm sure the first episode of Season 3 will give us the results.   Regardless, in 2016 we're going to have a situation where President Underwood would have been in office for over two years. Underwood's first "term" started late October/early November 2014. If he gets re-elected in 2016, his second term would start when he's inaugurated in January 2017. So his first term is over two years and if we use a plain meaning rule reading of the 22nd Amendment, it's seems clear that he wouldn't be able to run again in 2020.  But you can be sure he would try to get around that somehow when 2020 comes around (assuming the show is still on the air then).   This is wonderful. It's been a long time since I've seen a picture that really "stared into my soul" so to speak. I didn't break eye contact for a solid minute just looking at her. Brilliantly done.

 two words... don't blink! seriously creepy though!   That is crazy freaky! It sounds like this guy might know something you don't. The question is why would he say leave? Have you ever messed with ouija boards or the like? Maybe ventured into any creepy abandoned buildings?  	2
 It is indeed a very beautiful town, and Tennessee's oldest town! Here's a picture my dad took from downtown Jonesborough.   http://imgur.com/cLkRTI2   Can I take a message?   Tis a very similar landscape.   -fellow DayZer   Na we have "hollers" here in TN. I've live here for about 10 years and haven't really figured out if there is a defined landscape that makes a holler a holler or if the places they call holler are just called that because the road names are named such. For example "hog hollow rd" is a road name in this county and that area is generally referred to as hog holler.    Yep sure is is!   Oh Em Gee.   I've been up to Mountain City a few times and the path from Johnson City to Mountain City that goes up by Watauga Lake is absolutely gorgeous. I've always wanted to go out on that lake.    That's awesome! I love living near mountains. I'm not sure if I'd want to live anywhere else. Just about everyday I see something that I haven't noticed before. I hate when they go bare as well. Way more beautiful in the summertime when everything is green.   This is what I see.   http://imgur.com/r9UEzHs  Near Jonesborough, TN.  Edit: Much like, so wow.   	9
       can you provide some info on the black bars in Frames?   I dont know if its common to everybody but, hitting next on Every photo in an album on facebook always results in disk activity and also scrolling down the news feed for stories in the past also leads to disk activity.   Yes, because they develop it and test it out for maximum performance with chrome.   Yes, chrome does play html5 YouTube much better and smoother, because they implemented it first and launched it. Now everybody else is playing catch-up. Sick marketing move.    i still feel Flash is horrible on chrome. It does play better than Firefox on Linux but it takes a couple or more of "refresh" page to get the video to load in the first place.   im hoping that these sites convert once html5 video gets a little more traction.   And yes the awful works-on-Chrome mentality is more than bearable these days _   Yeah true but kinda feels bad that people still mention it as if he was forced to resign and they are using that as a reason to abandon :(   Hope they get some sense into their heads soon and firefox goes far ahead from the current catch-up situation.    most news channels/popular sites still use some form of flash player :/   i wish they convert   eh? Java works fine on all my OS's. Whats your issue?   Strange, people are still talking of the Brenden Eich issue. :/   Mozilla needs to address this again.    emojione is trying to address these issues.   they could probably make a font with the work they have done but that hasnt happened yet.   they welcome devs to use all the content that is open-sourced  - http://emojione.com/    so far gimp in comparison to PS.   Other than that krita, mypaint, inkscape, synfig    Apple emojis are proprietary.   The only open sourced emoji I've known so far is Google's, and emojione.com   Emoji One is a better answer than both of them,  but is Web based.   Edit -  Firefox does support emoji, you might be missing the font files on your system. Get the symbola font from unicode or segoe ui if your on windows 8   This isn't an animation software :/   SynFig could help you   okay even more recent(as far as possible) xD - https://twitter.com/OrmrTheEditor   they are active here though - https://www.facebook.com/OrmrTheEditor    Linux beta is out as of - 3 December 2014 - http://www.getormr.com/download         if its real bad, i think you have to reset your browser or create a new profile. back up before proceeding.   Reset - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings   New profile - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles     Get rid of ad block for a while and check if you find a difference.  Also try safe mode.    Broke my heart :'( , Linux is secondary everywhere    its so beautiful    You'll have to wait on the white page, I get it too, the site loads fine after the small wait.   If it doesn't I think it's because of connection trouble       Few things come with a user manual these days. Many people struggle using a smart phone. Too much clutter and confusion.      Ah true, people are influenced by what they see around them, but devs could have a final say on the matter    The right click isn't an issue, it the way it should work.    If you've high end cad programs like catia or so, it's right click everywhere     The problem is with the open source community is that they too content with what they have, they don't see lack of good GUI tools on Linux a problem because they use the command line anyway  Dont feel that way, we wanted Office, we've got LibreOffice and OpenOffice.  We wanted a alternative to 3ds max/Maya(though maya runs on Linux) we got blender and its going places. Alternative to Autodesk Sketchbook, we've got Krita and MyPaint. Corel Draw/Illustrator - Inkscape, SynFig.   There is an abundance of good software, i'll admit some of these having a learning curve but they are worth the time spent!    The community has never kept quiet, we've kept demanding, its just the commercial bigshots are ignorant, and the community had to figure out its own version of things.    im downloading the new dev built right now :D   hehe wish it was as simple :D   wow you've done a whole load of work. :O :O :O   Maybe you could ask people here or at /r/linux or similar sub reddits for help? Collab with people on git hub if you like?   and it will positively impact the Linux culture and base if its picked up and worked upon.  Many people just wish Photoshop runs on Linux so that they could convert. That hasn't happened so far. :/   The open source community is good, just that sometimes, things are out of focus or pressing issues are not addressed   oh okay! Awesome :)    Contests for UI and UX do not work (that is what "everyone feels qualified to criticize the UI and suggest improvements" would be).   i think if mock-ups are shown to the public or demo-ed, then people can vote on the best implementation.   Also people who have a better concept should be given consideration and voted along with the other concepts.   GIMP has quite a long release cycle, so this should be possible.     yup!   I just wish changing opacity, brush size, colors, could be done on the go. Krita does an almost amazing job at this. A artist who's drawing something doesn't have to constantly switch between the keyboard and tablet/mouse much.   true, but i feel blender provides more co-ordination while using that rule, and you don't have to remember most of the commands or dig the menu's, the space bar/search gives everything!     and the new engine :D!   just to clarify, i meant a wacom drawing tablet :)   Ah yes I agree about the issues with preview     vector   I guess it's a typo   GIMP ui currently is way better than what Blender was in the initial days. But blender has picked up, polished it self and has a much better UI today but the most important thing is that it's still Blender.   There is a learning curve to both these software's, but something about UI/UX is important to have a really smooth work flow.   Love blenders rule - one hand on keyboard and one on mouse       No love for Russia?   if you have a tablet, you can sketch using the pencil tool.   Afterwards use the node tools, simply the path(Ctrl+L), and keep tweaking and adjusting!      We'll help you to flesh out your idea and promote it to a larger community.   Okay that felt awesome to read! :D   I think with some proper co-ordination this could be possible and hopefully big!   MSE is quite usable on the Nightlies for sometime now. Some bugs are left and some new ones pop up too, so unless every known issue is dealt with its better to keep them in testing.   Would also be a negative backlash when you ship something thats only partially working   xD well something can be done to make it non-capitalistic    Yes but the scale has been low I feel :/   I believe contributors will show up, because most people don't want to shell out huge $ on a legal version of Photoshop. If there's an alternative that works just as good, then it's well worth contributing something for such a cause.   The UI could use a fix, many other features can be smoothened out, yes Photoshop and Gimp are different, that should remain, but there are things like cmyk etc. that still haven't happened. A drive like this should enable users to vote on a set features they want to see implemented in time frame.    oh yeah :/ missed that.   But still the possibility of such an event would be wild and awesome    Yup true! But i guess the team could also use the money to hire part time/full time programers for the project    I've outline a few steps normal user's can take up to ensure that their privacy is protected with the different softwares one uses on a computer or smartphone.   Here the link [Short Guide on Privacy/Safety tech for your Browser, Smartphones and OS](https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/short-guide-on-privacysafety-tech-for-your-browser-and-os/)   Do read and please leave your feedback here or on the page :)   Hope it helps!   Yes very true! Many people I've known would want to use gimp, but they aren't very comfortable once they start using. If a campaign to fund and improve gimp happens then I guess lots of contributions will pour in.   Especially the fact being it's open source and free!    We all know that there is no Photoshop on Linux and I dont think Adobe has any plans to make one.     GIMP is the best thing available but IMHO it hasn't reached that level of perfection we would like. Yes, it does a lot of things Adobe can do and sometime even better but theres a feel that something's missing.     Krita another OSS app went for a successful Kickstarter funding recently(https://krita.org/item/krita-2-9-0-the-kickstarter-release/) and its helped the software and the community pretty well.   Im sure lots of users out there would like GIMP to reach the top, many want a true Photoshop alternative thats simple to use and looks good.   What are your thought /r/gimp ?  Wouldn't such a funding campaign help GIMP progress as the app we want?    Am I just pulling stuff out my ass or do you guys notice a correlation    ah well its true, but i dont think because its because they are branded as OSS. Its mostly the look of the app, and the ease of usability that matters to an end user.       Yes! i wish GIMP also goes with some move like this!   We could possibly have a perfect alternative to Photoshop!

Chrome renders extremely thin fonts, still looking for an answer.   One solution is to use your own custom fonts by changing the browser settings.   ive done it all, even gstreamer(both versions) is installed, and the test case at http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/tests/video.html plays the MP4/H264 but YouTube wont show green :(   there is opensouce http://emojione.com/   Its meant for the Web, but it could to be implemented in distro's with some mods   Nobody has shown interest in color emojis on Linux so far    amd actually is more better with their driver support and openness, but yes a pain to find and install.   Its similar with nvidia when u have new things like Optimus tech and all happening.   Some looking around(RPM Fusion) should help you, orelse get the drivers from the AMD website itself. Its the best possible source.   its because your middle mouse click has been activated, by some key combo mostly.   Autoscroll allows you for 4 way scrolling.   oh yea, ive noticed in the YouTube html5 page MSE   H264 still appears disabled :(   wishing things work out!     the puzzle.    Mozilla is starting with Facebook video as they're rolling out Shumway, so if Facebook suddenly eliminated their use of Flash it would be...  oh awesome! :D   Hoping Shumway rolls out to linux soon :D     Try booting into safe mode!   It disables rest of the apps, if thats causing some interference and also try wiping "cache" in recovery      /u/Alhaitham_I corrected me, its an instagram embed facebook.   ah yes true, i didnt see/might've missed the instagram overlay.   Thanks for correcting me! :)   im on Nightly 38.0a1 (2015-02-22) and its so far appeared for that video in the screenshot, guess it was some kind of momentary test run   :) Check your omtc status in 'about: support'    Bad UI, pricing, minimum marketing and no guaranteed updates across the entire android range.    Ah I meant for Linux   I guess in Windows it's already enabled by default, if not you just need to enable the omtc option and not the one I've mentioned here.   I'm not sure of the technicalities of the property I mentioned to be enabled but without it omtc on Linux remains disabled.    also this - layers.acceleration.force-enabled   ah yes true that method will work.   I was served this version without spoofing the user agent on linux.   On mobile yes, but not on desktop i think.   Never saw the html player on Facebook before   i think it hasn't been implemented properly, i was lucky to get this in html mp4, others have been using flash X_X       Ah, so there's several patents covering Cleartype, I didn't know that.  yeah! its also the same case H264 and many audio/video formats   oh you should have mentioned Debian   "Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault" is what you need i feel. Check out this link for more info:   http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1ofgl7/howto_better_looking_fonts/  EDIT - about the Liberation Sans, i think its wise to file a bug report to debian to make them aware of the issue on the choppiness of the font, so that they can rectify it!   Lcdfilter will enable sub-pixel rendering. Great font rendering on lcd screens.    From Wiki:   "Microsoft has several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. This had caused FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, to disable this functionality by default.[4]  Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.[12]  The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between 1998-10-07 and 1999-10-07, thus should expire in 2019-10-07"   http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/   http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html   Any of these 2 methods will drastically improve font rendering, Infinality will also mimic other OS's font rendering mechanism.   And your browser is also responsible, for some unknown reason Chrome is sub-par at font rendering, do try out Firefox, its simply good these days.   Also the Liberation Sans font is choppy(if on fedora[maybe other Linux's too] - reported bug but no action has been made yet)  EDIT - There are patents preventing these from enabled by default which is why its left to the users choice   Restart and power off phone would be nice    This does seem as the issue "Liberation Sans"   I have it installed on my system (fedora 21) but even in LibreOffice the font is not properly anti-aliased/hinted. Something wrong i guess with the font, will try find a fix for that!   Thank You for narrowing this problem down :)   I have my font rendering correctly setup on Linux,   It's strange because every other site renders fine except this   I do have anti aliasing enabled to rgb, sub-pixel rendering on, and freetype installed.   It's only this site that has messed up font rendering, everything else is amazing       If your graphics card is nvidia Optimus  hybrid technology, then Google for the bumblebee project and install on your os   Why so serious?       Docking!    In Address bar - "about:config" - Search for "mediasource" and double click to set the options "True"   Also:  http://www.ghacks.net/2014/07/25/enable-mse-h2-64-support-youtube-firefox-right-now/    Just for your info, MSE(HTML5 videos) is under super heavy development, so there are bugs, if you find 'em, report them :)  You can follow this for more:    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778617      You should be on nightly for the webM , the other ignore_codecs is added by the user   ah yes that's my last resort :)   im thinking of fallback mode.   EDIT - i just read on some page that pc's made withing the last 3-5 years could work fine.   On my current machine(i3 4gb ram) - its below 120 MB   Thank you for the info! :D   Just what i wanted to know :D   Its my first time with debain and just didn't want a bad experience. Thank you Again :) :D   ah yes, i did try those links out before coming here, but i couldn't find what i was looking for, luckily the r/debian community has helped me out.   Thank you for additional info too :D   yeah ive been thinking about it too, im just hoping gnome can be used fine with a 512mb ram environment. It used to run the old version of Fedora pretty well and its been a long time(4+ years) since i upgraded it.   New fedora has a huge minimum req. and ive been wanting to get debian for a long while.   just hoping it works out fine :)    thanks for the live image Readme - help me clear up a bit of the confusion :)   what bout these live cd's/usb version(1GB or so i think)?   the thing thats confusing me is the standard edition and gnome edition. Does the standard have no Desktop Envirnoment?   Thank you for the link and answer, but what if I'm without internet?   Hello r/debian   im almost on the verge to get debian for my old system as i found out it will run on hardware(512MB Core Duo) a few years back.   But as i went to download the live installation media, i found out 2 version's - gnome and standard?   Whats the difference between those two?   I'm looking for a gnome desktop as natural because ive been used to it with Fedora a long time.    Does the standard ship with the gnome desktop or do i have to get the gnome iso as such.    Also is the installation text based or GUI?     EDIT - SOLVED - i got the info i wanted to know! Thank you kind people of /r/debian ! :D   If you do have more info to share, please do! :)   VIDEOS!!!   Ubuntu Phone OS - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TShKZLeZzWE feature=youtu.be   Promo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpfHYpfEXY feature=youtu.be       I do not know what infinality is :D  http://www.infinality.net/blog/   http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html   good going :D   its good to see people donating to opensource projects       Yes moto g or moto x any day!    I feel so sad for him.  Stay strong.  May your dog Rest In Peace    glad it helped, its hard to live without the app though, i just wish they made it better to use the RAM efficiently    Google has made an amazing blunder of the update mechanism.  Why don't they approach the update system just like other Linux systems   	113
 The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical.   As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:  * Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it.  * Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one.   You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.     Cash can be used anywhere that currency can purchase goods.    What case is that?   Thanks!    http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051514562  763  Ok so this joke is really really really offensive, but here it is:  What did the Boston Bombers do that Hitler couldn't?   End a race.  I'm sorry.    http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051514562/  763   I think THIS is the way to do it, not a 2 minute rejoin window. League of Legends does it this way and it works pretty well in my opinion.    What do you mean the map wasn't in the book?   How do these compare to the Invisible Shields? I got two anyways but I'd like to know.    735   Thanks!   678 DayZ please!   Try completely uninstalling Synapse and seeing if the keyboard functions as usual. If it doesn't, I think it would be time to send an email to Razer Support.   178   Can you really play BF4 on the Edge? What graphics settings and what FPS do you get?   To get more rows of tiles on the start screen, go to settings  tiles  show more tiles and tick to yes. On my RT I get four rows instead of three.    I'd love a few to repair my old beat-up controllers :)   Source: http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1004944069   And this is news because....?   EDIT: Holy shit, Gold! Thank you so much kind stranger! I figured that comment would get buried for sure!   I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.    It wouldn't be too much more expensive, and it would allow you to add more things in the future if you would like.    Better graphics card comes to mind first, then a power supply with more wattage. That's really about it.   Keep in mind this is a MICRO build, more for portability than anything. If space isn't an issue, get a larger case and a better mobo.    You could go with an R9 280X for $100 more and have a PC that will last you for a long time.    I built a killer mid-range gaming pc (plays most games like BF4 maxed) for $800 or so just a few months ago so you should be fine with the cash you have set aside. I've posted pcpartpicker below.   I got a lot of my parts with good deals which is why the total price is a little high.

I mean sure, why not? It's just putting a custom case on a shelf above your desk.     Way to ruin it with the title.    Ah man, that sucks. Didn't know that was specific to the first generations.    Works for me on my RT + Touch Cover 1. You have to tap pretty fast and hold down the second tap.    Double-tap then drag.   I looked into it more and found that I do have DDR3 memory running at 1333 MHz. It seems that I was looking at the DRAM frequency.    I see, it seems I don't know enough about memory. Thank you for the clarification!   How much would you be willing to sell two of your 4GB PC3-10600s?   I would like to get at least 2 x 4 GB PC3 10600 or PC3 12800 (1333 or 1600 MHz) ram kits at around $30 or so. Anyone have old laptop memory meeting these requirements? Shoot me an offer!    I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:  * Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in.   * Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill.   * Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter.   Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed.   To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.    I have a stock cooler from an FX 6300 never installed. Name your price.    I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me.   I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.    Honestly this ultrabook would have pretty much the exact same portability of a surface.    Yes, but there are adapters that you can buy to get an ethernet port.     I upgraded from the Blackwidow Ultimate 2012 edition to the 2013 edition and that was very much worth it. If you have nothing else I say go for it!   Just take a look around, they don't really have THAT many products. Only then will you know if there's some really cool looking headset or mouse that other people don't recommend.   Having said that, though, I recommend:  * Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)  * Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)  * Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset.   Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.    Date and time skin at the center is [Metro Desk X](http://exsess.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Desk-X-v0-8-ALPHA-366743811). Top bar and side bar are custom skins created myself.       Try unplugging the keyboard, restarting your computer, and plugging your keyboard back in after your computer has completely booted up again.    I don't really see the difference between the two questions? Sure, the second one is more specific but a good reviewer will talk about how the workload impacts social life when asked just the first question (because it's the greatest factor in how social you are). Same for most questions on the page, they sound like generic questions any freshman or college review websites would ask.   For comparison here is the same model sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/171011545519?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT _trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649). This is a FANTASTIC monitor well worth the money. Good luck on the sale!  	47

Can we duplicate the reddit search field within a subreddit, but as an exclusionary search to act as a filter? Functionality would be equivalent of using regular search field with eg. "*subreddit:technology -comcast*", minus the subreddit specification because inside it and add a "-" in front of search to create a filter. This leaves it purely optional user choice, and allows for a tailoring of user experience within subreddits.                     	163
       Syria, Iran, and Hezballah have threatened to attack Israel if the US strikes Syria.  Because of this, Israel tested its anti-missile defense system. How does one test an anti-missile defense system? With dummy missiles.  I don't see how it's warmongering to test one's defenses after being threatened with missile strikes, and if Syria wants to test its own missile defenses, it can go right ahead.      Ah, so at least it was an emergency. Still not exactly the best seamanship out there, but it wasn't as though the officer was speeding to meet someone for lunch.   I'm no boating person, but that sure looks like negligence to me. Anyone know what the police were responding to?   I've never found the problem with Dupont Circle to be the cars, it's the pedestrians who jaywalk without looking for said cars. I don't know why Dupont is the one place where 95% of the time, people are stepping in front of cars that have a green light.   If the anniversary of the March on Washington threatens to overload our transportation infrastructure to the point where OPM has highly urged federal employees to telework tomorrow, I can't imagine how our region can possibly effectively host the Olympics.   What applies to US lawyers might not apply to Canadian lawyers, so, I caution people not to make unwarranted assumptions, and I caution the OP to take all the advice given with a bigger than usual grain of salt.   Reminds me a little of a cat whose eaten a joker fish! http://i.imgur.com/VbwLGxx.png (From the Batman: the Animated Series episode "The Laughing Fish.")   I think it's more a matter of they're not shutting down the Red Line right now. But, it seems a matter of time before they'll have to address this problem, and it doesn't seem like something that can be done without shutting down the stations.   I like Circus Ponies's NoteBook, but Pages can work pretty well too.   Don't forget Bob Justman!   I disagree with those saying to not read/study/learn anything before 1L. I'm not saying you need to (or should) pay money for a system or software (I've never heard of LearnLeo), but if you have the time before school starts, pick up one supplement for each of the core law school classes.   For Civ Pro, the Glannon Examples and Explanations book is king. For contracts, I liked the Understanding Contracts book from Lexis, but there's no one must-have book like Civ Pro. Do the same for Torts, Con Law, and Property. I wouldn't worry so much about Crim Law because I found Crim Law to vary the most from professor to professor. If you have the time, sure, pick up a book and do the same, but it's at the bottom of the priority listing.  Skim them. No need to brief anything, no need to memorize anything, and no need to master anything. What you should get out of this is a mental catalogue of where elements of the subject fit, so when you read a case, you have a sense of where it fits into the overarching jurisprudential firmament.   No, no it does not. The true owner cannot be dispossessed of a right to his/her property, no matter how many times something has changed hands after the theft and no matter whether the people involved knew it was stolen or not. The bona fide purchaser doctrine does not apply to stolen goods.  Leaving real estate out of it, property follows the Irving Principle. There was a 1965 comedy album called "You Don't Have to Be Jewish" that contained a popular song, "The Ballad of Irving," sung by Frank Gallop. The Ballad of Irving was about the 142nd fastest gunslinger in the West. One of the verses began, "141 could draw faster than he, but Irving was looking for 143." That is the Irving Principle. It doesn't matter if 141 can draw faster than you if you're facing 143. Well, in property, it does not matter of 141 people have a better claim to a piece of property than you do, so long as you are up against #143.   Here's a practical example of the Irving Principle at work. Albert buys a bike. Bob steals the bike and sells it to Cathy, who doesn't know it was stolen. Cathy later sells it to Dwight. Edgar steals the bike from Dwight and sells it to Frank. Who can legitimately claim the bike? It depends on who is making the claim. Dwight can come along get the bike back from Frank because it was stolen from him. Frank has no right to the bike, he has no right to compensation from Dwight for the bike, Frank's only remedy is to try getting his money back from Edgar. This is true, even thought at any point in time, Albert can stumble upon the location of his bike and file suit to get his bike back. Dwight has a better claim than Frank, Albert has a better claim than anyone, but in a fight between Dwight and Frank, Dwight wins. The Irving Principle.  All of which is a roundabout way of saying that bona fide purchasing has nothing to do with stolen property.   Of course The Chubby Checker app is a vulgar pun. Of course it violates the trademark of the singer Chubby Checker.  The only element of this story that is potentially newsworthy is that HP might be held liable for trademark infringement over hosting an app that they didn't actually name or create themselves.   I'd add Yamas in Bethesda to the list, certainly.   I'm a fan of the Lawyer2Lawyer podcast. Some really interesting interviews, and their guests give their contact info at the end if you want to followup on a topic. :-) http://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/lawyer-2-lawyer/   There are dessert trucks, including a pie truck, but their location depends on the day. Sometimes at L'Enfant Plaza, I can get a slice of pie, a cupcake, or a cookie, and some days, there's not a single dessert truck there.  If you'll be doing this during the lunch hour, L'Enfant Plaza is the best place to get government workers.   If you're under 25 and might need to rent cars, ABA membership may get you out of paying a surcharge. Otherwise, the $60 is not worthwhile.   Depending on the state, there may be lawyers who specialize in getting other lawyers through the character and fitness process. (In Florida, for example, I'd send you to Brian Tannenbaum.) This is serious, and if you can find experienced counsel who deals with C F issues in your state, I urge you to use them.   I hope your interview went well, OP.  I saw this too late to be helpful to you, but for others who may stumble across this looking for advice in the future, I'd like to echo BlackLetterLaw's suggestion that one should research the firm and its attorneys. Try to find connections. Did anyone go to your law school or undergrad? Same clubs or interests? Did anyone publish articles or books you can skim? Were any of the attorneys you might meet involved in any landmark cases, Supreme Court cases, etc.? (One of the attorneys I interviewed with at one point was really impressed I asked him about his experience arguing before the Supreme Court. Apparently, I was the first person he interviewed who ever asked him about it. I didn't get the job, but it was clearly a point in my favor that I asked about it.)  You might be asked what book have you read recently, or what's your favorite book, etc. Have an answer. Lots of firms want people with intellectual curiosity.  Lots of law school's career services offer mock interviews. It's worthwhile. If they don't offer it, ask a professor if she or he would be willing to do a mock interview with you. Or a friend. It gives you the chance to develop answers and practice being put on the spot. BUT-don't practice so much that you are going off a completed script. Interviews are supposed to be a conversation.   Gee, I hope all our suspects are this much fun.   Other members of the Court may not engage in the sort of behavior the Act is intended to bar, but I don't think they would sanction Congress meddling with the internals workings of the Court.   Others have given you great advice (only need casebooks in class, use E Es for outlines, no need for bar chart stuff, etc.), but I'd also note that I highly, highly urge you to skim through the E Es now, in the next couple of weeks before class starts. I emphasize SKIM as opposed to study or read, just to know where to mentally categorize and place what you'll be learning during the semester. Do it now, while you have the time.   The Constitutionality of this is questionable. While Congress has the power to pass legislation that increases or decreases the size of the Court, and the power to pass laws that are precluded from judicial review, etc., something that affects the internal workings of the Court itself raises a separation of powers argument. Who would give the final word on whether it is Constitutional? *coughs* The Supreme Court.   I just took a cab via Uber from AU to home. There aren't many cabs that go past AU's law school, so street hailing is out. I can either call a DC cab company with absolutely no idea how long it will take to get a cab (sometimes a cab comes in 10 minutes, sometimes it's 30, or I can use Uber, pay $2 more, and know exactly how long it will take for the cab to arrive and where the cab is as it's coming.   I'm a fan of the Max Burton 6000. It works well.   Elaine Corn's "Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to Start Cooking Today." Good inexpensive recipes, and easy to follow.   I like the classics: I'd whistle In the Hall of the Mountain King. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCjc_OllHdE   If this was a black neighborhood watch person who shot a white 17-year-old, do you think there's a chance in Hades that person wouldn't have been arrested on the spot?   Walmart had pledged to pay the amount DC is proposing. Their threat to pull out seems to indicate to me that they were lying, not that DC is overreaching.   In many US states, there is a similar implied warranty of merchantability... Goods are supposed to be fit for the purposes such goods are ordinarily used for.   Some professors need reminders from campus administrators that their policies don't trump the Americans with Disabilities Act.   Right to work states don't mean that you aren't an at-will-employee or otherwise have any greater protection against being fired, it means it is harder for unionization. It's a pro-employer policy.   No, that's not exactly what Justice Kennedy is saying.  There are two types of standing. One is Article III standing and the other is prudential standing.  Article III standing comes from the Constitution, namely, Article III, and requires courts only get involved with an actual case or controversy. Unlike other countries, the US courts don't issue advisory opinions. (There's a whole list of things that go into whether there is an actual case or controversy that I won't go into here.)  Prudential standing requirements can be discarded by the courts whenever they find cause. They are self-imposed requirements, they are not Constitutionally mandated, so they can also be ignored at whim.   Justice Kennedy is not saying the Supreme Court can ignore Article III standing or ignore jurisdiction. If there's no Article III standing, the Court can't hear the case. Same for jurisdiction. What he is saying is that just as a dieter can choose to make exceptions, be it an exception for one's birthday or for a particularly tasty-looking treat, the Court can decide to make exception to rules it imposes on itself.   This isn't a legal question, it's a factual question. Regrettably, without the tags, I'd wager the odds of police catching the person are nil.   Um, get a lawyer. Now. Not a reddit-appointed lawyer, an actual, licensed-in-California, criminal defense attorney.    Give Georgetown Bagelry (in Bethesda) a try. http://georgetownbagelry.com   Oy. My advice is for goodness sakes, get yourself a lawyer. Petty theft is a crime. Crimes are bad, and not the sort of thing you want on your record. If you are convicted or plead guilty, yes, it's may well be on your record permanently. Find a good lawyer in your jurisdiction.   The TL;DR is document review jobs are certainly better than having no job, or a lot of various minimum wage jobs, but they are the sweatshop of the legal world. See it as a temporary means of sustenance, not a long-term plan.   There is no possibility of advancement and there is no loyalty. Document review attorneys are expendable. You might get hired for a project only to be told the night before that they overhired, and "Oops, sorry, [click]."   And while I can 't speak to the accuracy of all of what areyouinsane said in the link by anti09, he's definitely right that you generally find out the project is over by telephone. In my last doc review project before going back to school for my LL.M. and getting hired in a real job (now finishing up LL.M. part-time), as documents were running out, we'd go in for what was supposed to be a full day of work, go through all the documents in about 2 hours, and then be sent home (with no added pay, obviously, other than the 2 hours were worked) and told to call a recording to see if there were more documents. There were, but we were told to call every day. So there were 2 days of full work, another day told to go home after a few hours, a day of full work, and the next morning, the machine said the project was over and we should mail our badges for the building back. (At our expense, natch.)   (Oh, and if you have any specific questions, PM me.) :-)   One: Figure out how you're going to get to school. There's no parking for 1Ls in the garage underneath WCL, and if you park in the neighborhood around WCL, you will almost certainly get a $75 ticket from the school. If you need/want to drive to school, you have to park on main campus (paying the bucks for a parking pass) and take the free shuttle to school. Doable, but annoying. The free shuttles also go to the Tenleytown metro, so, that's a strong option.  Two: Some people take law school way too seriously. If you have no free time to spend with a significant other, never go out with friends, spend all your time in the library writing an outline the size of War and Peace, etc., you're trying too hard.  Three: Some people don't take law school seriously enough. If you're out at the bars every night and aren't doing the reading, etc., you're not trying hard enough. Grades do matter, especially in the less than great legal market.  Four: This doesn't apply to 1Ls, since you don't get choices, but when you get to pick classes your 2L and 3L years, DON'T pick classes based on the bar. What you need to know for the bar, you'll pick up in bar prep courses.   DO pick classes based on professors. Professors make or break classes. Doesn't matter how exciting or dull a subject is. A good professor will make it amazing, a bad professor will make you wish you decided to become a sanitation worker instead of going to law school.  I suggest you take Evidence, because it's so fundamental to what lawyers do. Similarly, I strongly urge you to take Administrative Law. It touches upon almost every other area of law, so, it's really important to know. If you can, take Professor Popper's class. His exam is long but fair, and he is a wonderful professor.  Five: Do a clinic. Practical experience is vital, and it gives you the chance to learn and make mistakes in a safe environment with experienced practitioners guiding you and protecting you from harming your client or yourself.  Six: Network, network, network. Your internships and externships, be it during the summer or during the academic terms, are vital for getting jobs after graduation. Networking will help you get good internships and externships, and they'll help you get jobs.  Seven: Don't bother getting involved with the SBA. It's the equivalent of a high school student council but with even less real impact on the school and with more threats of lawsuits over silly things that don't matter a damn.  Eight: Do try for law review, and you don't get chosen for the main law review, join one of the briefs.  Nine: Go to office hours. Make sure professors know you and you know them, so when you need help getting an internship or job, etc., professors will a: have nice things to say about you, and b: want to help you.   And yet he has no problem opining on abortion cases. If you don't understand fundamental information about DNA, you have no place giving your opinion on when life begins.   I agree that the use of the FISA court has been appalling, however, I don't see how a President can be impeached for using a law the way it was designed to be used, going through a judicial review process (as weak as the FISA process is), and keeping Congress properly informed. This wasn't Bush's NSA scandal, where the NSA went after the content of domestic calls without even going through the motions of a warrant from the FISA court. This was for the phone records, not content, which involve a lesser expectation of privacy and all branches of government were involved. Unconstitutional? Yes, personally, I think it is. Awful? Yes, personally, I think it is.   A high crime or misdemeanor meriting impeachment of the President? If it is, you'd also need to impeach the judges who heard the FISA cases and expel the members of Congress who authorized it (given that the PATRIOT Act was passed nearly unanimously, somehow I doubt that will happen).  This was not unilateral action akin to other Presidential scandals, such as Watergate, Iran-Contra, etc.   If flights can't be obtained, it might be worth figuring out the cost of a town car service. It's pricey, but more reliable. For something this important, reliability is key.   Really? Who else besides Dartmouth plays pong with paddles?   Russ Feingold is now a former politician, but given that he was the only person with both the courage and intelligence to vote against the PATRIOT Act in the first place, he deserves a huge amount of respect.   It's a matter of personal preference. The tradeoff is probably screensize versus weight.   You're going to be lugging your laptop everywhere. How much are you willing to schlep, on top of casebooks that outweigh many dictionaries?  When you write papers, are you going to want the space to have a Lexis or Westlaw window next to your word processing window or are you okay flipping back and forth between the two? Hard to do the side-by-side thing on a 13" laptop, at least without squinting. That's why I prefer the 17". On the other hand, it's heavier than I'd likenow that I'm commuting from work to night classes for the LL.M., I must confess I find myself using an iPad and an external keyboard for notetaking more often than not because it's easier to carry.  SSD is entirely unimportant if you're just using it for law school related work. You don't need to spend that much cash on boosting the speed of saving OneNote or Word files.  I don't think the issue is necessarily one of keyboard quality, so much as it's keyboard comfort. The quality is pretty much universal assuming you're not buying a laptop that's supposedly a mainstream US laptop but is coming in a battered box that suspiciously only has Asian lettering on it and you found it for $150 from a guy on Canal Street. Comfort is a personal choice. What size keys, what layout, how much give the keys have, etc., all can differ from manufacturer to manufacturer (if not laptop to laptop). I urge you to go try them out in the Apple Store or Microsoft Store or Costco or (if you must) Best Buy (boo, hiss), instead of ordering one sight unseen.   Not sure why my responses have been downvoted, and perhaps this will meet the same fate, but an op-ed by Esther Lardent over at the National Law Journal touches upon the conflict of interest issue (albeit in an entirely different context), writing, "Particularly concerning is the notion of imputed disqualification, the ethical construct that if one lawyer in a large legal setting has a conflicts issue, all lawyers in that institution are presumed to share the same information and conflict." In a 50 state+ scenario, one lawyer with a conflicts issue can disqualify everyone. The more clients, the more potential conflicts.   This was a poor decision. From what I have read, it was not arbitrary or capricious to keep a 10-year-old off the adult lung transplant list because medically, it is less likely that an adult lung transplant would be successful. It would not necessarily fit or function. Instead of saving a 10 year old, you might have killed the adult who would have otherwise gotten the lungs.   Oh! It's my cake day! How did I miss that?! (Oh, right. 8.5 hours of work followed by 2.1 hours of school.) Thank you! :-)   The linked article itself says that he was not promoted to Admiral.   Preemption, preemption, preemption. It's a waste of time and money, with a 0% chance of surviving judicial review.   I like Professor Kerr, but I disagree with him that it is a love of Fourth Amendment balancing that moves Justice Breyer. I believe it's outcomes, a results-oriented jurisprudence that moves him in these cases.  A friend of mine had a 4th Amendment school case go to the Supreme Court in which she was the plaintiff. A few years later, she and I were both at a small meeting with Justice Breyer with the opportunity to talk to him, and she introduced herself and asked why he ruled against her. His answer was that he was worried about the dangers and prevalence of drugs in schools. That the decision was not congruous with precedent did not seem to matter, nor did he make a legal argument when asked the question. His was a simple outcome-oriented response.   I suppose I'm not surprised... Justice Scalia has often (albeit not to the level of "commonly") joined the "liberal" wing of the court in criminal procedure cases, and Justice Breyer's practical or outcome-oriented jurisprudence is often underestimated in media analyses.   Watch and learn as much as you can, and work as hard as you can so when you want a internship or recommendation as a law student, they happily give it to you.   Nobody is accusing him of committing a crime as far as I know. Ethical violations, yes. But the sanction for those is suspension or loss of a law license, not imprisonment.   (Heck, some states have nebulous rules about what firms can post online. The Florida Bar hotline claims that every tweet or Facebook post must include the name of the lawyer, firm, and office address.)      Lots of firms operate in multiple states. No firms operate in all 50.   As I said, not all state ethical rules are congruous. Everything from the firm name to who can be on the letterhead, to what offices must be listed on the letterhead, to various duties, etc., all are governed by different rules depending on the state.  DLA Piper, the firm other has listed in this thread as one of the closest things to OP's question, has offices in New York, Georgia, Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Florida, Minnesota, New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, Washington, Delaware, and DC. A lot of jurisdictions to juggle, but that's 17 jurisdictions. Not 50 states plus DC.   It would be an ethical impossibility. Remember, every state has its own ethical rules and every state's ethical rules are difference. One cannot comply with all of them.  Worse, think of the conflicts of interest. Screening for conflicts on a scale that large is impractical, and every matter a firm takes on limits matters it can handle in other contexts.   The tl;dr is that this wouldn't be a path to riches, it's a pathway to loss of licenses.   Heh. It takes about 45 minutes each way by bus/metro for me to get to work every day, so, I have some time to read. :P   Thanks for the suggestion. I read both of their books over the past few days. I enjoyed Evans book as a companion to Lipstadt's, but I'm glad I read her's first. I don't think Evans does a great job setting the scene and providing context, but with the background and details I had from reading Lipstadt's book, Evans did a great job filling in his part of the story.  Guttenplan's was an interesting read for an outside observer's view of the trial. He seemed self-contradictory in a few places if not obtuse, but still worth a read.   If you want something non-fiction, legal, but light (in terms of the intended audience, not in tone), go for Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips's "Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism." It's written for the lay audience, so, it meets the light category.  In 1906, Ed Johnson, a black man, was accused of raping a white woman. He was tried and convicted by an all-white jury. Two local attorneys appealed his case to Justice Harlan, the circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit, who agreed to have the Supreme Court hear the case. After the Court issued a stay-of-execution, Johnson was lynched.  The Court was outraged, perhaps more at the mob thwarting its order than at the loss of life itself, and the Court accused those it deemed responsible of contempt of Court in the case US v. Shipp. This was the only criminal trial the Supreme Court has ever held, with Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, his chief jailer, and some members of the lynch mob as defendants.  It's well written, an easy read on an interesting subject, and I think that if you aren't over-lawed from bar studying, it's a good choice.   Er, at this point, wouldn't it have been more accurate to describe them as shoplifters and not customers?   I'm gonna let you finish but Ryan Stiles had the best light breaking moment in show business. http://youtu.be/AkH3F7X7xQU?t=2m19s   My grandfather didn't spend several years fighting for the Kaiser in World War I for bad bread jokes. Oh, wait. Damnit!   First, that's an entirely different question from your original premise.  Second, did you listen to his speech, in person or through the live stream? I did. He didn't deliver anything other the standard law school graduation speech. Not a question of fault, not calling him a bad speaker, but it's the sort of thing nearly everyone delivers. He didn't deliver any unique insights.   Bull feathers. The role of a government lawyer is to use his or her professional judgment. The current rumor is that President Obama will be picking James B. Comey as his nominee to head the FBI. Comey was the Deputy Attorney General in the GWB administration from Dec. '03-Aug '05, and during that time, he famously refused to sign off on extending the NSA's illegal warrantless spying.  Here is what Comey had to say on this subject: "The lawyer is the custodian of so much. The custodian of our own personal reputations, surely. But more importantly, the custodian of our institutional reputations. And most importantly of all,the custodian of our constitution and the rule of law.It is the job of a good lawyer to say 'yes.' It is as much the job of a good lawyer to say 'no.' 'No' is much, much harder. 'No' must be spoken into a storm of crisis, with loud voices all around, with lives hanging in the balance. 'No' is often the undoing of a career.And often, 'no' must be spoken in competition with the voices of other lawyers who do not have the courage to echo it. For all those reasons, it takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say 'no' when it matters most. It takes moral character."  http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/5999230?access_key=key-16l4we8ag6u3o98ei3l7   Or maybe midgets.   That's an unfair way of phrasing the question. Prominent people from both sides of the aisle speak at WCL all the time. Liberals go to hear speakers from the Federalist Society or from the ACLJ. Conservatives go to hear from the Legal Defense Fund or the ACLU. But there's a big difference between speaking at a school and speaking at a school's graduation.  Had Koh spoken on campus (not during graduation), there would have been massive attendance, some pointed questions during the Q A session, and a worthwhile exchange of ideas.  Graduation speeches are a 1-way communication and they are not a place to give a platform for controversy. The focus should be on the graduates.   For the record, regardless of my beliefs as to the legality of the drone program, I don't find Koh objectionable. I don't think his reading of the law is over the line, the way the Bush Office of Legal Counsel was with the torture memos. My quibble is with EthanB00's claim that WCL students don't want to hear from those they disagree with.   Good grief. I suspect he's the type most likely to fail. Burnout and all that.  No matter what bar prep course you take, how many old exams you look at, or how many hours you spend, odds are high you'll come across a question you didn't study for. Maybe they haven't tested secured transactions in 11 years and it's your lucky day, they decided to bring it back. Maybe it's a hybrid question that's confusing you. Whatever it is, you still need to be able to look at it, think like a lawyer, and even if you have to make up the law, write a cogent, lawyerly analysis. Partial credit goes a long way. If you're fried from going into hermitage to study exclusively, you're not going to be in any condition to analyze anything new.  The bar exam is hard, but it's not THAT hard. And it's pass/fail. Every point you get above passing is a point you should have spent in the sun.   If they are changing you to a position that offers lower pay, do you need to give them 2 weeks notice? What exactly was in that contract you signed?   OK, thanks for the kind correction. :-)   Excellent! I requested it from my local library, so, it should hopefully be in my hands within the next few days.   I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm certainly no expert in British law, but my understanding is that the burden of proof in British libel cases is on the defendant. This means defendants have show that what they said was the truth (or some other defense).  Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the appropriate compensatory damages, but the burden of proof is not on the plaintiff to show that the alleged defamatory words were false, but rather, on the defendant to show that they were true or another defense applies. Getting punitive damages is harder than compensatory damage. Punitive damages require demonstrating actual malice.  Again, I'm no expert on British law. This is my understanding from what I've read, and if I'm wrong, I welcome correction.   Ooh-thanks! I wasn't aware of those. I'm looking into getting them from the library now!   Then I don't understand your argument that there needs to be laws limiting lawyer compensation. It's a free market. Lawyers set their prices and clients decide whether or not to hire a particular lawyer.  In the current scenario, about the court-appointed trustees, sure, they are getting a great deal of money from the case, but they have also recovered a great deal of money for Madoff's victims. Could the court have found lawyers to do it for less? Absolutely. Would those lawyers have done as good or a better job? Not necessarily.    I agree with almost everything you've said except your third point about the Irving v. Lipstadt trial. David Irving was the plaintiff, not the defendant, which might go towards your claim that libel is a hard claim to win, but the trial occurred in Great Britain where libel cases are much easier to win.  Dooperdoo's post was rather misleading when he said that Irving ran afoul of Lipstadt. Lipstadt made a few minor references to him, and Irving picked the fight. He chose to sue. It would be more accurate to say that Lipstadt ran afoul of Irving. Irving got demolished in the courtroom. It became clear that the sting of Lipstadt's words about him were absolutely true. Given how badly Irving looked during and after the trial, some felt sympathy for him and blamed Lipstadt for the decimation of Irving's reputation. This, of course, ignores or forgets that it was Irving who sued Lipstadt, attacking her reputation and livelihood as a scholar, not vice versa, and that Irving's lawsuit required Lipstadt prove Irving was a holocaust denier or at the least, an ally of deniers.  Lipstadt wrote a really worthwhile book on the subject, titled "History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier." It's not every day one comes across a memoir about a court experience that turns out to be a page-turner.   I went to a college with a non-traditional schedule, allowing people to take off a Fall, Winter, or Spring term for internships and make it up with a full summer-term of classes. I interned for the Department of Justice for a Winter and got to do the sort of paralegal work that in the summer, they have law students do.  If you have any degree of flexibility at your school, try for something other than a summer, so you aren't up against all the law students.  Negot8or is right about the issues of unauthorized practice of law, but that's solvable if they put you to use in the paralegal type of role, with some discovery screening, drafting, basic research, etc.   I can't imagine a LL.M. would give a damn about your LSAT score. LSAT programs allegedly have some sort of correlation with 1L grades, which is why law schools use the test. Now that you actually have law school grades, I'd think the LSAT would be meaningless for LL.M. admission.  As a J.D. grad of the school I'm going to for my LL.M., I believe I had an abridged application process, and if they wanted my LSAT score, it would already be in their files, but there was no mention of the score in the application process I went through.   I had an unpaid summer clerkship with the US Marshals Service's Office of General Counsel during the summer between being a 1L and 2L. They required a drug test. They also required an SF-85 which specifically asks about prior drug use.   Certain DoD and contractor jobs that involve working with the President or Vice President. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_White   As others have said, tort reform has nothing to do with limiting lawyer compensation, it has to do with limiting the amount of money victims of bad behavior or mistakes can recover.  Doctors and some others think that this will reduce the amount of insurance they pay, but it doesn't work that way. In states that have implemented tort reform, insurance premiums continued to rise. Why? Because doctors' lawsuit exposure or not, insurance companies raise rates to make more money.  Tort reform is also desired by big corporations as a means of both limiting the amount of exposure they have to lawsuits and as a way to help budget in lawsuits as a cost of doing business. One of the purposes of punitive damages is to provide a significant deterrent to the defendant or others to engage in bad behavior. Capping punitive damages does away with the deterrence effect-it can now be factored in as a business expense, as a known, fixed externality.   What really pisses me off is all the people commenting on the initial reports by blaming Sarah McClay for alleging getting herself killed. People faulted her for going where she wasn't supposed to be, or being on a cellphone, etc., when it turns out, she was just doing her job the way she was told to do it. Not her fault.  I'm sure her friends and family were reading some of those articles and some of those comments, and it would have been cruel to write those comments even had they been true. But they weren't.   There's no such thing as a "social media riot" and there is nothing punishable about inspiring others to speak out. His "harassment" of the principal was protected speech unless it caused a substantial and material disruption at school. Lots of people speaking up on twitter isn't a disruption.  Using his cell phone in class is punishable. Punishing him for the content of his tweets is not okay unless there is important information missing from the press accounts.   Schools are NOT the equivalent of an employer-one chooses to work or not for an employer, whereas students are compelled to attend school.   The main case on student speech is still Tinker v. Des Moines, which beyond flowery words about rights of students not stopping at the schoolhouse gate also gives us the need to demonstrate that the prohibited or punished speech would materially and substantially interfere with school discipline/operation. While there's been some narrowing with Bethel, Kuhlmeier, and Morse, there hasn't been much added to Supreme Court jurisprudence that applies to student speech generally.  Circuit and district courts, dealing with online speech, have come up with a variety of tests to determine if it should be treated the same as in-school speech or given more protection (such as in the Third Circuit's rulings in Layshock v. Hermitage School District, and the final ruling in J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District). Here, the facts are different because the tweets themselves were made from on-campus. I suspect that would lead a court to say that the tweets are on-campus speech, but even then, that only allows punishment if the disruption requirement of Tinker is met. I don't see any evidence of a disruption or potential for disruption. Instead, the school punished student speech it didn't like because it didn't like it, and that's a First Amendment violation and grounds for a 42 U.S.C. 1983 suit.   Here's a link to reddiquette. http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette I draw your attention to the last line that says "[Please don't c]omplain about cross posts. Just because you saw it in one place, doesn't mean everyone has seen it. Just vote and move on."   Yeah. I missed your post in /r/news and I deleted my link after you called my attention to yours. Your complaint here is unwarranted.   If you have Amazon Prime, there are three seasons of Good Eats available.   Darn. Missed it. Sorry.   A school can certainly punish a student for using a cell-phone in class, but punishing him for the content of his tweets seems unconstitutional. The tweets listed in the article do not rise to the level of a substantial or material disruption of the schoolhouse environment.   No disruption+pure speech=First Amendment protected speech (leaving aside discussion of exceptions for lewd speech, speech promoting illicit drug use, etc.).  Assuming that the punishment for using a cell phone to tweet in class would not have been 3 days suspension (without punishment for content of the tweets), said student would seem to have grounds to sue the school and the school officials involved in his suspension. I don't see grounds to claim qualified immunity on a case this basic.

Some schools look at your highest score, others will average your LSAT scores. Might be worthwhile taking the time to get it right the first time. On the other hand, in case something goes horribly wrong at the test center, it's a good idea to not leave it to the last minutehaving an opportunity to do a redo if need be is best.   The footage from KFOR and News9 is scary... I hope the folks in Shawnee make it okay.         Well-named. They are adorable.   Yep. Preempted. Food labeling is within the purview of the FDA under the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. The NLEA explicitly preempts state labeling laws that are not identical to the requirements of the NLEA. 21 U.S.C.  343-1. Between the FDCA and the NLEA, there's a very strong argument that anything not explicitly preempted by the NLEA is still implicitly preempted by the federal statutes occupying the field.         Well, I'm glad you posted it. I hadn't seen this one before.   I loved my StarTac. Best thing about flip phones is the ability to hang up on people by slamming it shut. Try hanging up in anger on a smartphone and you're liable to break a finger!   You can't understand why someone who was traumatized by being drugged and gang-raped by colleagues, and treated as a criminal instead of a victim by police, might do whatever she was told to try to make the threats and harassment stop? Really?   I think the hardest 1L subject is Property, and no, not just because of the dreaded Rule Against Perpetuity. The other 1L courses offer a overarching, cohesive (or semi-cohesive) structure to study. Everything fits together pretty neatly in Torts, or Contracts, things are at the least interconnected in Con Law and obv. goes back to one document, Civ Pro probably has the most cohesive structure, etc., but 1L Property is made up of the bits that weren't important enough to be their own class.   Real Estate transactions are mostly in their own class, Landlord/Tenant matters are mostly in their own class, Wills, Trusts and Estates has its own class, etc. Property is the stitched-together leftovers, with all the coherence of the monster in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Personally, I suggest replacing Property with Administrative Law. It's a subject lawyers are far more likely to encounter.   Although obvious, it's worth reiterating a law exam grade is just how well you did on that one day, at that one time, on that one exam. It's not necessarily a reflection of how smart you are, how hard you studied, or how much you learned in a term.  Good Guy Law Professor at the end of one of my classes this year said he'd be willing to write us a recommendation regardless of what we got in his class precisely because he understood the above.  	110

But Joffrey is really much more hated. and that King's Landing city commander who Jon Snow executed.    If you want to strike the right balance, I think rather than doing a lot of different types of programming languages (C++, Java, etc), you are better off focusing on a single type of programming and building some depth. Sometimes the easiest to pick up, and often the easiest to demonstrate to an employer is web development. So my recommendation would be to focus on a single area and do a project on that. Either contribute to an open source project on github, or build a practical app.   Its often easier to code when you feel a sense of accomplishment and doing classes or tutorials on C++ 101 etc, rarely gives that sense of accomplishment and doesn't particularly stand out on a resume to an employer. Whether you are doing app or web development, maybe its better to do a small project that you can deploy, perhaps in combination with your networking / infrastructure skills, and that becomes a valuable thing to show as your body of work and will make you much more employable.    All the time. Not just shows, there are so many movies I haven't watched yet (all the summer releases so far), so many TV shows (still haven't watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Walking Dead, OITNB), still need to get to podcasts (ReplyAll, etc.), have 1000s of items waiting on my instapaper queue.   I think I'll have a lot of fun when I retire in 30 years.   There is too much great content and I am not sure how everything will find audiences.    This especially happens when people are meeting either someone senior or a in a position of power (like a CEO, senior manager or something, or a celebrity). My point is a) what could they possibly say in a few minutes that would make them seem smart and b) even if they were freaking Einstein, are you really smart enough to assess that yourself. We just end up further elevating people who are in power and / or are articulate   After reading HP, I have always wondered why instead of selling digital photo frames, they don't sell digital gif frames, so we can have gifs of people waving or chatting or enjoying themselves instead of just still photos.

 I'm tempted too. If I can't fix it I'm selling it   Here's Part 1 incase you missed it.  http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2mlkar/the_man_who_lives_under_our_house/   I had another experience and I believe I now know the cause of what has been happening at our house. Originally we thought that the house that had burned down before ours may have claimed an unlucky soul, but after further research I discovered that everyone that had been living at that house had all survived. I wasn't sure how i felt about discovering this. I wasn't sure if I was glad that no one was injured or not. What happened was where the house used to be was in between my neighbors house and ours. Once it burnt down the land was split between two properties. How could the house be haunted if no one was injured? Then what could have been causing everything that has been happening at the house. Was the original fire an accident?  Last night we were all tucked into bed ready for a good night sleep. I had brought my girlfriends sons bed into the room with us; to make sure he would be able to sleep after the other night. I was fast asleep as well as my girlfriend too when we heard her son calling for me. I sat up to see if everything was all right and he was laying in bed with his eyes wide open. He said in a very calm yet nervous tone, "My bed slid towards the closet, can you please close the door?". The bed was no longer parallel to the closet, but the front of the bed(where his head lays) was pointed towards the open closet door open. Thinking fast I told him to just come to bed with us because I had to move his bed to get something. (This was a lie but there was no point into sending him into a panic state) Why was the closet door open? My girlfriend always closed the door before she went to bed because she couldn't sleep with it open. I shut the door and jumped back into bed, just hoping to sleep through the night.  This is when things began to really go south. When I woke up I noticed I couldn't open my eyes or move my body what so ever. I thought oh just sleep paralysis, my body will wake up eventually. It didn't. All of the sudden I heard a weird bird outside shriek and my chest began to tighten up. It felt as if a 500 pound person was standing on my chest. I then began to panic. I started sweating bullets from the heat and short breaths, and my arm that had been laying across my neck began to push down on my neck. I was choking and I couldn't scream and couldn't defend myself. I was helpless as I was slowly suffocating. All I could do was say a prayer in my head. As soon as I finished everything went back to normal. I was awake and so was my body. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. I just sat awake and made sure my girlfriend and her son were all right.  My grandpa had told me stories of demons that sit on the chest of sleeping victims. They are incubus and the succubus. These demons are known for sitting on the chests of men and women asleep. What these demons are known for is that it can take either a female or male shape and will sit on the sleepers chest and could even sleep with that human. If a female is slept with this demon they could be impregnated by that demon. If a male sleeps with that demon the demon could take over the males body. I wasn't touched that way by the demons nor will i allow them too. Also they will try and kill infants. They are easily researched and widely believed. I fell like that is what has been happening at this house. And the "Man that lives underneath our house" really does live underneath our house. Just much farther down than originally believed. I'm very scared for my girlfriend and her son and myself. Good thing my Grandpa has dealt with demons and spirits so I am going to fight this evil spirit. He used to be a white witch in Ireland before making his way to the states. He is very knowledgeable about demons and fighting demons. Much of the same as a priest, just not a religious figure. I will post a part three telling you guys what I am going to do about the demon that is ruining our lives. Also I will explain other ways to protect yourself from evil. Wish us luck.    Demon moved girlfriends sons bed. Sat on my chest and chocked me. Must fight them.   	2
 God bless you for showing me this 3    I want whatever drugs you are on.   You do realize this happened a while ago right?   OMG this is animal cruelty...   Since i went through the phase myself i listen to them and show them facts that disprove their theories. And they found out on their own as well.   Mostly government and ufo conspiracies.  And they all eventually lost interest when more and more of these theories were proven to be nothing more than someones wild imagination.   	6

 How old is your laptop? On my previous laptop (also Lenovo) I used to have lots of intermittent disconnects and slow speed.   A CS student told me that it was probably because my wifi card didn't support the new IllinoisNet standards (you know, the b/g/n stuff) and so I couldn't get maximum speeds out of it. That might explain why your roommate continues to surf on the waves of the blue ocean while you languish with a surfboard in quicksand.  I know it does matter because with a new laptop, my connection problems have almost disappeared.   So, this is my photostream on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps . None (or maybe one somewhere) of those photos is processed. I had stayed away from processing because of two reasons:  1. I believed that, as a beginner, I needed to learn how to take photographs 2. I was lazy  I decided some time back that I was just avoiding processing for no real reason and everyone was doing it anyway. So I decided I would learn Lightroom. I actually posted on here and got great feedback on learning how to use Lightroom (http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/xc64s/postprocessing/)   My first chance to use my skills on photos from a recent trip to Yosemite.  Here are my thoughts:  1. **While taking pictures**, I was less worried about the getting the settings right. At one point, getting the camera back from a friend, I continued shooting in Auto and thinking to myself that the overexposure could easily be fixed in Lightroom. I realized even at that point in time that I wasn't enjoying myself with taking pictures as much as I usually do. The composition half was the same, of course, but I was no longer playing with settings and irritating my friend to stand still while I tried various combinations.  2. **While processing** I really hated correcting the setting mistakes. I was really ashamed of the pics that were underexposed, overexposed etc. _It turns out that at some point in my discovery of photography, I had grown to love the process of making sure the composition and settings were right in camera_.  3. **While processing** I really, really came to love the crop tool. Having never used it before, I had never imagined that just cutting out part of a photo could be so powerful in getting the feeling I want from a photograph across.  4. Processing takes up much more time than I thought and as far as Lightroom is concerned, is very monotonous. Lightroom is designed to reduce this monotony, I know. But it's still a pain..  Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there and get some opinions from /r/photography on the whole processing...process. None of my friends are into photography like I am, so reddit is where I talk about this stuff. What do you guys post-process for? What's your philosophy on it?  I think I see the point of processing for professional photographers, where the end product is all-important. But for me, I think I will stay away from post-processing (except for cropping, that shit is awesome) and _enjoy the process of taking the pictures_ more.   **tl;dr** Tried post-processing...see the point, but don't really think it's for me. What do you guys think?   Poor guy/girl asks about bike safety and gets tangential lesson on time management.   Yo, down for this!   Wow..that's fast...and awesome! Good luck and good on your friends!      Why is this on r/linux?  And the damages were reduced by less than 1%.   I thought it was only because tomato was the most "filling" juice of the choices..   I'm using the Windows 8 free consumer preview right now. It's not too shabby. The thing is, for me, Metro turned out to be a gimmick. I used it a lot in the first few weeks and then hardly ever after. I'm on the desktop side where it's not really distinguishable from Windows 7. Well, that Start Button is missing, but typing *Super+Q* instead of *Super* wasn't too much of a stretch.  It does look better and the animations seem more mature for sure.  Though if I had to pay, I wouldn't upgrade.   Not helping here, but I think that's the apartment where Hugh Hefner lived!  Oh maybe I can help, why don't you ask in the Espresso? I'm sure they'll know who owns the building   My roommate last year had a ferret. I'll ask her and edit this reply as soon as I know. But AFAIR, she went to the VetMed school...  EDIT: This is what she had to say:  at the vet school   on the other side of japan house   they are really good   expensive, and you spend twice longer there than you should, but the ppl are really nice and you're sure the job is done very carefully  Hope this helps and hope your little guy gets better!   Didn't he die without completing it?    I'm here for an hour starting now and wouldn't mind meeting someone new for a beer!  EDIT: Greyhound station on Harrison, I mean   Source(s)?   THose UltraLite ones look amazing! I'm leaning towards waiting for them to get back in stock even if it means having to skip Memorial Day.  Thanks!   I am trying to buy backpacks for 3-4 day trips. Any suggestions?  What size (L) should I go with?   I've been looking at REI.com and backcountry.com, but they seem well...too expensive.  I was looking to buy something below $120, am I being unreasonable?   I don't want bells and whistles, just a backpack that will last through a lot of trips.   It depends. Waves interfere. The sounds from the two machines may cancel each other out, add on to each other or any combination in between depending on the relative phase of the waves.  Also, decibels are a logarithmic scale.   Especially since you're sending 4 texts over two months. That's perfectly fine.    don't take nice pictures, take useful pictures.   I want to feel it  All this is after you take lots of pictures. Take pictures. Crappy pictures of air conditioners where you obsess over the angle of the vents. Pictures of dogs, where you try to frame one nostril and a leaf. You get the idea.   It's like that common saying that you need 10000 hours to become an expert. If you want to feel, you have to learn to feel. Just keep taking pictures.   INTERNALIZE ALL THE CONCEPTS!  You should be having fun taking pictures. Take your camera everywhere, or at least walk it on a tight leash for an hour every day. Eventually you'll find that the camera is asking you to click pictures of that strange glow on the sidewalk at night.  **tl;dr: The more you internalize, the less you have to think about while shooting**   Yes, the horse's eye. No...Red eye removal did not work at all. IT complained that it couldn't detect a red eye.  I thought that was what Lens Flare is...it isn't?   So, All my google searching seemed to indicate that Lightroom is a bad choice for removing Lens Flare. Is this true?   Is there anyway I can remove Lens Flare in Lightroom?   The image is here: http://i.imgur.com/fvsFC.jpg  EDIT: I wanted to post the whole image, but got permission only for the cropped version..  Thanks!    "It's falling in my lap, but there's the evident situation of her living next door. And by "it," I mean my penis.  Your penis is falling in your lap?   I'm up for Ultimate any time!   Oh nice :) I actually researched cavitation for quite a bit when I was getting my MS, but it completely slipped my mind when replying to this question!  So cavitation would prevent the onset of supersonic flow itself?  EDIT: Some googling reveals that shock waves in water are indeed, different from shock waves in air...They do exist though. Cool :)   It would be the same. Shockwaves et al. The speed of sound is in fact a measure (well sort of) of the compressibility of a medium. In a truly incompressible medium, speed of sound is infinity.  So a torpedo breaking the speed of sound would cause a very similar reaction as in air. The answer is similar for your second question as well.  Though, the shockwave might decay sooner due to the higher viscosity of water. This is something I'm not fully sure of...  Also, of course, the drag of the torpedo is much, much higher and the speed of sound is also much, much higher, so getting to the supersonic region would be pretty much impossible.  **tl;dr** Speed of sound is infinity in incompressible medium. There are no shockwaves in incompressible flow.    I don't understand your question:  1/ What purpose is the rope serving?  2/ Why aren't we just talking about the planets? What are the objects for?     I had RES, but hadn't noticed the Save function...Thanks!   No no. I guess we're arguing semantics. My point is a philosophical one and I do agree that at some point in the details, the why merges with the how. Scientists believe that if you start with the merged question, you will get answers to both even on a higher level. Well, I believe that's true too.  But while we don't have the answers, we have to work with our individual senses of beauty.   Which guy? I'm talking about aesthetics relative to us.  I think aesthetics and artistry are useful "black boxes" for detailed scientific processes in our body which we don't understand fully.   It's like programming in a high level language without knowing assembly.   I came here to say "Yes. Refraction", but I see this a much deeper question. So I will just comment so that I can easily get back to this thread and wait for the answer :)   Umm...When a scientist asks "Why?", he really means "How?", which refers to the underlying mechanisms that get the sound out of the bird and how that sound is heard by humans and interpreted as song by a combination of stuff happening in the brain.  When an artist looks at a bird singing, he/she takes all of the above for granted and looks at the aesthetic qualities of the song. These aesthetic qualities are subjective. By subjective, I mean that they involve a lot of processes in the brain and science still hasn't got to that point.  My opinion, that would be.   Fuck...Can't believe I've spent 3 years on KDE not noticing that!!  Thanks...well....a lot!   Why is Okular text selection limited to rectangles?

Light travels. Light is received. Sight is made.  EDIT: Sorry, I think I misunderstood.  So..   T=0, you're on earth.   T=0, you're in space   T=1 year, you see yourself from space and then teleport back.   T=2 years, you see yourself in space.     That works.   Barring all the physical laws that might be broken, yes.   Getting down voted because those questions sort of have answers.   The Turing test is considered a reasonable measure of AI.  Intelligence itself has many definitions and AI researchers are working to meet all of them     There's no point using them _instead_ of exercise. They do help in muscle building, because they're proteins.  You don't need them unless you're doing a _lot_ of weights, etc. They're needed basically, if you're exercising more than the protein you can get from your daily diet (so it depends on whether you're vegetarian too).  **tl;dr** They do what they say.    Thanks! Will keep at it :)   Okay. I can do 60 kg wooden plank, facing the wind (i.e. the wind is blowing on the flat side).  Drag coefficient of flat plate = 1.17  Force on plate = Cd * 0.5 * V2 (velocity squared) * S (area)  Let S = 180 * 30 (6ft by 1ft) cm^2 = 0.54 m^2  So force is = 0.3159 V2  This force will act through the center of the plank.  Now imagine a plank standing on it's side and weighing 74 kg (my weight). Thickness of the plank is 30 cm (0.3 m), i.e. my foot.  Now the weight will act through the center of mass of the plank, i.e. 0.15 m from the edge.   So the moment due to the weight will be 74 * 9.8 * 0.15 ( 9.8 is gravity). = 108.78 N-m   The drag (force due to wind) acts through half the height of the plank (90 cm = 0.9 m). So the moment is  0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9  So equating both moments  0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9  = 108.78  i.e v = 19.5 m/s  i.e. Works out to **43 mph.**  I had assumed I would get an answer closer to 80 despite the fact that this analysis assumes that the plank doesn't exert any force to stay upright, but oh well :)   ******** Well, Wikipedia says that drag coefficient for a tall flat plate is 1.98!!  So the drag force will now be 108.78 * 1.98/1.17 = 184.089  And so the new speed will be **53 mph**.  Not bad...But really, I think all that's missing is to increase the net drag because the human will also exert a moment to stay upright.  EDIT: Also missing is the fact that a non-perpendicular wind would need to be stronger...Phew   I don't think we're doing the whole calculations consciously.   What we're doing (I think, and from a weak robotics background and observation) is akin to closed loop control. We guess where the baseball is going to be and keep our hands there. Then keep updating the position of our hand as we keep observing the baseball.  This way, we only need to do basic math (move hand delta left/right/up/down/forward/back) instead of complete calculations (move hand to (x,y,z) ). These calculations are much simpler and don't need to take into account a million different things.    Manning up seems to involve not doing something every man does ;-)  Yes, I see your point :) I'm trying, I'm trying!   No. No one's given up.  It's not only a matter of finding out which senses to provide (which in itself is very complicated).  For one, the number of parallel computations in the brain is far beyond what any computer today is capable of. Also, AI is being approached from a thousand different angles.  Take the simple thing Input - Process - Output. Research is focusing on learning (i.e. making a robot learn) how to categorize input, to learn how to process, to learn how to output. And every combination and small step in between.  In a senior level AI course that I took, the professor told us this at the beginning: "People think we have 1 mile to go, and so the media tells us we're almost there. The truth is we've gone 5 miles and now we think there's 100 miles to go"  It is also very important to realize that AI has actually overtaken the brain in many things. Machine learning algorithms can take many decisions faster and better than their human counterparts, as evidenced by tests on medical diagnoses, fly-by-wire systems. To me somehow, even though these things aren't "true" intelligence, it is just as impressive.   Anyway the definition of "true" intelligence comes from our intelligence, so we're inherently biased ;-)  In my opinion however, before pure AI reaches intelligence, we'll all be hybrids, ala Ghost in the Shell.     How do you guys manage?  I'm trying and so far here's my record:  2 days-Reset-1 day-Reset-1 day-Rest ...   Sigh...   Oh yes yes maybe. I have the ATT version and the T-mobile one has more than mine for sure.  But it doesn't _really_ matter. There are always devs porting ROMs all around the place.  EDIT: Not sure where you can check this. But galaxys2root.com is a good place for the S2. If you just poke around XDA long enough, you'll suddenly find one day that you have an opinion!   I can answer some questions:  Will the S2 be outdated anytime soon? I know that it won't be getting Jellybean, how much will I be missing?  I don't think it'll be "too outdated", i.e. it'll only feel outdated if you feel jealous of people who will have better phones than you. It will be able to everything you want.  Unofficial Jellybean builds are already out. I used Jellybean for a few days. Was a lot of fun. Google now is really cool. You have to root, of course.  How big is the switch from Gingerbread to ICS?   ICS is like Windows XP to Windows 7  If I root the phone, can I get rid of the bloatware that service provider install on the phone ?  Yes.  Can I brick the phone while rooting? If yes can it be unbricked?  Yes. Yes.  Can the S2 be used as a wifi hotspot for my ipad? I know it can be done with android tablet but I'm not sure about the ipad.  It can be used as a hotspot yes. I can't see why anything that can connect to wifi can't connect to it.  Does the phone matter when used as a hotspot i.e. any differences (network-wise) between S2 and an older android phone? -What's the best variant of the S2 to buy, I think I got some choices between i9100, i9100P, i9100G and the T-mobile's one (SGH-T989)?  No idea. But the T-mobile phone has more ROMs, so more hacking fun.  Just to make sure I'm not missing on anything: is there any better choice than the S2? Something with the lastest hardware/software like the S3 but with similar shape/form factor as the S2/Ip4?  Of course everything with better hardware is better!   Aerospace Engineer here, but guessing nevertheless!  1/ The wind conditions would be very very unpredictable for one. Lack in wind and the rover doesn't land. We don't have wind measurements at all the heights that the Mars rover is going to land in, so calibrating the supply would be a big headache.  2/ Power requirements: Maybe whatever they're using is just more efficient. Maybe it's easier to design.  3/ A rotating thing in space just seems to make bad engineering sense to me. One broken blade, one screw comes loose and everything goes to the dogs. No moving parts unless necessary (I see you have something against comments that mention moving parts, but really...even if there were a hundred moving parts and you could avoid the next one, you should. Moving parts suck)  4/ There is probably a complicated control law governing the output of the supply. Such output control would be much harder with a wind turbine, whose output actually depends on external factors, which is not the case for the thermoelectric supply.  **tl;dr**: Hard to predict, hard to control, hard to build    The tiles are for shielding. The material is what makes the difference. I don't think anything else really matters.  I saw a demonstration once where a guy held a space shuttle tile from one side. A flame torch was blown on the other side for more than 5 minutes and the heat didn't reach his hand at all! The material is really, really heat resistant.   And a lot of them are white too :-/  EDIT: Added a comma.   Those are some useful suggestions....Thanks a lot for taking the time!  Really cool pictures...I was going to move to 500px, but after seeing the pics of people who've added me as a contact, I'm going to stay on Flickr!    Yeah, I've read a lot about the stuff that was done in the dark room, and the stuff Ansel Adams did. That's where the choice of many of the tools and presets available in Lightroom and similar software comes from, right :)   Thanks a lot! Yeah, it was a lot of fun :)   Thanks a lot!!    Yup. I knew that and do agree with all that you say :)    I actually have access to Lynda through university! Thanks a lot!! That's what I'll do now!   That's what I'm doing right now. But I was afraid I would get stuck without knowing if I what I was doing was actually improving the picture ;-)   True that. Making the switch immediately!   I started taking pictures a few years back and didn't do any processing. More so because I was lazy to learn than anything else.  My photostream is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps (Just lost pro status, sorry!). None of the photos on there are processed. I used to be proud of that for some reason.   Now, I'm ready. I have Lightroom installed and want to learn the basics (color adjustments, tonal curves etc.)  Are there some good tutorials about this? Books or something along the lines that give me an idea of what good processing is would be good as well!  I did check out r/Lightroom, but it's not active at all..  EDIT: Thanks a lot for all your suggestions! Lynda.com it is!! :)   Here are the facts. That's all I have the energy for right now:  1. I am a poor, unfunded graduate student. 2. My mom had a brain tumor 4 years back. She was getting better. Everyone (including the doctors) said she was the bravest patient they'd seen. She was the prime example of how a lifelong practice of Yoga helps someone get over the toughest obstacles. Then she got two more tumors in the spine and was paralyzed, immobilized, disoriented and delirious. Yoga could go fuck itself. God laughed in her face. Now show me what you've got, He said from the nothingness that he is. She's deteriorating every day, and there's nothing anybody can do about it. 3. My sister-in-law is pregnant. The baby was the answer to all our problems. Where if we looked one way at my mom, we would be unhappy thinking about the amazing woman she was, we would be happy looking at the baby, with all its potential for the future. The baby is now diagnosed with Down Syndrome. 4. I can't do anything for any of these people. All I can do is fly from one house to the other, spend a little time with them and get back to my own miserable existence, which involves whiskey, cigarettes and loneliness of the worst kind in large quantities.  I know I'll learn to deal with all of this in time. But what do I do today?  I have no one to talk to. Well, I do. But I don't want to trouble any of them.  Reddit, so I'm troubling you. I don't know why. I'm sorry.    I am in Portland for the next 2-3 weeks and was looking to buy a used bike. I looked at the co-op and everything they have is more than $350, which is more than I can afford.  Is there another good place to buy used (well, new as well) bikes? I am looking for something in the $200-300 range.    I'm a grad student who's done most of his programming in Matlab and now, due to speed considerations on numerical simulations, have to program in C++.  I am familiar with syntax and some level of OOP concepts, but most of my C++ programming so far has been on Linux, where writing (in Vim) and compiling (g++) has never been an issue.  Now however, my laptop has Windows and I have no idea what to use to compile etc and would welcome suggestions. I do think Vim on windows looks ugly.  Eclipse seems cool, but seems like too much for me. Does anyone have anything to say about it?  What about QT creator? I seem to see only good things being said about it, but is it still worth considering if my program will not have a GUI?  EDIT: Thanks everyone for the recommendations! Got even more useful information than I had expected! I am going to try Mex with MS Virtual Studio first and parallelly install Linux in parallel.     Oh come on. This doesn't answer anything. I think the teacher was completely right, though she could have attempted something, I guess.  Your answer begets 50 more questions, like what are series, how do we know they converge, which leads to sequences and the foundations of real analysis.  Answering those questions is exactly what college math is about, so the teacher was right, I would say.      Ah...That be making sense and I be standing corrected!   Isn't this a random, irrelevant statistic? Correlating two variables that really have nothing to do with each other?  They interviewed 5000 people, of which 5 % were LGBT. Which means the sample was really small.  And for how many of those people did being LGBT have anything to do with brand perception:  "I don't like iPhone because there are no widgets" "Android is cool. It lets me tinker with settings"  I'm really not sure what to make of this article. Any ideas?     Is there a decent app that plays Youtube links in the background? Either as video or as audio, since most of what I do on youtube is listen to music.  I tried harex, and Queuetube, but both of those are quite bad. Harex refuses to quit, and is a pain to get working. Queuetube stutters and stammers.  Is there a good app that does this? If it could give me a choice when I clicked on a youtube link, that would be awesome!   That looks perfect.. Thanks!    Reddit,   My friend has a Motorola Droid Razr and it came preinstalled with Swype and new languages apparently can't be downloaded for preinstalled Swype.  Does anyone have a recommendation for a swiping keyboard that handles both French and English, preferably together or atleast allows you to change at the touch of a button?  I use Swiftkey 3, but for some reason it didn't work for her!    No. I have the regular S2..   Thansk! I did not know that! Any particular ROM you recommend / What ROM are you using?  This would be done through Odin right?   Really? :O AT T?  Mine said No updates available...And it lets me check only once a day.  That would be awesome!   I rented a one-way rental at night (midnight). The LEX was $90. The rental was $140 for a day. Gas was $25 or thereabouts.  So it's not cheaper by itself. But there were 3 of us, so it worked out cheaper for us.   Oh sorry. I have the AT T Galaxy S2...so SGH-i777 (assuming there's only one model number of AT T S2s)   So, I got a Galaxy S2 yesterday...  I had a Motorola Bravo till then, which was a cheap, slow but did-what-a-cheap-phone-should-do phone. The Galaxy (even though it seems like the S2 is behind the curve) is much, much faster, smoother and all that.  It has Gingerbread (2.3.7).  I tried rooting it yesterday. I rooted with a 2.3.4 zedomax kernel (only because that was the most popular result on Google) and my Wifi stopped working. I flashed a Shiyah kernel to fix it and then everything stopped working. After a very scary fifteen minutes, i unrooted to 2.3.4 and then upgraded back to 2.3.7.  So after 3 hours of meddling, I'm back to where I started.  I figure that my problems arose because I was using an outdated rooting guide.  What are people using to root the SGS2s these days?   A link to a good XDA thread or a blogpost would be greatly appreciated. I can't differentiate between good and bad on XDA without help yet.  My main goal not the root, but ICS. I know I can install the ICS firmware directly. Has anyone tried that?    Oh yes, we passed by Gem lakes. We were supposed to camp ahead of there actually, but didn't make it in time!  It had snowed just before we got there...so there was quite a bit, but nothing unmanageable...   I didn't have any cold season wear. I had to borrow a pair of thin gloves from friends and wear socks over them! My layers were two layers of sweatshirts and one t-shirt underneath. Like I said, unprepared :D But even with my stupidity, it was manageable, except for the night, which was slightly uncomfortable.  Oh, and wear sunglasses! I didn't and had a very unpleasant encounter with snow blindness!   It was really cold at night, though more due to lack of preparation than the weather itself.   And the fact that I kind of slipped into Long Lake and got my shoes completely soaked.  The climb was not cold at all. We were taking off layers as we got higher!       I'll be on the patio with 2-3 people. I have light blue polo shirt on. And I'll be there by 10 PM!   I'm not sure either how to recognize people who get there before me!   It's happening... Meetup at Bling Pig (the brewery) at 10 PM for beer.  I'll be there at 10 PM! See you all there.  Despite all rumors and unintended insinuations to the contrary, undergrads are welcome!   Yes!   I won't be here the Tuesday following this one, but will certainly make it every other Tuesday in the Summer!   Get them along too!   Either one? How about starting at the brewery? I haven't been there as much as the usual one.   I am sorry, I posted asking for a meetup and then promptly forgot about it!  How about Meeting Tuesday at Blind Pig for beer and talk?  EDIT: The brewery (for starters!)   Any other Grad students around? And interested in meeting for a beer or two or three?   EDIT: We seem to have something here. How about Sunday night? I'll post details tomorrow. Also no hate for undergrads intended, all beer drinkers welcome :D        Hello all,  My friends and I want to go backpacking over the long weekend. Any suggestions close to LA?  The only real constraint is that it shouldn't be too crowded.  Thanks!  EDIT: Wow...Thank you all for your suggestions...this is awesome!   Wow! Grad student going through exactly the same thing here! Wow... It's scary how much is the same in my life.  Well, I can't answer any of your questions, because I'm trying to find out myself. I can tell you it's really frustrating. It's been three years now (two with non-reciprocating soul mate) and nothing gets better.  We have hope. And cigarettes.   This kind of gets into the dirty details of things, but OPs explanation was only conceptual. The ONLY real interaction (that causes any sort of net transfer of energy) between the wings and the air is through friction, i.e. viscosity. No viscosity, no lift.   The idea is Viscosity - Circulation - Lift.   There is a net loss in momentum of the air and a net force on the wing (both lift and drag), i.e. Newton's Law. Yes, the air is deflected downwards in order to generate lift,  If you integrate the pressure over the entire surface of the wing, you get a net force, which can be split into lift and drag.  Also, "Air hitting the bottom surface" of the wing is just wrong. Imagine a flat plate with flow perpendicular to it. Air is hitting the bottom surface in all glory, but lift is infact zero (all the force is drag).  Aerodynamics researcher (PhD) and teacher of Senior Level Applied Aerodynamics.   Pedantic note: Faster air doesn't "lead" to static pressure. Low static pressure and high velocity are equivalent in a flow. One is not the cause of the other.  Lift is generated by circulation and circulation alone. Your explanation is kind of incorrect in the sense that it does not explain why lift would be zero in an inviscid flow.

 I am fairly interested though.... Despite the 'sarcasm' surrounding it, I legitimately think its a pretty awesome movie. It's loveable and funny and I'd be thrilled to talk about it.   What the hell is wrong with you   Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson (How I Met Your Mother)   Gah, you ruined it.   Would have expected to see North Korea by now. Has a knack for poping up in 'worst places'.   And all this science, I don't understand   Pass the text book so we can puff up this-no I can't fix this, he's just a complete and utter stoner.   I honestly see absolutely no problem here. It's past 1, and you may have convinced me to go make a sandwich.   I figured no one cared. To be honest I'm a little surprised people still read that. But I guess if it brings some sort of closure to one person, hold on.   Oh boy, you caught me at a good time. So my dad has this thing that builds up a about a metric shit ton of air pressure. Its made for powering nail guns, but can be used for all sorts of things. They didn't really put a responsible limit on the machine because they didn't really put a respinsible limit on the wild number of attachments you could hook it up to. Theres one for blowing around pressurized air, one for power washing, you name it.  Anyhow, I was supposed to clean the front walk way today. My walkway is made up of a bunch of stones with no cement in between. Shit gets stuck in there and its almost impossible to get out. I was generously given the air cannon to cleanse those hard to reach cracks. It started out just fine. I pumped it up to a shit ton per square inch, and we were off. Everything was effortlessly coming out, no ammount of dirt and leaves could stand in my way! And then I got bored. I decided to crank the pressure up another half shit ton. I distinctly remember saying, "Let's see what this baby can do!" Oh, how I would regret those words.  I started aiming the little pressure gun thingy around my yard to see how far it reached. About 25 feet for those of you wondering. It was shaped kinda like a realish gun, so it was pretty fun. Suddenly someone shouted, "Hey!" *Shit!* I thought, *did someone just catch me really embarrassingly playing with fucking air?!* Accept I didn't even get those rational thoughts together. I just turned to face my accuser. Fun fact, sometimes when you're surprised your muscles tighten and tense up. This can be especially bad if you're holding anything dangerous, like, say an air cannon. Before I knew it, a shit ton and a half square inches of pressure hit my brother directly in the balls at point blank range. It very literally blew him away. I mean he had some decent hang time considering how many steps he had to go down. Unfortunately for him, he didn't even have the weeds in the cracks of the bricks to comfort his fall.  He just got back from the hospital and apparently were telling everyone he got hit by a base ball from a rouge pitching machine. Only me, him, my parents, my neighbors gardeners, the lovely doctors at Widmore Medical and my friends will know the truth. Oh, and now the internet I suppose. Shhh.  **TL;DR I hit my brother in the balls with an air gun pumped up to exactly one and a half shit tons per square inch of pressure. Recently released from hospital, no permanent injuries. If you don't count pride.**   What in the fucking fuck...   I'd have to see his study habits to really find the issue here.   Upvote for your time, sir.   Paul Blart. Paul fills the cracks in the heart. Go away pain.   Peanut Blart and Jelly   THERE BETTER NOT BE ANY MALL COP 2 SPOILERS HERE   Oscar nominations?*   A big fat upvote! Gracias, mi amigo.   No, this is /u/test_subject3655...   I actually spend a lot of time in Wisconsin, I was just in Milwaukee two weeks ago (complete coincidence, I still don't live there). One time I actually met Hulk Hogan in the Milwaukee airport, bandana and all. It was weird, we had a very normal conversation. At no point during our 13ish minute chat did he nor I acknowledge that he was a fairly famous celebrity. He just sat down next to me, asked me to pass the news paper, and we talked about the headlines for a while. So to answer your question, its pretty nice this time of year.   Yes, they absolutely did, but Halloween itself is a Christian holiday. Of course there were other influences. I guess I don't really see what your arguing here, Halloween is a Christian holiday just like Samhin was pagan. Historians today aren't really sure where Halloween itself originated, although there are many possibilities, Samhin among them.  Of course many Christian traditions come from other influence, whats your point though? Halloween is simply not celebrated in paganism, period. Nor any other religion. Hence 'completely Christian'.  EDIT: For the record, the term 'a completely Christian holiday' does not at all mean that there isn't other influence in it, nor does it imply it.   Yeah but...its fact. What is there to disagree with? And ambiguity of history?   Awww. Gracias, I'll fix it.   I canged it three times. Started with intents and purposes, changed it when someone said that was wrong, changed it back when I realized he was wrong. The first change was about two minutes in though, so no edit asterisk was added, the second edit was when I put in the EDIT. To be honest, I didn't see your comment until well after.    It doesn't change in quoted text...  Gotcha.  Try it.  I think the edit was the part with EDIT next to it.   Usually I skip straight to step two. I like to stay ahead of the game.   Reunion potentially revived?   Nope, [this one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33yg8j/what_are_some_unusual_things_your_parents/cqpm5jw) takes the cake.   Well no, not necessarily. That's definitely a possibility, but the origin of Halloween is still debated. Some think it was from Samhain, some think Pomona, or even Parentalia. No one really knows where it came from, but Halloween itself is a completely Christan holiday, regulardless of what holiday preceded and maybe even inspired it.  EDIT: Downvotes? I don't really mind, but why?   Although more of a commercial thing now, Halloween is 100% a Christian holiday. Its an evening of feasting to remember the dead (hence it's being called the day of the dead in places like Mexico), particularly dead saints (hallows). Costumes and fun was a way to approach the sad topic of death more lightly. And the 'scary' aspect of Halloween come from farmers and people dressing up to scare evil spirits away from their harvest. The entire holiday is essentially Christian though... If I were you I would tell them about it, just to see what they thought.   Thats so sad, some of my favorite memories are playing outside with neighborhood kids :(   Were you an only child? I feel like this couldn't even be enforced any other way.   Fucking fuck you... I don't even know what that is, I noped out after the word 'urethral'. The picture didn't help either.   'Picture' isn't capitalized...I think he means the portrait...   I had a dog like that... We named him 'Gord' because he eventually started responding to the term, "Oh, good lord!"   Woah, I think I heard that one go flying over your head   Well I really love anything Kevin Spacey does, but I gotta say House of Cards is a step above the rest.   I know a few people who didn't touch alcohol until they were 21. Props to them for that kind of self control, but its really embarrassing for a 21 year old to walk into a bar, try their first drink, and gag out of complete disgust. Before you go out for a big bash on your 21st birthday, maybe test the waters in the shallow end.  EDIT: I realize how few people this applies to, I mean thats an ungodly amount of self control, but this is for the good kids don't deserve embarrassment like that.   Not really, they just didn't get along together at all. They were both really nice to everyone else.   Yeah pretty much, I don't live in Wisconsin.  EDIT: A lot of people seem pretty disappointed with no Reddit reunion, so for all intents and purposes, I totally live in Wisconsin.   sigh*  EDIT: I think my name takes the cake on this one. The name comes from when I was trying to come up with a username and they were all taken. A friend of mine said, "just stop, man" and what do you know, it worked. Little did I know 'stop man' is some sort of Japanese anime porn comic. [I found out the hard way] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tra31/whats_the_biggest_secret_you_would_share_without/co1s2h8?context=3). Anyhow, I guess thats what I'd be into.   In middle school, the quiet kid, Steven, had an arch rival. Robbie. In class Robbie always seemed to come out on top of their little scuffles, mostly because Steven couldn't really formulate or execute a 'burn' or 'comeback'. He just rolled over and let Robbie get his insults in until the teacher stepped in. One day I was walking behind Robbie after that class and Steven quietly crept up behind him. Before Robbie could even turn around, he got as close as possible and said, "If I was to come into your house and kill you while you were sleeping, I doubt anyone would even notice..." then he disappeared into the darkness of the science hallway. I don't remember the exact words, but the was pretty damn close. I was about 55% shocked, 30% laughing hysterically on the inside, and 15% terrified. Robbie never made fun of ol' Stevie again.  EDIT: Yippie, new top comment! Thanks, Reddit :)   I once won one (once won one...woah) of a those huge arcade prizes at the amusement park. Never have I been able to return to the same level of stardom.   "My anaconda *does* want some"   Everything about that fucking sucks.

Every season the first four games are just horrible, then they get it together later by around week 5. I need to explain this concept to all of my non-Patriot fan friands literally every year.

You know when you're mind starts to wander while you're reading but you're eyes keep moving down the words like you're actually reading them? Well I was reading this when I decided in my head I should imagine Obama saying this like he would have on the TV show, and that made me think of my friend who can do an awesome Obama impression, and then I thought of this guy on Americas Got Talent who does really cool impressions, which lead to thinking about Howie Mandels goatee for a while, and then I thought maybe I should grow a goatee, and then I was like, "Hey, King Tut has a pretty kick ass goatee", (for some reason I said that part out loud) and that went on for a while and I came to the conclusion that King Tut and Howie Mandel would probably be really good friends, a thought which developed into a TV show staring the two ('Howie and the Tut'), a sitcom about two dysfunctional, fun loving room mates living in suburban Giza. And then I guess I read the name 'Obama' and it must have registered in my brain because suddenly Obama was in the show, and he was like the guy in the gang that no one really likes but hes still always kinda around (not necessarily unlike normal Obama) and they all went on all kinds of adventures together, like white water rafting down the Nile, and pulling pranks on ol' Vlad Putin (as I imagine Obama does in real life). And then realized that I been reading the same line over and over again for literally eleven minutes.  It was a wild ride.   Thanks, man.   4 would already be pretty fucking big...

What time zone do you live in in Europe? We can just do some simple math here.   Never not upvote this  I got a second opinion as this is not my first language. I might have maybe forgot there was such a thing as a double negative, but lets not dwell on that. Small words used in quick succession occasionally confuse me sometimes...   It was the right choice against the wrong team. Think about it, the Seahawks had three downs, one timeout and lass than a minute to go one yard. The best game plan here is to throw it on second  down, then if it's incomplete run it on third, if that fails use your last time out and run again on fourth. It might have been a better idea to throw it on third instead of second, but regardless the throwing was not the problem. As a coordinator or a coach you do not account for things like interceptions or fumbles. Sure you expect them once or twice over the course of a game (three or four times if your Rex Ryan) but you don't avoid choosing a play because you think the other team is going to come up with a miraculous play. Not only that, but as good as Marshawn Lynch is, he is NOT good at running from the one yard line. In fact, he's pretty bad at it. I'll direct you [here] (http://mobile.sportingnews.com/article/4634710-nfl-super-bowl-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-one-yard-line-analysis-context-pete-carroll-call-patriots-2014). His swooping left and right with bursts of speed doesn't work from the one yard line when an entire team is running at you down the entire line. Pete Carol and his offense made the right decision, the Patriots were just in the right place at the right time.  Theres no guarantee the game would have been over after that either. Who in the right mind doesn't think Tom Brady can't get a field goal (which is all they would have needed to tie) with a minute left? Especially considering how well Tom Brady was playing that night.   I don't think you understand, that was a glorious moment in Patriots history. Richard Sherman, the very man who disrespected Tom Brady with his "You mad, bro?", finally got what was coming to him: agonizing defeat in the form of Malcom Butler. I have nothing against the Seahawks, Russell Wilson seems like a great guy, Marshawn Lynch is hilariously unconventional, and I'm a huge USC fan so Pete Carol is and will always be a hero in my eyes. That being said, seeing the cocky sparkle in the eyes of Richard Sherman die a little bit at that exact moment was literally the most satisfying thing I have ever seen.   "Yeah, sure, but fuck that guy"  No, but seriously if you think they might be dating someone, approach the topic very casually, so that just in case they do its no big deal. It also might be a good idea to go into it fully expecting that they do in fact already have an SO. Then you get to play the other role, acting surprised if they don't or cool and collected if they do. Kind of just something like, "Really? Awesome!" if they don't or, "Yeah, I kinda thought someone like you probably would" if they do. Its tough to give exact examples or recommendations though because you really have to read the situation, but I think you get the point. Good luck!   He pulled this one out of the bag a few times this year. Where he drops back and when the pocket starts collapsing runs through it up to the line of scrimmage and guns it on the fly. I've never seen it from him in any other season, but its fucking awesome!   The consumers of the North Korean economy will surely rejoice! Well, they would if I hadn't just made them up.   Ohhhhhhhh, I get it! Took me a while, but I'm here now!   I dont get it   You forgot Independence Day, Fantastic Four, X-Files, Terminator and Half Life 3! Oh wait.

At the end they all get on a plane and he suddenly looks all dramatic amd serious and says, "I've got a bad feeling about this flight..." Last line of the movie.   Yeah, I guess it could also be argued that he killed Tricia Tanaka...   Hurley! Wait, he hit someone with a car. Did they die? Nah, he's Hurley.   Ah, the fabled Cockamouse. Half cockroach, half mouse. It's about the size of a potatoe, it has antennae, a hard exoskeleton, fur whiskers and the ability to fly. It primarily inhabits apartments and hotels on the lower east side of Manhattan, but has been sighted as far away as the subarbs of New York City. As of right now, there are an unknown number of wild Cockamice, although one was known to have recently given birth.   Confirm or deny OP, confirm or deny.   Me and some friends once smoked in a big park near my town. We went down a trail and found a good spot. The park closes when its dark so after a while we got everything together and headed out. It got dark a lot faster than I had expected though, and pretty soon the trees made it completely dark (the not-quite-as-awesome kind of trees). To make matters worse, we couldn't find the way back. I had been there pleanty of times before, but for some reason I couldn't find the right trail. We went in the same circle three times. Yeah, I know, but it was terrifying. At one point ome of my friends got way ahead of us and wouldn't slow down. He was gone eventually. We finally made it out and got a call from the guy who went ahead saying he was waiting by the gate to make sure they didn't lock it while we were still in the park. We finally got out and parked close outside the park. I thought we were home clear but apparently not. A park ranger pulled us over when we were leaving and questioned the hell out of us. Almost worse than I would imagine a cop. He totally knew, and would have definitely called the cops if he could prove it. He followed us for a while too. We were in two separate cars, so we went different directions and lost him, but it was still scary as hell.   ...and??   Pavers? Good to know! Theirs looks like [this] (http://www.resourcedir.directory/images-uploads/2014/02/08/arbel-paver-patio-landscape-pavers-design-and-installation.jpg), it really is just about as beautiful as a drive way can get. And no I'm not the least bit stoned...lol I guess I'm just really passionate about drive ways.   [This] (http://www.amazon.com/RAW-Natural-Unrefined-Rolling-Papers/dp/B0064DWDZM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1428972170 sr=8-2 keywords=rolling+cones) will make life easier. I just got like 400. Also, /r/casualconversations is good for stuff like this! I think. I'm not really sure, I subscribed like two days ago, but give it a shot non the less! Good luck:D   Nice, but the octopus above your TV really stole the show for me. That thing is fantastic.   Joke or did you light that up?  EDIT: Downvote? I'm totally serious. I've seen both on this sub.   "My, what strong edibles you have!"  "All the better to get baked with, my dear!"  All I could think of for some reason. Please don't judge me...   Good lord, please don't sneeze OP.   This would give me the same exact dilemma as my neighbors drive way. I know, let me explain. You see, they have no ordinary drive way, no sir. Its made up of individual stones meticulously fit together without cement like some sort of road mosaic. It looks incredible. Every time I see it I'm like, "Damn, I couldn't drive over a piece of art like that!". Same concept with the ashtray. Good job, OP!   As a supporter of legalization, I hope not. As a recent watcher of 'Thank You for Smoking', I would love to see a sequel.   At first glance I thought that said "on the outskirts of Saint Louis, Colorado". I first questioned my historical prowess, then my knowledge of geography, then I read it again.   The pond is behind you, genius.   For those of you wondering, yes this is exactly what you think it is, no you should not open it if in public. Someone should probably throw a NSFW on there too.   I only say this because I'm sure that not everyone did, but you MUST watch the video. It's amazing. [Link] (https://youtu.be/qkpWwnNiGgE) for lazy people who use hyperzoom (like me).   Whats that?   That would be one hell of a box cutter.  	102

 It's not about sentence structure, it's using the correct words and grammar. Which to me is very important.  Saying "hung" instead of "hanged," to me at least, is like saying "brung" instead of "brought."    Edit: People are comparing drinking breast milk to cannibalism?!  that's because people here are retarded with a false sense of logic.   MOST BABIES ARE CANNIBALS RAHRAHRAH!!!    I think I'm pregnant   oh woah! I always wondered what those were when I was a kid. An older kid told me they were scorpians.    it's not art  It's a bold statement to make. It has been made about many things that we now revere. I don't want to get into an argument about it or anything, it's just a nice sentiment about being human... You are making a universal claim, and it holds true right now. I mean, it really does for the most part. But who knows, couple years down the line and "OppoQuinn, you're just like the people who didn't want robots to have equal rights! God! I HATE YOU!"   an honest question:  Why do you want to pay for something that should be learned through hard work on your behalf? There are many free -- not in the sense of dumbed down articles and tutorials -- resources on the web and in books (not actually free).   The reason I ask is because I'm just assuming that you do not trust the reputation of free information, but realize that I could be wrong.  Seriously though, if you're looking for a way to learn web design my best advice would be to not pay for it with money! Work on building a portfolio of work that you have invested your hard work and time, which in the end is much more valuable. No paid courses are necessarily going to get you there faster. Just tinker, receive criticism, and tinker more.    /r/shittyama   That's just good advertisement for his sister!   I too learned that things that are different have no similarities.    You know, my drivers Ed was taught by some dreadlocked hippie that had a drum circle session during break (I went to the week long drivers Ed with five hour classes). that guy had some pretty down to earth things to say about driving.   Seriously.    just sounds like a bunch of drug addicts doing science.   I just always think to myself "de - finite - ly"      The cylons plucked it out and threw it on to the floor, picked it up and showed it to me... Looked like a hard boiled egg.   I believe you are looking for this: http://boards.4chan.org/b/   Unlike booze, of course.   Basically wondering if there is a common pictorial image for Sol and the planets surrounding it...   Now this is one of the really tough questions. The reason is because "the greater good" is really loosely defined. It could mean simply "the greatest amount of people unharmed", it could be used to imply some sort of "universalize goodness," or perhaps other more specific definitions for deciphering the greatest good, beliefs of what that is, and what is actually happening in reality.  There is no real answer, of course. Unless you believe in some sort of system of truth that exists independently of the world.   Well, the PNW, and especially Portland takes a special kind of pride in their Spanish coffees... There is so much booze in those things that I'm definitely on the way after one.   Was it as shitty as people try to tell me?   I frequently bring my computer to a bar and drink a Spanish coffee while working.   Ah, damn. Yeah, it is really surprising how expensive those  bastards are... I just bought a desk and a chair and the fucking chair was almost as expensive as the desk.    ...can you just buy a chair for yourself? Or is that not allowed either?   I like the way they do things in France.   I too saw this on criminal minds.   babe   I said out loud to my self, "that's amazing!"  and I've already seen the reich roll   No. Due to certain quantum factors, there is a 50/50 chance that the toast will land face down on either side that is buttered.   In order for toast to levitate, you need to refrain from buttering either side. Because of the same quantum factors as above, there is an inverse property which causes the chances of it landing face down to become -50%, or in other words, floating.   this sounds like a /r/shittyaskscience question to me   Occasionally?   Aww you are just adorable   you're a cheeky little cunt, aren't you?   Well no shit. Thank you! No seriously, thank you. I thought that that was simply a universal rule for everybody that had money. I'm terribly happy that you cleared that up for me..  You fucking ass hat.    *all* of them, HIV_butts   the man *made* a million dollars   This is really awesome!

I just ate a whole pizza and am currently working through a six pack. Just commenting on a general trend of Reddit...   Now, It's clear that you're not a fan of low carb diets. Great! I personally don't give a fuck.    because this is reddit, where people hate everything you say.   Nonono... You've got it all wrong. I enjoyed the movie. If you cannot stand a single piece of criticism of a movie you liked, then such is reddit I guess...   exactly. I re-watched this last year, and before that I saw it when I was a freshman or so... It absolutely scared the shit out of me back then, but when I watched it last year I realized how fucking brilliant it is.   You know, I really did enjoy the movie... There was just something irritating about it being high school students doing everything. I just kept saying "this fucking kid is in high school."   Sources   *illusion*   Aww, You started out so great.   You go up to the bartender and say, "buy mike a shot of rumple minze on me."  It sounds foolish, but quickly turns into a hilarious game of getting fucked up.    Yeah man, but the service industry has a tendency of smashing dreams on the floor and rubbing your face in the broken pieces. It's excellent money, I know!    It's become somewhat of a prank at the place I work to "rumple" someone.    If you're in the pacific north west, order a Spanish Coffee with Stroh Rum. That'll get you going.   ah, first time there? hmmm... It's... It's, well.. you know. fifthworldpics, bro!   reddit is getting people killed?    Really great design!

Apparently, when I was too young to remember, I used to throw tantrums in public quite frequently.

THANK YOU!   I prefer Octopodes, and I will never let that go.  [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus#Etymology_and_pluralization)   I wasn't trying to argue with him. I was just pointing out that his remarks sounded like something a child would say.  But I have an honest question for you. How old are you? Please don't think I'm looking to make an ageist argument here, I'm just curious. I'm 25, and have been out of college for a little while now. And the one thing I regret is not spending more time focused on studies. I honestly think that I was too immature to start my studies in the first place. And I guess my point is this,  College helped me grow up. It allowed me to become independent, get lots of new interests, learn romantic relationships, make big mistakes (and recover from them), etc.  I think it's very important to acquire this kind of culture, and it's almost tragic that collage/university study has become the medium for which most kids in the US go about getting them.  Being truly self sufficient and supporting yourself financially is when these lessons really happen. College should be about improving upon whatever skill set you desire to improve on, so that you are more prepared when real life happens.       haha! you sound like a child. An entitled, shitty little child.  there's more to school than learning    so it's like this. You shouldn't believe a random internet stranger, I don't blame you, I wouldn't either.

Companies that focus to the multiplayer side of a game and downgrade single to a "get ready for the multiplayer" experience are also hurting gaming.  And no one seems to make a buzz about it..

Original thread-- https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2qptfp/lumia_930_microsoft_is_working_on_a_new_update/ :)   Two things: photography and cinematography.

We have been made aware of an issue where the displays on a limited number of Lumia 930 units are exhibiting discolourations. This phenomenon is due to the performance of the display in certain brightness conditions. However, **we have identified the root cause** **and are currently working on a software update that will deliver improvements.**  Source:[ My twitter account](https://twitter.com/test_subject3791gr)  https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/549484852244774912 [1/3] https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/549484895743918080 [2/3] https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/549484933375205376 [3/3]  http://i.imgur.com/sikTs3W.jpg  Great news i guess :).  **EDIT**: [This is now on WPCentral](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes), with a bunch of comments. That's good, this issue needs more visibility, Microsoft should fix these screens ASAP or replace faulty devices (a recall maybe?).   Marlon Brando   Nothing. Damn it.   Time flies   Does God exist?   From what i understand, there are two similar problems: the one is a purple tint that occurs even on black menus (i don't have this, and i think that this is software related and already fixed). The other one is mine, with gradient on white/gray backgrounds, and i believe that it's hardware related (purple tint AMOLED are a common defect. Had similar problems with my Galaxy Nexus).  What country does your 930 originates from? I have installed another firmware (from Finland) in order to get the Denim, but that didn't fix it.   Yes, i played a lot with this (and with brightness). I can change the purple tint to a more bluish one, but the gradient remains on white/gray backgrounds. If i set it on green, the right side becomes too green.  I'm using the Denim update.   Phone is updated with Denim, it's not fixed.   They got tired   Man, you ask for gold, you get gold. Wish I was that lucky.   Got a 930. I'm disappointed with the screen (it has a purple tint and a gradient on white/gray backgrounds). Service says that everything is normal, but I guess I'll try again with them. But good phone overall.   Anyone from Tauranga, New Zealand? You're so far away from me (17,607 km). I'm from Athens, Greece.   Al Pacino. The one and only.

Yes i have. Screen sensitivity is on normal.   Hello. I decided to pass the [speaker "problem"](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2o91qy/lumia_930_speaker_problem/) on my Lumia 930, but now i'm observing something else, which was there from the beginning:  When i scroll through the app list or some other list (marketplace apps, settings menus and also Internet Explorer) there seems to be an instant "jump" when i pull my finger from the screen, which moves me further down (or up, depending on the direction i was scrolling) a bit on that list.  This doesn't happen every time and sometimes it needs a lot of trying to reproduce it. It's more evident on apps list and settings menu. I can't reproduce it on apps like Here maps, Nextgen Reader, Zedge, Lastpass, Fresh Paint, when viewing a photo or on some touch screen tests.  I disabled double tap to wake and to zoom and set screen sensitivity to normal, but that doesn't help. It seems like a Windows Phone problem rather that hardware.  Ideas?   It's sometimes for me also. The (less audible) hiss is every time, the pop/click is with more specific sounds.  So i guess that's the way it is.    So, no hiss on yours?   Hello. I bought a new Lumia 930. So far, i'm quite impressed with the phone. The only drawbacks seems to be the battery (which could have been better) and the speaker on the back.  The speaker is my main concern for now.  The problem is that, after every sound, it makes a bearably noticeable hiss for 4-5 sec and then (with most sounds) a click/pop (which, in a relatively quite environment, is quite obvious). That hiss is there even on apps like Nokia Camera, continuously. Also, on some notification sounds, there are 2-3 clicks just before the end (but can't hear them on music or other sounds).  I have found many references to this problem (px [here](http://forums.windowscentral.com/nokia-lumia-930/322329-nokia-930-speaker-hiss.html)) but no solution, workaround or someone that gave his device for service and they fix it. Many people say that it's a known problem with Lumia's, and it's something that occurred after WP 8/8.1 (and i have the latest updates).  My Lumia is eligible for DOA, but it's something that will take 10-15 days, since the store has to send the device to the authorized service in order to certify that it needs replacement - yes, i know, shitty service. I'm from Greece.  So, i was wondering: is this a hardware or a software problem? Is it a problem (so they are going to replace my device) or i'll spend 15 days with no smartphone just to get another one (or just the same) that has the same problem?  Thanks in advance!  EDIT for spelling   As the GoPro flies On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' A poor little GoPro falls In the ghetto   Yes, probably, but i'm not sure. Any source validating that there's sapphire on that lens?   It may get a little hotter. It was one of my concerns before buying. From what i have heard, it gets better over time. Bear in mind that many of the latest high-end phones have these issues. For example, LG G3 is like holding the sun.  EDIT: Also, many Xperias have overheating issues.   So, yes, yes you can. My Google calendars are available and i can add events to them.   Yeap, no comparison between 520 and 930. Even 735 felt luggish to me.   I'll check and get back to you :-)   I bought a Lumia after my Nexus 5 broke down. Nexus 7 is still going to be around as a tablet, mostly due to its great battery and big screen. But, as a smartphone and for daily usage, Lumia is going to be there :-).   I'm always extra careful with the camera lens on the back ;).   Thank you :).  (Nothing, just the light in the room hitting the bezel of the screen in an interesting way :p).   http://i.imgur.com/vSSEoj3.jpg  (and sorry for the bad photo quality from my Nexus 7...)      Man, i'm one step before buying Lumia 930. I just can't decide if i want to spend the extra 150 euro and buy 930 and not 735 (which costs 200 euro).    I was wondering: does the Lumia 735 suffer from overheat?   Thanks, so i guess the hue is not a problem. What about the reports of overheat? Is this happening a lot under normal use?   That's interesting. Maybe he did the review with a bad device or something.  Are you using a Lumia Icon or a Lumia 930?  EDIT: I see, thanks!   So, this is not happening on yours?  http://youtu.be/JYV2U5kuGBM?t=2m3s   Quick question for the owners of the Lumia 930: what do you think about the viewing angles of the screen? I saw on a video review (i think it was from Phonedog) that colors tend to fade easily, from very small angles. Is it true? Is that screen that bad?   i went to 2-3 big local stores and i couldn't find a Lumia 930 to examine it myself. In truth, there were very few to none Lumia (they tend to promote Samsung and Apple).  EDIT: Here, i found it: http://youtu.be/JYV2U5kuGBM?t=2m3s   There are many apps that i'm counting on in Android, but i don't think there's anything that i'm not able to find an alternative for in WP right now. I'm not closed mind or a fanboy of any company or OS and Windows Phone is definitively a choice for me.  My price ceiling is definitely around ~200 euros. it's the specs that matters for me right now.   That's it's price here in Greece too. And yes, 735 is something i'm considering. Problem is that, if i finally manage to spend 200 euros, i'm not really sure if i want to get a Lumia 735 or go with Android and a Moto G 2nd gen (same price).  Windows Phone is a great choice for me for low-cost smartphones 100-150 euros), but i'm not really sure for something more pricey.   Cosmote and Vodafone has, my carrier (Wind) doesn't currently provide 4G. Don't really care about that, it wouldn't change my mind about what to buy. But i guess it's an extra point, in case i decide to change providers and use LTE.   I'm not considering 520 that much, just as a super-budget option for now, in case i decide to go with something extra cheap for now and get something better in 5-6 months.  I'm more between Lumia 535, 635 and 735. Lumia 535 has the downside of "coming soon" in Greece (don't really know how soon) and i need to get a smartphone in the coming week. And Lumia 735 is a little costly for me (200 euros), i don't know if it worths it.   That Snapdragon 200 is a big downside, compared to a Snapdragon 400...   - As Good as It Gets - Superbad - Death to Smoochy - Midnight in Paris - Freaky Friday   A local cinema in my town (a suburb of Athens, Greece) is still doing one intermission on every film.    This, according to the CIA Factbook, makes the US one of only three countries (the other two being Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Liberia) that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_States  Jeez.   Since i posted this.   Remember: there are people that get paid nothing at all for doing what they do.   I am from Greece. The latest calculations estimate that we'll have Netflix here in 2097.   I'm an intern genetic biologist for the Masrani Corp. **AMA**.   This must be one of the most encouraging comments i have ever read on Reddit. Coming from someone who was "on depression meds for a while", it matters even more.   Ethan Hawke and Edward Norton   **JFK**  From Oliver Stone's golden era. Having recently watched **Born on the fourth of July**, i really miss that Oliver Stone. Going to watch **Nixon** in the next few days.  My second favorite movie of this week must be **Remains of the day**.  Yes, during the last weeks, i'm in the mood of watching old (or very old) movies that - for one reason or another - haven't watch until now. I have really missed some gems.   The line looks good :-)   Good choice, already played that :-)   Gaming is getting too much fantasy based (guess that's what sells more to a Lord of the rings/harry potter generation), but I'm not a fan of fighting dragons and warriors on the latest massively multiplayer RPG. So, I'm interested on your best picks of pc games that have a real world story, characters and setup (even if they get to extraordinary levels, like grand theft auto).  Thanks!   Put your music and your new album on **SPOTIFY**. That's another way to **LEGALLY** listen to it. It's 2014, internet is not an enemy, music must be accessible.  Any plans on that?   On DVD, it was Pearl Harbor. Boy, when i got it from the local rental store, I was feeling like I've been transfered to the future. And sorry for those renting VHS. And when i watched it on my computer, that was amazing. But a shitty movie.   Sounds interesting, thanks!   Thanks, that clarifies it. So, are there private screenings of the movies for these groups, or everyone gets a copy for personal viewing (like film critics do) and then submits a rating? And if so, isn't there a possibility that those people leak movies online?   So, if I understand correctly,13 people manage to watch every movie released in the USA?   Yes,I know about MPAA etc. My question is about the people that rate. Do they exist and do they really watch everything? Or its a semi automatic/by the book process, without viewing the actual movie? And if they watch and judge everything, how many judges are there?      I saw Titanic (1997) on a relatively small cinema. The Titanic movie was like a happening, everyone had to see it. So I remember it vividly, since it was a special day, many of my friends were there.  I was 12.      Don't have 5 right now, but 25th Hour has a great soundtrack (by Terence Blanchard).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLGt4lcUU9o         Unprogrammed virtual gaming worlds, dead-ends and infinite spaces.

I need something that users vote via clicking on links inside a tweet (for example click a link to vote "yes" or another link to vote "no"). Thanks!                                       Token limit... what a silly rule...                     To clear it up, [here is the full text](http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_trackers/transcript?language=en#t-343768) from the TED talk:   Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it, install it in Firefox, to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers.  Nick Bradbury [said something similar](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/girls-around-me-shows-why-privacy-shouldnt-be-an-option.html). As he explains:   Privacy - like security - **should be expected, not something that users have to enable**.  In other words, privacy must **be a de facto thing**, not something you have to choose/enable/look for. It's not an option, it's a right, it's a fact. It's like peace, health etc.                             	129
 I was just jokin' around dude, didn't mean for you to take it seriously.   Yup   It's pronounced Barometer, Jerry!  (I know it's the other way around)   Everyone has their own preferences....   It won't. IIRC, Interstellar was filmed in 70mm, and it looked fine.   A /s might help communicate your point a little better, but it's still not hilariously funny.    It's *not* Star Wars The Force Awakens?   Huh, I had no idea.   Not ID Forever Part I?   Larry David never fails to make me laugh   I usually do Plinkett, then the 101 Wacky Jokes for Kids to prove that Plinkett's voice isn't actually like that, then Half in the Bag   I would think it was because it might cause confusion among people who saw Luke lose his blue lightsaber   DAE I know what u talking about rlm rite??????????????????? ayy lmao   I guess they didn't color it right for the trailer   It seems like Star Wars and Marvel are being saved for D23, and that's only a month later.    It's the percent of critics that liked it, not the actual rating of the film. I have no idea why Sharknado is at 82%, but you shouldn't say critics opinions are irrelevant because of it.   ?   Not his question.   Links  [Teaser](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MlDw3gHoSGM)  [Poster](http://imgur.com/iA1YmdV)   I wouldn't think so...   Darth Plagueis was Palpatine's master, as mentioned in Episode 3   Yes, because YouTube was so popular and different in the two years that it was around before Google bought it?  Google has owned YouTube for 9 years, a pretty significant portion of its lifetime. Not much has changed to drastically alter your viewing experience.  And by the way, it's not Googles fault for having to follow the law and take down clips that movie studios don't want on YouTube...      Notice anything...?  http://imgur.com/fNFgxLY   I honestly felt that it was closest in style and tone to the OT.   Spielberg makes movies like that for any age - legitimately great storytelling   Mm... Maybe not as talked about in today's world, but by no means underrated. Fantastic reviews, good box office results, several Oscar nominations...   Steven Spielberg      Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (has a 6.1, but close enough!) I think that this is a legitimately good movie, with some good performances and underlying messages.   Each to his own, I guess, but no reason to call me a dweebo. I like Star Trek just as much, just so you know.   That's *Caitlyn* Fett now   Yeah   No, this is a well known fact that's true   I would agree, if it wasn't for movies like Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel   I wouldn't say boring. Maybe emotionless, but they looked cool  (IMO)   Sure they have a lot in common, but no one should try to point out which one is better than the other, cause there's really not an answer to that.   Missed a couple of lines there!   Met Jar Jar and Boss Nass...   They locked the door and tried to kill us   Star Wars all the way    Yup, all those hundreds of millions of dweebos. Complete idiots for liking a simple story with fun ideas and relatable characters. Morons.  /s   But it's almost like comparing boats and cars. One might be used more often, and they're both methods of transportation but they're used for two different things.   Alright, I guess I agree with that.   Well, it's kind of an obscure movie to put fake casting details on, especially ones that seem realistic.   I disagree. I don't think Star Wars is only an action movie, it has a lot of relatable human elements and themes, and is genuinely a well told story.   Wars and Trek are about two different things, and I really don't think it's right to compare them.   No. No one does that. Crazy people do that.   That's gold, Jerry, GOLD!   Not just to me, but to many critics and movie goers alike. Look at the AFI top 100 movies, or the best movies on Rotten Tomatoes, or most critic's choices for the best movies of all time, and you'll see that Citizen Kane is high up on that list.   It's an absolute to you, but not to the majority of people who think it is the best movie of all time.    I suggest you watch The Godfather Part II. It's a more interesting/faster paced story, and it reveals more about Michael and Vito as characters.   But so many things *about* it shaped what came *after* it. It changed the industry as a whole, which is a very hard thing to do.   When did I say that?   Give me an example.   Because it's a practically perfect story, that's fantastically well written, with some of the best acting of all time. Very few flaws, if any.     ... About what?   Yeah, but if you really want to know why it's considered the best movie of all time, watching it would help you understand what people are talking about.    Every moment you might think is cliche or overused? Citizen Kane started that. Appreciate it for what it is, and realize that modern filmmaking wouldn't be anywhere close to what it is today without that movie.   Everest? Macbeth?   Macbeth! Steve Jobs! Prometheus 2! X-Men Apocalypse!   This is actually the THIRD installment in the critically acclaimed Birds series!  http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0109275/   Huh. I actually think Ewan McGregor could've been a good Bond   What? Like the original *didn't* have young children playing an important role in the movie?      Radio Bart will always hold a special place in my heart. Marge in Chains and Treehouse of Horror V are close behind, though.   Well, would you rather have a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?   Too bad it's a true story.    Jurassic Park - Always amazing  Lost World - Liked it  JPIII - Bad, but entertaining and fun    What are you doing on this sub if you don't like their jokes?   And by the way, you made a suggestion, and multiple people pointed out why it won't happen. No use arguing it.   REVAN CONFIRMED   MI: 5   I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life...   How?   "Knowing how to read will be useful when you're older"  Yup, checks out.   Back to the Future.   Too perfect.   Jack! Please!   I mean, there not even really that nerdy...   "Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most... Human"  Was a hell of a thing when Spock died...   Mkay   Spike    Its based on a true story   And Andy! And Olaf! And Marbles!   Don't forget Westworld!   Oh I thought something looked strange about the rest of those guys... To tired to think   What?   /uj I don't know if it's part of the jerkin' or not, but Stanley Kubrick was American /uj   Not anymore it isn't!   The Empire Strikes Back    stage 19 elbow cancer   ["Why would you shoot me in the kidney?!"](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvYkmG5iGU)   It *is* an iPhone accessory    Dude, it's coming out years from now. I'm sure the script is still being worked on. No updates does not automatically mean it has been cancelled.   No   I would think its the writers more than the director    Wrath of Kahn? The Voyage Home?   I know what you mean, but pirates seem to smell lol chlorine to me   Agreed   Chlorine    It created a lot of the modern cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques that are commonplace today.  http://www.neatorama.com/2014/01/13/What-Makes-Citizen-Kane-So-Special/  http://www.slate.com/articles/life/ft/2011/05/the_mark_of_kane.html   Not just revolutionizing film at its time, but film as a medium in general. So much of TDK would be different if Citizen Kane didn't exist, and the same goes for every other modern movie.   No - episode vii this year, episode viii in 2017, and episode IX in 2019   Yeah, but Mike Stoklasa isn't anywhere near as well known as those guys   What?   Last Star Wars film in 2017? No way Jose! You still have Anthology 2 in 2018 and Episode IX in 2019, and I doubt Disney will stop there!   Maybe, maybe...   /u/trollabot test_subject3827   Yeah - above *Citizen Kane?*   Ah okay  	109
 trofies is for fagets n babies!  go cry with siff faget!@   LMAO faget!!!1   Go explore the game some more and figure it out.

Yeah, in general, I've found it to be less reliable for stun-locking enemies, but the 2h/transformed charged attack will send the lesser to regular to large enemies flying everytime, though the diagnal angle can make it a bit less user friendly than say the horizontal spin2win of the hunter's axe.   They are too loud and obnocious, just like the crows.  My issue is that I'm pretty sure there is little to no fade in these sound effects, so no matter how close or far I am from the mob, it sounds like they are screaming or barking in my ears at a gajillion decibals    Haha.  You've put together 1% of the story so far :D  Keep going.  There is so much more to it!   Yep.  That being said, I've had my fair share of, "Fuck those guys and their cheap ass frenzy mechanic!"   I do think frenzy could have been worked in better.  It should either do a large chunk of damage, but less than what it currently does, like 50-60% health tops, or keep it at 70% damage, but not let it kill you, so at most, it would reduce your HP to 1.   Wow.  That's crazy-awesome.  Good on your friend.     Man, I never fight that thing head on simply due to the zero margin of error allowed fight for a cursed dungeon, plus, everytime I've ever tried to engage him close, he often chains his regular attack with a charge or leap at point blank, and dat hitbox gets me everytime from such a close range.   Guess I just need to git guuder.  Also, I don't play my Chikevyln too often, so that option of bone-marrow ashing the last large chunk of his health for safety and ease hasn't been an option :/   Once you create a chalice, can you still join other glyphs even if you take that original chalice down?  I mean, I know you have to create the original chalice type to be able to join a glyph of the same dungeon type, but is that memory inherent in your game/character, or do you have to leave the original chalice up the whole time?   I hate them too, but they're not that cheap.  There are lots of tools to deal with them, including ranged weapons, sedatives, frenzy resist armor, and frenzy resist runes.   The brains are a prime example of what the souls games do best:  they put extreme pressure on players, intentionally inducing panic and "what the shit is going on?" confusion mode, which in turn causes players to panic, and thus not play as methodically and carefully as they must in a Souls game.   Like any other enemy or boss, if you approach them methodically and with patience and a level-head, they can be easily taken down, and create that satisfaction that the Souls games are known for.   But DaS2 was a B-Team thing, so I think it would be more likely to be seen in BB than DaS2, but still, I wouldn't necessarily count on it or expect it :D   Really?  I was never hit by any of his jump attacks ever, just by staying locked onto him, and dodging forward (to where he is diving from), right as he is diving, and thus, he winds up behind you, and you can just turn to face him and click to quick-turn the camera around to attack him again.   Comment so I can find this later.  Thanks for the links :D   They are awesome weapons. I find Ludwig's to be a bit dull, but the chikage is fun to play with, and to play against.  And Yes, rifle spear is OP, but only cuz it's broke as shit right now, an it's a shame because its such a fun weapon.    It's not OP, It's just plain bugged.  Ludwig and Chikage is OP, considering how easy and quick you can build a character to do top-shelf damage with those weapons, even with no depth 5 gem-farming.   Because reddit has the dumbest ranking system, and the arbitrary down-voting and upvoting system is totally horse shit, and just like any other form of trolling or bitching on the internet - it is unregulated and unchallenged and it doesn't really mean anything :D   Ha ha.  Wot a storee Mahrk!   Yeah, Yogg Saron was a long time ago...   That's so... gay?   Loran Darkbeast is fairly telegraphed and easy to dodge though once you figure it out, though his movesets are a lot more brutal than Paarl, and he can easily one shot you once he is fully charged and doing some of his bad ass moves.  Havne't gotten to Ebrietas on my level 4 beast-bro, as I have been mostly working on my beastbro, but my onebro runs are usually the last thing I do in a SOULS games once I am border-line done with it.  OH HAI COLLETE!   Are you gemming the burial blade correctly?  You can get an easy 650-750 AR with the correct gems, which are the +8-9% physical gems with the flat +70ish arcane damage.  The burial blade is bad-ass, it just takes longer to optimize since you have to farm depth 5 chalices, whereas, you can make your +10 chikage or +10 evelyn or +10 ludwig's bad-ass with minimal time and gem-farming investments, which is why it is the easy sort of go-to common-cheese builds :D   The burial blade is much harder to optimize than other weapons, as you need to get to lowest level chalice dungeons to obtain the odd gems that are like +9% physical and +70ish flat arcane damage.  Those gems are built for BoM and Burial Blade.  Furthermore, I think the best is the Uncanny Burial Blade, as it has a triangle gem slot so you can add another %physical damage +flat arcane gem, since most of the waning gems are crap for that setup.   Yeah, it's super easy to raise super-high with minimal stat and time investments too :/   Yeah.  You have to master the camera adjustment of facing your character opposite direction, and tapping the right stick button to auto-orient your character with direction he is facing.  Next game:  Cameraborne, where the hardest enemy you fight is the camera, and they are all cameras.  Oh god.  I'm having PTSD flashbacks about the centipede demon in DaS.  WHY GWYNN WHY!?!!  YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!   oh god, what an abomination!   Yeah, the "why" of most FROM games is seldom the point, or all that important.  It is a rash of people and characters dealing with the "what" of it, often futilely until the bitter end.  The point is, life is a bitch, then you die.  It's all so pointless.  Fuck it.   Stop spoiling your game play!  You only get one chance at a first time play-through, so drink every last drop of that coagulated menstrual blood and take your punishment!   Yep.  I killed him on another toon last night, and took me a few tries to readjust to the whole delayed movements and dodges.  But I totally enjoyed the waltz of it once I got the timing right again :D   If you are using BoM, stunlock her into a wall, a pillar, or just stun lock her period, as she will likely wind up pinned up against something in general.  If you have 15 arcane, you can use beast roar to make this fight even more trivial.  R1 spam your BoM until your stamina is gone, immediately use beast roar, then resume spamming, but don't give her a second to even begin attacking, or she might one or two shot you.  And if you can keep her pinned at the part where she imbues her weapon with fire, and don't let her complete the enchantment, she will spend the rest of the light trying to light her sword on fire, like some retarded child trying to light water on fire.   And if I open those, then all dungeons are open to me?  Because I thought I would be limited to only exact matches, ie., cursed, fetid loran = only cursed fetid loran   So if you make a dungeon with all offerings (ex, Isz root or loran root), then you can join any dungeon with any combination of those offerings?  Thanks.   There is no proof from what Micolash says that Rom was once human, and was turned into kin or anything else.  There is no way to prove what he says as literal, as it can just as well be taken in the same manner as someone saying "god gave birds wings so they could fly."  It doesn't mean god reached down and glued wings on ferrets and thus that is where birds came from, as if it was just a gift that was given, it just means, 'as they were made/created/evolved/born."  There is no concrete proof for either case, but I find it odd that every human character in game has a lot of screen time, dialogue, or info via item descriptions, yet there is nothing related to 'Rom the human' anywhere.  I don't think this is an oversight.  I think Rom is what he has always been, and whatever that may be, it never was human.   Ok. Cool. I think that will be a good go to spot to get guaranteed radial gems with minimal farming for my burial blade. Thank you.    The official guide. There have been a lot of posts listing pictures of the guide. Look up your primary weapons and the damage types and multipliers in those posts.    It depends. Flat physical affects all damage types (phys, thrust, blunt) but if you are primarily using blunt or thrust attacks, it might do you well to double check what other gems you can docket in there to maximize what attacks you use the most, especially since different attacks have different modifiers. It also depends if the enemy is open or not.    Another note:  40 dex is a shit ton of investment for a weapon that is best and meant to be utilized in 2handed Bloodtinge form - that is what you do your killing with, the R1's are just for transforming there and back to minimize the HP leak.  Chikage is not for a dex build, and you also lose out on Eve's damage with non hard-capped BT.  I would have gone to 20-25 skill max, and instead gone for 15 arcane for the hunter's tools, as beast roar is stupid OP and easy to stunlock people with (as well as your only parry type defense while using 2h stance, which is dangerous with only 26 vit), and maybe pumped vit to at least 30, especially if you are going to be invading people.   While fun to play (with and against), I'm sort of sad that the majority of my fights are against BT chikage/eves or Ludwigs :(   Makes me with there were more weapons in this game, or at least, more go to ridiculously powerful weapons, rather,  more viable and competitively powerful weapons, that are as easy to obtain and get the most out of them with minimal time investment and little to no farming.  I'm enjoying my burial blade build right now, but to get to the best gems for it, I have to run to the ends of the chalice dungeons and farm the lowest levels, as there are no +physical % damage +flat arcane anywhere in the main game or basic chalices, whereas you can put a few easy to obtain +18 to +20% gems in the chikage and call it a day    edit:  specifics   I know a lot of people that need to revisit the past and learn how to spell :P   Doctor:  "Please point to the chart and tell me exactly how it is that you suck so much."   Don't forget the baby great ones or surrogates or whatever they are - all those little slug things that just stare longingly at the celestial garden/alter of despair.   Great write up, thank you, but due to the format of one of the first parts, can you please clarify that this info is correct:   *EDIT; If you want guaranteed radials with physical % and arcane add:*  *Glyph: ba362b97*  *Location: Phtumeru Ihyll root.*  *Rites: Cursed, Foetid, Rotten.*  *Unlock lever, and farm the brainsucker mob guarding the treasure chest in the t-room before the first boss. The best it can drop is a rating 17 gem, but its a guaranteed radial...*   That edit was for all the information below, right?  Also, do you know what the first boss of this dungeon is?  Ie., is the boss itself worth farming for gems too?  (I mean, you would have probably mentioned it if it was, but still worth asking)  Thanks.   edit:  grammar/clarity   Aside a bloodtinge build, which is this game's ranged build equivelent (which a FROM game should have), guns do little to minimal damage, especially on the later bosses who have a billion HP and can kill you in one or two hits, but I am wasting my breath, as you are either a retarded troll, one ignorant motherfucker, or just plain retarded, period.   Mr souls veteran here took 6 tries to kill cleric beast and 4 for papa G?  An easy boss is one you can kill in one or two tries, and you taking that many attempts is pathetic.  I killed cleric beast my first try and it took me two tries to kill Papa G in my very first NG cycle ever.  You sound like a noob, and a lot of your fellow newbs spend hours and days and weeks getting past these areas your having a hard time with.   The brain trusts always sing as far as I can tell. And the baby starts crying as soon as you beat rom. That beig said, no one has come up with a decent lore connection of the messengers and who what and why they are, and even more intriguing, no one has yet to adequately explain why Mind of Mensis and the Winterb Lantern's brain matter is made out of dead messengers    Dude. Beast roar is awesome. You can counter projectiles and knock lesser foes and bosses and PCs on their asses. I think I'm gonna put 15 arcane in all my builds from here on out. Fuck having 50 vitality :D   Parry or beast roar or use longer ranged weapons for those bitches. I dont get why people have such a huge problem with BoM. No worse than the spam fest that goes on with a lot of other weapons, and I happen to find BoM the easiest to counter :D   I still don't understand how the motion control crap works. Alls I know is I occasionally perform the most inopurtune gesture that you can't cancel easily like in DaS    Yeah. Unique and fun weapons like Dragon bone fist and majestic greatsword were fun to fuck around with too.    You mean Christians?  Sounds like Christians to me :D   Whoa... let me just adjust my in-foil hat for this one...and.... yes!  I totally agree!  He is in fact Laurence and imposter Isofeka and the blood minister from the beginning of the game all at once even!   Yeah, but pre DLC, you could aquire double digit slabs easy in the course of the main game, and once they released the expansions, you could swim in them.  Sure, you couldn't upgrade every weapon right away, but there were too many similar and samey weapons in that game anyhow.   Ha.  No sweat.  You had started off our earlier discussion fairly level headed, so I thought it was a bit strange that you were all-of-a-sudden throwing out completely irrelevant evidence and ideas :)   That being said, now I'm curious about this whole "gherman isn't gherman" thing, which, I think is a ridiculous idea and there is no reason or evidence to believe so, but still, I'm curious...   Ah, I've only seen a few gargoyles here or there in chalice dungeons, and no, never saw a chunk drop in there, but it's not like I farmed the gargoyles either :D   Wow.  Someone sure is feeling murderous today, huh? :D   Just wait for the next two bosses!  I'd rather fight 3 keepers at the same time over them!  The hot dog is one of the worst, but if you have the patience and are super careful, you can beat him really easily, you just can't really fuck it up at all, and either way, it will just take a long ass time.  As for the keeper, on my STR toon I just parried/visceraled her and duked it out old fashioned style, and on my SKL toon, I kept the keeper stun-locked with R1 spam from Blades of Mercy, then knocked her to the floor with beast-roar once I ran out of stamina, then I rinsed, and repeated till she died.  She escaped it once or twice and killed me once or twice, but I just whomped her that way for simplicity's sake  :D   Edit:  And your level is fine. 94 is plenty high to do any of the game.   I have yet to get a chunk in a dungeon, from a gargoyle enemy or anywhere else.  Can they be found in chests or on the ground or something in chalices?  Or just from enemies?   Those are two distinct differences though, as the imposter actually has dialogue and is voiced by two separate actors, whereas the apprentice only exists on an item description, so I fail to see the point of your reasoning?.   So you can dupe and glitch, but then you can't carry those characters forward and keep them?  That doesn't sound all that worth it :/   I think it took me 4 or 5 vicerals to kill him in NG+ with the +30 and +20% visceral runes :D   There are plenty of one-offs and non-sequitters in these games.  Not everything is long and well-crafted and intertwined through the whole story.  This may or may not be one of those one-offs, but the point remains, it can be read and interpreted in either manner, with no concrete evidence favoring one over the other.  Read it as you choose.   Even if they are low level, at the least they probably have +9 or +10 weapons, with possibly the best gems farmed from chalice dungeons or late game, or maybe they've duped a zillion chunks and rocks (not sure if it works on gems).  This is why I said *'best to run to end game to make your toon more competitive in PvP,'* meaning, some of these people could have built these toons week 1 or 2 of BB's release (or even more recently), and they have had many days and weeks on their characters to farm for better gems and fully upgrade all their primary gear to +9 or +10, on top of finding the best gems.  (Also, they might have their gems, weapons and builds better itemized than you).   Edit:  Like the guy above said, I've "speed ran" my three PvP toons to end game to have decent gems and all primary weapons at +9 or +10, and I'm still clearing out chalices on a few of them.  And by speed-run, I mean, it only takes a night or two of gamplay to get the runes, the levels, and the primary weapons I need to +9 or +10, and to pretty much be at end game, and have my toon where he can hold his own.   Edit 2:  As for your damage, double check with the guide to make sure you are gemming your weapon properly.  Ie., you might be gemming your hunter's axe for pure physical damage, yet, only most of the weaker, 1H attacks are physical damage for the HA, where all the 2h heavy attacks are calculated as blunt damage.  Thus, if you gem the hunter's axe for all physical damage, but only use heavy blunt 2h attacks, then you are heavily crippling your potential damage output.   And the saves will be compatible?  1.0 will run the current characters from 2.0 or whatever the current build is?  And then once you upgrade the current build will be comptaible with your characters you took from 2.0 to 1.0?  If so, hell yeah!      Fast track was Isofeka's clinic glitch, but I heard they fixed that, which is kinda obnoxious if you've already leveled a toon or two normally and want to create some different builds to get into PvP ASAP and stay competitive in PvP.  My one regret is I didn't level up an arcane and a quality toon while that was still available.   I'd say your best bet is to play the game through towards end game as normal so you can get enough upgrade materials and ruins to make the build you want and stay competitive - and it shouldn't take that long as the game is super short, especially once you are more familiar with it.  You could also create a totally viable and competitive PvP build at level 60-90 with decent gear and a +8 or 9 main weapon with minimal time investment, but it depends on what you are looking for.  Back to the first point - playing through the main game will also give you some practice since you might be playing with weapons and items you aren't familiar with (ie., going from a main STR build to a PvP BT or SKL build).  A lot of people insist on 50 vitality as a must for all PvP toons due to the invader 30% health debuff, and while it almost helps in making up for that stupid handicap, it isn't necessary, though I do notice I tend to win more when I'm the one being invaded, and not doing the invading.  All that being said, you don't need to min-max in this game to be successful.  As with all the souls games, superior individual player skill will always win out over superior items, upgrades, runes, and so forth.  Good luck to you~   Well, there are a lot less things to upgrade in BB, but at least slabs were super common in DaS2, and chunks could eventually be purchased, and twinklings and dragon bones (the hardest to collect en masse) were super easy and quick to farm too, especially once you got to the late game, and they were at least guaranteed spawns.  Like farming in any game, it is a pretty obnoxious time sink and poor design imo, but it is and was still better than upgrade item availability in BB  :/   To be fair. BSB's poison AIDS is no joke. And you're probably not too terrible if you made it to BSB period. Yes te game game gets harder, but you will likely become better at it. Take a break and come back later. Sometimes that's all you need for these games :D   Not really. It is just subtle and cryptic, which FROM does quite often and quite well.    Well, he never really befriends you, he just doesn't try to kill you. But yes, you can still talk to him so long as you enter old yharnam through the back route. But be careful, I don't know if killing the hunter below makes him permanently hostile or not, so don't engage either in combat. Just come back later after you've unlocked the short cuts an you can make your way up all those ladders to talk to him.    Hehe.  Bet it sucked to be him!   Thanks for the info.  I was just looking at the game on steam, and it seems smarter to pay 20 dollars to upgrade DaS2 on the Pc, rather than having to pay full price for SoTFF elsewhere :D   Hey all.  I've been lost in Bloodborne since release (which I bought a PS4 for), and I have been thoroughly enjoying both the PvE and the PvP, but I did want to eventually pick up SoTFF.  I played the hell out of DaS2 on PC, and while part of me doesn't want to pay for the same game again, I was curious what my fellow hardcore Souls fans thought of SoTFF, as well as if anyone had some ideas as to which system it plays best on?  Or what the main differences are, as I've read the graphics were over-hauled for both PC and console versions.  (For reference, I have a PS4 and a PC to choose from, no XBox1)   That being said, how is the funcionality of the different systems?  I prefer to game on PC, because my PC performs better than the PS4, better graphics, I like keyboards, etc (though I still play Souls games with a controller), but I heard that the console versions can support up to six persons in a multiplayer game?  But the PC release doesn't?  Any other big differences like that between them?   And in general, what have you guys thought of SoTFF so far?  Is it true that SoTFF comes with all three DLC's?  Thanks in advance for your responses  :)   Again, it is very well-written, and one of the most beautiful gems in the whole of the first game was the easy-to-miss, right-under-your-nose hint dropped in your first NPC encounter of the game:   Oscar the Fateless straight up says, "...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... *But perhaps you can keep the torch lit...* There is an old saying in my family... Thou who art Undead, art chosen..."   The whole "keep the torch lit" is a direct reference to the kiln of the first flame, and yet, you would have never known it your first time through, and even on subsequent play-throughs, it is absolutely easy to miss this tasty and subtle reference.  Again, that's good writing  :D   Right, which would likely be a bastardized, incestuous dose of the Queen's blood.   Did you ever play Dark Souls?  There is an exact similar situation at the beginning of that game, where FROM does the exact same thing - they allude to a very specific piece of information that you would just never understand or 'get' on your first play through (or ever for that matter if you are inattentive).  I don't want to say it in case you've never played it cuz spoilers...   I like how literal and hidden in plain-sight you can take the translation. That blood in the beginning?   "Where's an outsider like you to start?  With a little bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."     He could be literally injecting you with queen Yharnam's blood. And yes, I suppose it could be menstrul blood, or from the afterbirth.    Bingo. I just posted this a little while ago:   Ah, but you are just reading it a particular way:  "Bone of an old hunter whose name is lost."  It doesn't say "bone that *came from* and old hunter whose name is lost."  While there are thigs to be lost and found in translation, that is still a massive difference in language use. The item description clearly tells us the one who used it was an apprentice of Gherman, but it does not clearly say where it comes from. Think about that :D   Ah, but you are just reading it a particular way:  "Bone of an old hunter whose name is lost."  It doesn't say "bone that *came from* and old hunter whose name is lost."  While there are thigs to be lost and found in translation, that is still a massive difference in language use. The item description clearly tells us the one who used it was an apprentice of Gherman, but it does not clearly say where it comes from. Think about that :D   Yep. And to be honest, I don't really care for the different physical attack values, but maybe there was good reason for it. If all attacks were just physical, they probably would have had to tone every weapon down to do less damage.    That, and it wouldn't make sense to have blunt/thrust go through a double dip for damage mitigation. It would essentially mean all thrust and blunt stacks would be weaker due to stacking defense types, which would be quite retarded.    Honestly, FROM has been a revitalizing force in what has been the stagnant industry of gaming, aside the already well established formulas, and the one offs and innovative indie studios.    I warn you - if you pick up bloodborne, it will likely ruin gaming for you, and if you play the previous souls titles, every other game will feel like hello kitty island adventure where you run around with a bunch of school girls slapping each other with wet noodles, and hardly any game out there will even come close to the satisfaction, risk, reward, and enjoyment of playing a game made by FROM Soft...   You have been warned.    That is a very keen connection, and a very cool theory. Can we run with that?   Yeah. I'm too used to playing with the sweeping motion of the larger weapons too, so the spread just seemed unnecessary for me I suppose.    Right. They seem to recover a bit quicker, but you can spam it again in a split second if you so choose anyhow. Again. Personal preference I guess. I don't like the way the shotguns handle :D   Not to split hairs, but "It was said" and "He was" are two very difference ways of saying something.  But now that you have me thinking about it, the only other hunter in game we encounter who uses quickening (if I'm not mistaken) is the Chikage hunter in the grand cathedral.  Do you think that is the same apprentice that is mentioned int he description of the old bone?  I know the guide calls him "The cainhurst crow" or whatever, but it still gives us nothing definitive...    Whoa, slow it down professor!  Are you sure?  Let me write this down.   At point blank they can do some damage, but pistols stagger beasts just the same as the shotguns.  The shotguns have a wider arc, which just seems to promote sloppy play, and why bother with a pellet spread when you can swing a wide weapon like the axe or scythe or sword and stagger a group of enemies just the same, or use a beast roar, or throw a molotov or any number of options that actually do more damage or provide you with more utility.  I just tend to find that nearly every other item/weapon in the game has better utility than the shotguns, the exception being the rifle spear, because it allows you to parry while 2handing a transformed weapon.  Again, this is my personal preference and play-style, and I was over-all kind of dissapointed that the shotguns didn't have a more unique and effective usage.   The repeater pistol outdamages Eveylyn at high Blood tinge, but that is because it fires two bullets, and you go through your resources faster that way.  Being that it can be easy to miss with bullets, I found Eve to be the better choice, as it is accurate and fires fast, and other than having fun playing with the rifle spear (non-bugged version), I've found absolutely no real use for the pellet spread of the blunderbuss or shotgun type weapons.  Sure, it is supposed to do damage, but that damage is negligible outside of a blood tinge build (especially in NG+ cycles, depth 5 chalices, etc), since your focus isn't on playing a ranged build.     That being said, is this for PvP or PvE?  Because I've found no reason to use anything but the hunter's pistol for non Blood-Tinge builds in PvE.  The pistol fires fast, is accurate, and you can shoot enemies at point blank (unlike the Eve which is too long, and will often shoot past enemies or other players at point blank range).  There is the blunderbuss, but I found it to be slow, clunky, and the damage it does in no way justifies how it leaves you more open to attacks on account of how slow it is.  Then there is the repeating pistol, which does more damage, but that is only because it uses twice the resources.  If you are thinking about the damage your guns can do, it doesn't really matter as much when you're not a BT build.  It's about utility and it becomes more of a personal preference or what you think is fun and stylish, though I can't speak about ludwig's holy rifle and the modifier of holy damage, as I don't know that much about it.   As for other reasons to increase your gun damage, sure, occasionally an enemy will have a slice of HP left after a fight, and it can be convenient to shoot them once or twice to kill them, but again, it isn't needed or warranted if that's not how you've dedicated your build, though it depends on your playstyle.   At the end of the day, weapon damage in the souls games comes down to the conservation of movements.  Take for example an enemy that has 3000 health, be it PC or NPC.  Let's say you set out to kill it with three gunshots leading into three visceral attacks.  If your gun does 200 points of damage, and your visceral attacks do 800 points of damage, then you kill the enemy in those six moves:  gun shot parry+visceral, gun shot parry+visceral, and one more gun shot parry+visceral for a total of 3000 damage.  The enemy is now dead.   Then let's say you decide to pump your bloodtinge, so your gun shots now do 250 damage (up from 200).  It might seem handy or helpful to have that little extra damage, as sometimes we do find ourselves dying in a situation where an enemy only has a tiny slice of life left and one more gunshot would kill it, but the fact remains that in the same scenario above, it doesn't change the amount of attacks it takes to kill an enemy:  1st parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy has 1950 HP left now  2nd parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy now has 900 health left  3rd parry+visceral - 1,050 damage - enemy is now dead, but the damage added through pumping another 10-20 points in BT is negligible, because he would have been dead anyway, and thus you wasted points in BT.   I know people can argue any number of ways on this, but imo BT and gun damage is useless outside dedicated builds, and thus the weapon you use is a matter of personal preference, be it for effectiveness, feel, or style, and I've just found the regular old Hunter's Pistol to be too damn awesome and reliable to not use, and it is easy enough to get it to +9 (along with your other favorite weapons) to where you can use it as viable damage output should you find yourself facing off with an enemy who winds up with a tiny sliver of health left (though less so in depth 5 chalices and higher NG+ cycles).  Hope this helps, now go hunt in style!  o/   edit:  grammar/clarity  Edit 2:  Back to the reliability of the pistol - it staggers enemies just the same as the blunderbuss, but it is just faster and super accurate :D    Unless you're going full or super-high BT build, I wouldn't bother with Evelyn, as the Hunter's Pistol is on par for damage with it until like, early 20's bloodtinge.  And if you are going to invest that much in BT (Eve requires 18 I think, which is a lot for non-primary damage), and you don't pump it up more to use a chikage, you are pretty much gimping what could otherwise be a higher damage, more focused skill build, or wasting what could be a full (40-50) bloodtinge build with a good 20-25 in skill, utilizing your stats best with chikage as your main weapon and eve for damage and utility.     If you want or care to do actual damage with your firearm, yes, I'd say go full BT or a skill/BT build with eve and/or rifle spear and chikage, but if you are just using firearms for utility, then waste as few possible points in BT as you can get away with:D   Would love to spar sometime this weekend.  I have 3 semi-complete PvP builds that are staying around level 90-98, but I'm not sure of the best way to do so in this game since there are no soap stones, and passwords don't affect PvP. I imagine the best way to do it is by grabbing the first root chalice available and using that glyph. What do you think?   Edit:  not sure I I'll have the time to grind out the chalices on all/any of my PvP toons just yet, as I'm pretty sure the hunter tombs key chalice is required for chalice PvP   I'm not seeing it. Also, I'd likely suspect lag as being the culprit :D   I think the final allure in this game (like the other souls titles) is PvP, and challenge runs. Ie, like someone below said, it isn't about just getting gear. It is about the challenge itself, such as the triple offering dungeons   Stun lock on lesser foes. You should be able to own most enemies in les than 1 bar of stamina, and for total pwnage, for a measly total 15 points of investment in arcane, you spam until your stamina is gone, then use beast roar ASAP to knock them over, and by the time the enemy stands up again, you should have enough stamina back to rinse and repeat.    For multiple enemies, I'd suggest either playing unlocked for quick turning to be able to stab whoever is coming at you, or be quick to flick the lock on to whoever gets closest, enabling you to still spam constantly without getting swarmed, though with how bad the camera can be at times, it might get you killed until you are more accustomed to it.    Eit:  I hate using BoM for PvP though. Sure, im not practices enough with them in PvP to really speak to their power, but Between the lack of range and the latency of multiplayer, I can't stand using them against other players :D   Tots casul troll. But the point remains. She is an way boss.    Edit:  just realized he said no heal run. That's insane. I'm pretty far on my level 4bro that I don't play too often, but I imagine i'd get quite sick of an angry at the game if I tried that.    I either stockpile them early to get a few levels, save them for when I want to splurge on consumables, or use them to push me over the edge to be able to level later in the game.  As for the mad-men's wisdoms, I wouldn't use those until you need them, since a brain-sucker might steal them, and there is no shortage of insight in the game.  I tend to use insight/wisdoms to purchase armors and crafting materials at the insight vendor.   Dude, if you're anything like me, you hate the cane.  The poke/poke of the cane is fun and effective, but the whip is slow, and does low damage, and pretty much every other weapon with a little bit of reach (ie, wide slahes of rifle spear) do a better job of staggering or knocking over enemies and doing crowd control.  The cane has a certain cool factor to it, especially when imbued with fire as it looks amazing, but I found it to be far too weak, and slow as shit in whip mode, and it seems to be outclassed by every other longer-ranged weapon in game, particularly the axe or burial blade.  I didn't do a whole playthrough with rifle-spear, but I did play through half the game with it, but it was one of my favorite and most fun weapons to play with, though it was a bit weak compared to the damage I could do with some of the other weapons (and no, I'm not talking +flat arcane bug).  It just depends on what movesets and abilities you like.  	105
 That was really obvious, I'm surprised OP didn't notice   Just because he's wearing a black suit, you're assuming he has a large penis? Wow.   So it was that vendetta not the fact that he found out he was going to become the Flash's enemy by going back in the past that drove him to become the Flash's enemy?    What was Barry doing in the 25th century?   Why so fucking long between seasons?   Wells said Barry's body could lead to vaccines and stuff. Why did they never go through with this research?   Wow Joe was so harsh on Barry. Joe was so adamant that Barry's dad killed Barry's mom.      This.   What episode is this??   This is quote from my thread.   Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy.   same   Does that include twerking?   Same. I was looking forward to seeing more of that after the pilot but NO.   In the comics, Eobard Thawne (Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash) was a huge Flash fan and travelled back in time to meet Barry Allen. However, he miscalculated and ended up in a time after Barry Allen died and discovered that he was destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy which drove him crazy.    My question is... how would he be destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy if he was born after Barry Allen died? (Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy.)  Hopefully this question makes sense.  It's something that always has bothered me about Eobard Thawne's background.  EDIT: Fuck you downvotes. It was a genuine question.   did he get fired?   Stealth Mode suit.   Your EDIT and your TIL are the same thing   At 5'5'', he's taller than Captain America. (Steve Rogers, Pre-Serum)   Nice artwork!   I'm fucking astonished at this man's logic. Read a fucking book.   south park   Not God, Grodd.   Yeah, a costume like that wouldn't be flattering for her frame.  Dem hips in the pic though. Goddamn.   Why not?   Subway?   You got ripped off on that meal plan, my friend. I would be quite disappointed if I were you.   You like? ;)   I'm glad you're still around friend :)   have you ever met your future self   was that movie bad or something   Did you punish /u/technologicalbrian ?   Sara was the closest thing we'll get to that   I think that the only reason I will watch this show is because Kara is really cute.  [NSFW] [She looks cuter when she's about to get fucked.](http://thefappening.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Melissa-Benoist-Naked-02.jpg)   Cliche evil twin.   The boss makes me want to quit watching this show. Bitch, you're not hot.   That brings me hope. Olicity must die.   what the hell   should've allowed the voices and sound effects to play simultaneously like the first few dialogues from braniac-luthor   Laurel's full name is Dinah Laurel Lance. Laurel is Dinah.      that's how it happens in the comics   so much leather   Read the title.   I wonder why so many fans are pushing for the brighter red suit with the white emblem then.   And blacks getting killed by white cops, amirite?   Happy Cake Day.   Not all Asians are racist /:   Holy shit, I stopped playing for a little over a year and Raigeki is unbanned?   How did he get her if Barry created her though? Obviously Barry created her for his own use   Anyway, why does the timeline not reset when Eddie shoots himself?  It can't because, by killing himself, Eddie created an infinite loop paradox so the whole timeline decided to collapse on itself by creating a black hole.      the second one looks way better.   Vibrating hand of death.   I bet it was because he was also affected that night when the Particle Accelerator exploded.   So which was the majority!? Darker or Same????   Yeah I was like what the hell   Did I ever mention that it wasn't my fault?   Too masculine. Couldn't tell it was a female.   Forget two weeks, a few hours is enough for middle-eastern blood.   This thread has negative 2 comments LMAO.  But, yeah just watch the first two seasons of Arrow in order then watch Arrow season 3 and start Flash Season 1 simultaneously with watching Flash episodes before Arrow episodes. It all lines up in order.   If only it was a darker red like the costume.   Looks like a rotten banana.   I dunno, Flash and Arrow had more enjoyable pilots, imo.  I don't like the clich "anti-hero" hates protagonist up until protagonist saves his/her life or something along those lines.  Jimmy Olsen was always a young comic relief character in the comics/DCAU continuity.    he's a grown ass black man here which makes me wonder what Lois Lane looks like.  But, hey, the effects are decent.   No, there were 3 Barry's BEFORE our Barry time-travelled.  There were 4 Barry's in the finale.  Young Barry, Future Barry (who came back to save his mother and his younger self), Future Barry (who went back in time again after Flashpoint events from saving his mother to stop his younger self from saving his mother), and Our Barry.   Definitely not on-par with Arrow/Flash. Probably won't end up in the same universe.   Welcome to the Hotel California   Fuck you      Technically, he   other Barry *are the same person*.   Time Travel won't be invented until 30 years from now.   Never grew wisdom teeth and I never will.   no one saw.  Except Sasuke, right? That was one of the reasons he gave into receiving Cursed Seal LV. 2.   I mean if Naruto can become Hokage without ever promoting from Genin, I wouldn't say it's impossible for Lee to promote to whatever he wants.   An auto reply replied by an auto reply replied by an auto reply replied by an auto reply? Would've made sense if it was 3 times and not 4.   It says there are seeds on the site though with the info on the right (you know what i mean)   Yeah these torrents are pretty old about two or three years.   Good bye, Dad.   So, basically - no Flashpoint confirmed.  Great analysis, I too had my theories that there were possibly four Barrys in that room and this all makes sense.    I'm excited for what's to come.  Do you think we'll be seeing the white emblem costume again in Season 2?   AGREED   Yes Cisco   I just noticed the similarity between the two endings.   Why were the same two tweets posted twice? That confused me for a minute.   Her teeth appear to be quite big for her mouth size.   Do you think it'd be a mix of a Dynamic Timeline as well as the Multiverse Model? One could theorize that the reason Future Barry knew where, our, Present Barry was immediately and told him not to follow through with his plans was because Future Barry had already gone through the events of Flashpoint and not only went back in time, once again, to save his younger self but to also prevent his past self to ensue the events of Flashpoint in the first place.  Thus, a loop?   4 minutes in and this thread already got downvoted multiple times... what's wrong guys?   Infinite loop   Why would he choose not to have the life he always dreamed of...? That was the biggest plot twist for me.      I can't download anything.   The show *just had its* finale, so it won't be on Netflix till the Fall.  FTFY. Sorry, was bothering me while reading it.    Let's call him a distant relative.   My name... is Eobard Thawne. -nod-   Any good?   Your comment just fucked my brain.   LOL. that was so unexpected. thought you were gonna say he was retarded or something   yes.   And, if so, does that mean no possibility for updated suit? :(   And a much brighter red!   That makes a lot of sense, thank you friend. Any chance we're gonna see our Barry get Future Barry's suit in Season 2?   So, Future Flash has already experienced the Flashpoint events?   the only thing that bugs me when i first saw it and that still bugs me now seeing it again is the mouth.   That makes a lot of sense, thank you very much friend.   Thank you for the great analysis and explanation.   /u/samx3i do you believe that season 2 will explore Earth-2?   And for those who never watched Smallville, what exactly is that?   Poor Barry. Couldn't save his mom.   More like "chose not to save his mom."    Not god, grodd.   Dat singularity.   Tell that to Heatwave and Captain Cold.   Just a disclaimer - I love the show's CGI. I just thought this little bit here was derpy. Loved the finale though.      Also, do you guys think that Future Flash knew Eobard was going after Nora after young Barry was taken to safety?  One more thing, in Future Flash's timeline did he grow up with his mother?   Same!   Whoa what's a Webm and how did that download so quickly in such good quality?   Drew it with my index finger so forgive me for the sloppiness.   Didn't he say it in the pilot too   "Everyone is attractive"  Seriously? You're complaining on how the actors look? The actual acting makes sense but criticism on their appearance is retarded.   Especially Captain cold. Everything about his character down to the way he fucking talks.   That... Makes a lot of sense. Did you come up with this yourself or is a fact that all that actually happened because of the disconnect?  Common sense I suppose   Stop quoting that. That isn't an actual quote from the finale.   When he said, "I have to try," I totally did.   shooting your dick would just be painful  Implying shooting your balls wouldn't be just as painful if not more?  EDIT: Downvotes for common sense.    Dear Grodd...   So, your sister.   ty   In the finale and at a few points throughout the season since the pilot, we see the Future Scarlet Speedster in all his scarlet red and white emblem glory.  Do you guys think that costume was CGI rendered or does an actual physical Future Flash costume exist on set?   Does that mean that an actual Bright Red with White Emblem costume exists on set or was that whole costume CGI?   Some would say it's the Reverse.   it's on netflix now   no its reference to a song  	132
 Agreed. I read these years ago and just picked up the DE Trilogy again in recent months. Drizzt is the man, and really has some nice character development throughout it as well. I don't know if I'm shocked by that or not, but I guess I didn't look at it that way when I first read them.    I've always loved anything in the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Ravenloft, Dungeons and Dragons style. Some of them are miniseries within the series, others are standalone.   If you wanted a good Forgotten Realms series to get into I'd recommend The Dark Elf Trilogy. Drizzt became a huge character for R.A. Salvatore and ultimately became something more than I bet he would've imagined. Each of those books has a great pace to them as well, so it definitely keeps you locked in throughout.    Pretty much took the words right out of my...keyboard. Couldn't agree more.    All phones take crappy pictures heh. But nicely done. I dig it.   That's exactly it. I feel like readers of Da Vinci Code aren't your typical readers, so because of the movie hype - not to mention all of the additional media hype that surrounded the "Controversial subject" - I remember this book flying off the shelf.   Agreed. I did this with my grandfather years ago on a Talkboy (remember? Home Alone?) To this day it is one of my most cherished memories of him.    It's OK friend. You have maple syrup and hockey. All's well in the end.    Have a pic? I'd love to see it; provided it's in an area you can show. ;-)   Hah that's pretty funny and from what I gather, very typical of him to do. I loved Mother Night, so I'm glad he gave himself an A for that one. Slaughterhouse Five is a classic, but I don't know if I'd rank it higher. In fact, here's my go (based on what I've read of his)  Mother Night - A   Cats Cradle - A   Slaughterhouse Five - B   God Bless You Mr Rosewater - B+   Welcome to the Monkey House - A-   Breakfast of Champions - C   Deadeye Dick - F   Wampeters, Foma and Granfaloons - C   Jailbird - C   Galapagos - B   Hocus Pocus - C+   Armageddon in Retrospect - B+   Bagombo Snuff Box - B+   God Bless You Dr. Kevorkian - C-      Haha yeah, anything over 100K would help you break even.  But seriously, a fantastic spot for MMPB. Anything from the big names like Clancy, Koontz, Crichton, Rice, Vonnegut, etc. can be had for nothing. My girlfriend and I spent hours in there during a visit in February. The guy who runs it truly does it as a labor of love.    Had I read it only once I'd agree with you, but after having just read it again recently I found myself liking (and understanding) it a bit more. Sometimes KV can be a little too vague and satirical for my liking, but I found myself laughing a bit more this time around.   That said, his style does grate on my after a while. This isn't a direct quote, but if you've read anything from him you can relate. "He put the pasta into the colander. A colander is used to drain water from pasta. Pasta is made for consumption. Through consumption humans get energy."  Maybe that's a lame example, but it's late and I'm tired. hah   And then there's this: http://www.bookthing.org/  By far the single greatest book "store" ever. I'm planning a trip there next month and I live 3 1/2 hours away. Well worth the trip considering the cost of gas more or less covers the books.    Hah yeah, pretty much. Just don't forget the gambling on horses thing and then you have him down perfectly.   I find humor in the sheer fact that he embraces his role, but I just can't hack his stuff. It just feels like the same thing over and over and over again.    Thanks, I'm not the only one.    Truth be told, by bookshelf is kind of a timeline of my life. While I've already stowed away the children's books for the day when I have kids of my own, the collection more or less begins with my early interest in sports and fantasy. From there, a number on non-fic books start to pop up along the lines of "Alive" and "Devil in the White City," but there's also a good mix of humor with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs as well.   Yes, I have my one shelf devoted to Stephen King and Tom Clancy, another devoted to Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter Thompson, but for the most part I have a pretty solid, well-rounded library that I'm really happy to show off whenever someone says they enjoy reading.    Oh he's definitely whiny, but that's the beauty of it. How many times do we look back on life and think about how easy those things were to overcome when we were 14 - 17?  I'd take the responsibilities of 18-year-old me again in a heartbeat. They pale in comparison to those obstacles I face now, but when I look back on those moments I think of how easy they were and how immature I was to whine about something so trivial.    Da Vinci Code, Sarah's Key, Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Anything by Charles Bukowski, Hyperion    I didn't mind Galapagos, but Deadeye Dick was awful.    Agreed. Not to mention the thought of having endless cliffhangers after every chapter makes me nauseous already.    I was just talking to a buddy of mine about this the other day. He's one month away from having his first kid and we were just shooting the ish, talking about growing up, playing video games (Goldeneye tourneys all dayyyy son), Magic the Gathering, D D, Warhammer, LAN parties for Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft II, etc. Time goes by so fast. Hang onto these ones. They'll last a lifetime.    God damn. That was beautiful. Salute.   Agreed. It's been on my list as well. However, I've noticed over the years of my browsing through the discount rack at B N (because let's be honest, it's ALWAYS there) that the translations and versions tend to vary. I'm sure it's all "in the ballpark," as they say, but for the sake of discussing it while reading I'm just curious to see if anyone knows of the best version of this classic.    The Stand.   	24

    They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin.   Maybe it doesn't fit your appeal. As a legendary Apollo I think it looks nice and may wait for gem drop BUT with the free gems you can win this weekend you may only have to pay for 400. I think it looks nice.   Confirmed!   Successful trade with MuseTheGreat. Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, Ratchet and Clank: Up your Arsenal, and Ratchet: Deadlocked. Great guy!   League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?    I was ranging from about 1990-now.   Really cannot agree more.       Did it   They all look really really good, and sadly, no. I will continue looking but the offer for the paid shipping is still up if its inconvenient for you.   Actually closer to Philadelphia. I guess I'm not too familiar with the map and regions haha.    Just someone with a funny design like Ymir, Kumba, Ne Zha, Bakasura, etc.   That's fine. I was aiming about ten or below. We'll discuss the shipping and stuff tomorrow but may I see the pictures?     	15

 Go get checked. I just had a cancer scare and it was no fun.    I will be seeing you at the Hollywood Bowl on October 8th. Can we hang out?    i was sooo close to photoshopping this same exact thing. you win!    yeah!   ahhh you got me!   I was just in line at the bank. The guy in front of me was some creepy old guy wearing a AAA uniform. The girl behind me was an attractive Latina nurse.   So the old guy starts hitting on the nurse pretty hard. Calls her spicy, compliments her figure and generally eye-fucks her the whole time. I could tell that she was getting really uncomfortable, and felt like I should intervene. I mean, I was sandwiched between them so it's not like I could ignore it all. So, I did what I do best: I start hitting on the old pervert. Hardcore.   I generally repeated the things he said to her, complimented his mustache and uniform and said it would look best on my bedroom floor. I even winked a few times. I could tell this guy was incredibly homophobic and hated the fact that he was getting hit on by a guy. He did, however, understand the point I was making and got out of line and left. He even apologized.   The girl thanked me and said she'd never seen anyone do that. I just replied that I'm always happy to fight fire with fire.   So is this something I can get knighted for? I'd love to be knighted.    they do in my heart   great, now i'm turned on at work   More times than you'd think. I should also add that I owned a toy from the smash hit FLUBBER that would dance from sound activation. If I started clapping, shit would go crazy.    From ages 8-10 (roughly). It was great.    clearly i should stay off the internet. thanks!    got em!   http://imgur.com/S2beu   sorry, there's the link.   	13
    On it!  I finally feel like I want to be around people again!   Thanks for the encouragement and perspective!  It helps to think to the future.  At least today it does!    	3
 Hey thanks heaps for getting back to me.  What goes on on the Sunday classes?    I really want to start training in Parkour, great exercise and what not. Is there much of a scene in Newy or a group or  others keen to give it a crack?   Does anyone know of any uni sharehouses Here? Preferably near Macquarie Uni?   Would anyone out there happen to know of any web development or Web design companies in New that are looking an intern or work or anything like that.   That is brilliant       Yeah its a really great place. They don't have the range that Kings have but whatever they don't have they happily order for you and it gets here pretty quickly.  And the Owner is a bloke named James and he is super talkative but a really nice guy.      	8
 Nope.    Nopenopenope.   Dead people freak me out anyway and I am terrified of zombies, even if it wasn't a zombie, that would have been the first thought that popped into my head, I would have promptly emptied my bowls and bladder simultaneously and learned to fly real quick.  Because my feet would not have touched the floor once as I booked it the hell out of there o-o.    Yeah, do let us know what they say. I'm sure there's a few details of the story that I've forgotten but I told it to the best of my memory, which is usually pretty good and considering that this story put me off  little black dogs for years, it's one I remember the best lol.    Well, fortunately, unlike some people, I don't waste my time writing fictional stories ^_^.   	3
 Should have closed one eye and looked at your thumb.   My father was great and strong. I never knew him.  He left before I was born. I only talked to my mother about him once in the ten years before she left me too.  My father's parents took me in. Grandpa was a businessman, and a good one. When I moved in, however, he gave all that up to buy a fishing boat, and hired a crew. He spent most of his money, and Grandma nearly left him.  Over the next five years we would set out for months at a time, only coming in for short a reprieve before heading back out. It was hard work, but with Grandpa there, I remember it all fondly. It seems really exciting looking back on our adventure.  On my fifteenth birthday, there was a storm. Even grandpa was taken by surprise. He lost his nerve and tried to turn back, but it was too late. A wave broadsided us and rolled the entire ship over. We lost all of our equipment that had been on the deck. Across the from where I clung to anything I could find, I no longer saw him in the bridge.  Grandpa was gone. Plucked away by the storm.  After the sky cleared, and I was finally falling into an anguished sleep, I heard the sound of water dripping on the linoleum near my bunk. I opened my eyes to find my grandpa standing there next to the bed.  "I'm glad you finally met him," he said and he walked out of my room.  My father taught me everything I needed to know about life that day. About loss.   He's probably over in /r/shaving or /r/wet_shavers or something. :P   /u/outfromtheashes is slackin', but he's trying to make a new guide for beginning writers. Basically a quick list of do's and definitely don'ts.  I don't think there's any way to have a story you write here do well without having some basis of writing. Get some fundamentals, then the story you want to tell and do it.  /r/nosleepworkshops is there for people to work on improving their nosleep stories.   Yeah? Look who's talking, bub!   What makes you think it's a Moleskine?   Yes! That was great!   That ending is awesome. I think trying to condense it into some moral lesson or something could only cheapen it. Nice story, thanks.   "You're so vain. You probably think this post is about you."  Music. Just music. :P  I don't see a problem if you can edit it to 274, but what if it's 1000 words and you edit and edit and finally hit... 500. Rock bottom. Then what?   You also can't ignore how reader-friendly it is. A 275 word story is just a couple minutes worth of time invested. Some of those /r/nosleep stories are thousands of words, not counting series.   I guess I might as well mention here that I moderate /r/NoSleepReruns, which is for exactly this - a great story gets posted there and no one even gives it a chance. It's a sort of recommendation sub for second chances.   Completely agree. That CSS makes me feel dirty.   Here's the thing. /r/NoSleep is pretty restrictive in their rules. It's sometimes hard to write for, because most of the time it necessitates everything being in first person.  /r/ShortScaryStories can be about anything, but there's the length restriction. That's not good or bad, it just is, and I think it definitely has its place. The only problem with it is that people are editing their stories down to 274 words to fit them in here. That's not necessarily the best thing for the story.  /r/DarkTales is non-restrictive. It's not even just Horror, it's anything dark. Maybe some people have been turned off by the sidebar. Maybe people don't know what it is.  You have to mention /r/LetsNotMeet as well, since it's basically the way that /r/NoSleep was in the beginning, and it's got 95,500 subscribers - nearly twice the size of /r/shortscarystories.  The point is, I would assume that /r/DarkTales would have the most subscribers, /r/shortscarystories would have the second most and /r/NoSleep would have the least. Not even factoring in the default status of /r/NoSleep, it's exactly the opposite. Why? How did they form that way?  /r/LibraryofShadows is as abandoned as a real library. The librarian checks in once every few months to make sure it hasn't burned down or collect the insurance money. The users that do accidentally stumble in there don't seem to actually read anything judging by the votes.  EDIT: Oops, i meant /r/TheTruthIsHere (33,000), not /r/LetsNotMeet.   You may be patient 4,567,003, but you're still a zero.   Welp, these were all the comments I needed to read here.   Is this it? The chosen one?   Boo!   Seven "fucks!" Fuck yeah!  Thanks for the honest feedback. I was too attached to some ideas to notice that they actually came out deformed. Good comments.   Thanks for having a read-through. This is the type of stuff I was looking for.   43,592 in /r/shortscarystories  2,780 in /r/DarkTales. I like it, I do, but why hasn't it picked up an audience?   So I've noticed a lot of posts that are 274 words here. Exactly 274 - one word away from that limit. It's pretty clear that they're being edited to fit.  So if you write a story that's 276, and can't be any shorter than that or it'll fall like a deck of cards, where do you submit it?  ShortScaryStories is awesome, but is there a sub without a word limit for catch-all horror writing? If not, why do you think that is?  **TL;DR:** Where else do you submit your stories? Subreddits? Websites?   Holy Spirit.  God the creator, resting on the 7th day.  The son, God come down as a man.  God, the myth, the communicated idea.  God's existence depends on us humans. Kill the human, kill God.   Nah, I think they're a time traveler like in The Time Machine. The streetlights are the old fashioned lamp ones like in pre-electric London (his time). His time machine is hidden in the woods, now out of fuel from the last jump. He's just realizing that he left fingerprints in another time when he wasn't supposed to exist, thus creating a rift and rewriting history.   No. Thanks. That's great, but yeah, I really am trying to sleep.   Wow, you actually came up with this? That's amazing. You're a prodigy. Who's your publisher? Is it hard to write when you *can't even be bothered to read the sidebar*?   So you can put in a good word [with them](http://sites.lwhs.org/animation13/files/2013/12/2003-The-Triplets-Of-Belleville-2003-11-960x566.jpg) for me, right?    Pyramids. They burn just like she did.   Thanks for writing the memoir of my mother for me. D:   He said, **"MEN DON'T HAVE THE BABIES."**  Edit: "babys"   Cigarettes.   The animal corpses did it for me.  Good to have to back writing shorts, Gravy.   When I was a teenager, my mom used to down a fifth of cheap booze and pass out in front of the TV. I'd sometimes sneak in and steal her still-lit cigarette from between her stained fingers.   Then one night I didn't.  At least I've still got her brand to remember her by.   If you wantto collaborate with those authors, I suggest you message them directly. Check the Author Pages section of the FAQ for Facebook pages etc.   /r/CreepyReadings?   /r/AskScience, /r/HomeworkHelp and check the related links there. Not sure about the rules for AS, but it's popular at least.   The poor, unsuspecting public!  Seriously though? Knowing that you wrote that a long time ago is really interesting. I think you're a phenomenal writer now. This may not have been the greatest thing, but shit, you did a lot right! You built characters and layered on a plot, which sounds basic, but those are things that a lot of people just *can't* do. So all flaws considered,  It's actually inspiring that you shared this.  Thanks.   [Aokigahara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara)   That part in bold is fucking awesome. Great stuff.   It was the word "squirt" wasn't it?   Meth heads usually have rotted teeth; it's a common identifier.  Also, a trope in horror is to have someone grow an "unnaturally," or "impossibly" large smile and/or shows their sharp teeth.   It should have been obvious from the title, but I didn't see it coming. Get 'im, KMA!   I was just trying to be helpful, gosh.   Come on, baby, don't be like that.    What was that machine?  And is the ~~Grindhorse~~ Understeed coming back next year or going to another farm?  Some absolutely terrific descriptions here. I'm glad you lived to tell the tale.   Sorry, ma'am, Queen. I'll try to keep it local from now on.      I haven't told you how much I like this yet, but I do. The only thing is that I feel a little weird because I read it on my phone.   It's kind of weird though, because when I was a kid I played outside. I went down the block to the park and walked to school... But my kid? Over my head body is he just *outside* all the time like that when nobody's watching him.   Thought I heard sirens.   I know the feeling. I couldn't believe it when she told me that.   My name is Minnie, like the mouse, and Ill suck your dick if youll give me another hit. For a rock Ill do whatever you want.  But you gotta wear a rubber. Im a classy lady and I aint stupid. They all wear condoms.  Some guys try not to. There was this one guy...  Five bucks to finish the story.  Kay. So theres this guy, Mike. Mick. Somethin. Anyway, he lives down under the bridge usually. He took a liking to me after the first squirt. For some fuckin reason he was hooked on *this*. Problem was he didnt always have the money for it.  One day he shows up broke and shitfaced and tries to feed me all this shit about how he *loves* me. He starts gettin grabby and then pulls a knife, so I shoot him in the gut with Lil Missy here.  Nobody gives a shit about us down here. Get it? So nobody cared when Mikey died, least of all me.  Next night he comes crawling back - like I told you, its like hes addicted to this fuckin honey. Only... a full day layin under the bridge with a bunch of rats hungrier than him means he aint got legs anymore. Chewed him clean in half. Guts trailing about ten-twelve feet behind him and hes litrally crawling his ass back to me.  Says I love you, and I shoot him in the head so he finally lays down.  Hey.  Hey, where you going?   You sure packed a lot of story in there.  So Benjamin convinced this adult woman that she was his mother until Wendell came and told her that Benjamin was the same kid he'd grown up who was actually ~60 years old?  The town is kind of like Neverland, then? Where you never have to grow up.  So just one more question... if he breaks through their arms, is he free?   Nicely done!    More good ideas, thanks.   Ooh okay my bad.         That kinda sorta makes sense, but I think you're struggling to develop [ethos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion) as a writer, and most times you read it it's a mistake. So unless you already are a well-known writer with a reputation of making few errors and people are going to look for some deeper meaning, then... I'd just say follow the rules in this case.                  He didn't realize that there was a cut or scar? Or did they teleport it out of him?   Jesus fuck, man. Was the reason you had to finish it... because you started it?   I knew I'd seen your username before! You wrote The Itch for the picture challenge!  Thanks for the welcome and suggestions.   This story was off the hook, Itch. If the guy kidnapped Sophie lived nearby, maybe it was a close call? I really hope they can catch him and send him to prison, then the rest of his cals will be made on a cell phone.   Not all, man. Storm troopers aren't clones or they'd all be the same height.    Do you ever think that maybe there's another way? Like another path or road that time didn't take? That someone back in our lives made a decision, and both worlds still exist; both sides of that decision were made, but we can't see the other side?  A man showed up at my farm tonight who looked a lot like me. He had my mom's eyes, and his smile was crooked like mine and Dad's. He said his name was Bill. My brother's name was Billy, but he died when we were little.  Bill said that he was tired, just looking for a place to rest. I let him sleep in the bed and didn't pester him. Dad always said, "Best to treat others well. You never know when you might need a favor." It wasn't pretty, but it's honest.  Dad. That bastard.   He shot Billy right in front of me when I was just ten. When I'd visit him in prison, he'd tell me it was because I was his favorite. Because I was the strongest. The smartest. Because it was fate.  Now I know that it wasn't any of that. It was just a decision.  Tomorrow, I'm going to follow Billy to the place where that decision wasn't made.   Dude, sometimes your puns are my main motivation to write. I just start getting that itch to hear one, you know?   Thanks, Itch!  Yeah. I love it here too. It seems like every time I go to /r/nosleep lately I end up writing a complaint in the OOC and deleting it.  This place reminds me a lot of the pre-default nosleep. As in, people actually want to be here. Much more positive environment.  Thanks for the rundown, though. You're all my new friends now.    What users post regularly here that i should follow? Got any favorites? How about favorite SSS's of all time?   ^ I'd put that first sentence of this post in the comments if you're worried about it. Good on you for caring about stuff like that.  Also, why is this your last story?   Do you ever think that maybe there's another way? Like another path or road that time didn't take? That someone back in our lives made a decision, and both worlds still exist; both sides of that decision were made, but we can't see the other side?  A man showed up at my farm tonight who looked a lot like me. He had my mom's eyes, and his smile was crooked like mine and Dad's. He said his name was Bill.

Thank you for reading it. You're all so nice tonight!  And yes, the *'s turn into italics in Markdown.   Thanks!  I'll definitely check the comma usage, and consider the timestamps.  I didn't want to beat someone over the head with a re-telling of The Krampus. It's scarier to me if it's human, just someone who actually kidnaps (bad) kids, and beats people with a stick. The title is more of a sort of lens to view the character through, and to arouse suspicion of the mysterious stranger. Maybe I tried to do too much?  What about the narration of the tape? Are there more problems than those that you mentioned?  Thanks again!   [That was kind of a dark suggestion](http://i.imgur.com/QyI7gt9.jpg), AFC, given what /u/Bruxism- said. Oh well.   [Krampus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lu_QB6Nv_ilStO4LfFW3AIDFP7z3Hte-xK_ZbOet99M/edit?usp=sharing)  First try at a found-footage style narration. I seriously want feedback on this, even if you *didn't* read it, at least if you could tell me why, or at what point you stopped.  Edit: I give bonus points for angry expletives in your comments, so go nuts. Be destructive.   There are some weak, info-dumpy passages that stick out like sore thumbs.  One example is a character who says out loud what their job is to another character. This is obvious to them, and it's clearly only there to explain to the reader.  There are a lot of adverbs (-ly everything). If someone exclaimed, then they did so loudly - the reader can figure that out without you telling them. It seems like a small thing, but it's one of those things that marks it as being amateurish, and degrades trust in the writer. On that same note, there are a few words that maybe didn't mean quite what you thought they did. Just trust in your prose.  I didn't read the whole thing yet, but I do like how you've layered the plot on. You're not apologetic with the unique parts of the world (magic/The Choosing/memory reading/religion) and I like that confidence.  Oh, and I found a you're/your mix-up which was inexcusable.  All-in-all, I would just say write what you know. Your ideas are pretty good, but the language is a little irritating and doesn't quite suit you yet. I think the story could have been fine if stated more simply, so just have the confidence to do that.     I think it's telling you to eat her.   Or you could just wear flashing lights and reflective clothing. There's no benefit to being "stomp-activated" except when you're a kid.   The Holidays raise my anxiety level. I think that they must raise everyone's to some extent, but my therapist said that I should write down what happened to me two Thanksgivings ago. He said that it might help. I doubt it, but here goes.  It starts with Miriam, a woman about my age who worked in the office downstairs. She wasn't ashamed to show her scars. Over the top of her sun dress, they blossomed out over her shoulders like a topographical map. I did my best to avoid bringing it up whenever I saw her, which only became more difficult when she started saying hi to me when I'd get there in the morning and when I'd leave at night. The signals were obvious. She had me in her sights.  She didn't rush me when I wouldn't ask her out right away. She knew about my last girlfriend, and how it hadn't ended well. Lisa's alcoholism had gone downhill, brakes cut and out of control. I hung on, however, to hope and to her. I refused to leave, even past the point when it was obvious that nothing good could come from it. I think that in reality I hoped that she'd die, rather than to have to face the feeling that I'd failed and abandoned her.  What she did instead was come to my office with her father's unwieldy hunting rifle. Everyone I knew anymore had been at work when it happened. Miriam had probably been locked down in her real estate office like the rest of us. It's funny because we'd failed our most recent active shooter drill before that, but the police were able to stop her before she got close to me.  After Lisa had been taken to prison, I discovered that my days now felt empty. Most of my time had revolved around her while the rest of the world, myself included, had been neglected. My birthday came and went without anyone even noticing. I bought some good whiskey that night to celebrate in my apartment, but somehow drinking just dredged up bad feelings about Lisa and made me feel sick. I ended up drinking some water and turning in early.  I liked Miriam, but I couldn't see myself asking anyone to hang out anymore. What would we do? I didn't go to bars or play sports or hike or... anything. I'd let myself go physically and mentally, putting on over 40 pounds in a few months. I had nothing. More than anything, though, I was afraid that if we spent any time together outside of our hello-goodbye conversations that she'd see that. I started getting to work early in the mornings to avoid seeing her in the shared lobby. There wasn't anything I could do about the evenings, though. Whenever I got off work, she'd be there, acting like she was waiting for something else. She always left right after me, though.  The Fall season brought freezing rain that came down in buckets. It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and a long weekend was just around the corner. The potholes on the way to work were so full of black water that in the evening light you couldn't even tell what was a puddle and what was a pit. It was one of these hidden voids that caught my front tire. I felt the car hydroplane and lose traction, then catch on the broken asphalt, jerking the steering wheel in my hands. The front of the car glanced off a narrow tree, sending the world spinning. I just remember everything being *so fucking loud*... and then nothing.  When I woke up, I was in such incredible pain that I couldn't speak or even think. I felt myself sliding along the forest floor, the rain falling on my face. I opened my eyes and there was Miriam, the strain of dragging me evident on her face. "Oh thank God, someone's here," was what I wanted to say. What I tried to say. All that came out, though, was the scream like a tortured animal. With each tug, she managed to drag me a few inches, and my arms and legs would be reignited with pain.  Through tears and involuntary screams, I pleaded with her to stop. One concrete question pushed its way through the maelstrom of agony: *Where is she taking me?* I couldn't even hear the road from where I was and the only trees that I could see were far away. Looking past my feet I saw her car where she'd dragged me from. *Her* car.  The reality of my situation set in then. She wasn't rescuing me. She was *taking* me.  She pulled me up the small wooden steps which raked across my shoulders. Out of place bones in the small of my back hung up on the top steps. She yanked harder and everything fell to black again.  I woke up in a room with wooden floors and walls and just one door. I was laying flat on the floor, ropes tangled over top of me in a web. I couldn't move, anyway. There was pain when I tried and I was pretty sure that bones on the right side of my chest were broken. The really concerning thing was that my legs didn't seem to respond at all. The smell of cooking food and something foul filled the room from a small antique-style wood cookstove.  Soon, Miriam came in from outside wearing a dark green raincoat and black, knee-high rubber boots that trailed mud onto the door mat. She flashed perfect white teeth at me when she saw me looking.  "I was worried you'd never wake up, sleepyhead!"  "Help. Help me."  "Oh did you do another doo-doo? Well, I'll clean you up in just a moment."  She sounded so vapid. So stupid. LIke a pampered teen in Uggs and yoga pants talking about someone else's toy poodle. I hated her. I was fucking terrified of her, but that felt natural. The part that didn't feel at all normal about it was that I was now hyper-aware of the dozens of imperceptible things that she did from moment to moment. The way her hair was; how it smelled; how she wore her belt too high; the slight lisp in her voice that she'd trained to only come in on some words. She was too old for all of it.  She hung up her jacket and sweatshirt, and took off the boots, leaving them by the door. She cleaned me like a baby. I almost blacked out again when she lifted my legs to get the filth that had run up my back. Then she went to check on the stove.  I said before that I liked her. If none of this had ever happened, I might have even worked up the courage to ask her out. We'd have gone on some kind of a first date. Dinner and a movie. Maybe not dinner, actually. She'd have wanted to cook herself. But then I'd have tried to get to know her. I'd have looked right past those things that I was suddenly aware of. Knowing that she was some kind of psycho made it easy to call those things out in my mind - she was past redemption anyway.  This is what makes the whole thing so hard to forget and put in the past. Before this, I would never have known. She hid it, but more to the point, I was willing to trust her without knowing anything about her. Then at the end of the date, I'd have gone back to her place and I still would have ended up watching her walk across the room with a knife in her hand.  I thought that she was going to torture me, or kill me. The insane thought even came into my head that she'd slaughter and eat me like a fattened pig. She pulled out a wooden folding chair from the table and stood above me. She just stood there and looked at me, then looked at the knife then back at me and smiled and, oh God, I remember thinking that she looked cute when she smiled because tiny dimples would form in her cheeks.  "I'm so glad you could come for Thanksgiving, Adam," she said while pulling down her pants. "I've liked you for a while now, you know. You play hard to get."  I continued to watch the knife as she spun it in her hands. The blade would catch the light from the gas-powered lamp and flash twice on every rotation. The wooden handle had been dyed like a rainbow, each ring of grain a different shade. It looked ridiculous. It also looked sharp. She set the tip on the top of her thigh and spun it again. Blood ran in a bold line off her pale, scarred skin and fell onto the floor.  "What a perfect first date. I would say that I didn't expect it... but I think we both knew that this was coming. I know I've daydreamed about it before. Every day." As she said the words, she pulled the knife along her leg. It didn't go smoothly, but it went deep. The blood pooled on the floor and ran into the cracks between the boards. She waited a moment with her eyes closed before she pulled it out. Then she did a sort of shiver, like a cold breeze had blown across her neck.  I looked away then, but it didn't help. I knew that she was cutting again and softly humming against the pain of it. I could see it in my mind as well as hear the blood dribbling onto the floor. Looking away, the only change was that the smells from the kitchen crept back into my focus. Mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, yams with cinnamon and brown sugar. The place smelled like heaven and I was starving. Even through my horror, some crazy part of me wanted to eat.  Miriam bandaged up her wound and then cleaned the floor. From on top of the table she picked up a plate, the contents of which I couldn't see from the floor, then took it back to the stove.  "Dinner's almost ready," she said. "Everything else is done. I hope you're hungry. I've just got to cook this and it will be time to eat."  I couldn't say no. It hurt too much to fight and she was surprisingly strong when I tried to turn my head and close my mouth against it. The first piece I spat out onto the floor without chewing. She cried and slapped me across the face. With the next one she held the rainbow-handled knife to my throat. She took a picture of my face as I chewed, the plate on the floor next to my head, the thick strip of her cooked flesh sitting there lifeless and sluglike.  She took more pictures on her iPhone, and fed me more. There were five pieces, but it felt like it went on forever. I tried to throw up when it was done, but nothing came. There was nothing left in my stomach to throw up. Miriam sent and sat in a stuffed chair which faced away from me after that for a few minutes. I didn't care to see what she was doing during that time. Then she fed me the rest of my dinner, asking me at least ten times if I'd had enough. After cleaning up, she laid a sleeping bag out on the floor next to me and kissed me good-night.  "Thank you, Adam. Happy Thanksgiving."  I laid there awake for an hour. A whole hour with just silence and pain, and my crazy thoughts whirling around in my head. Splashes of red and blue lights appeared on the walls from the front window, then the police came through the door a moment later. As they were loading me into the ambulance that one of them chuckled and said that "It smells amazing in here."   Is this... for this subreddit?  Is there a code?      [Good advice? What are you doing here?](http://i.giphy.com/5xaOcLOmvJEKIOpOSe4.gif)   Kill it.  Sending this stuff in a PM is awesome. Saying "This scared the shit out of me and was so well written," seems fine. Playing along and asking about the story is better.  But just replying to "The thing covered in human teeth and nails came out of the forest and ate my family," with "This is the greatest thing ever!" is not so cool for a place like this.   It gave me an Indiana Jones vibe.   Congrats for getting back into writing. Don't stop!   "Beef bike! BEEF BIKE! Why aren't you stopping?"   I mean, still harass them, but at least have a safe word or something.   I *was* wondering.  Hope you're feeling better,  though, seriously.

A bit of pink lace hanging out of his briefcase. Those were the first pair that I found.  We used to fight about it back then. I think he enjoyed the fights almost as much as he enjoyed *them*. He liked knowing that I knew, the crazy bastard. He liked that power; the feeling that Id never... do... *anything.*  But then he started bringing his girls back to the house with him. *My house. My bed.* I couldnt take it listening to their screams and moans coming from the room.  So I tied him up.   Thats it; its all I had to do. I tied him to the bed one night and left, pushing my way past the grisly, shadowy figures streaming in - the ghosts of the girls hed killed, come to reclaim their peace.   You need Pocket.

I'd say its front-page dreams are over.  Too bad, too, because it was a pretty interesting story.   Thanks for pointing out what was "special" about the notebook itself.  You know what you can use on the go? A tablet with a stylus. You don't even have to take a picture of it that way.   I want to apologize, but cant. The guilt of losing a piece of my towns history is burning a hole in my gut, but its not something that I can just talk about with them. Its not something that you can just bring up in casual conversation.  History can be a powerful thing in the wrong hands. A persons reputation controls them, and in a small town like mine, their history defines them. The antidote then, is to control your own history - to keep evidence, to continue remembering.  I lost a video tape, one of those little ones that fits inside a portable camcorder, and now I cant even apologize for it... but maybe I can make up for it, even a little. By sharing it with you. This piece of history, uncut, unaltered: the truth.  The tape begins in mid-November, 1993. Peter Smith, 8 years old at the time was given the camcorder by his uncle for his birthday. The first five minutes or so is mainly made up of the kind of stuff youd expect an 8-year-old to film; clipped conversations, awkward shots of family members half out of frame, people singing happy birthday where the camera cant decide where to focus because of the dim lighting of the candles.  Without warning, it changes to the inside of a cramped apartment. Childrens toys and clothes scatter the floor. Peter is doing a fake newscast in his bedroom. His sister Nicole, just five years old, does a convincing impression of the local weatherman, capped with a back to you, Pete!  Together, they belt out a breaking news theme, trumpets, drums and all.  Their father bursts into frame. Keep it down! he hisses. Your mother is trying to sleep!  Peter, frozen on camera, looks mortified. He suddenly seems very out of place wearing his fathers tie over his Power Rangers sweatshirt, blond hair cut into a 90s bowl.  Nicole speaks up. But mommy sleeps all the time! We never get to do anything anymore!  Peter leaves his seat and steps out of frame. Randall, their father, crosses in front, kneeling down to hug his daughter. Just before the tape transitions again, you can hear him say, Shes sick, baby. She-  *-clip-*  In the next shot, the family is packing boxes into the back of an orange and white moving truck. Dad, can I keep the camera out and film this? Peter asks from behind the lens.  Sure, champ! Randall is loading a box labeled clothes into the truck. Hes smiling. Its obvious that some time has passed since the last scene, and seeing him now is a huge contrast to last time he was on the camera. A blue plaid shirt stretches across his broad chest. Hes grown a beard, and the new look suits him well.  Where are we going daddy? Nicole asks.  Oh, baby. I told you, were moving to Oregon.  Ory-gun? Why?  The cute factor of this five year old is killer. Shes adorable. Long, dark hair hangs down nearly to the bottom of her puffy, dark blue winter coat. The coat forces her arms out from her sides, and a pink beanie with a frilly pom-pom tops the whole spectacle like a cherry.  Were going to start over there.  Start over? Like Noah?  Randy smiles widely. What do you know about Noah?  He put all the animals in his art and there was a biiig flood, and then the sun came out and God gave them a rainbow. Then they started over.  Thats very good, honey. And youre absolutely right, were going to put everything on our ark, he gestures to the moving truck, and were going to start over new.  Is God going to give us a rainbow when we get to... to...  Oregon?  Yeah, Ory-gun.  Maybe hon-  *-clip-*  The tape skips again, for several minutes, Peter films out the window as cars and brightly-colored signs fly past. He quickly pans, showing his sister in the carseat next to him, and his mother, Quincy, driving. The orange moving truck can just be seen ahead of them through the windshield.  *-clip-*  Did you get it? Did you get that?" Quincy asks. The camera is moving all over the place. You can hear the belt unbuckle and Peter points the camera out the back window of the car. Auto-focus struggles and then settles on the rain-covered glass.  No! I missed it, youve got to go back!  I cant go back, Pete. Its okay, though.  Nicole starts crying.  No mom, weve got to go back and film it. We have to!  Were not gonna make it to Ory-gun, now! Nicole wails hopelessly.  Nicky! Nicky! Its okay! Were *in* Oregon. We just didnt film the sign at the border, thats all. Its alright, now calm down.  Peter mumbles a Sorry, Nicky, before shutting the camera off again.  *-clip-*  You see Randall and the kids in a hotel room with two queen-sized beds. McDonalds happy meals and wrappers are on the tables. Nicole is squealing, jumping on the beds. She looks like shes never had more fun.  Dad, video tape us! Peter says, and hands the camera to his father. After a few fumbling seconds, it turns to show Peter now in place on top of one bed, his sister on the other facing him across the divide.  Ready? Peter says. Go!  The two jump. Peter easily clears the gap, doing a bellyflop on the other side, but Nicole lands on the hard edge of the bed. She starts crying and Randall immediately sets the camera on the bed, facing the wall.  The door bangs open and as Quincy comes in from outside the room. Shut up! God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, Randy?  Sorry, Quin, we-  Shut her up. Shes going to wake everyone in the fucking hotel.  Hey, cool it, Quin. Please?  Im going to go finish my smoke. Pete, its time for bed.  Mom!  Ssshut up! Just shut up! Jesus, all day long with you and... she trails off and the door slams shut.  Nicole and Peters sniffling is the only thing you can hear for a a few seconds. Randall breaks the silence. Its okay. Youre okay. Lets just get ready for bed. You know what tomorrow is?  We get to our new home? Peter asks.  Thats right, and were going to start over over there, remember? Things are going to be different. I promise. Okay guys?  Okay.  Now lets go brush our teeth.  The camera stays on, ignored on the bed next to the wall. When the kids have come back and are tucked into bed, Nicole asks, Daddy? I dont think mommy likes me. I dont want her to come back.   Heyyy, Randy says soothingly. Mommys going to be okay again. I promise. Remember how she used to play with you all the time? Remember before... before she got sick?  No.  Well *I* remember. And you know what? Shes still your mommy, and shes part of our family, so we love her no matter what. And I love *you* no matter what. And you too, mister.  Love you too, dad.  The front door opens again. Quincy sighs, Finally.  Hey... Quin, can we talk?  Randy, Im fucking tired. I really dont need to hear it right now.  Come on, Quincy. Just... You promised youd try this.  I am trying. What do you call this? Moving hours away from everything just because your friend is selling his house?  Sh! Lets go outside.  Fine, but you say one thing about your new pal Jesus, and Im gonna...  Just... Youre going to wake the kids. They dont need to hear us like this.  The door closes and though the voices start off muffled, you can hear that Quincy is shouting. Eventually, Randy comes in to go to bed and turns off the camera.  *-clip-*  In the next shot, the family has already arrived at the new house. Peter is running outside while making motor noises with his mouth. Nicole is sitting on the porch steps, organizing her pink Barbie backpack.  A white, two-story house sits in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by tall evergreens. A hand-made garage and a gravel driveway that leads to the main road are the only other things in the grassy clearing. Dark clouds hang low over the house.  Peter steers onto the large front porch, through the front door into a furnished living room, catching a glimpse of his parents sitting at dining room table, then barreling down the hallway and out the back door. As he runs beside the porch again, his father calls his name.  Youd better come in! It looks like its going to rain out there!  Aw!  Wheres your sister?  I dunno!  Nicky!  They continue to call and look for her, checking behind the garage and in all the rooms of the house. Quincy joins them outside, hands stuffed into her pockets, dark hair blowing wildly in the stirring wind.  Where could she be? Randall says, returning from the driveway. I mean, she couldnt have gotten far, right? I knew we should have gotten the phones hooked up sooner.  I think she left, Randy.  What? No. She probably just...  Its happening again, Randy. Shes so quiet that the turbulent wind very nearly swallows her words.  Quincy, its-  We lost her!  We didnt *lose* her. What are you talking about?  Fuck you, Randy. You know what Im talking about. Quincy goes inside, leaving Randall staring at the empty space that she just occupied. Snowflakes have started falling in force.  *-clip-*  Peter and Randall are in the car, making their way down a narrow gravel road.  Dad, where are we going?  Were going to go into town so we can get the police to help us find your sister.  Trees are blurring by on the both sides, the gravel path winding between them. Snow has fallen in the areas where the branches above are sparse and flakes are starting to pile up on the windshield.  The gravel driveway drops down a final steep incline to find a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Randy slams on the brakes, and the car skids in the soft wet gravel.  What? Randall says.  What is it dad?  I dont know...  Is that a person?  Randall opens the car door and crosses in front of the cars headlights. Peter is pointing the camera through the window onto the road, but its impossible to see anything there in the gathering darkness.  Randall jogs a short way, then suddenly stops and raises a hand to his mouth. He bends down and scoops up a shapeless black form. Zoomed in, the camera is shaking in Peters hands.  Get in the back seat, Pete, he says through the glass. Randy opens the door and lays the dark mass in the passenger seat. The camera zooms out and another mans pale face comes into focus.  *-clip-*  What the FUCK are you doing? Who the FUCK is that, Randall?  I found him on the road. Hes hurt, but I didnt see a car or anything.  And you just *brought him here?*  The roads are closed going both ways. The trees are just blowing over everywhere. Every few feet another one is down.  Jesus, is he even breathing?  Randall carries the tiny man over to the couch in the open living area, in front of the wood stove.  And what about Nicole, Randy? Did you see her?  Im going to keep looking. I dont know how long I can stay out in this weather. Ill try to get through to the neighbors houses, at least. Maybe she just got lost and went over there. Its going to be fine.  You- youre leaving me here? With *him*? And what if he wakes up? I dont believe this.  Pete follows his father out onto the porch with the camera. The snow is falling so thickly that the little shed not 100 feet from the house is completely obscured. Wind blows audibly on the microphone, creating a hiss.  Stay here! Randall shouts at Peter and points back into the house. He disappears into the flurry. Peter takes the camera back inside, and films the falling snow through the window.  Nicky.  The whisper is just barely audible.  He turns toward the living room. The black-clothed stranger is lying there on the couch, unmoved. Peter comes in close with the camera, putting it right up to the mans face. It looks contorted, like hes snarling in pain. Rigid, scraggly hair clings to the mans chin and cheeks, tapering off as it rises to the mans spotted, bleeding scalp. Black scabs the size of Snapple caps adorn his head. Purple lips and sunken eye sockets lend to the mans overall shabby, sick appearance.  Nicky.  The camera is pointed directly on the mans lips. The thin purple lines take up the whole frame. They dont move, but you can clearly hear the whisper.  Nicky.  Peter! shouts Quincy from the stairs behind him. Upstairs!  She catches him mid-step as he flies up the stairs. You dont go near that man again. Do you hear me? You stay away from him.  *-clip-*  From the top of the stairs, the camera points down on the front door and the dark living room. A few glowing coals remain in the fireplace. Randys jacket is still white with snow. In the dim light, the camera has difficulty finding something to focus on.  What are we going to do, Randy?  Its out of our hands now. He looks exhausted, bedraggled. His jacket stays stiff as he hangs it up on the hook. Shes in His arms. Im going to pray now, and you can join me if you want.  No, thanks. Thats your department, but Ill send a letter to Santa, just to cover our bases.  What?  To Santa. Its a joke.  Wh- How could you say something like that?  You know... I think its like you said, maybe everything is going to be alright now. This could be a fresh start for us, baby. Quincys blurred form is moving closer, slowly.  Quincy, if youre trying to... mock me, this is really not the time.  Im not mocking you, Randy. Im being serious. Im sorry. For everything, I mean. When Olivia died, I mean... Things were bad before, but that just broke me. It was too much.  Randy hugs his wife and gulps back a sob. It was somehow worse, though... because there was still Nicole. They looked so much alike, do you remember, Randy? Do you remember all the little twin outfits and matching bows and shoes? And after she was gone, all of it was double. Extra. It killed me that I couldnt get rid of it, or throw it out. Because I still had *her* and we werent really allowed to move on.  You can see that Randall has pushed himself free of her arms now. He holds her at arms length.  I know you didnt want to listen when I told you this before... But I know she killed Olivia.  Shut up.  I know it. And having her there all the time, it was like living with her ghost.  Stop it, Quincy.  Now shes really gone, dont you see? It wasnt *natural* for one to be here without the other. We finally cleaned the slate. We can start over, now.  Shut the fuck up! Damn it, Quincy, it was an accident! Just stop it!  You know, I never forgot what you said when you first came home that night.  Dont.  What did you do to my daughter, Quincy? What did *you* do? Wheres *my* little girl?  Youre an alcoholic, Quincy. You were depressed - you were sick. Thats... Youre sick.  I dont feel sick anymore Randall. For the first time I can even remember, I feel... fine.  A curdled scream from the old man shakes the air and startles Peter who runs back down the hall and into his parents room, locking the door behind him.  Hes awake! Randy yells from the other side of the muffled bedroom door.  *-clip-*  -ome down and meet him. Now, he hasnt said anything yet, but were going to take him into town as soon as the light comes up. You and I are going to have to cut some of the trees up, you think you can help me with that?  Okay.  Great.  Randall looks like he didnt sleep at all the night before. His hair sticks out at odd angles and his face is pale and sagging. Even his smile looks weary.  Down the stairs, the man is sitting at the table with his back to Peter as he approaches.  Um, sir? Randall ventures. This is my son, Peter. Sorry, hes into video taping everything right now.  The man turns slowly to stare through the camera at Peter. Chewing, his mouth works side to side like goats. Then he turns back, and methodically takes another spoonful of oatmeal.  Well, want some breakfast, champ?  Wheres mom?  I think shes still slee-  *-clip-*  Pete, already in the back seat of the car, watches as his father carries the skeletal form from the house. The sun is coming up, and even though a thick layer of snow covers the ground, the placid rain is beginning to thin it back down.  Slowly this time, Randy maneuvers down the gravel driveway.  Skid marks, he says as they reach the road. Look at that. Right there on the edge of the bank. I couldnt see them last night in the dark. Hold on a second, Im going to take a look.  Randy jumps out of the car and jogs across the highway. Peter zooms in. He turns around to say I can see his car! before he drops over the edge of the embankment and out of sight.  He zooms back in, and pans from side to side, scanning the road for his fathers reappearance. He stops as he notices that the old man has turned and is watching him with a vacant expression.  Do you know Nicky? Peter asks in barely more than a whisper.  The mans lips spread into a smile, revealing long, crooked teeth rotted and black at the gum line. His eyes dont leave the camera and Peter. He just stares and smiles.  The car door jerks open and Peter is pulled outside. Randall is back.  Dad! Dad, he knows something about Nicky!  I know.  Randall is clutching a pink backpack in his fist. With quick movements, he opens the trunk and exchanges the backpack for a wood saw, then moves around to the passenger door.  You son of a bitch, he says as he drags the man out by his coat collar. Unable to support his own weight, the man drops helplessly to the ground. Peter, get back in the car. Stay there. Randall drags the man by one leg over the embankment again and out of sight.  For a long time, Peter just sits in the car. You can hear him breathing.  *-clip-*  He turns the camera on, pointing down the road heading South and leaves it on for about thirty seconds before shutting it off.  *-clip-*  Theres some kind of noise outside the car like thrashing in the brush. After about a minute it goes away, and Peter turns it back off.  *-clip-*  Randall walks back across the road. There are no signs of the old man or the saw.  *-clip-*  Through the rain-streaked window of the house, Peter zooms the cameras focus on the point where the gravel driveway enters the woods. You can see his breath forming fog on the cold glass.  Dad, theres someone outside.  One broken headlight and half the silver grill of a huge truck just peek around the tree line.  What? The curtains move as Randy pulls them aside for a better look above the camera.  It looks like its crashed.  Yeah, it does. Maybe they hit one of those downed trees or something.  How come theyre not moving?  I dont know, Pete.  Seconds tick by.  Im going to go out there and see if theyre okay. Just stay here for now, alright?  Okay.  Randy opens the door.  Dad!  What?  Im scared.  Its okay, champ. I promise, okay? I love you.  Love you too.  Peter points the camera back out the window, and Randy pulls the door quietly shut. Soon, he steps off the porch and into the frame, walking toward the truck.  He freezes, squinting ahead.  He turns to run back to the porch. A sound like a cannon fires from the truck, rattling the windows, and Peter drops down beneath the window. His breath is ragged with panic.  The camera creeps back up to the window. Randall is there, lying face down in the mud. A red spot is growing on his lower back. His arms are still moving, groping, but he isnt able to drag himself. Hes reaching for the window - for Peter.  The auto-focus is shifting from the window to the curtains to Randall.  From the truck, a bear-sized man in a black fur coat takes a few limping steps into the clearing toward Randall. Hes carrying something like a 4x4 in one hand, propping it up over his shoulder.  The bear man whips the wood down through the air like an axe onto Randys skull. Peter drops down behind the window again, struggling to contain his crying.  You can hear the thumps from the club in a steady cadence, and then everything falls quiet. Even the rain pauses.  Irregular footsteps sound on the porch, then a knock at the front door, but Peter doesnt move. The doorbell sounds, pressed but not released, *ding*...  The knob slowly turns and the weather stripping creaks as the door cracks open.  *dong*  Peter sprints up the stairs. The sound of the doors glass panes shattering is drowned out by a roaring scream that isnt human. Peter bolts straight ahead, opening his parents bedroom door, and shutting it behind him, placing his back up against it.  MAMA! He screams and drops the camera.  Bare feet hang next to the bed, a few feet off the floor, a chair kicked onto its side underneath them.  The door frame splinters, and the camera is knocked under the bed, plunged into blackness.  Peter goes silent in an instant.  The sound of the killer beating him and his mother goes on and on.  The rest of the tape is of the dark, which eventually goes to blank. The whole thing is about 45 minutes long.  *Was* about 45 minutes long.  The Smiths were discovered by Ronald Preisler, still technically the owner of the house, the following day. Hed met Randy through a church conference that theyd attended together.  The car found in the woods near the base of the Smiths driveway could not be traced back to a registered owner. It was assumed to be owned by Benjamin Burns, a career truck driver whose body was found nearby, hacked to pieces with Randall Smiths wood saw, and bearing signs of blunt force trauma not consistent with a motor vehicle accident. Burnss truck was reported stolen after the fact, but was never recovered.  The body of Nicole Smith was discovered to be washed nearly a mile down a nearby stream. Hair and blood samples place her in the abandoned car near the time of the crash. The handles on the insides of both rear doors appeared to have been torn off. They were not found inside the car. However, when it was recovered, it was found that the latch was damaged in such a way that the door could not stay shut or locked.  Quincy Smith was found in the upstairs bedroom of the house. The time of death estimated to be several hours before her son Peters, whose body was found in the same room. While his cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma, hers was shown to have occurred prior to the trauma her body underwent.  Randall Smiths death was the only one thought to be a mystery, since he was charged with the murders of his other family members and Benjamin Burns. The cause of death was said to be the gunshot wound. The subsequent marks of trauma were said to be post-mortem, rendered by some unknown passerby who came across the scene.  The video tape was never entered into the police file or as evidence in the investigation. I got it almost two years ago, now. I nearly destroyed it the first time I watched it.  Instead, I hid it away in a box of video game cartridges. A box that was recently donated to a Goodwill in the next town. It wasnt there when I went to look for it. Ive gone every day and asked, but they keep telling me that they dont have it, and if they did, that someones bought it by now.  Im unbelievably sorry. But I cant tell them now.   Finally, the voice of reason.   'Ti Tuga digga tu Gi Friba fligugibu Uh Fligugigu Uh Di Ei Friba Du Gi Fligu fligugigugi Flilibili Ah Fligu wene mamamana Lucifer!   Gotta re-write the whole thing. It was in this weird tone, too, so I'm not even sure I can capture it again.   I wrote the best story ever...  And I didn't save it.   I think everyone goes through times like that. Not saying that it's not true for you. Every time it's happened to me, though, I come across something where I least expect it that wakes me up... at least for a little while.   Anyway, intent is important, I think. Whether or not you went for the ride, ask the question of what they wanted it to feel like to read their story, and you can usually make the determination.   Is it going to keep you up at night? If yes, nosleep.  	114
       Thug life dude!    I never wanted to believe that my Dad was stealing from his job as a road worker. But when I got home, all the signs were there.      	5
 Poor Ivy Pepper, she will have to play with her plants again tut tut   Ah whatever, Couch Tuner again then   Also, where the heck is Ivy, are they ignoring her for another season, she needs screen time god dam it   Not keen on the likenesses here, it seems that someone forgot the photos and went by memory   Imagine not getting let in somewhere then flashing an FBI badge   Fox won't allow UK residents to view their site   Will the new mini series be shown on terrestrial TV or Sky / cable in the UK  The original series had aired on BBC / Sky 1 but what about the new series?   I sure hope they remove that stupid delay between the US showing episodes months before the UK receives them, you'd think nowadays that most countries would get things around the same time  Also, when will season 2 air in the UK ???   I feel The Riddler should be on even level with Pengy in season two but they're still showing him as secondary    I know this was sung briefly in the cell by the old woman in an episode in the first series but I wonder if the full "I used to give her roses" will feature on an episode soon  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TC38KlmnSo  Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new  It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters   Would be great to have a few cameos from those who were in Cell Block H  They should have Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart / Home   Away) back as he was in the original as Geoff Butler / Ernest Craven / Kurt Renner   Gordon looks bloodied, you think he would have taken Falcone's offer and had a vacation by now, maybe Bullock finally had enough of him lol  	12
 You're absolutely right, and you are making some fine points. I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just presenting a view that agrees with Christian beliefs that I feel is better than the average Christian argument for the problem of evil. The most common answer I've heard is that "it is beyond human understanding." And you're right, this is a non answer. All I'm saying, however, is that if you're going to present a non answer to the problem of evil, then you might as well pick a good one based on logical proofs and arguments. This is better than just stating that humans cannot understand God in my opinion. I'm not presenting this as a solution. I'm not presenting this as my opinion. I was just trying to point out that Leibniz has a pretty good theory that coincides with Christian arguments and beliefs. That doesn't mean that it solves the problem of evil. If it did, then nobody would use the problem of evil as a criticism against God and monotheistic beliefs. Leibniz presents a logical argument that allows the problem of evil to be circumvented while still maintaining the integrity of God. If you disagree with it, then that's fine. If you want to say it's wrong, then you have to find a fault in his argument. I'm not leaning one way or the other. I just thought that monotheists might want to take a look at Leibniz's theory to help them argue their points. Everyone knows that it's hard enough for them to explain themselves without relying on the bible or faith. I'm not saying that this view is of any particular moral worth either. It is simply an explanation of why there is evil. Another major reason why God in Leibniz's theory can't make any less evil is because how time and space work in the creation of the universe. Like I said, Leibniz's discourse is a good read, and it will explain his theory better than I ever could. If you don't want to take a look at it, then that's fine. It will expand your mind and your opinions though.    I disagree. I think that it's fine for them to have faith, but that shouldn't be a cheat code used to end philosophical arguments when things aren't going their way.    You should read Leibniz's Discourse on Metaphysics. It spells it out much clearer than I did. I'm not saying that it's the best view, but it is a complete theory that isn't based the idea that God created good and the devil created evil. It actually provides an answer. And essentially yes, this is the best possible reality or universe that could have possibly been created. You can't know that though because it is beyond human understanding. If you can poke holes in Leibniz's argument, then I would be very interested to hear how you did that. Otherwise it's just another competing theory. I could care less one way or the other though because I'm agnostic. I was simply stating that Leibniz has a pretty solid answer to the question of evil that coincides with what Christians believe in. It was merely a suggestion that Christians should adopt this theory, or a different complete philosophical view, in order to argue this point. To me, this is better than shouting bible quotes or using circular arguments. This at least a theory that I can respect because it is based on good logic, and Leibniz was a freaky genius guy that that makes his argument pretty strong against criticism.   	3

When is reddit going to remove the asses over at /r/GreatApes? I'm more than sure they downvote brigade in default subreddits.    I totally get that.  He's bleeding internally due to injuries sustained from her kicking him in the stomach though.  That means his organs got messed up. That sounds like an emergency room visit.   Half the stuff on this subreddit it complete BS.  This guy got kicked so hard he was bleeding out of his mouth and he decided *not* to go the the hospital?    So she kicked you so hard you were bleeding out of your mouth?    Then you didn't go to the hospital?    I'm calling BS.   Because it's a lie.  TIFU is full of them.   I'd drive through Austin cackling with glee!    Thank Jingus there's a veto ability.   Vote.  Tell everyone you know to get off their butts and vote!  33% turnout this last cycle lead to this BS.

I've only seen the movie once but I can look back on it and imagine this theme!   It's also a common theme in a lot of movies now that I think about it. Like Interstellar.    Haha, no problem! I'm glad you enjoyed it!   Hey! There are probably some men out there that enjoy it.    Is it the food? I love food in movies.    My favorite part is the acting.    Have you ever seen [C is for Cookie?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9rzMaAucI4)   It's been awhile since I've seen it! I remember my favorite seen was the autopilot.    Morgan Freedman has such a way with words man! Unbelievable.    I'll start: The Shawshank Redemption  My mother and I would watch it together when I lived at home, it's her favorite movie.          I'll start: The Shawshank Redemption    My mother and I would watch it together when I lived at home, it's her favorite movie.      I read it as 'stupid pajamas' and I thought "You are heartless!"   I started to realize that as I was typing. Yep, passing down the stupid.    And too bad kids aren't bright enough to realize that it's not 'one person's' fault.   People should be blaming their districts.    I don't know how to say this nicely:  Too bad. :D   Neat   Vacuum cleaners. I've never seen one blow.    Arma 3 Altis   What did you use?   Which one do you recommend? I've been tinkering on codeacademy.com, is that a good one?    Yay! I'm so glad you liked them!   I'll be frying some up tomorrow. I got a craving!    How? I'd like a change in career.    I have one too, I've made like $3 and I can't cash out until $100.  It's been over a year...   Here is the recipe!    http://cavemanketo.com/crispy-wings/    If you're trying to cut back on fat, then baking would be best.  I'm on the keto diet so I'm just trying to limit my carb intake and let me tell you, I fry chicken thighs this way and I can't believe how crispy they turn out!      I find that cooking the broccoli helps more.    I do it over the stove, I think if you're using a deep fryer you use its lowest setting first (like 280F) and then crank it up to high (380F?)   All I get are pictures of Gary Oldman   "Blue" "Waffle"   Try the twice fry method:    14 minutes on medium heat     3 minutes on high heat     They come out like breaded fried chicken. I'll never eat them any other way.    I've got this weird gut issue where if I eat too much raw broccoli I won't digest it and end up pooping chunks of raw broccoli.     I was having a discussion with a cab driver while abroad in Mexico and he flat-out asked:    "All black people are evil, right?"    And just turned the question on him.    "Are all brown people evil? Are all Asians evil? No? Well that's your answer."     brb, buying a cucumber   When the one close to me was new it was super slammed. It's best to go at lunch.    That place is awesome.    Why couldn't TIME use a how-it's-made?   'Reverse engineering' in a video is weird.   The delicious explosion of Totino's Pizza Rolls.   I would've like to have read it that way but there are subtitles...   And so it begins.  Watch faces were popping up on /r/fallout and soon enough that's all the posts were... watches.   Every time he wins I cringe.    I thought you were funny!   I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels this way.    I think it was just a good guess. No way he'd quote what we all saw. That's unoriginal.   Now let's get Matthew McCaunghahay to narrate it.   Karma pls   I have never liked them because I felt like there was no effort in making the conversations work.   This one is the best I've seen *because* he put effort into making the conversations work.    Dude, all that rhymed! NOICE   Hahaha, never had that problem.  I'm glad you're jerking yourself off about this.  Feels good man.   Ohhhh, gotcha. I appreciate the explanation!   Wow, you must be in a fraternity (or you are 10) having said that last line.  do you only hate the guys that stole your college girlfriends?   Just in case you delete it:  Clearly no one wanted to rush you....Greek life is a club like any other. Do you condemn a soccer team with the same fury, or do you only hate the guys that stole your college girlfriends?     -/u/zerorules    JUSTA PRANK BRO!    And so it begins.

EDIT: fixed some incorrect information.    He was soliciting his story. Basically trying to make money off of it. That is 'self-promotion'  Make sense?    Can you ask him what he did. I've searched all around and haven't found a solution even when searching "AMD Rust fix".   Can I get two slices of cheese between two meat patties (no bun) for $2 at the other chains? Hell nah.   Awesome, thanks!   Give me your address. Them fightin' words.   (Don't really give me your address)    Why can't I watch the theatrical release of Anchorman 2? The only one I see on Netfilx is the extended edition which completely sucked.    Anyone know what the limit is?   I have a friend with the same card that doesn't have any issues. I believe that somehow it configured itself to use my CPU instead of my GPU to render everything. Like it didn't think I had a dedicated GPU.   The game ran completely fine before the experimental version came out. After that it has been super laggy.   I think this will be the last game I ever purchase in Alpha.   I have an AMD Zambezi 6100 CPU running 4.1Ghz and a Radeon HD 6870 GPU  I cannot run this game in legacy or normal mode.  I did not have problems running the game before their overhaul.

I didn't know it didn't help. :/   That makes sense.   Me either!   Yeah, I don't think I ever learned that!   Well shit, now I've learned my lesson.  Thanks for the tip!   I haven't. I stay away.   https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/search?q=yogurt restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all  We get it. This is just like those damn peanut butter posts.   Holy shit.   121 went down to one lane a couple of weeks ago (where it enters Garland) and there were signs for miles saying "left lane closed ahead".    We get 500m from where the lanes merge and what do you see? A bunch of assholes getting in the left lane to cut people off at the end.    I placed my car between my lane and the left lane to stop them and all they did was drive in the shoulder to go around to be stuck at the end.    I don't get it.   EDIT: Looks like this isn't the proper, efficient thing to do! Don't be me; don't be wrong.   My worst enemy.    5 years ago I went into a Firehouse Subs and asked for the hottest sauce they had.    The man handed me this sauce.    I placed a crap load on my sandwich, ate it all up with minimal tears, and left the store.    That's when it hit me. It felt like Bruce Lee was in my stomach trying to kick his way out.  I drove to the nearest dollar store to pick up some pepto bismol and I felt James Bond drugged (from that scene in Casino Royale) as I walked to their bathroom where I proceeded to puke.        I hate Jake! I can't see him as a tough actor.   It was so surreal.   Oh, I completely agree! I enjoyed the loud. It made me feel like I was there.   I believe a lot of people were bitching about it being so loud.  I think it was loud on purpose. Like when Michael Cain's big reveal is practically inaudible due to the sound? Yeah, that might just be the director trying to convey how you would feel if you heard that. You hear the truth and then nothing else matters.   Or the shuttle taking off? SHIT FLYING INTO SPACE IS LOUD...   WHAT ABOUT INTERSTELLAR!?    Damn, you got me.   It has? I looked at the app today, this feature wasn't included. I downloaded an update and it's there.

 Then the police got him for vandalism.   All I have to say is... 2.0   I once had a dog that ate spiders.   I hate when I've got a cup of coffee from a Starbucks or a Wawa or something, and the coffee manages to consistently spill out of that tiny fucking hole, every step I take, resulting in my hand burning all the way to my car. Gets me every damn time.   What kind of person are you?   Before you posted that, did you even think about all the Jewish and Catholic jokes that are told every single day, or all the jokes there are about Mormons? I mean there's a musical comedy on BROADWAY about the fucking Mormons. Muslims aren't special. Why should Islam be the only religion that people don't make fun of? Is it because they'll bomb us if we do? That should never stop people from making fun of something, and the Muslims, especially the ones committing these heinous acts need to be taught that the world doesn't revolve solely around them, and they have no right to impede another person or groups of people's freedom of speech.   Oh wow... the moon. That was so 1969.   That's because this isn't from the same movie. I just thought, "hey look, this one sounds real."   This scene from LotR has hooves that actually sound right. They're riding on dirt, and guess what! It sounds like they're riding on dirt! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9K7fueW4Bk      Like half the dwarves die bud. /u/goodbye9hello10   They behave in the exact same way in the books; Gandalf, Aragorn and Legolas all seem relatively invincible, a fact which is compromised for by the apparent weakness of the Hobbits and other men.   On the AP calculus test last year, I was asked to find a slope and so I drew a mountain and a man dressed to hike saying "look, we've found the slope." Later on in the test, I also outlined a dollar that I happened to have in my wallet. Not that it pertained to the question, I just had a feeling by then that the test had gone awry. Needless to say, I got a score of one.   how about 553? No more republic, only empire.   YES! I've heard that before. It's so good.   Just an FYI, I discovered this while I was in Normandy. I was sitting there in front of a cafe, being all American and when my pizza came out, I was bamboozled. There were no slices, just a great circle of pizza. Being the American that I am, I simply ripped junks off of the pizza and ate them. After my meal, I looked around and realized my mistake. Everyone that was eating pizza around me, from the British guy next to me, to the French kid next to me, were eating their pizza with a fork and knife.      I know. I'm saying in the future. I should have said that the Aldmeri Dominion's territories are in open rebellion. All except Cyrodil.   Guess he's got the dirt on everybody.   Avast is my favorite    Make it into a war. Skyrim, Elsweyr and Hammerfell have gone to war with the Altmeri Dominion, there is a resistance movement in Cyrodil, and now they are invading the Summerset Isles. A small portion of the Summerset Isle is a war zone. Then you can travel to certain areas in the Cyrodil, Elsweyr, Hammerfell and Skyrim. Kind of ambitious, but with next gen graphics and consoles and computers, it could be done.   Pursuit of Happiness. Always.   What is it that makes you a liberal?  	23
 Well in the long run it's better deals. Last time I was there I spent around $500 but I also got an Xbox so there's that   Yeah no kidding. Costco continues to save me boatloads of money    Thanks for the advice. We switched when we introduced rice cereal and it's been great   So do you mix a days worth of formula in it, keep it in the fridge and then microwave bottles of formula?    Well we've been using the Kirkland for a while. He's doing great with it and my wallet is thanking me   My son is just over 5 months. He's rolled a couple times here and there, and not crawling yet but socially, he's amazing, he will sleep through the whole night, and we've started him on rice cereal a little while ago and he eats like a champ. He's not breastfed anymore because the wife wasn't producing enough so it's formula until he gets real milk and food   Damn you brought back some memories with this one.

My dad saw him on TV and immediately said that he's pure evil.    Call the pound or animal control. When I was younger our neighbors never controlled their dogs and would try to keep them in the yard but if they got out "oh well". One time they got out at night, got into our yard and attacked our dog. He died in my arms on the way to the emergency vet. Fuck people who don't keep their dogs on a leash   Which 3DS is that?

My company insists on hiring schmucks without CDLs and then waiting for the several month process of them failing the written test two or three times, then waiting the month it takes to get the driving test scheduled and then them needing to retake the driving test 3 times. All of this is because being 6 hours away from the bakken oilfield, they can't pay enough to hire guys who already have their CDL.   I agree with you. If the person I'm with doesn't already conceptually get how backing up needs to happen, I don't know how to help them. I'm trying not to be too hard on him because I basically was in the same boat as everyone else except I had my learner's permit when I was hired and having only little experience backing trailers up, I picked up on it quickly and I passed my driving test the first time just like with my written test   At my current resume job I've been tasked with showing a guy with his learner's permit the ropes of driving. My truck is the only truck in the fleet with an automatic transmission (fuck you, it's also the only one with working cold air) so their thought is to send some newer people with me on my route to get used to the trailer before being tossed into a manual truck. My route is out of city so there's also less traffic to deal with. (but honestly fuck those guys I learned on stick floating gears).   Anyway, the first guy they had with me was great because he had already driven with trailers and had no problem backing up to docks. The most recent guy however, can't wrap his head around backing up at all. Constantly turning the wrong way and is practically at a 90angle before he pulls back forwards and tries again. I understand that not everyone picks it up as fast but this guy makes me want to pull my hair out. The only way I can get him to back up straight into a dock is if I give him step by step instructions on how far to turn the wheel, and for how long, and I don't feel like it's possible to learn that way but if I just let him try to learn from his own mistakes he just keeps making them and then getting frustrated and repeatedly slamming the brakes too hard and flooring the accelerator to pull forward. I've tried giving him every pointer I have and it doesn't work. After next week he's someone else's problem, thank fucking God.   It seems like Verizon is always the last though    Married person here, some shows my wife wants are non existent and I tell her to deal with it, we are both aware we won't always be able to find some things we want this way. It works just fine   Now let's see how long until Verizon gets it   There are many better pizzas everywhere but it doesn't stop me from occasionally indulging my inner demons   Frito pizza sounds disgusting but I'd eat this.

Home freezers are basically 3D Tetris to fit everything in   Kitchens generally go through product faster, have walk-ins that are easier to ensure rotation, and use quicker use by dates for product just to make sure it's not spoiled. I don't have an iPhone, but to me the draw is basically using it as a freezer inventory app. How many times do people go and rummage through their freezer and either proclaim they don't have any food and end up getting fast food or buying what they already have or finding something that has been there since the freezer was first plugged in five years ago?  It's a little but easier for upright freezers but chest freezers it's common to have stuff get buried and I think that's where this app can be most useful, knowing what's in it without digging it up.    I don't get it   I know, sounds awful doesn't it?    I've delivered to some places where the walk-in was like how you described, no special door to hold the cool air either, just a standard door.    The app is great. Much better than looking up the website if you're already out.   If they want to push to get more people using it, they should try updating it more often. It hasn't been updated in over a year. While useful, it looks outright ancient. A material design update for Android would be amazing    Back to the Iron Giant    At least you weren't reading about goatse    kids in giant robots, boobs, and borderline paedophilia  Well I guess it's a good thing he didn't watch Gargantia on the Verduous planet    I'd like to see some high quality gifs of landscapes but don't know where to go   I love this.

Cat looks like it's taking a shit in the thumbnail    It just affects people differently. I used to work with a guy who was only in a good mood if he came to work high. Not only was he in a good mood but he performed amazingly and would be one of the most helpful dudes in the kitchen. If he came in not high, he was cranky as fuck and always got frustrated and messed up dishes because of it    I'd buy him a drink   Don't forget that the nemesis system isn't as active and evolving as the ps4/xbine version    Yep. I bought an Xbox One assassin's Creed bundle at Costco for $329... The same price as all the black Friday deals. The only one better is getting a $50 gift card from Target but it's nothing worth waiting in that huge like for. Skip the lines, buy at Costco   Would you prefer a YouTube video with a 30 second it to, music added to the entire length of the video and someone who keeps turning the camera back to their face for way too long far too many times? I think vine is the perfect no-fluff way to show what's going on.    I KNEW being poached was a real concept. I'm a delivery truck driver now and one day when I came out of a store two guys got out of their vehicle and approached me. Basically wanted to poach me from my current job, asking if I liked my job and telling me the benefits of theirs (but the yearly wage starting out would have been 10,000 less than I'm doing now). But whenever I talked to anyone about it and use the word "poached"  they kinda cocked their head and gave me the deer in the headlights look   This town is so small, if they even have a health inspector, I don't think they'd even know what NSF is    It's all extra from the summer lol   It's for the bakery/deli in a tiny general/grocery store in a tiny town       That's amazing    No worries, your pizza stone will continue to work just fine, it just now has some assembly required. I've been using a split stone for over two years with no ailments    Fellow Markiplier fan! I can't believe he teased us by playing the whole game but then waiting to do 10-20 mode!    It's the extreme temperature change. Even if you did put it back in quickly, that was basically two quick temperature changes. Consider getting a peel    That last point is one of my biggest peeves. Almost all the time I see pizza stones being sold with a special wire rack to use it for serving. So many people think "oh that's great!" without realizing how awful that idea is   Exactly what I did when mine broke. I still use it and it broke about two years ago   Yeah it was painful    The issue with playing PC games on your TV from the couch is that many games aren't optimized for playing from that far away.

I have 8 gigs on my media center and for some reason, I regularly get Windows bitching at me to close shit to free up memory.

I still have quite a few on my front page but there are things I don't need on my front page    The multireddit is the best feature. Before it wasn't really an official thing, but you could type in /r/comedy+jokes+dadjokes etc and it would combine them into a single page before. It's nice to basically create several "front pages". I have one for local subreddits, one for gaming, and one for diy subreddits.    Why is this getting downvotes? Is nobody really interested in a meet up?    I had a feeling where this was going once you mentioned the beard   I always upvote darude - sandstorm when someone asks what something is   I'd recommend both in either categories.

Ever since my son was born in July these kinds of posts are suddenly everywhere to make me paranoid of something happening to my 4 month old son and run my feels through the blender   The problem isn't really the indexer, the problem is a lack of dedicated uploaders.

I'd have a group of friends in our party and one guy would always end up on the opposite team    I can't help but wonder how much piracy is really going on per capita than there used to be. Services like Pandora, Spotify, and Google Music are making a huge selection of music readily available at a reasonable cost (if you're paying for premium on Spotify or Pandora). I myself used to download all kinds of music, but having the access to a huge library of music that Google music has from home or anywhere really makes it worth the money for me to have. Now I don't have to deal with syncing music libraries or using up an obscene amount of space on my phone.    I'm not against the forehead ones but I've used the ear ones my whole life and my family has never had problems with them. Do the forehead ones work past infanthood? I don't want something I'm just going to use when he's a baby, I want one that can be used for years with everyone in the family. The only reason I ask is because every single one I've seen says "baby thermometer" in the title   Unfortunately Costco formula comes only in one size: bulk   My wife and I have a bad habit of losing those tiny digital thermometers and besides, I grew up with an in ear one so I think I should get one for my family. The only issue I'm coming across is that it seems every one has to use those disposable filters. The one my mom had never needed anything like that and it worked perfectly fine. To me it just feels like a cash grab, keep making money off of something that is a one time purchase. My mom's thermometer has lasted for over 24 years and I'd like one that will last me just as long without needing to still spend money on it.   If the filters are absolutely necessary, can anyone fill me in as to why?   We've been feeding our 4 month old anti gas Similac because he gets pretty gassy and had a mild case of colic in months 2 and 3. When spending $60 at Costco for 2 containers of Similac (which lasts about 2 weeks with how much he currently eats) I couldn't help but notice the Kirkland brand for almost half the cost and bigger container size. Does anyone have any experience with their formula?  *update* we've been using it for about 3 weeks or so and he is doing great with it. Even coming from gas relief formula he hasn't had any issues with the switch. We're also using the Dr browns bottles which are great   Traffic was at a standstill going West a couple miles out from Columbus around 830 this morning. I sat in it for an hour before it got going again. That fucking sucked because I was making deliveries to Columbus and it put my day right in the shitter   That's a shitty plan. Straight talk is the way to go    Well Portal 2 is coded by a talented and experienced team. Minecraft in comparison was written by a single guy and it was an accidental success and after that it's just a few guys coding it.    Something that disappointed me was that your pet goes from being a legit party member in your group in Origins to being a simple ability in 2      Well the intention is for it to be a laptop replacement so the keyboard is an obvious buy   Thinking of an i7 surface and it looks like you can play a fair amount of games and stuff like photoshop, but I'm wondering about minecraft too as it is poorly optimized and I can't play it on my current laptop without overheating it.   Editing tags for TV shows is still cumbersome and requires you to go to the tags screen and then to add shows you have to scroll through your entire library of TV shows not already in that tag in order to find what you're gonna add   My circle of friends like to call it Skin Soup    He's so hot he melted through the bed   A moon in the background would also be a nice addition    I just don't understand the hate for the app. I've been using it for years, it really is quite a good messaging app   I second a layered coat. If not, another option is to wear a hoodie and then a light rain jacket over it to keep the wind away as well as keeping your hoodie from getting soaked if it rains or snows. Gloves are good too to keep the hands dry when you're scraping ice off the windshield. As for myself, I skip the hooded coats and wear a mad bomber hat or beanie   I thought this was familiar. I expected to see the video was posted in 2013 but much to my surprise it's new   Okay but I gotta go to court tomorrow for my DUI and then the next day it's my turn to watch my kid and my ex lives 2 hours away so I have to get permission from the police to drive that far from home and then next week I'm going to a music festival that I got some sweet drugs for that I need to use   I thought that was my job   I don't think we'd all fit but I'm sure all of us together would make a pretty kickass restaurant    I just bought one because I didn't know what was a good brand. My hands get dirty at work so I figured the coating wouldn't last very long   The one I got said there was an anti fingerprint coating on it which was complete BS because it smudged the second I went to use it    I use it with a tempered glass screen protector for screen protection.    I'd love to use that but it seems that everyone's solution to the IR blaster except for supcase is to just leave the power button exposed which is an awful solution for my small hands   Muzei on android with the reddit extension is great for this. Let's you also dim the pictures and add a blur so the picture doesn't dominate your icons  	146
 Erm, how so? How does one live lavishly on minimum wage? Or did I miss a sarcasm / tag?   Agreed. From the other comments, the show would need to be about millionaires who inherited their wealth.     Hahaha... riiiiight   That is a really good point. Completely agree!   I guess the point would be to have them help others of their own volition, rather than having them help others "because it's the format of the show". Then again, there's no telling how they would react once they get their money back.      Yeah, absolutely. The knowledge that they'd be able to go back to riches would indeed be the weak link in the show.   That's why it's a 'Crazy' idea I guess :(   Hahaha that they are!   Interesting - I'll look into it more. Though from the description of the show it seems like the donation seems like the more key feature, which I don't particularly like :\   I like it!   Hah! Yes!   Agreed. Was going to say a year originally, but that may be too harsh (and impractical to film).   Me too, but hey, in the USA most them are millionaires at the very least. They'd be eligible to be part of the show anyway :D   They would also be cut off from their own house(s), car(s), etc... but instead given 'average' lodging and vehicles comparable to what minimum wage workers make.   Edit: The people on this show would be either politicians or millionaires who inherited their money - people that worked for their fortune wouldn't be a good fit.   Yes. So much yes.      I came here to post the same info. Thank you!   Would subscribe. Let me know when it's up :D  	19

 The Euro is at historically weak levels (not exchange rate-wise, but credit and solvency) due to some boneheaded decisions made by several countries in the Euro zone. They're not going to move to the yen, so in fact this will make the USD even stronger than before.   Spying is a little like masturbation, everyone does it but you might want to seek help if you're doing it constantly.    Maybe it's because the US knows as soon as Iran gets a nuclear warhead, suddenly Israel will be like "AHA! Look at all the nukes that we have too!" The two governments are total shitheads, so they will for sure escalate as close as they can to war if not actually into one. I'd like to give the US some credit and say that the cat is already out of the bag for Israel's nukes, so they're just trying to prevent it from getting out of control in the region.   what's wrong with terminator seeds? they are ecologically superior if you're an environmentalist, and most farmers buy seeds every season anyway.   digikey   Great explanation. China's banks are fundamentally capitalist too - why would they buy debt that nobody wants or is of uncertain quality in the medium to long term? They already have enough on their plate managing the debt bubble in their own country.    Inability to export these Russian assets will be their Achilles heel. It's really hard to shut down oil and gas wells, so if they have not enough people to sell to then they will have excess supply problems.    Do you think that Russia could make up the difference lost from sanctions through rising gas prices and diverting exports to places like China? That's a pretty tall order. Fortunately, as Russia participates pretty strongly in the world economy I am optimistic that sanctions will have a huge effect in the medium term. But it will be several years before Russia feels the pinch.    It's just kind of odd that if having refuge is essential, why didn't Monsanto/other GMO companies just spike it in themselves from the beginning? That way farmers can't cut corners.   Also, how could you even make a good plot with a character like Deadpool? There would be absolutely no suspense or character development.   Seriously, I don't think people understand that the only reason why the USSR lasted so long was because it heavily relied on stealing resources from its satellite states in the eastern bloc and beyond. Russia seems strong in the short term, but they would get economically curb stomped in the next 5-10 year range.   How much of that death rate do you think is due to disparities in health care infrastructure? What happens if someone in a Western country got infected with it?   Christianity is the same way -- there are large numbers of small Christian "sects" in America that disagree vehemently with Catholicism and many of the major Protestant groups.   It depends though. Lots of supermarkets have shitty tasteless ones that aren't even ripe.   Are they still good if you throw them into some (pre-cooked) oatmeal? Like would I break my teeth?   Donut/Saturn peaches are kind of odd though -- they get mushy incredibly fast and then they get way too sweet to eat.   I turned 30 a few months back, and still feel pretty young. Granted, I have a long-term girlfriend and we're probably going to get married in the near future, but seeing my college friends get married a few years back and popping out kids is kind of unnerving.   Also, if you read the article it says that the store revenue increased by only 2% but yet net income doubled because he fired everyone. That's always the first thing that anyone, especially if they work in finance, will do as a reflex but the question is does he have a long-term growth strategy? 2% increase in sales is pitiful if you consider that other chains (eg. fast casuals like Chipotle) are growing like gangbusters.      Did you even try to Google it?   https://www.calacademy.org/science_now/archive/wild_lives/fence_lizards_050601.php  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9488334/?i=5 from=/2301709/related   I don't have a good link for this, but on the PBS Nature series they specifically show a type of crow that collects tools.   To be fair, there are also many examples of de novo resistance, eg. point mutations in the target site (I think rifampicin is an example).    there was a lab working on it in California. I heard they lost NIH funding and had to scrap the project.    Fun fact: there is a lizard in the California/Southwest region that is also a target of ticks. But the lizards have something in the blood that eradicates the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and helps fight its spread in the region!   I think people don't really understand what this means and where antibiotics come from. The vast majority of antibiotics and drugs are derived from Streptomyces/Actinobacteria, who excrete these naturally. Most of these bacteria express the resistance gene in tandem so that they don't die while they are producing it. Therefore in most cases a resistance gene *by definition* will exist. These can get passed by horizontal gene transfer (eg. phage or plasmid).   Also, generally people who have type 2 diabetes are older folk who are prone to being stubborn about lifestyle changes.   I think that ~50 billion would probably be enough to give every single HIV+ person on the planet ART for free for the rest of their lives. Do this for along with promoting safe sex and you'll probably have a good shot of eradicating it in ~50 years.   Honestly -- just bring up some clips of the show on Youtube. It is an awful, cheesy, superficial but fun mess and I don't know why people are expecting anything different.   I'm 30, thought the trailer looked great!   There were already multiple gulf war conflicts before 2003. Was the point then to finish up some loose ends or to deals with a "WMD" problem? Nobody was ever honest about it, and even if they indeed had them, invading should have been the last thing on the table instead of the first.    Interpret this how you will because there are a lot of sides to this, but in WWII the standing policy was to bomb to rubble every German city over 100k in population. The eastern European front was equally bad. Major cities in Japan suffered the same fate. Most people don't talk about itin the USA, but if you go to even a tiny German town there will usually be some kind of memorial or exhibit showing how they painstakingly rebuilt literally everything brick by brick.    I don't know... it's kind of fun but it just makes everything taste sweet rather than flipping flavors around.   Actually, it's pretty accepted that there is a strong genetic component to pair bonding in humans: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97287/ is a brief snippet (a bit old).   Those Camrys... they will literally last you a quarter of your life.   Russia may be an oligarchy, but the moment that Putin tries to "nationalize" the industries is the day there will be a coup. Putin's legitimacy is solely based on a social contract between him/oligarchs and him/Russian citizens. If he can't deliver on the jobs or money and tries to take it for himself, the entire country will turn into a shitshow.   The cheese on the pizza can get pretty nasty of you leave it out for too long.    Also, China isn't an idiot. They can see that Russia has huge long term problems as compared to the rest of the West.    Exactly right. It's like if there was a science scandal and everyone saying "well, I guess I'm going to try homeopathy now."   well for one thing, you can actually avoid shooting at civilians instead of bombing a whole building.    They probably have enough capital to start some new factories by now.    Easy -- the life would be highly divergent than anything we have seen on our planet. Even through the panspermia theory, the genome sequences would still be really different than anything that exists on Earth. All organisms on life are generally well conserved in terms of the essential genes, so you would just compare these elements.   Another great reference is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire:_How_Cooking_Made_Us_Human by Richard Wrangham.   Regarding the cooked steak thing: Richard Wrangham has an entire book on this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire:_How_Cooking_Made_Us_Human   They are already taking off, but not in the ways you expect. they are doing well in business applications that require record tracking. or even in things like boarding passes.    It won't really solve it, but at least the "new states" from which SoCal is stealing water could at least extract revenues. At this point they don't even have good negotiating power but the tables could turn if each of these "states" were given equivalent powers as every other American state.   I'm not totally familiar with the situation and how the proposed state lines are drawn, but there has been a lot of bad history with regards to SoCal/LA and water rights. Entire communities have been destroyed because of water being diverted to LA.   How the fuck is this kind of statement upvoted? Most Jewish people, especially in the USA where 40% of Jewish people live, are not religious zealots (ie. "the chosen").   Squab is fucking delicious. Better than duck!   Generally, the order is Farmers Market  Garden  Canned  Store. Why is the market one better than your backyard garden? Because they know how to grow the tomatoes properly and not in a tiny patch of dirt without proper nutrition or fertilizer. Also the sunlight is probably better in a field.   I feel that once you get up to the $15-40 range, then the actual variety of grape starts to come out a lot more. There's a lot of diminishing gains after that and you'd just be paying for the scarcity (eg. made in small batches) and high costs due to lack of scale.   I agree- the important data is not one number but the general trend.  in this case it would be important to look at the dose response curve.    Godzilla. What the fuck was that. He's on screen for maybe 20 minutes. His first fight with the MUTO in Hawaii cuts half way through and all of a sudden they are going to SF.    I love the jersey cotton sheets from Target. A lot of times the "high thread count" doesn't really mean anything since the "regulations" on that are incredibly lax.   Given that this guy has written a review with such a provocative perspective, it's likely that he currently has a lot of promising data that supports this hypothesis and will publish shortly. I just browsed his CV and he's definitely not an academic lightweight.   It's so stupid, because the police should know that they are only maximizing their risk to their own lives by entering with guns blazing!   People like to generalize way too much about what people should do with their hair. People have greasy or dry scalps all because of genetics. Sure, the shampooing matters but I think the important thing is to do things that your body is comfortable with. For me, I had the itchiest greasiest scalp. I would be breaking out with huge pustles on my head. People were telling me left and right to use this "natural" shampoo, to shampoo it twice a day, to not at all. What ended up working for me after literally 15 years of greasy head was Selenium Disulfide. In Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength. After that, I decided that whatever people told me to do was bullshit and if it wasn't working to try something else until it got better.   Bingo! Philanthropists don't give their money away for free. They want organizations to be able to match it with their own fundraising. That shows that the people on the receiving end are competent.   I'm not sure how it's counted in HIV, but in cancer, generally "cured" means you died of something else other than cancer.   My two older sisters are almost exactly one year apart in age. I try not to think about it.   Should have seen the look of anger on the guy's face. There were literally no defenders back there when Brazil scored.   Given the state of proteomics technology (with regards to sensitivity and specificity), I would take any results about "number of genes" with a grain of salt. You're naturally going to miss (a) rarely expressed genes, and (b) small proteins that will be lost during the prep. Shockingly I haven't seen many studies done that try to map proteomic data with transcriptomes (eg. you could make libraries with promoter bashing and do an analogous thing with RBS) to figure out the detection response as a function of gene expression.   GRRM also said that the TV show will never be exactly the same as the book. He's also happy with the way the show turned out. Let's face it -- TV canon and book canon will become different things, and that's not a bad thing.   They are cryotubes. Pro-tip: don't be cheap and buy shitty ones. Your samples will thank you later.   A lot of specialized "hard" work pays a TON of money.   China is also fortunate to be able to study other countries' developmental histories and not to make the same mistakes. Case in point: today, the US is winding down its dependence on foreign oil because of shitshows like the Middle East. China is doing the same thing, but they're doing it because they've watched how other countries have turned out over the years. That's not to say they have their own very substantial challenges, but they're definitely punching above their weight.   Give China some credit -- for such an environmentally dirty country that is still developing beyond their manufacturing base, they sure spend way more than anyone expects them to towards alternative energy and clean manufacturing.   I think a parallel case in point in the USA is the oil sands in the Dakotas. The entire country got hit hard by the recession, and then these jobs started picking up in the region. If it were not for the energy sector, the area would become a literal shithole. It's not such a black and white issue -- I think a lot of people are extremely lucky to say that they can choose to prioritize environmental conservation and they should continue to do so, but the real question is should we ask those who do not have the means to do the same thing? For a lot of people, paying off their house and having food on the dinner table vastly outweighs the oilsand environmental damage.   Not sure why you're being downvoted. I think people don't have such a black and white view of things, but rather rank them in their own personal hierarchy. To many people who live in an impoverished country, mowing down trees for natural resources and products and jobs would not be a bad thing. Sure, it screws them in the long term, but they are starving today. They've decided that the benefits of industry outweigh the environmental costs. Many people in fully developed countries will disagree with them (myself included), but I can totally see where they are coming from.   not true -- if you are at a teaching hospital that works on your disease you can try to push the people there to enroll you in the stage 1 or 2 trials as soon as they start. way less than 10 years.   not sure why you make the oral route such a big deal. there are many drugs that are delivered intravenously,  especially in cancer treatment.       Pajama pants and a tshirt means she's comfortable! And if she's comfortable she's happy. If she's happy then she's way more sexually appealing.   OMG. Perfect timing for my story! Me and the gf went to the Columbus Zoo recently, and they had a little turtle exhibit. Lo and behold, they were getting it on. A dad and his kid strolls by and the kid excitedly exclaims "Dad!! What are they doing?!" and the father replies "...... well, what do you think they are doing?"  "I think they're wrestling!!"  "Yes, that's exactly what they're doing!"  Cue the turtle on top giving a huge O-face. "Dad, that one's so angry he's screaming!!"   Not sure why you are being downvoted. Obesity a huge medical issue that is really, really hard to fix with exercise. Lipo would go a great way in reducing other types of health problems, improve long-term patient outcomes, and improve self-esteem! High amounts of fat are also known to cause huge hormonal changes too so IMO it's a great idea. It's not the ultimate silver bullet, but it will go a LONG way to improving health in this country.   It would be utterly fascinating for plastic garbage to settle on the ocean floor, just like dead dinosaurs of eons ago. I could imagine future expeditions looking at sediment layers and really doing a WTF.   The crazy thing about ART and Truvada is that children are now being born without HIV, and babies born HIV+ are now starting to be cured. There is a great window of opportunity to have an all-out application of HIV drugs across the planet -- we can then contain its spread and it can literally be wiped out in a generation or two. We can't say the same about many other unvaccinated diseases.   But how do you contrast this with the rise of the hipster generation in the past decade? They are ironic about everything.   I think the main problem is that the technology's not really there yet. Unlike cancer, there's not a huge foundation of biomarkers and proposed mechanisms to build on. The ones that we do have, though, are somewhat inconclusive/have low effect size/not completely predictive. Today, at least with cancer you could sequence and find mutations that could be clinically actionable. I think the best thing we can do is try a similar approach, but instead of looking for mutations we could look at gene expression changes that could be druggable.   There's no shortage of disposable labor to deal with that kind of material in the more sketchy parts of the world.   I got an S5 literally two days ago and it's plenty fast. TouchWiz doesn't bother me at all. I really don't understand why so many people on the internet cling so hard to the "Stock Android Purity Law" as if being designed by Google automatically makes it better. In fact, I tried the Moto X, M8, and S5 all side-by-side through multiple visits to the store and guess what? I actually liked the S5 the most. People have different tastes, and apparently lots of people like Samsung's design.   Likewise, McCain got a lot of flak for running back to Washington during the crash in 2008.   A great effect is that it increases the mobility of the labor force. Don't like your job? Quit and find a better one. It will improve the quality of businesses and improve labor relations too.   Minimum income guarantee is a great idea, but having it be flat across the entire country is a terrible idea. Canada is a really diverse place, and $20k would be vastly different in terms of actual purchasing power.  The immediate benefit of a guaranteed income would be that the Canadian government would be effectively subsidizing *all* businesses through increased spending and (possible) decrease/elimination of the minimum wage. You would have an increase in the mobility of the labor force as people would not be afraid to change jobs.   However, it's not an insignificant cost: The only way to make up that shortfall would be through increased taxes -- for example, the government could increase tax revenue by increasing sales taxes or business income tax. At the end of the day, though, governments aren't there to make money but to make investments in their citizens. The real question is what kind of expenditure is appropriate for the government in this kind of scenario?   He was the only guy that showed up to the game. Belgium dominated the entire match.   WTF? The Red line goes across the entire city, as well as busses being practically everywhere. Boston hits way above its weight in terms of public transportation accessibility. Going downtown is effortless, and now night owl service is starting again. I lived there for six years for graduate school (2006-2012) and I could count on one hand the number of people who owned a car.   Lived in Boston for six years and recently moved away. Fall is most definitely the best season. Winters (and snowstorms!) are getting a lot shorter too so there are more weeks for keeping that peacoat out!   Surprised this is so far down. Back in graduate school I knew a diabetic guy who had some knowledge about these types of medical devices. He said that the reason why so many of them look so primitive is because it costs so much money to get them approved and the bar is set extremely high. An iPhone app controlling an insulin/glucagon pump sounds great, but there are a million of things that can go wrong. Granted, the atmosphere regarding FDA medical device approvals is steadily changing (eg. the inhalable insulin that just got approved), but we're still a long ways off from basic medical devices reaching the 21st century.   Also, by nature the judicial system is *supposed* to be conservative by design. It is not there to make new laws, but rather to clarify on whether a law has been broken or whether a new law is unconstitutional.  There are other avenues for citizens to make change. They're through the legislative and executive branch by way of elections. The state and federal governments in most cases can supercede the Supreme Court through constitutional amendments. But expecting the judicial system to create new laws is not exactly an efficient method for progressivism.   Ticket to Ride is one of the best games that I've ever played. Excellent replay value and great for newbies.  Pandemic is very difficult but it's edge-of-your-seat exciting. The problem is that it's a co-op game so it really depends on the group dynamic (eg. one guy could dominate the entire group with his opinion). Also very tough for newbies to figure out.  Love letters is an unexpectedly fun game. A friend showed the game to me once and I was pretty skeptical. Each round is like 30 seconds long, and is extremely addictive.   When I realized the research interns in my lab were born after 1990. In a few years many of them will be born after 2000.   I went to Harvard as a PhD student and this was always confusing to me. I knew a few people that ended up getting Masters degrees from the Extension school, and also plenty of people that ended up getting certificates or taking post-bac pre-med classes. As far as I know, for the degree programs you were still enrolled under the Extension School (which is part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences), so it's unclear whether you would be sharing classes with the rest of the undergrad community. You could join all the extracurriculars and community events, though. Finally, you were also strictly prohibited from listing your degree as from "Harvard University" and had to list it as "Harvard Extension School", although I know literally nobody that actually followed this rule on their resume.   Actually, contrary to popular belief, most of Europe is not covered by extensive public transit. Sure, the moderately sized towns and cities have good access, but the entire European continent is literally covered in podunk and suburban towns where there is no night-time transit. Most people have to drive for work and pleasure. It's not a very long distance, but they do it anyway.    That's nothing -- my Gmail account has 35k+ unread!   Also, the original TMNT cartoons were stupid as fuck but were pretty entertaining. Anyone who thought otherwise probably has their nostalgia turned up to 11. Just fire it up on Youtube.   But seriously though, most of the leaks that came out were attacking Google/MS/Yahoo, and the telecoms. Barely anything with Cisco or the companies that make the hardware itself. Kind of curious if you ask me...   If you're white, then the only time you'll ever witness things like this happen is when they're within eye or earshot. Which means you have to be in the right place at the right time.  For minorities, women, and the disadvantaged, even one event in their lives is too many. It's stupidly naive for people in this thread to think that this kind of thing doesn't happen.   If there were no profit incentive, then no drug company would ever invest in the R D necessary to create vaccines. Also, the regulatory framework around vaccines is one of the most rigorous and is independently reviewed across international agencies.  Here's another thing to think about: the fundamental issue is that there is a fundamental disconnect between any given person's *perceived risk* of getting vaccinated versus their perceived risk of contracting the disease that it protects against from the general public. One is an emotional non-quantitative assessment, whereas the latter has been backed by decades of longitudinal data. Then there is also the perceived risk of trusting a pharmaceutical company with a vaccine versus the actual number of scandals that actually involved vaccines. It doesn't come down to a perception of whether a pharmaceutical company is interested in my general welfare -- it's whether I believe that the risk to my well-being is higher when I trust them to make a vaccine versus the risk to my well-being if I chose not to. The problem is that the people who choose the latter consequently compound this risk not only for themselves but also for the general public.   Except for, you know, the fact that many childrens' vaccines are generics, the fact that you take them only once in your life severely dampens their profits, the fact that they have dramatically improved infant mortality in developing countries (where you would also expect the rate of increase of side effects would be *faster* if these vaccines were harmful)...   You can make up all kinds of conspiracy theories about big pharma, but vaccines (and antibiotics) are one of those things where they have the *least* incentive to mess around.   Also it wouldn't make any sense if bacteria/archea and fungi were considered non-vegan, because such a pan-organismic view would mean plants wouldn't be vegan either. Unless you were a level 5 vegan.   I'd give them a bit more credit. The Transformers movies have been getting better with each sequel. I think the writers and even Bay himself have been getting comfortable with making this type of movie. There are very few decent movies that exist today where the main characters are *not* the humans. Godzilla was terrible (despite a lot of redditors loving it, for some reason), and Pacific Rim just barely got the right balance. The Hollywood track record actually isn't very good.   How do you not die of carbon monoxide poisoning in a tent?   The Wikileaks cables also showed that many Middle East countries were practically begging the US to invade Iran.   A lot of drugs come from nature, but they become FDA approved. The big thing I have against dietary supplements is that you can literally say anything with the special footnote and the FDA can't do anything about it.   There are bars here in the Bay Area where it's okay to throw your peanut shells on the floor. I almost had a brain aneurysm when I first saw it with my own eyes.   Seriously, that is some high budget stuff right there.   I think people miss this point because of short memory. ISIS is a symptom of tribal warfare in Iraq, but ultimately grew into an actual force during the Syrian conflict. It's really a sign of bad foreign policy by all parties involved that they didn't get that situation under control. The West chose to help out Libya because it was easy, but they should have kept their eyes on the prize in Syria. The longer a civil war, especially one involving religious sects, keeps on going in a country the more likely they will gain strength/resources and spill over into neighbors.   I don't get it either -- the US is basically allied with Saudi Arabia for purely historical reasons. If anything, in terms of geopolitical interests the US should be allied with Iran. Both Sunni and Shia want to destroy Israel so it all comes out in the wash, but there's a huge difference between funding AQ/ISIS and Hezbollah. Iran has a huge interest in stabilizing the Iraqi and Syrian region. Both countries are theocracies with questionable human rights records, but only one of them seem to be actively trying to destabilize Afghanistan and Iraq.  	107
 Wyss Institute scientists have embedded effective synthetic gene networks in pocket-sized slips of paper         This new form of solid, stable light-sensitive nanoparticles, called colloidal quantum dots, could lead to cheaper and more flexible solar cells, as well as better gas sensors, infrared lasers, infrared light emitting diodes and more.      Lettuce could be the first life to land on Mars if a team of students succeeds in their plan to grow salad on the planet in 2018.         Australia has celebrated the new year with millions of people flocking to fireworks displays around the country.         Researchers recorded brain activity when people touched their thumbs, index and middle fingers to a mechanical object. Smartphone users broadcasted increased activity compared to non-smartphone users, and the activity was boosted the more people used their devices.      Habitat loss due to agriculture has caused the insects population to fall 90% in 20 years, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to consider protecting monarch butterflies under the Endangered Species Act.      When rovers exploring other planets seek out chemical signatures associated with life forms, they're only able to identify chemicals that we know to look for. That's why Swiss scientists from the EPFL research center have created a device that identifies microscopic life, based on nanoscale movements instead of chemistry.      The demand for Solar PV consumer products is increasing across various industries and applications especially in the BOP market, where consumers benefit from the low cost, better quality, environmentally clean, and brighter products. Also, it will help in eroding the upfront cost advantage that kerosene has today.               A team of researchers at Harvard, the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Chicago has taken a major step forward in effectively enhancing the fluorescent light emission of diamond nitrogen vacancy centers - a key step to using the atom-sized defects in future quantum computers               Orthodontics is a special branch of dentistry that focuses on the treatment of teeth and jaws that are misaligned. The word comes from the Greek words orthos meaning straight or proper, and odont meaning tooth. It is concerned with the treatment of malocclusions or improper bites. These may arise from tooth irregularity, problems with the jaw or both.                        Bank of England might actually turn to those two social media channels in an effort to set interest rates.                      Research team have developed a three-step reaction sequence in which a copper complex converts carbon dioxide to oxalate under mild conditions. The copper complex is first reduced by reaction with sodium ascorbate or vitamin C. The reduced complex selectively reacts with carbon dioxide from air and fixes it into oxalate, with the oxalate ion bridging between two copper atoms.             Hi MysteryVoter.

They are not to be confused with Stereotypes, which are one-dimensional characters weve seen in too many movies. Archetypes represent elements of our personalities on a deep level  the mother, father, artist, teacher, king, etc. Theyve appeared in countless stories for thousands of years. They reach us on a subconscious level, which is perhaps why they have endured and still have the power to touch our emotions.      Winter can be tough on dogs and cats, but there are a number of safe and effective ways you can help them get through the cold season, an expert says.      Using the principles of liquid-liquid technology, researchers have developed an extraction column which recovers metals companies use in their production processes and avoids both environmental pollution and lessen economic losses.      Moscow State University is planning to build "Noah's Ark," a repository for the genes of every creature, living or extinct.      The SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud service is now available through IBMs highly scalable, open and secure cloud.             Keeping a tree well-watered goes a long way toward minimizing the needle problem. But beyond that, scientists are trying to find ways to make trees less messy and keep them fresh through the holidays.                  The first few pages of your screenplay are critical. Most execs, or Readers (people who want to become execs) will only give you about 10 pages to get them interested. That is why your screenplay must have a great beginning.         An international team of archaeologists and scientists say proteins found in the dental plaque of peasants from Roman and medieval Yorkshire provide direct evidence of milk consumption from as early as the Bronze Age.            When you want to write a script of comedy movie, there are some steps to help you so that you will not find any difficulties in writing it. In this article, you will find some important steps that might be very helpful for you.      In automotive industry, like Google, Manufacturers are trying their hand at self-driving cars. Mercedes-Benz would be one manufacturer that you would expect to lead the charge and it has its own efforts going.            Father Christmas began his journey round the world from Australasia this morning  and Microsoft and Google are both offering ways of tracking his journey to drop presents off with children across the globe.      Sony is bringing its cloud-based PlayStation Now video game streaming service to Samsung televisions.                           It seems Australians fall into one of two main camps when it comes to favourite Christmas goodies for December cook-ups, and our tastes appear to be influenced by the weather.      Hopefully youve had a chance to read first article on the common mistakes that authors make in their early, and often later, attempts at screenwriting to adapt their book. If not, thats okay. Each of these articles can stand alone. So lets get started.   Here are a few of common mistakes of new screenwriters. Hopefully, this article will help you to avoid them and make your script or book into a movie more enticing to Hollywood.            A network of nine reference sites off the Australian coast is providing the latest physical, chemical, and biological information to help scientists better understand Australia's coastal seas.            By mimicking the red and green colours of falling leaves, Bornean lizards avoid falling prey to birds whilst gliding, new research has found.

 Can I just have your number in general?   There's a new one happening right now but it just... doesn't sound right. The tone is off I guess. I can't explain it.   Goodness.   Wooooowwwww.   Hang in there. I'm sure someone will find you.   Format please. Text block is really hard to read. I had a hard time with it with my own post but if you hit enter twice at the end of a paragraph you'll get the space you need. Edit: Made it through. Put a salt circle around your bed and your son's rock and play. Update us asap please. :)   I had to read that a couple times to figure out what really happened. Holy shit.   Dude. Did you kill your wife or something...? Or are you just a big bully?   What's a shadowban?   I will take you at your word OP. What is your motivation for killing? You don't sound at all deranged or like you are having psychiatric problems.   Yeah we already established Clayton is immune. This doesn't have the normal tone of the mold stories to it. I wonder... Also if you kill/let someone else kill Clayton, you're screwed. And who is Rachel?   Which one?! I'm in Nova Scotia and it's awfully nice to see a fellow Canuck on here.   This advice is probably gonna get me all kinds of flack BUT when my insomnia got to the point I couldn't function and I was seeing stuff, I started smoking a joint before bed every night, taking a sleeping pill with a cup of tea, and listening to really quiet classical music til I fell asleep. I eventually weaned myself off the routine but I still struggle with getting to sleep. I hope you can beat this OP.   That would be terrifying. I'm really glad you made it home safe and sound.    I had no idea where this was going. Nice writing style OP.    I would have done worse than kick him. I get angry in traffic when people are acting stupid and I have my dog in the car.... I'm really glad both you and Belle are okay. Dogs may not be "worth more" than people but I can promise you I'd save my dog before I'd save a person.   Anyone crack the code?   This is fantastic. Can you tell us more about Iggy, like what you've been up ti with him since, and if Roy is doing well? Dean Koontz often writes abut dogs and I must say the humor and descriptions here really reminded me of him.   I've seen this posted and read this like 3 times now.    Mold mold mold. You can't fix it. Get your sister and your dog and RUN.   Any news OP?   My dad was a trucker. He did long-haul all through my childhood. I have the utmost respect for what you do. Please be damned careful in this town.   I got so excited I teared up.    OH MY GOD IT'S THE MOLD I COULD CRY!!!!!!!!   I don't think I've ever smoked up at 4:20pm or am. It was always at like lunch time during school, or 11 or 12 at night right before bed.   OP, I've heard that if someone you know calls your name, you should wait until they do it a second time, because the first is the devil or something trying to get your attention.  As for the doorbell, I've had it happen a few times. Always when I'm distracted, and there's other noise happening. Never had an explanation for it though.   Was that a typo in the story? We're compiling a list of the mistakes to see if they mean anything.   Nothing creepy ever happens in Nova Scotia. All the creepy stuff is elsewhere. :(   I haven't figured out if they're important yet. Can you let me know what the typos you've found are? We're trying to make a list to see if it means anything.   I may have but don't remember. Is there something I should know/read for reference?   Porkchop I need to know more!!!!!   IT MIGHT BE THE MOLD DON'T ASK QUESTIONS JUST IN CASE HE GOES AWAY!   You can also spell anal.   Amazing work! Thank you so much for doing all of this.    In Death Agreement - Severity, it says "widow" instead of "window" and in Mr Poe of Newark, "crank" is suddenly spelled "crack." (That last one is an easy typo to make though and may not necessarily be one.)   You're welcome. I hope everything is alright after last night. Keep us updated and stay safe.   Yes! There seems to be one word or letter in each one! If you figure out what it says, can you reply here? I'm curious if it's just my own mind messing with me.   It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?     It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?   Motel sounds like a great plan, especially if the lights are out at home. You should be able to get bundled sage at any local occult shop but I'm not sure where else. You could try googling or searching Facebook for a local group that could help you. Wiccan groups, paranormal investigators, etc.    Have you found any pattern in the typos in each post? The stories are so well written something about the typos and mistaken words makes me feel like they're deliberate.   Salt circle around your bed, anywhere there's cracks, in doorways and windows, burn sage and waft the smoke all around your house. Start wearing a piece of sterling silver on your person. Update soon please.   Someone more patient than me needs to go through all these stories and see if the odd out of place words and typos are a message. They're too well written, the screw ups seem deliberate.   Has anyone else noticed the random typos? After reading the mold stories I'm like trained to see mistakes as hidden messages. This one says "of" instead of what I assume would be "some," and another one had an "are" in a place it didn't belong.   More please! I wanna know!   Awesome story OP. Your writing style is really engaging and easy to read. I've often heard that staring at your reflection too long will cause you to see things you don't want to see.    There's more?   I'm sorry OP. That happened to me a long time ago. PM me if you ever need to talk.   Hey OP any news? You doing alright?  	48
    That was in the beginning, they probably didn't think it would be so popular. According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_the_People_(petitioning_system) it's now 100,000.   Actually, they introduced evidence of that into the trial.   So it mentions something in the story that happened earlier. The original post is from June 2015.   ?   Where would I learn more about these fraud proofs?   Published yesterday, what do you mean?   Google "website to image", couple sites will let you put in a url and give you an image. Copy that into imgur for permanence.   Why? Is proper SPV *that* hard?   Why? Just wait until someone presses then press, maximum one minute wait.   This is mentioned as a potential problem on the weaknesses page on the bitcoin wiki, and also links to a page on getting around the timestamp issue.  Go tell whoever wrote that they have no idea what they're talking about.   It's not going to be noticeable over the short term. There are sometimes hour-long gaps between blocks. One or two blocks generated at a slower rate won't set off anything.  I'm not the first to mention this vuln of only connecting to one node, I've seen devs saying similar.   The judge ruled otherwise. If Ross had claimed an interest in it, they might have needed to justify, but as it was Ross had the burden of proof and failed to meet it.   They don't have to justify it, contrary to your claim. The fact that they did is irrelevant.  My point then was whether they need to know the search is legal.   You said  And they have to justify their authority to do so.  I saw what you said about third parties, I was bringing out a different point then.   Do you not understand the scenario I've been describing? I start with block X, generating blocks, then send them to you when I'm ready. The timestamps are after X.  You keep on adding new checks which nobody ever checks, and would be trivial to exploit if implemented in code.   You claim that they need to justify their authority to search, however it would seem the burden of proof is on the defendant that the search was illegal.   They might not, as I said, I'm unaware of case law dealing with that specific question.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Search  has  The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties.  but it's not clear whether the police need to *know* that it was given at the time of search. The government's argument would say no, because Ulbricht had no expectation of privacy for the server due to its violating ToS, so he can't throw evidence out.  http://www.wired.com/2014/10/feds-silk-road-hack-legal/ also says it might not be true that the Feds can search foreign property.   I generate them in advance, and only send them to you when you connect.   Yes, but they didn't search every server, only the server SR was on.    In order to mine blocks after X you have to have hashing power equal to the total hashing power of the bitcoin network at block X.  No, because you have more time. If you have 1%, then you can mine 1 block in 100*10 minutes on average.  Plus you have to continue to do this without falling significantly behind for an average of 1008 blocks (to next difficulty change).  I only need to do this for 1 or 2 blocks, however many confirms you'll require.   I'm giving you all the blocks up to X, plus two that I mined. This should be clear from my post.   Huh? Mine is exactly 98 blocks shorter than the real one.  Also, would you notice?    All I need to start is a copy of the genesis block hash -- any chain you give me can be verified to be the correct one from this genesis block.  Nope. I start a chain from block X, mine two blocks on it. Send it to you. This chain is X+2 blocks long.  The real chain has X + 100 confirms in the meantime. You don't see it, because you only connected to me.  You have the wrong chain.    Your argument is a straw man.  I wanted you to clarify what you meant, thanks.  From your original post it seemed like you think there's a duty to break laws not affecting you.   Or, don't enter a regulated market. Plenty of people have made quick money in non-regulated markets (e.g. Flappy Bird).   1. Do you think the law against possession of child p is unjust? 2. If the answer to 1 is yes, do you have any, and if not, how is that consistent with what you said above?    But to know that it violated the party's ToS, they'd have to have some reasonable suspicion (or whatever the nomenclature is).  They had freaking reasonable suspicion, it said on the site it sold drugs! (Technically they didn't know it was a third party until after they found it, so it may have been legal, but they couldn't have known until afterwards. So it would have been illegal (possibly) if it had been on his own server in the US. Whether that's valid is an interesting question, but I don't know if there's precedent.)   There are so many unjust laws out there. Why should I do the research it takes to break them? I bet you haven't broken every unjust law, either.   Parent was implying a pardon is wrong if he didn't break the law.   They didn't admit it until the trial.  I've seen a theory that Dratel didn't want to admit it until he had to, because that would reduce public support for Ross, which was paying his bills.   Actually no. The government claimed that they found the server legally. Ross challenged that, but refused to claim a personal interest in the server, so that was never ruled on. So as far as we know, it's possible it would have been ruled legal anyway.  (I think the government's argument was at least partially plausible; basically that it was outside the US, and handed over to a third party in violation of said party's ToS, and therefore didn't have 4th amendment rights.)   The murder for hire stuff was also on his computer, thus not editable by the agents who were corrupt.   The second of the ones I quoted, or  sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes  Sorry I was unclear.  I agree that if limits are set too high, then one small miner can do this. My system would allow anyone to bid for the blocksize, so it will be chosen by those who most want it, as in the Coase theorem.   You badly underestimate fools.   This started because someone said that you only needed to connect to them if you trust them, and you said trust is not required  I don't have to trust you -- the proof of work gives me trust. :)  You're right that if you connect to one good node then you'll end up with the right chain, but if you connect to only one node that isn't trustworthy, you have no guarantee that you'll be on the right chain. You can verify the chain, but you don't know if there's a bigger one out there.    If you have access to the internet, you could get access to a list of nodes.  I'd imagine future clients will check for validity by comparing the responses from multiple nodes.  That doesn't help, unless you manually choose some nodes, and abort if you don't get a response from some of them.    and also the risk of a rogue miner using oversize blocks to knock competitors off the market, or sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes  The first of these is irrelevant to my system. The second can only be done by multiple miners colluding, in fact it requires 51%.   It doesn't really matter if you can iterate.   `x--`   It acts exactly like a function of **it's** argument.  As someone who knows grammar, rekt.   But if you only connect to one node, then how do you know they don't have any hashpower? Your claim of no-trust needed is wrong.    And 5 minutes later someone adds a couple of blocks that includes the transaction mrEvil wanted to leave out. So you'd have to keep making a chain of only your blocks till the end of time to avoid that.  You only need to reject blocks with the transaction you wanted to exclude.  Which makes everyone else on the planet sooner or later stop using your chain, since its not distributed anymore and people will use the other 49%'s fork.  So you're saying a hardfork to stop this one chain. Everyone needs to upgrade, and anyone who didn't upgrade stays on my chain.  Also, in the time it takes, the attacker already successfully double-spent.  And this can be repeated, blocking any blocks that build on a competing fork, for as long as attacker has power. That builds an incentive to follow this attacker's proposed rules.    But the point is that standardization is not a "market". (Most things aren't.) There are no buyers and sellers, there is no item that gets traded and has a price.  It's not a perfect analogy to a market with fungible goods, but arguably markets don't need fungible goods (to take an example from the link above, selling dedications.) The buyer is anyone who burns, the seller is implicitly the entire bitcoin community, which gains because the float goes down. The item being traded is blocksize, with it automatically going to the highest bidder.  The purpose of a maximum block size limit (like the maximum size limit for internet packets) is to make it possible for each player to ensure before hand that he has enough resources to play his role. If the maximum block size is 1 MB, the admin of a site that needs to store 10000 blocks in memory knows that 20 GB of RAM will be more than enough. If the maximum block size is 20 MB, he had better get 200 GB, or program a more complicated solution with disk swaps or multiple servers. Now, what should he do if the maximum block size is computed from the traffic?  This may be a valid point, but note that "serious" proposals have been made with varying blocksizes as well. So some core devs don't seem to think that's a problem.    Having 51% allows no such thing, unless you are willing to compete with the rest of the network until the end of time, essentially forking it. Hoping that everyone will choose your more restrictive fork.  Your "restrictive" fork is longer than the other one, and is completely valid, therefore nodes will accept it.         Agreed, but it makes the above claim a lot less valid.  And there's still a chain of custody.   Roohparvar says the sleeves are thin enough to fit inside almost every battery compartment imaginable    A free market is not "anything can be sold". It is a market where there is no artificial barrier to the entry of new suppliers, suppliers can set the price of their product as they please, and customers can freely choose among suppliers.  That's not the meaning I was referencing. I'm talking about the idea that [If you may do it for free, you may do it for money.](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2015/02/book-dedication-for-sale/) My (only partly in jest) claim was that the blocksize debate was not being conducted that way.  There's also the claim that the free market always works better than a non-free market.  Setting a common standard for products that have to interoperate -- like lamp and lamp sockets, power plugs and sockets, internet packet formats, character set encodings -- is not something that "free markets" are good at.  [citation needed]  (actually, since this is /r/bitcoin, even a citation won't be believed)  Whenever two computer systems have to share a database or exchange information, it is necessary to have a fixed maxmum size for items and messages.  This would still have a maximum size, just recalculated every so often, in a deterministic way.   But none of the "corrupt" agents had that access.  Do some research on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody   Are you saying you disagree?       OTOH Gavin has a point saying that a median always excludes the vote of the hash power minority.  I must have missed that. Link?   Buying paintings doesn't change the system. (And the money goes to others, who then spend it back into the economy. Not wasted.)    Having the most money means you can change the system to make sure you keep being the person with the most money sounds like a good idea to you?  Whoever controls 51% of mining can already control what is mined. The only thing about the system that could be changed under this plan is the blocksize.    Well, how about doing as Gavin proposed then, having the growing blocksize limit, BUT also making a very reasonable default adaptive soft limit, like 1.5x average since last 2016 blocks?  I've proposed this as well. You should use the median, not the mean, as someone pointed out.  I think more needs to be done on incentives, but that seems right.  Of course, [I prefer my own idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3863vw/a_brandnew_idea_for_resolving_the_blocksize_debate/) :)   There is no such thing as "almost surely guaranteed" in statistics.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers  Maybe I'm not the one who needs to study statistics more. 6 block in a row at some point.  But not starting from an arbitrary point. If I fork the blockchain starting from block X, 51% means I'll eventually be longer than the mainchain, while .01% means I most likely won't.  I can try forking anew whenever a new block is found, but that won't let me double-spend something from block X+1.   You've got an almost surely guarantee, or probability of 1, over unbounded time.   The logs on his computer couldn't be changed by someone with SR access. The journal, etc.   What do you think his appeal can be based on?   No. There's a petition site at whitehouse.gov, but change.org has no guarantee.   I think almost everyone will agree that he broke the law at this point.   The judge threw it out because he refused to claim a privacy interest in the server, which could not be used against him in court.   1. Make this on the whitehouse.gov website, if at all 2. These rarely work, I don't know of anyone who was pardoned through such a petition, although some had tens of thousands of signers.   So if the old node software never worked    That address has lots of non-random letter: Size, YES, Pm, a mispelling of i am (and sex), and four CAPS at the end. I challenge you to come up with another address with all those features, and sign a message with the key.  Besides, if this is accepted, there's no need to discard the keys, as spending would be blacklisted.   thatsthejoke.jpg   It's not only bandwidth, it's the UTXO set, which may grow a lot faster with larger blocks.   Just curious what you would consider a free market "anything can be sold" solution to this.  Or would actually using a burn address be enough?   But they need to waste it, not just give it to politicians.   FWIW, most of the sites I've used accepted a number other than 6.  And 51% is guaranteed in the long run.   It seems to be a definitional dispute over whether hardfork means network split or code change from a previously consistent state, and as the previous code was itself inconsistent, some aren't considering it a hardfok. Or maybe it's whether there's a protocol change or not?    So first of all, not everyone has a list of nodes like you do, and less nodes means less security for those.  Are you manually checking that you got valid responses from at least one known node, by the way?  Second, if everyone does like you, that puts the cost on those nodes even higher, leading to a disincentive for node to publicise their addresses.   That's a soft fork, I think.   Blocksize is sort of controlled like you say, but only if miners make a conscious decision. It's not as good a guarantee as the one against 50% attacks.   Your first point is very minor (no pun intended).  And a small miner must still verify a large block in order to mine on top of it; if they assume that others will be mining on it, they want to as well, but if it's large then they may not be able to store the blockchain anymore, or not have enough bandwidth for incremental changes.   6 is irrelevant to the attack.  And if you have less than 50%, you aren't guaranteed to suceed.   I've seen it said that bitcoin has never had a true hardfork; is that not true?  Edit: also, they seemed to be referring to when the limit was first introduced.   I'm on an i7, but I think it's in the 3s in GHz. Didn't time anything more than 5.   One of the agents (DEA agent Carl Mark Force) was the lead undercover agent in the case against Ulbricht, and had high-level access to administrative functions of the Silk Road, including the ability to manipulate logs, chats, private messages, posts, account information and bank accounts.   And that somehow caused chat messages to appear on Ross's computer how exactly?      I like mine better. That one is both serious and unfree. They unfairly award more power to those with more money, without requiring them to pay it. That's not free markety at all!   There were no relevant hard-forks AFAIK, although there were some edge cases.   That was a soft fork.    Most scenarios predict that the winning fork is very quickly decided by market or other forces.  The last hard-fork caused by a bug took longer than "very quickly".   I'm thinking a new vote each retarget. However, if there's no opposition, then it takes very little to maintain/adjust. If there's opposition, then you need to outspend them.  (Perhaps there could be scripts as opposed to simply numbers, which would allow more freedom.)  The beauty of my idea is that it changes all future hard-forks to soft-forks; all miners just refuse to mine on ones with a bad vote, and nodes will **never** have to think about it again.    It worked for me, taking under a second for each result.   for i in {1..5}; do echo xprv9wTYmMFdV23N21MM6dLNavSQV7Sj7meSPXx6AV5eTdqqGLjycVjb115Ec5LgRAXscPZgy5G4jQ9csyyZLN3PZLxoM1h3BoPuEJzsgeypdKj | bip32gen -i xprv -f - -o addr -F - $i; done  took 2 seconds to complete.  Try that, and if it works, then something's wrong with whatever key/code you copied.    How is the "huge block" problem any different than the 51% problem?  If you have less than 51%, you can't do a 51% attack (at least not with a certain chance of success). But any miner can start making huge blocks.   The problem is that some nodes will be hurt, and don't have the option to make these tradeoffs.    It would be great to have commitment that the core-devs and other stakeholders would abide by such a vote.  I was thinking that would be enforced by code.   And it's all done in the blockchain!   Just because it's hard doesn't mean we should make it even harder. There are real tradeoffs here, which you didn't acknowledge at all in your post.    We have full nodes surplus now, too many people are running full nodes.   That is not true. The number of nodes has been dropping, and some core devs are concerned that it's going to be too low.   Disclaimer: this may or may not be serious; take it as you wish. If you do take it seriously, don't dismiss it as ridiculous. Conversely, if you think it's ridiculous, then it's probably satire.  As I'm sure you all know, there's been a debate recently over the blocksize. This is beginning to feel like politics. Bitcoin was made in order to subvert politics, so this is unfortunate.  The optimal solution for any problem whatsoever is a free market. This is proven by the [Coase theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), as any good anarchist knows.  The reason this hasn't solved the blocksize problem is that it's not a free market. Shocking, right?  **My proposal**  Make the blocksize a free market. Specifically, designate one address the "blocksize voting address", and disable spending any outputs to it. People can send any amount of bitcoin to this address, which effectively "burns" it. In such a transaction, also include an OP_RETURN with a number, which is your vote for the blocksize in bytes. These are averaged out every difficulty retarget, weighted by how much money was voted for them, and that is the new blocksize.  (I've tentatively selected an address for this: 1SizeQWexshCicTnfPmYESiAymjHyBXKX.)  Note that miners can reject transactions that have blocksize votes they don't want, so 51% of miners can easily collude to block voters they don't like. However, those voters can in turn make the fees to the miners high enough, which perfectly aligns incentives (ah, the magic words).  I had some buzzwords to put here, but I forgot, so pretend there was more things that you like about bitcoin here.    Then bitcoin must have been really big, really important.   Or someone just spammed a lot.  Besides, nodes don't make money.    How can I verify that the child addresses are connected to the master key?  You can also print out the private keys by changing `addr` to `wif` and check that those generate those addresses. I'm not sure how else you want to verify.   And what kind of wallet do I need to spend the bitcoins sent to these child addresses?  Any wallet that allows adding private keys. I don't have any wallet recommendations. Is the code good?    It suggests that my equipment is not catching up, and i'm not suitable to run a full node while other people and business can (they are forwarding it).  And when it costs a million dollars to run a full node due to large storage/ bandwidth requirements what will you do?   You spelled the fictional character wrong.   You aren't blocked, ergo the West is good.    then i have to accept that - that's what people want.  and then your node crashes because the block is too big.  Your claim that it only affects you if you want it to is false.   You can set your own soft limit and stop forward blocks bigger than that.  If you reject all blocks above a certain size, and others don't, you are breaking consensus.  You can't stay on the network without accepting everything other blocks do.    Not if I connect to specific nodes I trust along with other random nodes on the network.  They can also be targeted, though. And a situation where you need to distrust almost all nodes you don't know or aren't public isn't ideal, to say the least.   * Download https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils `git clone https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils` * Run `cd bip32utils` * Run `sudo python setup.py install` * Run `for i in {1..1000000}; do echo xprvyourkeyhere | bip32gen -i xprv -f - -o addr -F - $i; done`  Tested in ubuntu and bash.  If you need the private keys, just change `addr` above to `wif`.  Changetip will be fine.   virwox.com, if you have a Paypal Mastercard you can use circle.com or coin.mx   But these all sound to me like issues that affect some, but not others. So it seems to me like it ought to be a configurable setting.  I can't opt out from the network if I run a full node.    Are you confusing nodes with miners? Having control of half of all nodes isn't some sort of magical number that'll allow you to do whatever you like. All it takes is one node to distribute a longer chain and it'll be accepted by all other legitimate nodes.  But you don't connect to all nodes. You only connect to some subset, and if I control half of all nodes you're likely to only connect to mine.  If I'm connected to several nodes that I trust, the likelihood that someone is going to compromise all of those nodes simply to double-spend against me seems lower than my chance at winning the lottery having never bought a ticket.  If running a node costs a lot, then you may not *know* people that run one. I personally probably know exactly 0 people who run nodes.   So if I'm responsible for $15 million of damage I don't owe any explanation, but if it's half a billion I do?   https://archive.is/LOBq3   Shouldn't you be in jail?   $15 million   If I've got any significant hashpower, I can convince you that I've sent you bitcoin with many confirms no matter where you start from.  I can also convince you that the chain is much smaller than it is without doing any work.   Sony getting hacked caused lots of damage, it was evaluated in the millions.   If you only visit a single node? Nope.   And if the network was reduced to only a handful of nodes, I imagine all of them would have public addresses. If you can connect to each of them, query for the same information, and get the same answer, is there any reason not to trust that answer?  It means that an attacker only needs to compromise a couple of nodes. It's less centralization.  Also, imagine there are 20,000 nodes. To be half the node network, you'd need 20,000 nodes of your own, and would need a lot of IP addresses.  But if there are only 25 nodes, then anyone can make another 25 nodes and be half the network. They can make 100 nodes with unique IPs, and be the vast majority.  Is this the only danger to worry about? That you might not have the longest chain? What issues could result of this?  It means someone could double spend. I send you chain X with a payment from me to you, so now you think you've been paid. The real chain Y already spent that payment somewhere else.  There's also a standard double-spend attack with preventing you from seeing the double-spend, but that only matters if you accept zero-confs. Even so, less nodes makes it easier to block.  Also, lower nodes means easier to censor, and harder to get cheap anonymity.   something reasonable such as 21 mb  If only everyone agreed that was reasonable ...   How many transactions do you do a day, how much do you pay in fees, and which currency would you switch to? You haven't provided enough info to be meaningful.   If you run your own node, then you have the full security of bitcoin as long as at least one node you connect to is honest. You can only be "fooled" into accepting a shorter chain if nobody that has the longer one can communicate with you. Also, if the fake chain is a lot shorter than the correct one, it will likely have very long gaps in between blocks, or the latest block will be far in the past, increasing suspicion.  If there are few nodes, then it's easier for someone to ensure that you connect only to them.   Nice try, Chinese.   http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/  The Great Firewall of China. A massive system of centralized censorship purging the Chinese version of the Internet of all potentially subversive content. Generally agreed to be a great technical achievement and political success even by the vast majority of people who find it morally abhorrent.  I spent a few days in China. I got around it at the Internet cafe by using a free online proxy. Actual Chinese people have dozens of ways of getting around it with a minimum of technical knowledge or just the ability to read some instructions.  The Chinese government isn't losing any sleep over this (although they also don't lose any sleep over murdering political dissidents, so maybe they're just very sound sleepers). Their theory is that by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, they will discourage casual exploration. No one will bother to circumvent it unless they already seriously distrust the Chinese government and are specifically looking for foreign websites, and these people probably know what the foreign websites are going to say anyway.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China#Evasion  Tor is probably the best, but might as well try different things.  Download all the software in advance.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China#Evasion      You shouldn't be reusing addresses [anyway](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse).  You could just send away any coins on that address first before doing this.  (Also, the fact that you have other unspent transactions in the same address will make the procedure described above more complicated.)   You said it's a few dollars for a test.  But if you don't trust it, first generate the list of transactions using only your public address. Then, save the html file, go offline, generate the actual transaction, and save that. Then you can test it on blockchain.info before uploading it. That way, your private key is never entered while you're online.  You can't do it completely online because it needs to pull your transaction history. (By the way, I confirmed that transactions still pending are included on the list, so you can double spend with it.)   If you want to test it again I'll "help" you ...   Well, I knew immediately that the only hope to recover the funds is that a legit mining pool that has a policy for returning funds in such circumstances and that I can contact, mines the transaction.  You could also have quickly made another transaction and hoped the second went through (not very likely though).   404   User wallets won't let you double spend in general. You'll need to create the transaction manually, then broadcast it.  Assuming you have the private key:  1. Go to https://brainwallet.org/#tx  2. Paste in the private key  3. Put in the destination address  4. Put in the amount you want to send. This should be less than the total, to include a fee.  5. Copy the raw transaction, go to https://blockchain.info/pushtx, and paste.   http://www.cnbc.com/id/102632153  It's been edited, archive of original [here](https://archive.is/2V1qL).   No no, you misunderstood. OP wants *more* threads, not less.

Since there seems to be an almost zero chance of finding the original pressing of Aenima on vinyl, would any of you lucky owners be willing to rip and share yours? I've heard so many good things about the recording, and it being my favorite album of all time, I'm dying to hear it. Not sure if it would be near the same quality, but I'm willing to try anything at this point.  EDIT: I should go on *record* here and say that I am not a fan of "pirating" music, and that I buy all the music I enjoy listening to, that this plea is nothing but a desperate man trying to fulfill his curiosity. I'd love nothing more than to take a trip back to 1996 this weekend and buy my own copy for a price that wouldn't take food from my children's mouths.   Might I recommend the novels "The Exorcost", and "Legion".   No worries.   That was my point. If I found the fog creepy, I would have to be agoraphobic(homichlophobic?).

There's always maintenance.   I did an Aircraft Structural Repair course through a Transport Canada approved school, I then applied all across the country to find a position. Once my foot was in the door I gained more and more experience until I completed the required task list in a logbook, then I wrote an exam to acquire my AME 'S' license. Everything I do involves reading and understanding engineering approved repairs and OEM drawings. Engineers do not over see the project at hand, but are there as support if there is a deviation from drawing spec. As a licensed tech I would never put my name to anything that wasn't to drawing spec, or deviated without engineering approval.    Yeah, I know.

Without getting into too much detail, we would remove and replace the upper and lower outboard wing panels, beef up the outboard wing ribs, and add reinforcements to the wing stringers both in the wings and the centre tanks. Of course last but not least, hang the winglets.  EDIT: Eventually the 737's came from the factory with all the added rework complete, so that if a customer wanted to hang winglets, all they had to do was purchase and hang them up.  EDIT: Stringers not stingers.   No worries. It took so long because of all the structural reinforcement we did.   It's been a few years but if I remember correctly I think we had it down to something like 6 crews of 4 working around the clock for 4 days. That's not including the day of preparation by the mechanics.  EDIT: I just wanted to point out that my "glad to see they're still holding up" statement was meant to be light hearted, and of course it would be unsettling if they began to fail.

This is one persons point of view based on nothing more than conjecture. I don't think all three bands are some kind of twisted inside joke on the fans. More like people doing what they do best and making a living. Could the situation get anymore dissected? Talk about "over thinking and over analyzing".   Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names.   Absolutely.   Thank you very much for that.

My truck is still covered by warranty so for now I will be spared the financial and labor burdens. However, if this is common I would like to know more about what it does exactly, and how I could prevent it from happening again (if possible) and/or fix it myself.

I have a baby due the day after so I may not make it,  I'll get over it though.   Well, that about sums it up I guess. It's a total shit show, and I'm still blown away, but this is the world we live in.   I'm thinking out loud here and this statement should be taken with a grain of salt, but if this is the case then it's time for me to find new forms of inspiration.   Heck I'd take the fire lane.   Agree 100%.   Well I've been looking for an excuse to hit the road and visit the states, as a new dad I don't get much time to do things like that. With my wife on board for a guys road trip I figured seeing Soundgarden and NIN together would have been a fantastic opportunity.    Wow dude, first concert ever was NIN. Your jaw must have hit the floor.   Yeah, you're probably right. It makes sense now that you mention it. I was really looking forward to an epic road trip but oh well I guess, first world problems. Enjoy the show man, the Tension bluray will have to tide me over whenever it's released.   Yeah I get it, but I don't, if you can pick up what I'm laying down. I'm surprised Trent hasn't voiced an opinion about this yet.   I personally don't mind flipping $100.00 on a big production act, I know it isn't cheap to haul all of their gear around, not to mention the show itself is totally worth it, but this has been taken to a new level of expensive.  Again, I could probably land some $100.00 tickets during the public sale, but nothing short of the first 30 rows would make my 35 hours of driving worth it.  I'm with you on the underground, Animals As Leaders are playing downtown here for 25 dollars, can't get much better than that.   For those of you wanting to know:  * I took the picture with my phone because I wanted to quickly send it to my cousin and didn't want to go through the process on my phone.  * These are the "platinum" seats for Red Rocks using the "MYWAVE" Soundgarden fan club code.  * It is my personal opinion that no one is worth this much and that these are obviously reserved for the rich. (Unless of course there was some kind of meet and greet and/or sound check attendance which even then I wouldn't flip the bill)  * I can't see Trent agreeing to this after all he's stood up and said regarding corporations with hands in his pockets. What the actual fuck is going on here?        I had the exact same issue, although captcha seemed to fuck me over as well. No matter how many times I plugged in the captcha correctly, it would not let me through. I was planning a huge road trip from Calgary for this show, fuck.   This is my favourite aircraft on the planet. Thanks for these, haven't seen them before.   Very nice. I have quite a few framed and matted myself. I've yet to post my collection.

Newfoundland beaches look nothing like that. Then again, neither do the Newfoundlanders. I'm going to go with my gut on this one and say it's fake.   Go to Michael's, get a decent frame, and a color matching matte. That's your best and cheapest method for preserving its awesomeness.

Where as if the employee in question is fired due to negligence on their part, the employer would not be liable for such a claim.    I would do terrible things to you    Art.

"That stuff comes from hardware room.").[18]  On November 11, 2010, intermittent phone conversations were transmitted and were recorded by a listener (at 1400 UTC) for a period of approximately 30 minutes. These conversations are available online, and seem to be in Russian.[19][20] The phone calls mentioned the "brigade operative officer on duty", the communication nodes "Debut", "Nadezhda" (Russian for "hope", both a noun and a female name), "Sudak" (a kind of river fish and also a town in Crimea) and "Vulkan" (volcano).

I've been puffing on this concoction for probably 2 weeks. I still can't see myself ever getting tired of it, it is just so flavorful, exactly like eating a grape skittle. I have read countless reviews of juice tasting "exactly" like something but upon trying it myself, I will always find some miniscule flavor out of place. This is the first juice i have tried with a taste so seamlessly integrated to the flavor they are attempting to emulate.    The company is called Preferred Vapor.

Ok, yes, you are correct. I can feel my heart rate and digestion rate increasing. Both of these are loosely correlated with metabolic rate. So while I guess I cannot directly feel my 'metabolic rate' increasing, I can feel the processes that are positively correlated with said metabolic rate.       http://cornerstonecollective.com/better-metabolism-with-cannabis/  Even beyond differences in population, at this point in time, we really dont know why metabolic effects are occurring from cannabis use. Researchers have postulated that the interaction between the endocannabinoid system and the bodys metabolism occurs through partial antagonism of CB1 receptors in the brain. This speculation stems from trials in which Rimonabant and other CB1 receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce body mass.  http://www.foxandnug.com/#!metabolismcannabis/c1x9h  In the study current marijuana use was associated with 16% lower fasting insulin levels. How does this help with metabolism? Too much insulin leads to weight gain by storing fat. So by lowering your insulin levels you minimize the weight gain. Want another reason to justify your marijuana consumption? Chronically elevated insulin levels often lead to insulin resistance, diabetes and heart disease. So get those insulin levels down!!   The study also notes a significant association with marijuana use and smaller waist circumference. So how is it that marijuana helps your metabolism when marijuana users have higher average caloric intake levels than nonusers. Well the mechanism is not quite understood yet but our guess is that It helps you process sugars in a more efficient way, thus lowering insulin levels, thus minimizing the amount of sugars that are stored and converted to fat in your cells.  Basically, you are mostly correct, the direct effect on metabolism is minimal, however the mechanisms are not currently completely understood. While this is not a scientific source, being a long term smoker, I can actually *feel* my metabolic rate increasing after I smoke. I am willing to bet that once further detailed studies are carried out, a true correlation between marijuana and metabolic rate increase will be discovered/announced.    Yea, it fucking blasts the smoke into somebody's lungs if the L is rolled right. Gets you high AF. It's like a grav bong hit without the grav bong.

You're talking about one of the greatest authors of all time.    You know what you call someone with a million dollars in pennies?  Fucked in the head.   Works for me, thanks man!   Good to know.

Lucifer_Hirsch, you're my hero.   Does closure mean buttsex?   *100 Trillion years   I think the premise is that Hell is soo terrible that even something as insignificant as a spoon will provide at least a menial mental distraction from the torture you are being subjected to.    I bet that thing is constantly giving OP splinters.    Or they could also be borrowed and revised works of ~~science~~ fiction.    You call these bagels?   Of course. I was mainly curious as to why he chose "wooden" spoon. It seems to stick out when we're talking about a place that is traditionally hot and fiery. He could have just as easily have said "small metallic spoon" or "small golden spoon" and achieved a similar effect. Just curious as to why the prompt writer himself chose to go with wood.     That would only make sense if he didn't use the plural "prompts" in his comment or say "95% of the time", meaning 95/100 prompts. There is no doubt that he's referring to a group of prompts rather than this particular prompt.  You are correct, he is referring to prompt(s) plural. However, by responding to my comment concerning the hate in THIS thread and concerning THIS particular story, it seems as if he is lumping THIS specific post in with the other 95% that are considered leading.   Huh? My original comment was speaking on the Writing Prompts hate in this thread, and talks about this specific post in general. His response was "The biggest objection is how leading the prompts are". It is only logical that he is chalking said hate up to this specific prompt being leading.  Edit: typo    Not disagreeing with the efficiency of nuclear energy. I was comparing renewable energy to fossil fuel energy. Just as there is a hard limit on how much power you can generate from a finite area, there is also a hard limit of how much oil you can suck out of a given oil field.   The fact is that it shouldn't matter how much paper money it costs to make something happen when were talking about ending the irreparable harm we've been causing to the Earth (the one and only planet we live on) by drilling, spilling, and burning these oils and refined fuels.    Edit: Typo   1 out of 16, i like those odds. I wonder how many golds he'll get by the time his comment reaches 200!   But they could/would if the proper funding was pushed into expanded research and development for those technologies.    I mean that's not really the twist, it's a starting scenario.   After arriving in hell  The writer just chose a direction that used this scenario as the ending to his story. He chose to focus on the build up and the details (and did a great job).   The prompt writer himself came out and said that this story went in a completely different direction than the 3 ideas he had played out in his head.   	118
 Dominique Wilkins. The guy had heart, and he dunked like he wanted to throw his whole body through the rim.    They're both in 'motor valley' about half an hour out of Bologna. Basically, if you're a petrolhead and you're in the region, it's a must-visit destination. Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Ferrari, Lamborghini etc etc... This is no big deal.   He does come off as a bit of a knob to the casual viewer.    There can be only one.   Len Bias?   Sure ain't going to be a team that places emphasis on character. The guy's a fool.    A black guy, clearly.    YOU CAN'T COMPARE HIM TO DIFFERENT COLORED PEOPLE DON'T YOU KNOW THE RULES   LEAFS YOU FOOL.  LEAFS.   "Whose game is it? It's Michael Jordan's game!" - still gives me chills. And what a game!   6:55 for the insane layup, steal, turnover, block and the call but the whole game is dynamite.   Bulls vs. Knicks: 1992 Playoffs, Game 7.  Jordan : http://youtu.be/D9BKx2HN8Ms   Jordan to team up with LeBron and Melo to form Detroit big 3.    This is about vanity, if you like having a clean shiny chain you go for it - but this guy's right. You're probably reducing its lifespan.    Well, that's a Dwight Howard Lakers top, so it's less than 2 years since it was filmed.    Cover it with a white spot.    Or the next Gerald Green, albeit without the cringeworthy tough guy sooky mugging after dunks.    At 12 mm on a full frame, you can almost see behind yourself. In the wedding shot I would have looked like I was right in their faces, no more than a couple feet away. It can be a really cool effect but it feels incredibly rude to shoot this way!   http://m.imgur.com/a/BdwUU   Dude, the place is jumping! Plenty of people wouldn't have it any other way. You and I like a bit more space but others like the pace of a big city like that.    *dominant   Man, a Kurt Rambis basketball card was always the best shitty one to get in your pack. Those glasses... That moustache... I almost couldn't believe he was a real person.  http://d1warraxuf7xh1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/act_kurt_rambis.jpg   His sources were probably executives that were worried about the foot. He didn't report that the foot was fucked, he just said it was an issue with various executives. Both sides could be right on this one.    Yeah I kind of had it in my head that he was old, tired and flogged out. I guess not!   You'd have to include Oden then.    I've had the fuckers draw level with me at 80kmh.    Pessimistically confident.    It was probably all the #thereturn crap. Hold the guy up as basketball Jesus and there's bound to be a backlash.   Ahhhh shit, the poor bastard. His wave was just about to break.   Can't see that happening. Wade is part of the furniture.    Don't you have something better to do?    Motorcycle sales would rocket.    I dunno about that. Pop has said he's gonna retire the day Timmy does.    Small ball and the trap defense worked for a particular lineup of guys - Miami is rebuilding from scratch now, so I'd presume their style of play will change depending on who they sign.   Keep one of these under your seat: http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Safety-Car-Bike-Auto-Tubeless-Tire-Tyre-Puncture-Plug-Repair-Cement-Tool-Kit-/291047728863?_trksid=p2054897.l5660  You can also get miniature air compressors. I use them heaps - as often on my mates' bikes/cars as on my own.   Hornet 919 was one of the best all-round bikes I ever owned. I miss it heaps. It fit me like a glove and did everything - touring, stunting, track days, commuting, great for passengers, the lot.   I haven't ridden the FZ09 yet - it's on the list - but you can pick those old Hornets up super cheap in my part of town and I'm forever looking at them in the paper and going "hmmmmm..."  The Speed Triple, if you can stretch for one of those, is the [best bike in the whole world ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDNrRX6EzWA).   I thought it was called a four-play.    Dude that was one of the all time greatest highlights I've ever seen. And it came right after another insane putback slam. I feel for Pau and all but those made me jump out of my seat.    Because if they're paid what they're worth, they'll lose again.    That was more or less me 15 years ago. Funny thing is, the muscle memory of all those thousands of hours hasn't gone away. I don't shoot hoops for years at a time but I can step right up and hit 8 for 10 free throws.   Anyway, I feel for ya but there's a big wide world of other stuff out there. Motorcycles filled the gap for me.    Yeah they're tops! I'm just trying to arrange a test unit, the SMH10 and 10R turned me back on to riding with headsets.   On my high school team we had one guy who could dunk, and it was a big deal.   It was that or Drew Peacock. I just wanted a penis name.    He was an unstoppable offensive rebounder when MyPlayer Dick Harden got drafted to Dallas.    I dunno, surely it's a severe dose of short-man complex that makes him the ferocious competitor he is...   I kinda have a bad feeling about it. A kind of cancery feeling. The Bulls' success has been built on heart, effort and hard work. I'm not sure you can plug a me-first guy into that and not kill it.     At least she's not called La La.   Yup that's me. 1198 isn't the worst bike I've ridden around town - I've been riding the new Buell lately and that takes that dubious honor. But the s1000rr is as smooth as butter. If you want a bike that can be Clark Kent as well as superman, it's gotta be the Beemer. Doesn't look as nice but test ride both and the difference will be obvious.    Went up there with a car and a bike a few months ago. 3 nails in the bike rear tyre, one in the car tyre. What the hell is that all about?    The amount of seriously dicey u-turns I've done on windy roads durung tests... *shudder*   Fucken lot of work eh. I'm ashamed to say it but the farty noises in your oil change vid made me giggle like a school girl.    Lightning is about to release something that will shit on every bike on the road. Fastest production bike ever.    That team could be the most punchable collection of faces in history.    And bow legged.   The leftist party wasn't left enough for the southern States, plus they'd just made cunts of themselves. Abbott won by keeping his mouth shut. And he's probably still got loads of support, just not from people who can use the Internet.    Jordan has become a real heart and soul player in the last 2 years. I'd be very sad to see him go.    That's absolutely stunning footage for a 21 year old sports broadcast. Crystal clear... And so many cameras - they had just as many on the reverse side. Clearly knew they were filming a once in a lifetime athlete.    Certainly the best correction of athletes - not sure it really lived up to its potential though.    Bron needs his hand held and Wade needs to feel like he's still relevant?  Edit: I think it's more like Bron throwing Wade a bone.   PJ3 played some really good ball while Westbrook was out. Sad to see him ride the bench in the playoffs.   I've been lucky enough to ride a ton of bikes, and the best by a mile was the Speed Triple. No question.    DONGGGGGG   I had the chance to sit down with Randy Mamola once a few years ago and ask about this stuff. He told me that an engine part made for Rossi might cost 3 times as much as the one on Lorenzo's bike. There's a huge difference again between that and the satellite bikes.    Hard to beat Wade in hateability.    I want total humiliation.    They should let Bron do interviews without Wade there to hold his hand.    Condolences in your last two decades.    Bulls with Melo and Rose might be able to knock the heat off, especially if they bring the chump game we've seen the last two times out.    The Poo Game (tm)    Plus, he takes an arse-kicking like a champ.   I think it's great. As often as not, it takes a special kind of psychopath to become rich enough to own an NBA team. Hang 'em high if they've been pricks.   No way - the Spurs first half offense has been blowing everyone away. Mind you, so has the Heat's shitty D.   That Heat uniform is the wrong colour to be shitting yourself in.   Then again, Melo might look at the way Bosh has gone from being the Man to playing third and fourth fiddle.   So much skill, such a finely tuned human being, erased in an instant after what was probably a tiny error. Vale Bob Price.      You and I could work as hard as we wanted and not end up with his size, strength or bounce. Even among NBA athletes, most of whom work like bastards, he's an outlier.  Edit: missed your point entirely, play on!   A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers. Much as I want Miami to lose, I don't think we'll see that kind of effort again.   Winning genetic lotteries?   All those chats are played through the in house PA.   I make a point of blurring the speedo in anything I put up anywhere. No need for John Q. Law to have any reason to come after you, no need for anyone who knows the road to be looking at what your corner speeds are - whether it's higher or lower than theirs, little good can come of it.   He's an ignoranus.    This can go back and forth all day. You've got your opinion, I've told you mine. Great player, bullshit situation and I don't have to be impressed by it.    Took his legacy in his hands by teaming up with two of his biggest competitors in the east and taking a pay cut to prevent the salary cap from maintaining competitive balance. Clearly it worked a treat, and plenty of people jump on board when you start winning.    I have plenty of respect for LeBron's game, but fuck the Miami superteam. It's a pussy's path to a ring.    If everybody you meet seems to be an arsehole, you're probably the arsehole.    Those dunks at the end... Lad's got some anger to get out.    Outlaw gangs are very real and very serious.    You know, it's kind of possible.    The leap to side-sitting on the tank at 2:15 made me laugh out loud in joy and disbelief. Beast!   So... What sound does a cockenballs make?    Garn then, show us!    Wow. I can't remember ever seeing somebody get thrown so high.    He's handling garbage most of the time.    "Cupcake?"   Me too! Excellent cheap hobby.    I've got some 5-driver Westone jobs. I use then for onstage in-ear monitors. Having said that, I think they're total overkill even for that. I reckon most any molded earpieces would do the job.    Lance Stephenson:  http://i.lvme.me/rri734x.jpg   Well he does seem like a bit of a cunt.    ...says the guy on the FJ... :P   Right with ya mate, not naked enough.   About the same as good noise cancellers.    I thought the sennheiser noise canceling cans were pretty good, until I started taking a set of molded earphones on the plane with me. They're tons better, you can listen to stuff on the lowest volume setting. Lets your brain relax.    Interesting point. I guess we'll see.    How much of that was flat top?    I don't think it's cool for you to broadcast that offer Glidecam extended you.   Agreed. It was so good, it made me like a Nickelback song.    Right - not to mention how deflating it is to your sense of self belief to take on the best team in the league without your #3 offensive option and best defender. OKC plays on emotion, this is a killer.  Also, fuck the heat.   Onya dad! :)   Won a stack of road races too, Angel Nieto rode Bultaco in the 70s. But more recently they've been known as off-road and trials 2-strokers.   ...but you've only got one arse to put on them!   Nothing about OKC's stagnant, iso-heavy offence convinced me they'd beat the spurs even when Ibaka was healthy. Ibaka is their most important defensive asset and their #3 option at the other end. They might get a win or two but I think they're finished, especially since the Spurs have a great defender to put on KD, and home court advantage to boot.   Top level racers are by no means normal people.    Regular season records don't count if your team is coasting like a bitch.    Agreed. Source: will never shut up about hating this chequebook superteam.    They were all pathetic. And he should die in a fire.   But it's basically totally comprised of wrinkles!   This is only true of some people's spit. But when you find someone with just the right loogies, you hang on with both hands.   	115
 the thing is...you have the same amount of units at that mark as you normally would so it doesn't effect your ability to hold it.   as so0n as you scout it start getting towards vikings. Multiple bunkers(mostly just to delay the push), pull all the scv's when you finally do attack   What is the thought of 1 rax double expo against protoss? I tried the build today and it seemed like my midgame push was much stronger(but slightly delayed). It keeps you ahead of a fast expanding protoss on economy and you don't sacrifice much in terms of army production because the increase in scv's gets your back up to production levels of income quicker. Discuss.   GSTL has players planning in the same way Code S does...Same with Code A.    my point was that you were choosing your data to fit your point. You can't said oh Code S is decent win % and ignore Code A, Foreign tournis, and GSTL.    i'm talking about dropping around max. Of course you can try to drop before then but most decent zergs(plat or better) should be able to shut those down with minimum losses. The theory is that since brood lord army is so slow you should drop to exploit that...except that's putting at least 12 army supply away from your main force in what is already a hard straight up fight. sure maybe that one drop might kill some drones but it hardly matters if the rest of your army dies.   if you drop you die because those units aren't present in the big fight.   not including the (1-26) winrate in the GSTL   here is the link i promised http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=266096#   I believe there is a blog post by blizzard that says if you get to x number of points in a season you gaurentee yourself a promotion.   i can't answer all your questions but i can answer a few.  * By placing a sacrifice depot you do nothing, any skilled player can pick that off with roaches or will ignore it. * I dont understand how factories floating matters...but they will probably target the wall on one point and then ignore it while trying to kill off units. *i place my down right before i head out for attack i think. * a bunker and some depots..just like your natural. Don't use baracks bc then you have to interrupt production to lift.(also you really should make sure you get those 50 scv's!) * I almost never win vs z with my initial push, rather it sets me up to kill them eventually/get into the late game ahead. * It depends on what X is and what their composition is an whether you want to rush medivacs/tanks * I do this! I have a +1/+1 stim medi timing that i hit against z...usually combat shields finishes up during the attack or slightly after i think. I'll link a replay here when i get home. You can really explore the 1 rax FE. Fast tanks/slow tanks/no tanks/1 rax to mech. Each is situational though...If you are comfortable with one,stick to it. * 50 probes by 10 minutes(and 100 overall supply iirc) * if someone is going mass muta just go kill them. Mutas suck in head to head...or build a thor or 2....turrets are really only there to delay them.   as a terran...you hit the E button and then click..then approximately 2 seconds later is when the emp actually hits. At least thats been my experience.   just so you know, emp is not instant...it takes a while to cast   thanks   i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises   i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises   the program isn't very outlined from what i've seen. Just giving the exercises to do but nothing outline progression(whereas SS is really specific with its progression)   I did my first day of Westside yesterday but I'm not sure how to progress on my upper body max day. Do i increase all my weights?      how did you determine your starting weights while doing west side?   okay, watching your replay i noticed you are basically doing a 1 base all in...is there any reason why?   first note is you actually see his overlord scout in your vision but you still send your scv scout the wrong way. If that scv scout goes straight to his base you see the lack of drones and you can bunker up.  Here is what your base looks like when the baneling bust hits. Up to this point you've done no scouting. http://i.imgur.com/SoeYD.jpg  Here is what my base looks like(notice i've taken an expansion and still have almost the exact same supply amount as you) http://i.imgur.com/nYdyk.jpg  tl:dr-if you scout it they can't win   select is the game reported before and is from 2010..should be on the mlg site somewhere hopefully.   I remember when i was in silver/gold league i thought banelings were the most overpowered unit in the game and i seriously thought "herp derp make banelings". But then i learned to split my marines and how to target with tanks and now i trade with banelings well. Currently TvZ is my strongest matchup as i fell terran is really good at abusing zerg at all times in the game. My worst match up by far is TvT and that can't be based on OP/UP.   I think Protoss is the easiest race most definitely and the strongest race and I think they could use a late game nerf. But if they get nerfed late game then they can't compete with Zerg. I've just come to accept that I have to play better than other races if I want to be better than them.   relevant user name   So i'm thinking about starting Westside for Skinny Bastards and I'm looking at starting with the following schedule for day1  * bench press: max set of 3-5 reps. * dumbbell bench press: 3 sets of 6-10 reps. * Chest supported rows: 4 sets of 10-15 reps. * rear delt machine: 3 sets of 12-15 reps. * Hanging leg raises: 3 sets of 8-15 reps.  my questions is how do i determine a good weight for the non max exercises. I know i can do the SS method for the bench press(add 10 lbs until i slow down but what about the other ones. Same method?    actually thats part of the beauty of this build, any 2 base all is extremely weakened bc of taking out sentries or even just the zealots. Scary counters are 1 base colossi and 2 base colossi is harder as it forces late game.   This is not an all in build...in fact its a really strong build that techs really well. I personally prefer the 4 rax variation of this but the idea is that you(as terran) want to trade minerals for gas. The early marine pressure is simply about sniping as many sentries/stalkers as possibl to delay tech or weaken it(as it wont have enough supporting units. Taking 4(or even 3) gas afterwards you can still tech appropriately without delaying tech.  EDIT: the build for the 4 rax variation is  10 depot,12rax,15 cc, 15 2nd depot, 18 2nd Command, 25-3(rax),supply depot so i would assume 6 is similar   thats the point...once i scout them i'm not sure how to react   but scv's don't really help against banelings :-/   What is the best way to defend an all in assuming you've already 1 -raxed expanded. I've been hitting a lot of four gates/3 gate proxy robos/baneling busts/roach baneling bust and have correctly identified all of them coming. Some I hold, some i don't. However, I don't ever feel in control of the situation. I just kinda pray they mess up somehow or back off a little bit. How do you hold these builds?  I "know" the answer is bunkers but i'm not sure of the amount to make and also whether to prioritize them over say a supply depot so i don't get supply blocked.   all weekend the streams in the live player were freezing/stopping. I tried talking to support and they either told me i was lying or told me to switch browsers and would not help further. I was really pissed as a paying customer. When i went to twitch.tv I had no problems except not being able to watch high quality...but that was better than everything stopping middle game   its b een doing all weekend and when i contacted support they told me i was lying .    He sounds totally different...a lot like he did back in the day   i go 4 rax into 3 gas..i think its puma's build. gets tech up at a decent rate and allows quick 3rd   If you play terran and are diamond level or below this timing attack should be pretty powerful. I can't speak for higher than diamond as i haven't matched up against any masters zergs yet. There is a couple of variations of the build in this replay but this is my standard one. Note that i had horrible macro but it didn't matter.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476  here is another replay where i dont commit to that push as much because i scout early units.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263488   I'm also working on a 1 rax expand variation of this build that skips the helions that i'll post here soon  EDIT: the basic idea is map control is gained via aggression   If you play terran and are diamond level or below this timing attack should be pretty powerful. I can't speak for higher than diamond as i haven't matched up against any masters zergs yet. There is a couple of variations of the build in this replay but this is my standard one. Note that i had horrible macro but it didn't matter.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476  here is another replay where i dont commit to that push as much because i scout early units.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263488    I recently posted my TvZ push that I've been doing to good success here and may post my TvP once i've gotten the late game transition ironed out. My basic build right now is 1 rax expand into 4 rax with a midgame pressures that build up advantages.   as a fellow platinum terran TvT-i think thats just how the match up plays as I run into the same issue. I've been experimenting with bio and it seems to do well at times. TvZ-you should be killing them before broodlords....or you should be so far a head that you can just produce vikings and marines and kill them. TvP- Dont get to the late game...ever.   oh snap....now i can afford to off race!   would a nicer less gas heavy move be just to start into a ffe? cannons murder marines...don't really know as i'm terran though   here is my NA contact info: test_subject4671.465 friend me and i will do a couple of practice games with you so you can get a feel for where you might need static defense and/or marines   and they didn't even produce lag free to US. 'm in VA and was lagging  incredibly all thoughout last day   no...i posted a thread about this before the event and it got downvoted to hell...only half the games were commentated   sounds like a good variant of it. This is just a general guide line. other times i'll  go faster tanks or i'll create a reactor for the starport ^.^   Sayle is cobroadcasting with pokebunny live    here is another replay where i dont commit to that push as much because i scout early units.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263488   no. I should have taken a 3rd and 4th gas guyser with my 3rd command center instead of going for a 3rd and 4th cc.  delayed 2/2 purely macro level mistake as I have other games where i've timed it much better.  Edit: If you watch my POV you can see that i was almost solely focused on the attack and wasn't macroing well   1st game was a mech vs bio base race and 2nd game was build order win. so pretty decent   It was on POV 3. I believe score was 2-0. Goody mech so good!   If you play terran and are diamond level or below this timing attack should be pretty powerful. I can't speak for higher than diamond as i haven't matched up against any masters zergs yet. There is a couple of variations of the build in this replay but this is my standard one. Note that i had horrible macro but it didn't matter.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476  General ideas of the push: Reactor helion expand add two more rax w/ reactors add a gas, build a starport and 2 engineering bays get 1/1 and push with first two medivacs w/ a scan available to clear creep follow up with 3rd and tank production.   The hardest thing for me to hold off is a baneling/roach all in simply bc of lack of units so I really half to keep track of gas/units with my helions. If I scout it I'll prioritize tanks over medivacs and build a lot of bunkers. This is a powering build so once it takes off you should have a good advantage   I like to do a strong time push that hits before mutas http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476   they did it for the previous arena by bringing in the playhem guys(robin, adebisi, axel, tumba) and i preferred that.   last arena they had 8 streams iirc-4 casted and the main screen POV. I would prefer that to the 10 stream, 2 casted and the rest POV as I prefer a casted viewing experience   its not a concern so much as a preference...and if enough people share my preference than MLG should take note...if not it doesn't matter...but as a consumer we should dictate the market.    So according to the press release by MLG, half the games will have no casters and will simply be POV of players in the game. Is anyone actually looking forward to those streams? Are you planning on watching those streams? I personally would rather see those four streams reduce to 2 commentated streams as I personally enjoy the extra casters   i've had two friends die from bench press failures and one become paralyzed...thanks but no thanks.   I would like to gain muscle...I really dont have a ton of fat to lose. 6 foot - 175 ish. I just finished p90x to get to that from 200lbs...but that program didn't seem appropriate to adding mass muscle.   I looked through the links/faq but I couldn't seem to find what I was looking for. I'm trying to find a good gym schedule that i could follow that would be less focused on big lifts(like squats, deadlifts, bench press). To be honest, I'm just not that comfortable in a gym, much less with that amount of weight without a spotter. Can anyone direct me to a good program. thank you :)  EDIT: Just finished p90x so i've done bodyweight exercises but am looking for something that allows for bulking easier   and my vuvuzela   its very hard to keep ravens alive in a fight   the belief is that you have to do early damage to even participate..I prefer a 1 rax gasless expand into 4 rax 3 gas build. If opponent 1 gate expand or nexus first i feel my 9 minute mark push and then 11 minute mark pushes will do so much damage that i win... 3 gate robo is the bane of my existence though lol. (plat terran beating diamond p's)   I've been doing to polt bio play with double ebay. It gets countered by mass ling infestor somewhat but if i scout that composition I'm perfectly comfortable doing non stop drops and playing for the late game. I feel the longer the game goes the better it is for terran as I can snipe bases/drones etc easier and bc terran is very cost effective   no i'm saying we shouldn't act shocked that they act like every other business   Seriously guys. Everyone is in an uproar over the KESPA/MLG thing. MLG is a business that is trying to make a profit. You know how they always say that if IPL/IEM/NASL go out of business its bad for ESPORTs? Thats a lie! only one of these can come out as the alpha dog(see ABA vs NBA, WCW vs WWE, UFC vs Strikeforce, etc) and MLG is positioning themselves to win.   i play terran and i dont have any of my builds mapped out above 40 supply(and thats only for protoss). I feel terran plays really reactively as well   isn't the other player thorzain since he won Dreamhack?    thanks for the link...its weird..i can connect now .   In the USA, can't connect to battlenet. Any one else having the same issues?   core is my favorite workout...i may be a masochist though...   It all depends on wha t want to follow up with. I've been using the polt 3rax late tanks early double ups style(detailed in a recent day9 daily) so after my first 4 helions are on the map i'm throwing down two more rax(around the time i see roaches/banelings) i have enough time to produce 1-2 mauraders and bunkers etc. Remember that helions are primarily a scouting tool that help deny the third...keep them a live at all cost.  EDIT:i wait until i have all 3 rax up with 2 reactors and 1 tech lab before moving out or if i scout early double spine or quad queen at the front of opponents base(since that signals they are being passive)   i wall off with the factory/reactor bc that provides a high HP target that a zerg can waste banelings on. Plus it funnels towards one of the two depots. You shouldn't have your expand on the low ground until you have a force of 10 marines at the least(which will be well after both the roach and baneling time) but yes sac the depots. Remember these are respectively ALL INS..if he doesn't beat you there then you pretty much auto win. therefor we want to make it as hard to beat as possible. making him go up the ramp means you can line up the hellions to destroy most the banelings as they come up the ramp EDIT: and if he has roaches keep producing those maruaders and set a couple scvs to auto repair and then lol as you win   as soon as you see the roaches pull back the hellions and build a marauder and a bunker at the top of your ramp..remember he is sacrificing his economy to damage NOW so you can delay your expansion easily.   High Plat terran here:  your first helions come out right around the time a baneling bust hits if you are doing helion expand. by this time you should have an scv that has scout his main/natural...if he has no natural bunkers(2) at the top should solve all problems(including roach rush etc). Keep the scv in his natural to make sure he doesn't take it(hide behind mineral line)  assuming you 1 rax expand in tvp(which you definitely should be doing) then you put one bunker down automatically and you should scan his main circa 6 minute mark(right when your second CC becomes an orbital)...if you scout 4 gate make another bunker and pull some scv's and set them to auto repair  what is your tvt build? If you go cloak banshees you become pretty safe to any 1/1/1 build and while you will behind economically to a 1 rax expanding terran i prefer the early tech in this matchup as you can put pressure with tanks on a 1 rax expander   orbital commands can not be loaded with scvs   i try this style but every time i do it i get over run by a cheap cheese or someone going mech. :( i think i may expand too fast? idk its not the build order i need inso much as the idea of how to play it...i feel at a lost.   So I'm a current [plat terran](http://sc2ranks.com/us/2781279/test_subject4671) and I do really well with tvp and tvz. For tvp I do the Puma 1 rax expand to 4 rax/3 gas build and for tvz I do the Polt double Ebay mass marine late tank early agression style. The problem is, with tvt i dont have a build that I feel comfortable doing.I've tried one rax expand, reaper expand, tank expand, banshee expand....i just dont feel comfortable(especially with the prevalence of two port cloaked banshee in plat league). What are some build you use?   i think the general consensus on this sub is the pure protein offers the best value/taste/macros   i uninstalled the old driver(using control pane;-remove programs lol)   i fell back to driver version 295.73 and that has at least been a work around to the issue for me EDIT: apparently the current BETA driver will also solve this  	79
 I agree - perfect for a 15 year old boy. Shakespeare does Stephen King. (Cue outraged gasps from purists.)   Hmm, maybe I should put (***JOKE***) beside some of my comments, as people seem to take them very seriously. But the older I get, the more I adopt the perspective of the adults in the play over RJ themselves, and see the perspective of the Friar, the long-suffering mother, and even the between-the-craziness affection but exasperation of the nurse. Especially the Friar (who is often portrayed as a dodderer, but the text gives him wisdom). The father I still can't sympathize much with.   Interesting to hear from someone who was in the room at the same time. I wonder if there are others who would like to chime in. Or who have seen other performances - maybe it was a bad night for the team?   The Festival Theatre is not a particularly small room, seating over 1800, but does have a terrific thrust stage with a 220 degree sweep of seats around it, and the distance to the stage from any seat is surprisingly short given the theatre's capacity.  See the photo in my original post to view the stage.   I'm always happy to be disagreed with, and readily acknowledge that I haven't seen a lot of OP productions. This one was directed by Tim Carroll, who I understand is not exactly a newbie to the genre, and to me and the people near me it fell flat with a fairly mighty whump. Critics who have seen many more plays that I have also seemed unimpressed.   That said, much may have related to the level of the acting, which was somewhat uneven in this production.  In response to the comments about the importance of venue, I agree. Something might work at the Globe or Blackfriars, which are organized specifically for this kind of production. The Festival Theatre at Stratford is a magnificent theatre "machine", and I suspect some of the frustration has to do with having all of those resources (which, as I say in the article, Shakespeare would likely have drooled over) sit idle. Also, the OP format is itself artificial in that environment. They even had a complicated lighting arrangement carefully designed to simulate the gradual (and random) changes of light that might happen during an outdoor performance on a sunny afternoon.   Forgive my ignorance (which is limitless), but I'm not sure I understand your question. A three syllable cue before each line? Can you give an example?       PrettyCoolGuy:  I think this is a reasonable argument, but it's also difficult for any movie to represent every aspect of any minority if we accept that there is diversity within groups. If we portray a feminine gay man we may offend gay men who object that not all gay men are feminine; if we portray a very masculine one we can look androgyny-phobic. None of the movies on the list can reasonably claim to be fully representative of any community. I can't think of any others that are either.   I'm a psychologist who provides lgbt diversity education sessions for healthcare providers. These sessions are never as long as I'd like them to be, so I give lists of resources for people. I know they're not likely to plow through a long list of texts, so one of my lists is of popular movies.  A few of the films on the list I've also recommended to clients dealing with related issues, as an adjunct to therapy.  This is always a bit controversial, because we can find fault with almost any portrayal, but here's my list. Want to suggest more or comment on those on the list?  http://www.psychologysalon.com/2013/05/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity.html   Depression is such a difficult state that it attracts almost all of a person's attention. But making your life all about the problem can be depressing in itself. First I get up and take my pills (because I'm depressed), then I journal (because I'm depressed), then I go to my therapy session (because I'm depressed), then I listen to my relaxation CD (because I'm depressed), etc.  Sometimes it's useful to do some counterfactual thinking. "What if I WASN'T depressed? What might I be doing?" I ask clients to imagine they could eliminate depression with a snap of their fingers. (If only.) What does the good life after depression look like?  Then you can gradually begin aiming directly at that goal by doing some of those things, very gradually (after all, the depression hasn't actually vanished and is still slowing you down).

I think it would make a great nap spot, bring a book with a small light and just doze off slowly. Sounds sweet right?    Try making whipped cream and adding it to that as a flavor, if you like it great if not so what! Bad whipped cream is just like bad pizza, even if it's bad it's still pretty good.   Brooklyn and two guys pop out immediately...    Neighborhood Guy 1- Elderly Black man who jogs everyday, has to be in his 70's if not older and thin as a rail, emaciated really but he's out there every spring and summer, I can walk faster than he jogs but he's out there in the street all the time. Just saw him the other day. Knew winter was officially over.   Neighborhood Guy 2- Elderly White man, he's over 6 feet and roller skates every day using a large pole to help navigate around. He collects cans and bottles and you can see him roller skating along holding a large bag of recycles in each hand. It's a sight to see. I haven't seen him in a while, hope he's ok.   Place everything you want to cook in a bowl. Using a nonstick pan, add a knob of butter and a 2 tbls of a good olive oil until it's shimmering then add your hash mix in large spoon fulls, and let it cook until a nice crust forms, lower heat, cover and cook until cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes depending on how thick the hash is. Remove from heat, place a large plate over hash, invert pan and hash should pop out onto dish. Serve in slices like a pie. I made a slow cooker pork shoulder not knowing it was St Pats day and with the left overs I just made a homemade Shepard's Pie.

       everything looks great except for Iron Mans suit. Looks so photo shopped.       Titanic. But If I had to pick a recent score It would have to be Interstellar.    Its all about taste and all film is subjective. Your not going to like every single film.       just watching 1080p youtube videos id probably use that up in a few days.       Thor dies, Cap then gets to use the hammer?   I guess that makes sense. But Id hope that we would be able to figure out a way around that limiation.             Oh god. this movie is gonna suck.    I think its been put on the shelf for now. My guess is Fox will wait and see how FF does before revisting it since Josh Trank will have also signed on to direct FF2. So we may not get a sequel till after FF2 and even then Trank has his star wars movie to do. So if Chronicle 2 does happen it wont be directed by Trank.    is that including spectre or still 2 more after spectre?   Ok seriously can we stop already?                   TL;DR LOL   This article is from last year. Old news.    If it still turns on you might just need to replace the hard drive. Or the hard drive could of come loose due to the amount of force. Open her up and check.       its cheap, constantly updated with new content. Its original content is even better than some of its licensed content (Looking at you House of Cards). Easy to switch regions with a VPN etc. Compatible with lots of devices. Its just that good.    Netflix.          You could try the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak    Damn that's complicated to look at.    Apparently its 145 minutes according to my local cinema. Just in case anyone wanted know.    Their laptops are actually decent.    Is still shit.    If Captain America: Civil War has spider-man I reckon it has a decent chance.    So the last episode was called the return and we got a surprise guest apperance from Manu Bennett as slade. The episode implied that Bennet was returning as Slade but he didn't really did he? he ended up back in Prison and imo It was more of a guest apperance than a return. A return to me would of been him escaping so he could of been used later on. I just found the episode title a bit misleading.       Why didn't disney at least give the second one a go before canning the franchise? they could of at least wrapped up the story properly with one more film. And besides, It could of been one of those franchises that picked up steam through dvd,bluray and VOD sales. So much wasted potential. :(    A lot of people don't have the technical know how to figure out how to use Netflix,Hulu and torrents etc. Some people still cant afford internet. Also some people just prefer the social aspect of sitting down and watching TV with a bunch of friends rather than being anti social and watching it on a laptop or something. TV is a very social thing for a lot of people.       With all the spin offs and what not. When do you think disney will reveal the entire slate? perhaps at star wars celebration?    Is anyone else worried that Sony is selling off its TV and smartphone divisions and wants to invest more in PlayStation? I mean what if their investment fails to return a profit in 3-4 years time? would Sony consider selling the PlayStation brand as well? The last thing the gaming industry needs is a monopoly controlled by Microsoft. Nintendo really doesn't have any stake in the industry anymore like MS and Sony currently do. Would you guys still support PlayStation if it was purchased by another brand like Samsung?         Oooh season finale perhaps?    I mean come on. Do you really think CBS is just gonna let this show end? give it a year or two maybe three. But it will be back in some way. Mark my words this aint the last we've seen of it .   The new spider-man actor and director Captain Marvel director Infinity War director(s)? Thor Ragnarok director Black Panther director Inhumans director Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War Agent Carter season 2 Agents of Shield season 3 New Avengers line up for infinity war  Did I miss anything?       why not just download it all at once? its annoying when you have slow internet. Id rather wait a bit longer but at least be able to play it without interruption.    well thats stupid.    So I just started playing the order 1866 and I just watched the cut scene after you kill the lycan with the lightning gun and now the game seems to be downloading something again. its currently at 55% and 60 minutes remaining. wtf is going on?       human centipede   There should at least be a temporary logo until an official one is released.             its a tv show. the contract wont be that binding like it would for a movie.    there's nothing stopping it from happening. That's actually great casting.    I wanted spider-man back but not like this. Why move everything? they could of easily had another film in 2017. I'm happy civil war and guardians of the galaxy 2 seem unaffected though.    everyone noticed this. Your just late to the party.    They wont be taking money from each other. They are both Disney films. Disney would still get money ether way.    Why delay any of them? they would still make money. imagine the nerdgasms. Avengers and Star Wars a couple of months apart. Would be madness. But awesome madness.    Its not paid DLC for Unity. Its a complete game.    Oh god yes! but ONLY if the movie is ready in terms of VFX and editing and what not.       Not bad. Looks like your all set to go. Huge fan of those EVGA power supplies. So underrated, more people should use them.    So a week from now I'm considering upgrading my graphics card and with the launch of the 960 the price of the 760 will now drop. So I'm wondering do the new feature's and the performance increase of the 960 out way the benefits of a 760? or should I just go with the newer 960.    I like pc as much as consoles. Why is it wrong for someone to like both? Not only that I think its stupid to sell a console for a new pc case when the value of the console outweighs the value of a new case.    nope.    I don't see how one can film a movie like that with at least some of the cast members feeling awkward on set. I mean what if they down right refused to film a sex scene because of how outrageous it was? I haven't heard anything like that happening for fifty shades just used it as an example. I'm just curious how a director would handle a film like this?       that's the most stupid idea ever heard. no way I would sell a ps4 for a case.    I can never understand these posts. if its your money just buy the damn case.    Netflix gets new episodes weekly.    it will be quicker than dude, have you ever use tpb before? its like 10 minutes tops after it airs.    so watch it later on netflix?   I think an official discussion then a late comers discussion would be good. But it might be a bit too much for the mods.       I mean unless they go back in time some how it doesn't make sense but this is moffat we are talking about how so ofc nothing is as it seems.       Walter White. All he wanted to do was secure a future for his family before he died and the only way he could think of doing that was by cooking meth.       Im more interested in the process behind how marvel got to where they are today. I really enjoyed how star wars conquered the universe because of that reason it went so in depth into how star wars got to where it is today.       So get this, In the newest trailer there is a shot of Jason stathams Ian Shaw blowing up a car, next shot you see Dominic looking all sad at a photograph of his family .I think Shaw kills Brian and Universal is hiding it pretty damn well. What do you think? Here's the sequence im talking about. http://imgur.com/a/s10Zi now this could be just the way the trailers cut but it seems kinda obvious now that Shaw will kill someone close to Dom whether its Brian I cant say for sure but why else have that shot with the family photo with Brian in the center?   aye you see them plenty in both of the trailers. calm down. They are a major part of the plot they were even in the winter soldier post credit scene.    I might have been living under rock but I haven't seen this yet. Should I check it out?   that was more of a joke than a controversy tbh. North Korea just got Butt hurt someone decided insult their great leader.    I would of thought Selma would of gotten more controversy due the subject of the film but man American Sniper, It seems like every day a new article pops up adding more fuel to the fire. Are there any films as controversial as American Sniper?   it was announced by fox ages ago along with a march 2017 release date for another wolverine sequel.    Since when do you tip Pizza deliveries? we dont in NZ.    Heading there on Wednesday for the first time. Staying for a week. Any thing a first time visitor should do and places to check out?   I liked interstellar's theory on this. In the movie they claim that the U.S faked the moon landings to bankrupt the soviet union.             Did a quick Google didn't find anything.             Poltergeist. If you never want to sleep again.    you wot m8? your complaining about 250fps? wow.       . Windows server 2008 data center can handle up to 2tb of ram.  http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2008/07/21/3092070.aspx      It might go better than you think it will. I've heard stories of  EVGA sending back newer models of their card because its no longer in production. You might get back ether a 760 or 960.    actually can its called IGN   GTX 960.       Yep lol.    CW YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY!   Oh yes. That star trek trailer was amazing. The way they cut the trailer to Freedom Fighters from Two Steps From Hell. Still gives me chills.    I got mine from study link. Here in New Zealand .Its basically a subsidiary set up by the government and offers interest free student loans. You can also get a student allowance which is free but is dependent on how much money your parents make which will impact how much you get per week. Or you can get living costs which you have to pay back on top of your student loan up to $175 a week.          Good way to look at imo. The i7 will be able to play newer games longer than the i5.    eh? both are solid ports imo. They did have resolution issues at launch but I'm pretty sure they have been patched now.             I cant take anyone seriously when they start their argument with "fuck"      All film is subjective. Gourlami is allowed to like wolverine origins if he wants.    I love that line. Don't know why. Just do.    Damn this looks good. Might be more hyped for this than Age of Ultron.    its still too early. It aint out till march next year.       Aint happening, any talk of a sequel died when the abysmal box office numbers came in for the second film.     Im guessing with Age of Ultron? I'm seriously hyped for this movie. I want to see more.       Since Marvel don't seem interested to back a big budget film for the Hulk, why not go the Netflix route? Del Toro was already working on a live action tv show for ABC haven't heard anything in a while tho. Maybe they could jump start it again now that they have Ruffalo?   I cant find any copies online and normally its up by now. Anyone know whats going on? it did air today right?               Well this is interesting.   http://blog.ubi.com/ubisoft-quebec-studio-spotlight/      lol bs pics or it didn't happen.    if you compare the figure on the far left to how Paul actually looks in the scenes he did manage to get filmed you'll see he looks nothing like the figure. The figure is far to thin and the head just looks wrong. plus its awkwardly placed away from the rest of the cast. It must be one of his brothers who then had their head switched out with Paul's during post.          Its beautiful.    did you even watch the first movie? Dom and his crew were pulling of heists all the time like stealing dvd players and shit.    Big hero 6   Are people still pissed that superman killed zod? Personally I'm ok with it. I mean, if he didn't kill Zod, Zod would of killed the family and then kept on killing people. Zod left superman no choice. I get that superman killing people is wrong and goes against everything he stands for but I think it was an interesting and ballsy take on the character by Snyder. What do you guys think?   So this semester I have to get a laptop. I'm pretty much settled on the Asus ROG G551JM. Just wanted to see what people here thought of asus laptops. Are they of good build? do they last long etc?   How does Disney proceed with the franchise? do they keep going and try and make episode 8 better? or do they scrap the franchise completely? id assume they would keep going because they've poured to much money in to it already it would be pointless to stop.       2 years is the norm for marvel films, whats so unusual about it? 3 years your starting to get the point where fans will be complaining there taking too long.    Jaws   Best thing would be some chocolate bars, and whipped cream.          I think you should wait for amd to announce the 300 series. the 300 series might end up being better than the Nvidia's 900 series. Dont just jump on the nvidia bandwagon because everyone else is . Just my 2 cents.       we run windows. Decent size screen would be nice 15.6-17inch, light to medium gaming so some mobas,cs go, f2p games like nosgoth, the ocasional AAA title like tomb raider etc. No special ports required. Portability would be nice i don't want anything to heavy.       Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having an i7? I thought i7's were meant to be quad cores?    I'm not afraid to admit that ive done this, a few of my facebook posts ive posted were to try and make me seem cool but I failed pretty hard.    I've had a couple of pavilion laptops over the past 4 years both died due to over heating issues. Is this still a thing? or should the pavilion line up be avoided like the plague and is it worth stepping up to the Hp's envy laptops?                  Stephen king's the dark tower comes to mind. I have little faith the movie will be any good if and when ever it gets made its just so complex.    I mean why does avatar need 3 god damn sequels and we cant get one battle angel movie :(    Apollo 13   Looking for something that takes a scientific approach yet has all the fun of a good ghost scary ghost hunt.      How are they not done filming yet? WTH.       No, they clearly state that recommended specs will run at 30. Read again. All tho they say they are aiming for the most performance possible for now it looks like recommended specs will run at 30.    Here's the link to the original polish interview.   http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=1132   PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second?   I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better.      You sure that's it? I thought it was the plane that looked like the plane bane used from the dark knight rises?   should of got it directly from steam   yea its bullshit.      Ok I stand corrected. But usually the oscars do seem to prefer the higher rated films.    My computer will probably catch fire trying to play this.    I loved episode 3. Saw it 5 times when it came out. I still get chills when Anakin turns to the dark side.    It wasn't rated high enough on rotten tomatoes. sad but true. The oscars seem to favor movies rated 85-100% anything lower doesnt get recognized.       err how does she know when its your birthday?   what did she do then? when she found out one of her kids did it?   I have a 360,Wii,Ps3,Ps4,Xbox one and I think I have an N64 and PS2 around some where. Plus my gaming pc ofc.   same, here's how Id do it. At the end of AOU Banner is shot into space after cap and falcon break him out of a government holding cell set up by stark after banner looses control of the hulk, cap tells banner that its the only way hell remain free but cap tells banner hell call upon him when hes needed again.Eventually his craft crashes into Knowhere, Banner makes his way out of the crashed craft he looks up we see groot smiling at him and he says I am groot, end scene.       That's bullshit, I mean unless said third party stole the keys then they should be legit. wtf Ubisoft.    Anyone got a decent 24/7 OC going on this card? looking to OC to try and improve performance on some newer games that are coming out.    Ant-Man got pushed forward from November to July.    Wow. That's huge! Paramount must be well ahead of schedule for a drastic move like this.    I think this scene is really important. It tells you up front what phase 2 is about. It even foreshadows the events that occurred in the winter soldier with hydra being mentioned and how they will use weapons of mass destruction on civilians.       I preodered it you mad.    we don't know this yet, Bucky could still play a major role in civil war especially if stark finds out he killed his father.   	200
 Thanks! I will probably shave in a few days. I don't really enjoy the feel of facial hair. I respect people who can grow a good mustache or beard, though.    [It may be red dragon.](http://reviews.nuggetry.com/post-pics/barneys-red-dragon-002.JPG)   I'll take a hit for you tonight, OP!

 Mmeownow is the name         Overkill.  Playing Big Oil with 3 pubs, one of them was a infamy 5 when it was the top, and we just barely finished it.  Of coarse the highest level guy lead us all the way until the end of the last day when we had to bag up the right engine.   We all stupidly bagged up each engine (first time playing it) and he got mad and left. Threw some nads at us and left.   So i grabbed a bag and left for the helicopter and waited while the other guys went down and wanted to restart the mission.    I waited out the storm and handed off the first bag and then prayed to god. And then jt happened, first bag was right!  The other guys freaked out as I ran and made it out. Ahh, that was good.                Is there a blind guy standing there watching them..  	9
 Both servers were driving distance from where I was staying. In fact, the servers both claimed to be in the same city. Would have kept the cities in the image, but according to [Da Rules](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140907220547/infusiongaming/images/4/47/Da_Rules.jpg) all personally identifiable information has to be removed :(         When deciding on passwords, what would you recommend to do to make them as secure as possible? (Outside of password managers)   That's a fake (footage from games)      Yep, I've done all of that and it's still draining just as fast.  Worried now it might be a physical issue with the battery.  Gonna try to call Motorola tomorrow since they put me on hold for an hour today T_T   After the most recent, my moto360 started having great battery life.  Then, randomly this past weekend, it's life shot way down.  It only lasts for a max of 5 hours now.  Has anyone had this issue?  No settings have changed, and even untethering it from my phone kills it in the same amount of time.  Edit: After sending it back to Motorola and getting a new one, the issue has been resolved.  If you experience battery issues like this with a moto360, it might be worth calling support as this seems to be a hardware issue with the batteries where it can't hold a charge long enough essentially.   The Star Wars prequels are awful   Depending on the cost I may be interested. You have a cost estimate so far?  	10
 Should have stuck out your hand and introduced yourself. You play it off until she asks if she knows you. At which point you just say you noticed her and remember someone calling her name the other day.   Truth!   TL;DR Alabama threads the letter of the law and bans gay marriage licences, not gay marriages.   Comcast is the ONLY ISP in Knoxville,TN. My word! Why isn't the government providing internet connectivity hardware as infra, and having whatever private company provide the actual service? This lowers the cost of entry and eliminates this horrid monopoly.    Yes.    Are we to assume there were no animals alive way back when and are no longer in existence today that we just haven't found yet! I ask because urban assuming the myth stems from seeing fossil.  Equally plausible is a low intellectual flight of fancy and embellished stories.  So if a dragon is a misunderstood dinosaur or embellished actual creature gone extinct then we can strip out the frippery. Per the myths: flying dinosaur isn't mythical, we have other examples; fire breathing is perhaps a stretch; magical will be subjective since fire would have been magical to early men anyhow. So it appeared magical given what was comprehensible at the time.  Per embellished fable, which I'm more inclined to accept: flying creature is reasonable since there are/were plenty of those; fire breathing is still a stretch but spitting toxic venom that burns as fire, or something of that nature is not impossible. We have electric eels, chameleons that change color and vipers that spit venom, these are actually more fantastic than spitting venom. Magical powers in the eyes of early men...  Still, after we strip away the fellowship in both cases, you still have a creature like millions of others in existence or already extinct.    I can understand the stories about dragons being myth, but how does that make the idea of the animal itself a myth? Isn't that throwing the baby out with with the bath water?             Excellent thoughts on the article. I'll state first of all that I do feel that fossil fuels have their value and use. But I'm not sure this is it. While it is not feasible to wean ourselves off fossil based raw materials (and there are innumerable implications), i do feel that there is always more than one way to skin a cat if you will.  Ever single application or fabrication that requires fossil fuels can be sourced through one natural, sustainable means or the other. We either haven't found it yet, or we are leaning on the ease of what is readily available at the cost of the very planet we live in. His, Mr. Gates's approach is one of accelerating the discovery or development of these alternative options, and my hats go off to him and everyone else putting even a penny into this research.   The refusal to use commas makes it so confusing to read.    'They' can't be greedy because technically, there is no 'they'.   Fracking is as clean as the air in China (no offense). There is nothing clean about consuming fossil fuels at the rate we are consuming. And as technology develops, we simply are unable to sustain it. The world is quivering right now and so far we only have people in the US and a few other developed countries to account for. What happens when all of Africa comes online? What about rural China? What happens when they too start to consume at the rate the average American does. See the reason for panic yet?   What do you mean 60-70 of 'THE people'?   I'm sorry, but when you take one statement and criticize it out of context, you kind of loose credibility. Your response doesn't sound like you read or understood any of what I said. As evidenced from your very last sentence, which seems to capture exactly what I was trying to convey....   Well, is have to kill you first. But then, the next guy would also require proof. And since you no longer have a physical body with which to communicate, you can't tell him otherwise. For me it makes more sense since it explains much of the suffering that happens in the world. The way I see it, you have 3 choices: 1. Complete randomness. Which actually doesn't exist since everything has some mathematical it logical prices. 2. The Christian version of a God, who acts arbitrarily. See ops post. 3. Or some well defined laws that govern everything. Including the cycle of human existence which includes birth, death, and rebirth. Having to pay for every single act that you put out.   A note to all of you: Understand the concept of reincarnation and reciprocal action. What you sow you MUST reap. I read here, questions about how you can reconcile forgiveness, acts such as the Nazi holocaust, and someone  suffering from cancer. Here is a plot twist for the ages: what if it was Hitler or his kin who is now in this present life suffering from cancer.   And the idea that your sins just disappear because you profess some belief or other is illogical. The same book tells you that you must reap what you have sown. So the only way it makes sense is to understand that even after you repent, you will receive forgiveness after you have made good every single act of wickedness. That is true Justice! And only after having made good your wrongs and keeping with your promise to turn a new leaf, naturally, you are forgiven as if nothing ever happened. Because you have made right your wrong!   That's because it is all wrong. Simple answer. No such nonsense took place.   Your opinion is duly noted.   No, it's respect. You should try it.   Because, you know, since they lied about how they murdered him in cold blood, they couldn't possibly be lying about that. You only get one lie pet incident, right?   News flash, we needn't imagine such a scenario. We are living in it.   The only part I agree with us the part that your suggestions will never happen. You need a good people for that to happen. But if you had a good people, you wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. The system will inevitably collapse on itself. That much is for certain   Actually, this happens to every one.   Well I'd rather they fear us that the status quo   It's the problem with capitalism. FTFY.   It is sad that we all don't see this as a collective problem. But your words remind me if something I read a while ago.  Until we build our own networks and patronize them, we will never have a voice. And no, BET did not count.      Guys, this is important. I'm not anti-capitalist or anything... who am I kidding: I am as anti-capitalist as they come. Why, because philosophically speaking, the most profitable enterprise is no different from slavery. If you strip away all the frippery, you are left with something very close to that. It dictates that our actions are driven by what is most profitable. How can such a concept ever be good? Shouldn't we always do what is right and what serves the greater 'good'? This is what is best. And it is almost always in conflict with what is profitable.  Freeing ourselves from dependence on carbon and other fuels will usher in an immense upheaval in human life as we know it. Just imagine not having to depend on anything or anyone for energy. Then we can actually begin to do quite wonderful things. Think of it, near zero restrictions on energy supply...      I feel like I gained weight and am at an increased risk for a heart attack for just watching that.   Did you read the article? We need to move away from fossil fuel. It is high time we dramatically increase our focus on research and ideas on renewable energy. You are reading it wrong. What you are interpreting this as is "just cut off the lights". No! It reads "let us make the use of alternative renewables as our primary source of energy a number one priority and spare nothing in this effort." The pope is not a scientist. When Kennedy said, let's go to the moon. I can hear your same attitude asking 'how does he suggest....'. He wasn't a scientist. He simply insisted we make it a number 1 priority. That really is all.   I'm not sure what your criteria is but this is about the response of Jeb bush, a us presidential candidate to the popes announcement.  You really should read the article before make such decisions.          Where is the decency in this world. At this rate, there will soon be no reasons to wear any clothes at all. Then you'd hear lamentations about how that every guy you encounter only seems to have sex on his mind. ... Go figure.   What does it matter? You and I exist and are subject to the laws of nature whether we choose to believe them or not. So again, what does it matter what we believe or don't believe. I don't believe in gravity. That will not stop me from plummeting to my death of I took a step off a ledge. I believe I can fly... Same result. What you say you believe is of little or no importance. What actually is of value is recognizing the laws that govern the world we live in and adjusting our lives so that we fit into them. And this is actually to our own personal benefit. Otherwise, we will achieve the same result as in the previous examples above.  	37
 So could I perhaps use the equation y=16x+62. It's a linear equation, and I need to graph it.   Can you explain just a tad bit further?   The goal is to create a scenario which can be graphed using a linear-function.    My scenario is "Poncho Villegas is a soldier who needs to capture a fort. He needs 600 troops to do so, and currently only has a company of 62 soldiers. He receives a platoon of 16 troops each day. How many days will elapse before Poncho has the required force to conquer the fort?"  How might I solve this? I am having trouble puting this in linear function/equation form. Help me, r/ Homeworkhelp.   Wow! Nice to know someone is as interested as me in this effect! Do you have a video tutorial?   Low quality pictures yes I know, please acknowledge these were taken with laptop cameras.        I have seen Tron and Tron: Legacy. I always loved the derez effect. Whether it was evaporation or programs shattering into thousands of cubical vowels.    I have also seen a few episodes of VGHS, and the derez effect is also pretty cool.    If you were creating a movie which has a plot centered around a vidya gam or a computer, how would you recreate this effect?   Wat      Kinect     Could you use it for motion capture and then somehow port it to Maya for animation?   Wow! I know what route I'm taking!         Alright, what about this. http://nibbler.silktide.com/en/reports/mvutbrviwojhuvqp.softstorepremium.com  I really want this site to be legit. I am looking for cheap prices to buy After Effects, 3ds Max, and Autodesk Maya. That is my dilemma. I want to buy these usually expensive softwares for $150-$400.   It is certified by McAfee though.   It was tested with McAfee though. It looks legitimate. http://imgur.com/i5K9Ktn      Oh. Might you be able to clear these misconceptions up? All I want in my vfx work is photorealism.   Wow! Might I inquire what software you used to create 3d models in this wonderful render?      I really thought Tau Ceti was a good candidate?     Seriously. Every comedy related sub has a rule against memes and rage comics and posting such on a social network is considered "shit posting."     It's basically a cheaper version of Maya. I'm assuming it can render simulations?   Thanks!                       I think it will be around $200.   I'm sorry good fellow, but I do not believe there were any birds (Assuming you are denoting to the branch of Archosaurs) in the videos I had seen.   What might you mean, good sir?      EA                     Red 3 standing by.   A reddit is the website you are on.      Tree fiddy  	46
 "not that bad" is still probably not going to win more than 20-23 games; which is actually really bad.   1. A hornbook could set you back another 150 bucks. Any sort of E E will set you back ~50. If he's including other things that weren't included (law in a flash- flash cards) that's another 40-50.   2. New books here are around 180; I think 150 is an underestimate. Granted, I still think 9,000 is really stretching it. I'm probably spent 2500 as a 1L, 1500 as a 2L, and will spend about 800 as a 3L. If I had gotten every textbook + recommended hornbook + E E + some nutshell + law in a flash for all classes in which they were recommended, I think I could have broken 9k.  3. American books are much prettier than their Australian counterparts.   x_x sorry about this thread then.      For some reason, all the thrift stores I've been to here in my city are all extremely poor quality, I've lost faith in local thrift shopping.   laughs at you for using 'relevancy'  feels like an idiot after discovering relevancy is a word.   I'm looking to accumulate ~4 Fair Isle sweaters that are 'fashionably ridiculous' for this fall; but it's hard to track down a decent variety. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or any absurd ones they've recently come across?   I'm wondering this too.   Then we blow like... four.   I feel like dark shades of blue usually work best with light/medium grey. So a light grey v-neck sweater, nice blue jeans and some leather shoes. Or maybe a grey blazer with a white button down underneath.   Excellent. Thanks a ton. I found [these](http://www.florsheim.com/shop/style/18150-03.html) on florsheim, but they look too shiny. Is there any specific type of material I should be looking for in a shoe that is basically signifies it doesn't have a formal-shoe level of shine to it?   Inspiration is this- http://i.imgur.com/rh8IW.jpg  I've found these- http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/allen-edmonds-clifton-oxford/2892042?origin=category contextualcategoryid=0 fashionColor=WALNUT resultback=0 but on a student living budget, it's *really* difficult to justify the price. Does anyone know where I can find something very close in looks for around 150-200? Or maybe know of a good place to buy used Allen Edmonds?  I especially enjoy the walnut color and the simplicity of the toe. Unlike the 'strand' oxfords.   I think it was the "streets of new york" part that made everyone think he was asking for it, rather than "what kind of shoes would work with this suit".   At least you *can* beat bad teams.   That's.. ummm... overaggressive, don't you think?   Medium.   Definitely extra slim. I'm 6'3 150 and extra slim is still a little baggy on me, but that's the skinniest they have. If you get a small it'll be about 1.5 inches too short on the sleeves.   6'3 150 checking in. Life is not fun.   Ours is pretty easy to justify-  1. We were going to have an awesome 2nd week game with West Virginia... then they bailed. 2. Florida, obviously our yearly rival game 3. USF was also *supposed* to be at least a decent-level FBS opponent 4. Murray State- every team is allowed 1 cupcake   Hey buddy, relax. If we're better than the three teams ahead of us, it'll show up as the season progresses. No need to pitch a fit about only being ranked 4th in the 4th week of the season.   Wait, what? Wake is 3-1 with a win over UNC, no less. Boston College is the 'lol' team of our division.   Errr, that sounds nice, but it's more just that those specific games were historically significant. For instance [the choke at doak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_at_Doak).   Depends on the occasion. For a business/professional/interview event, both of them are too informal and will look bad with a suit. For a less formal occasion; you might have some leeway, but you'd have to post pictures of the suit, and I get the feeling they probably won't.    Agree with you on the first paragraph. Still think it looks sophomoric and ugly on OP.   FSU returned a lot more starters than Clemson did though.   You're violating the spirit of the thread bro.   Or. Maybe he's just a dumb troll.   Typically when you join a society, there will be networking events with accountants there from all the firms (big 4, GT, BDO etc.) This is nice because building a repertoire with recruiters and accountants can only ever help you.   At worst, you're going to have a better looking resume by joining a society, and by going to these events you'll get insights and advice that will make you a better interviewee. Ask them what they want in an intern/hire- then convey those traits back to them during your interview with the firm.  At best, your relationships will directly affect whether you get an interview or not; and you could even have already established a professional friendship with the guy who interviews you or one of your callback partners.  You *really* want, when your resume is being reviewed, to have the recruiter (or whoever) to look at your application and say "240drift is a sociable and easy to talk to person who asks intelligent questions and seems to enjoy this profession" instead of "I have no clue who this is, despite appearing on his campus multiple times, so we'll just have to screen him solely on the merits of this piece of paper." The odds of you getting an internship/callback/offer with the former is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the latter, when you have a bare-bones resume and only your gpa working for you. Remember that your gpa is a part of your resume, not the whole thing. Why risk something as monumentally important as post-graduation employment by only having a partially good resume?  Would I really have THAT much trouble finding a good job after I graduate if all I have are my grades?  Think about it like if you were considering asking a girl to be your girlfriend, where GPA=looks. You have a certain threshold, and the more attractive she is than that threshold the more you want her. But you're going to be committed to a serious relationship, if she has absolutely no personality, no mental stability, and when making the choice to pursue her you don't know anything about her past and if she has any baggage, you'll probably want to stay away in spite of her good looks; afterall, you have your pick of girls, so you can take one that's not quite as cute but has a solid 9-5 job and you know is fun to be around. Just like an accounting firm- your gpa will make you attractive to them because you're probably above their threshold; but with *no* extracurriculars and no volunteer work working for you, and no idea who you are outside of this piece of paper you've sent in to be reviewed- they're going to be a lot more hesitant to consider you for this relationship, and probably settle for someone else.  I know the abstract idea of networking gets pounded into the heads of college students; and it's either scares them, or they decide in their infinite wisdom that it's not worth it. But in the world of job efficacy, this is the lowest hanging fruit out there.  tl;dr- Join your schools accounting society, put on a button down shirt, paste a smile on your face, and meet people. You'd be foolish not to, it makes a huge difference.   To be fair; the code of federal securities law is, in my opinion, considerably more difficult than the tax code. And the SEC administering is considerably less efficacious than the IRS. So when the general sentiment is that people hate the current code; I can understand strong feelings against sec. reg.   Ever heard of a dude named Steve Spurrier?   I'm 6'2 155 pounds, and almost all dress shirts I try on fit my frame but are too short in the torso and sleeves, or are long enough on the measurements but hang off of me like a parachute.   I know BrooksBrothers has a decent extra-slim fit line, because my only three good dress shoots are from there. But I'm looking for some other lines of shirts that fit slim for the extra-lanky of us. I couldn't find anything in the sidebar or the (awful) search function.  Does anyone have any shirt lines that are good for us toothpicks?  Edit: and to go a step further, I'm especially looking for a light blue button down, but any general brand suggestions would be great.   You sound childish.   1) I only mentioned that because you said creaming 2 FCS schools doesn't tell you anything, you failed to mention we also creamed an FBS opponent that was 2-0, including a win against an ACC rival. Oregon, Oklahoma, West Virginia, all have considerably more shaky bodies of work right now.  2) I never said the transitive property doesn't exist. Good teams have bad games and lose by small margins to vastly inferior teams. VT got soundly worked, and clearly lost in the trenches to a team that, going into this game, had two pathetic losses. Having VT still ranked right now is just absurd.   How? between the 6 opponents of our two teams, Wake has been by far the strongest, and we just absolutely crushed; whereas oregon is giving up 24 points a game to Tennessee Tech, Arkansas State, and Fresno state.  And another: we've outscored Oregon so far this year too.   To be fair. FSU isn't the team spotting 34 points to FCS schools   How did you have FSU ranked 22nd preseason??   1. Wake Forest could probably tell you a little bit  2. You failed to mention in there that they lost to a team that got whooped by Youngstown State. You have enough information to know that other teams have lost to much better quality opponents then freaking 1-2 pittsburgh.    Wat. We beat a conference opponent, a 2-0 conference opponent, who had another win against another conference opponent UNC. We beat them 52-0. We out-gained them in yardage 612 to 126. We held the 'quarterback of  week 2 in the ACC' to 8/22 for 82 passing yards. We held them to 1.2 yards per rush, and that includes a 34 yard run 2 minutes into the game.  52-0 dude.   I hate to leach off the main question- but I'm way too poor for the near future to afford boots like these. Does anyone know where I can find something that looks very similar but less? Or is this just the expected price to pay for a pair of boots.  Edit: I should clarify that I'm in love with that color scheme of the leather/soul/laces specifically; moreso than the exact shape of the boot.   Yep. Overall the suit looks very sloppy. I'll add that it's noticeably more tight around the stomach than it is where the vents are, making the whole lower half of the suit curve weird.   Combined with the fact that it's a three button suit... eh, I wouldn't wear it.   FSU-UF  1. One of the best rivalries in the nation  2. Ee went through four humiliating years of getting trounced by them, and then once we got our act together they just completely lost their offense and we've trounced them right back. This year I think is the first time we get a really sweet game between the two teams in close to a decade.  3. The gators could plausibly be the last great stand preventing us from going to the NCG, which would exponentially increase the stakes of the game, and could make or break both of our seasons.   Cargo shorts.

Clemson's D doesn't look so great, I think FSU can put up a lot on them. But then Clemson has so many goddamn frightening offensive weapons, there's no way we're keeping the score low, nation's best defense or not.   But now I feel like a homerdouche and a jinxer by picking my team to win by 24 over a top-ten ranked opponent, so I'm not sure.    I love you.   Those light brown shoes behind the row of cordovans. Can you tell me where you got those, and/or if they're online somewhere?   To be fair. FSU *hammered* an AQ team that's looking to be decent this season.   I will never for the life of me understand why that wasn't a complete pass.   I remember hearing that a lot about a year ago too :(   Right, everyone knows we're going to be playing Oklahoma; the key piece to our 2011 vengeance tour.   Living in Georgia now for two years; and frequent Alabama- Tallahassee is worse than both by a non-negligent amount.   No way. Yuffie has the best date scene, because it's so awkward between them.  Yuffie fo life.   Depends on what school you're at.   This is much much more truthful than the comment you were responding to, thank you.   So were the two clauses immediately preceding it.  *cough* spotting bowling green two legitimate touchdowns *cough*   It might just be the lighting, but those shoes look too shiny to match that outfit. Pre-distressed jeans look bad, go for a darker color. Shave. Overall not bad though.    T-shirts (and probably all upper wear) fitting is 95% in the shoulders.  Sadly, this varies. As a lanky 6'2 150 pound male, I'm constantly running into either a) having a shirt fit perfectly in the cut and the shoulders, only to find that it's way too short in the torso, often ending at the very top of the belt *or* b) having the shirt fit in the shoulders and be long enough, only to hang off my body like I'm wearing a camping tent.   I've actually been looking for a reasonably priced blazer like that for a while now... so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd be all ears.   Ponder isn't looking very accurate. Does not feel good man :/   Holy hell they did it!!!!   Might want to switch to something harder soon.   My second favorite team this week!   A 6 minute mile is absolutely not even remotely difficult for a trained runner at the college or highschool level.

His career is **over**.   Can you be a little bit more specific- what prep books did you use for which sections? Were they sufficient? Where were they lacking?   I'm in grad school and I'd like to get my CPA for a tertiary purpose, and I qualify to sit for my state's exam. I'm a very proficient self-studier, but I'm on a student's budget which means that I can't afford Becker's full review course. Ever something like Yaeger which is $1800 is a huge financial strain to me. I saw that Wiley's review is absurdly cheap (150 for the whole thing), but given the price, I'm extremely skeptical of its quality as a good comprehensive review course. Do you think it's reasonably doable, given that I put in the necessary time, to pass the four sections with this book alone? If not, would anybody want to recommend some of the next-cheapest alternatives? Thanks in advance for your help.   I'm in law school-  1. Corporate law, or any transaction field of law is very difficult to get into with the way the legal market is right now. I'd say over 50+% of all 3rd year students are struggling to find *anything* at graduation, must less a job in a transaction field. This is exacerbated for areas like corporate because the majority of corporate legal work is done at "biglaw" firms, which are the highest paying and most prestigious places to go after law school.   2. Because of that, and because of the esoteric highering model of biglaw firms going after the best schools, while shunning lower ranked schools (see [here](http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202483173162 LAW_SCHOOLS_REPORT) for a ranking of the top-50 schools by biglaw hiring rate), I would argue that you'd be wasting an enormous amount of time and money by going to law school unless you attend one near the top.  3. Fortunately or unfortunately, law school admissions is very very heavily dependent on your "numbers" (that is, your GPA and your LSAT score). See for instance- http://gulc.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats. The graphs will give you an idea first of how closely correlated numbers are with admissions, and second what kind of stats you'll need to be competitive at the harder schools. You can also start seeing things like how Northwestern loves a high LSAT + work experience while UVA loves gpa.  4. My advice would be to talk to people in the profession about what the profession is like; get general knowledge and try and educate yourself as to whether or not you want to be a corporate lawyer. If you decide you do, take the LSAT, and study for it like *crazy*. The LSAT is a very learnable test, and spending tons of time working through the [powerscore bibles](http://www.amazon.com/PowerScore-LSAT-Logic-Games-Bible/dp/0980178207) (which, unlike what you'll find with the CPA, is actually the universal consensus credited study guide) and taking 25-30 practice tests (they publish actual old exams for pretty cheap) you can go from being awful to doing quite well. Granted, this alone is going to take 2-3 hours of study a day for about 4 months; but you'd be a fool not to put in the time because a single LSAT point can be the difference between admission and waitlist/rejection from the school you want to get into.  All in all, it's a long and arduous journey, so best of luck to you.   As someone who's generally very shy and introverted; this is a huge fear of mine. Would love to hear feedback.   Hell, I'd take Jameer Nelson, Jose Calderon, Lin, Jennings, Jarrett Jack, Rodney Stucky, Tyreke Evans, Darron Collison, Dragic, and Kemba Walker over Chalmers too.   I would disagree with your disagreement of yourself. You gave some specific examples of some of the types of problems that pervade poor and minority ethnicities in America.  I think it's just important for people to understand that, while obviously this is not true for everyone within any disadvantaged ethnicity, and while people definitely are able to overcome those disadvantages, there should be *nothing* controversial about suggesting that when you have these debilitating factors occurring at a much higher rate, you're going to have issues like crime, STD transmission, and poverty rising at a higher rate.  It's also important for people to not ignore or be ignorant to the lack of culture that we established, and the intensity of the systematic discrimination for black people specifically that disallowed them to just "overcome" these disadvantages like other ethnicities have (asian populations in california etc.)   False. The Beatles were considerably more influential.   This for some reason makes me think of two guys work in finance. One tells the other to "run to biglaw." As though either are a reasonably easily achievable option for someone to just run to.   Not to mentioned, that idea is only about about 6 minutes worth of show.   I'm not annoyed by them, it's just an 'aww that's cute' sentiment. I still remember [making memes](http://i.imgur.com/5ddfY.jpg) as a 1L.   1. How are you going to do this when the professor assigns "pages 43-87" in the reading?   Here come the 1L memes.   ESPN's Sports Science is one of the more stupid things that has ever existed.   Yep, pushes the movie to be being too long in length, and the french plantation just doesn't fit with the rest of movie. I'm glad it was left out.   I agree, and I upvoted for that excellent response. I was just merely explaining his PER.   Sounds like a British person came up with that quote to make us think they did anything.       A^M^E^RICA!!!!!!  Edit: Joke people. I was joking. I know British intelligence played a huge part in WWII   Affalo may score close to 20ppg, just because the Magic are starving for a scoring option. But to be masochistic about this season- he still had a below average PER, and taken in concert with the fact that when he was on the floor last year the Nuggets allowed 106.11 points per 100 possessions, and when he was on the bench they allowed 103.6; which makes me think he's not that great of a defender in spite of his reputation.  Aside from that, I think the Bobcats are hard to say because nobody has any clue how good of a player MKG is going to be next year, we have no bearing on him in the NBA. The Sun's Gortat is probably the single most underrated center in the league; he fits the position of a classic big man extremely well in decent blocking, great rebounding, and a very respectable set of post moves. I think he's one of the top-5 centers in the league.  So I think the Magic have a good chance of winning this competition.   I'd put Jefferson and Monroe above both Hibbert and Lopez.   First let me say that I love Rondo, and he's much much better than his PER; but it goes deeper than just him being a distributing PG. I'm going to focus on the negative aspects of his game, but I'll say up front that I love him and still think he's one of the 3-4 best pg's in the league regardless.  So. Rondo has a low shooting rate, sure, but that's for two good reasons. The first is that he's always had great scoring options around him, the big 3. That's a definite reason his PER is lower but is not a detriment to his ability as a player.  The second, and very damning reason, is that he's not a good scorer.  His true shooting percentage is *terrible* for a point guard. Rondo has the lowest TS% percentage of all 30 point guards who are above the league average (15) in PER. Amongst those 30, and excluding John Lucas who played less than 15mpg, the next lowest is John Wall who is still a considerable .019 above him. And the fourth worst of those 30, Tyreke Evans, shot  .029 above him, which is quite a wide chasm.  His fg%, while not awful, is still below average, and that's taking into account the fact that he can't stretch the floor with threes, and his mid-range game is still very weak. It's even less pretty considering how little comparative defensive attention he gets because, as mentioned above, he has such a wealth of scoring options around him. If he were to carry a greater offensive onus for his team, it would probably be even lower. Even worse than that, his free throw shooting is *horrendous*. Below 60% last season. That ranks him 116th out of 119 players last season who shot enough free throws for a statistically qualifying sample. The next lowest point guard, Devin Harris, shot 15% better than him from the line.  His inability to score hurts triply so 1. Because coaches will smartly not put him in an offensive scheme to be used as a scoring option, because he's so inefficient 2. TS% is directly taken into account for PER 3. scoring is the strongest way to affect your PER.  So while Rondo is the perfect example of the ways in which PER can be "broken", the reasons his PER are low do represent legitimate and serious shortcomings to him as a player. I think the general sentiment is that they are way overblown as a numerical representation of his shortcomings, and I tend to agree with that.    talk to a lawyer  There it is.   and rebounds, which I don't think many people quantify as an offensive statistic.   Aaaaaand his posts are gone.   Could be worse.   When do the results come out?   Yep. Our franchise doesn't suck at all. Even during that down period after shaq in the early 2000's we could have very easily established an awesome team with Tmac, Grant Hill, Horace Grant, Darrell Armstrong, and an emerging Mike Miller. But injuries ravaged us.  Also franchises that suck don't go on 4 year stretches of averaging 55.5 wins a season.   We made the finals a little while ago :(. Not bad for a city with like 12 people in it.   Orlando- 3rd richest owner in the league. Proven to be willing to spend that money for his team.  **WE WILL NOT STAY DOWN LONG**   That just about exactly how Magic fans felt about Dwight back in '08   FBI jobs requiring a JD are hyper competitive. FBI jobs not requiring a JD render law school worthless.   I'd like to see it tried. But this sub might be too immature; and the nature of basketball- that it inherently creates more argument- might mean they all turn into shitshows. I can see really posts getting downvotes by team homers, simply because the post is trying to show both sides of the coin.  Also, I think the format should be a little different. Unlike the more random nature of football, it's usually pretty easy to narrow down who the 4-5 contenders are at the beginning of the year and almost always be right.   Awwwww Yissssss  Just kidding though. It always sucks to see players decommit.

This has nothing to do with being reformed? Why are you posting this anywhere? I'm sure a quick google search would lead you to YEC websites that attempt to give explanations.

The foul-call rate is too damn high.   Ibaka playing? Did Spain's head coach read the Bill Simmons article yesterday?   JESSE EISENBERG SIGHTING   Sure it can. Lou Williams was a hell of a lot more efficient at scoring and getting to the line than Nick Young is; that's still a downgrade.  	107
                   Thank you very much for the reference to the very interesting blog that you included. It is greatly appreciated.   Divine intervention ?   There will, of course, be a spike in inflation in terms of imported goods. Despite its own difficulties Russia is likely to offer Greece a deal on energy so that will be a deflationary impulse. On the other hand there is sure to be some stockpiling on the part of the population so that is inflationary. The effect on the tourist industry will likely be deflationary as businesses chase a declining tourist dollar. The ups and downs go on and on. I subscribe to releases from the IMF, but they have so far not hazarded a guess. I suppose there are other forecasts, but I can't refer you to any specifics.   Probably. I would never shop in a place like that and neither would most of the people I meet on a day-to-day basis. Its clientele comes from a rather higher socioeconomic level. Still, it's nice to see it in print.   Funny ?   Actually Zinoviev who put the opposition at a higher number. Also from the realism displaced at both the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks/Communists and Lenin's own statements. You live in a small world where legitimate scholarly work is denigrated as propaganda against an archaic view.   No. The fight against IS is likely to be long and drawn out. Given Turkey's recent complicity in the attack on Kobane the open question is when the USA will decide to 'go rat' on the Kurds. In the end the USA values the Turkish alliance infinitely more than any friendship with the Kurds. The USA will probably delay until they are good and certain that IS is defeated.   At least no lives were lost in this latest failure.   To my knowledge the USA is close to being unique in the world in this regard. Even in France where language purity is along established tradition foreign languages don't evoke anywhere near this sort of hostility. Perhaps Turkey may be comparable in regards to at least Kurdish and Armenian.    Yes, I believe that's a correct reading.   Never mind. The hierarchy of Mexico recently carried out an exorcism of the whole country because of the 'demonic possession' of having a majority disagree with a certain Church doctrine.   Probably true. I'm agnostic about the point. If you define sociopathy as a 'mental illness' the work on prison populations would say otherwise. You can be well assured that there will be an attempt to expand this category to include as many unemployed people as possible. I suspect that there are some conditions defined as 'mental illnesses' either now, in the past or yet to come that would result in a person being **less prone** to violence. These would be of the 'paralyzing kind' that preclude a wide spectrum of action.  The point the spokeswoman for Mental Health Resistance was making is a fairly simple one. People who are **upset** are more likely to become violent, or in this case possibly become the victims of violence. She may have chosen her words poorly, but the context makes it clear what she was saying.   I think it will be their income that will be tracked rather than expenses. The experiment has been run before, and a particularly successful trial was in the town of Thompson (I think - memory can be fallible), Manitoba, Canada. If I remember correctly it ran for over a decade. Once more I'll have to check. Get back to you on this.   Actually not. The word 'communism' had a meaning long before the birth of post-modernist fashion, and it will have a meaning long after said fashion is consigned to the same archives in which Thomist philosophy, Hegelianism, Christology, positivism and dozens of other 'new and brilliant insights' reside. It means an economic system wherein individuals and families contribute labor in common and take goods from a common stock. In  practice such systems have usually been administered by an authoritarian ruling class and with rather strict sanctions via social convention. The longest lasting example in historical times were the Jesuit Reductions of South America.  This economic system is quite (and obviously) separate from the modern states that have used 'communism' as an ideological justification. Those states are what is more commonly understood as "communist" in everyday speech. The actual original and economic meaning can be better gathered from reading say the Bible than from any Stalinist propaganda.   Stalinist states have been "communist" in the same sense as the Holy Roman Empire was "Holy" and "Roman". They most certainly deserve to be demonized, and one of the authors you mention, Zizek, makes a very good and persistent effort at exorcising said demon. He did, after all, have the perspective given by having lived under one such class system.  The 'socialism' the author of the article is speaking about is not synonymous with communism. In actual fact pretty well *every* modern society, perhaps *every* society ever, has segments of its economy that are "communist". It couldn't function otherwise. The largest segment of our present economies happens within the bounds of family relations. Communism in the original sense is mostly about distribution. Socialism is about power relations in production.  Nope, I'm not searching for the word "communism" at all, and neither is the author.   As the author of the article makes plain **neither** is state capitalism/socialism controlled by a new ruling class embedded in said state. There are problems, of course, with simple economic democracy, and questions about relations with other workplaces and the community have to be worked out. That is a matter of future experimentation. State socialism/capitalism which the author has criticized has had its chance at said experimentation, and it has proven a dismal failure - as would be expected from a system that is obviously a rationale for a new ruling class, obvious to everyone but its believers and especially practitioners.   Well, that's quite orthodox. It's actually quite a common opinion amongst left communists. Leninists and Stalinists pay it lip service, but it has never been carried out in practice aside from the economic disaster of 'war communism' in the early years following 1917. That system, of course, depended on simple theft from the peasantry, and it was also very much a class system. It became increasingly so practically by the month. The new ruling class was embodied in the Bolshevik/Communist Party and it incorporated ex-workers and also not a few members of the old Tsarist bureaucracy.  Others may consider that the democratic side of equality ie a *real* abolition of classes or perhaps even the abolition of the *inevitable* outcome of inequality of authority - actual economic inequality in the distribution of goods by whatever system, market *or otherwise* to be more important. Still others may consider the division of society into order givers and order takers to be equally or more important than a simple abolition of the market. Especially as distribution in such a so-called 'communist' economy will, in any foreseeable future require a rationing system - by an 'incredible coincidence' administered by the order givers.  Now I'm not saying that such a 'communist' system is impossible. As a matter of fact one existed for about 150 years - the Jesuit Reductions of South America. In some ways these were quite admirable. They were certainly more humanitarian than the colonial regimes they were independent of and more so than their distant reflection in the Stalinist regimes of the 20th century. They even, aside from religion, preserved native cultures to the best of their ability. The ruling clerical class recruited its cadre from the natives at least as well as Stalinist regimes have done with their lip service to the workers. It must be admitted that the Jesuits were far and away less susceptible to personal corruption than Stalinist regimes have proven to be. Incredibly so !  Within the Reductions the economy was as 'non-commodified' as any idealist Marxist could ever desire. Money was only involved in trade with the outside world. Beyond family plots goods and necessities were allocated according to need - as determined by the ruling clerical class of course. It actually worked, and only ended due to the dissolution of the Jesuit Order by Papal decree.   Have a look. It's what you want. Be aware that the Society of Jesus accepts novices in our time as well. If the abstract (and idealist) goal of abolishing commodity production is more important than the ~~idealist~~ real desire for equality both in terms of economics and authority then you have a very good model there. Maybe you can begin a campaign for the canonization of a St. Dzhugashvili.   True, that's the present consensus. The article is inaccurate in that regard.   I don't think the list was set up as a 'one to ten'. In any case note that the list comes from a larger website that presents a wide selection of other progressive Middle Eastern musicians.   I seem to recall that you're quite an admirer of Wolff's. Don't worry. You'll get there faster than me a lot of times in the future.   Poland is rather unique in the EU. Even Ireland has moved beyond the shadow of clerical power.   Look back at the article to see the context. The statement was made by an activist with Mental Health Resistance, a left wing mental health consumers group. You can look up their Facebook page. Now, the context. She noted that people visiting mental health centers often become quite upset, and that is a fact. She mentions the situation of people leaving their appointments in an upset state. Especially in a place where they may be pressured to work for nothing ie workfare. Think about this for a minute. Can fights break out as they pass through groups of other people upset for a different reason and not entirely familiar with the merged purpose of the center. Of course it can. It may not be 'politically correct' to say so, but it is factually correct. The interesting thing is that the aggression may begin from the regular unemployed and not necessarily the mentally ill. That is the only part she omitted.    Note that it's part of a larger site featuring progressive middle eastern musicians in general.   Maybe it was the source that people are voting for. The BBC (published today) has a lot of fans.   Thanks for the information.   On vice versa. To define being unemployed as being a mental illness.   Yes, except the destruction of soviet democracy occurred very much earlier than the rise of Stalin. There were numerous oppositions within the Bolshevik Party itself against the progressively more hierarchical/dictatorial policies of the government during the first 4 years of the Bolshevik regime. The one that opposed Trotsky's plans to reinstitute the normal hierarchy of a regular army was called the 'Military Opposition'. At the Party Congress of 1919 their resolution against not just 'order givers' but also a class of officers who were to receive special privileges received 95 votes against 174 for the Trotsky/Sokolnikov plan. From this time forward 'recruitment' to the Red Army developed more and more towards conscription (kidnapping to the peasants involved). There were numerous other oppositions formed in the next 2 years, but in 1921 the fate of democracy in both the Bolshevik Party and Russia in general was sealed. The Bolsheviks had come to rule a country where they had defeated their organized opponents but where 90 to 95% of the population opposed them. NEP and the end of War Communism was the concession to this public opinion.  I can recommend a good book on this period of history. See Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. His case is basically airtight. As one article's title read 'Stalin didn't fall from the sky'.   The return of ranks in the Red Army, along with the destruction of the authority of the factory committees, then the unions and finally the soviets was *not* a neutral decision taken purely because of  'technical reasons'. It was very much a political decision, and it was opposed, ineffectively unfortunately, through each of its stages.   It's been done before in other cities, and yes, by its very nature, it is an experiment. So I agree.   A good source for regular environmental news from China is [China Dialogue](http://www.chinadialogue.net) . It is amazingly forthright for a mainland publication and well worth following.   The desks are next to each other or down the hall. If you've been observant when attending the offices of the 'helping' bureaucracies you will notice there is an "intake process". Little boxes are being checked indicating whether you will or will not become raw material of the 'production process' of various employees. All bureaucracies are the same. Their everyday work acts to both justify itself and to expand its field of operation whatever that may be. Effectiveness is usually not factored in at all unless some sort of scandal happens.   For those who so far have escaped the label of 'mentally ill' the intake process by its very existence puts others in a position of deciding whether said label is to be applied or not. If none of the unemployed who don't bear the label didn't fit into the check boxes then the merging of the intake processes would be even more absurd than the usual government bureaucracy. It doesn't just 'insinuate'. It 'demands' that the boxes be checked.   As to the larger world outside it is already a matter of discussion in some media about the 'character failings' of the unemployed. This merely adds fuel to the fire.   In Britain there have been programs that force people to work for various institutions, often NGOs *for no salary whatsoever*. There has been a lot of protest against this 'workfare'. If you were forced into that I don't think you'd be too happy. Similarly the way that 'job centres' work in most countries is that you God-damn better take what is offered/demanded. No begging off. Think about that for awhile.  As to the other unemployed workers who don't carry the label you may consider them 'privileged', and that, of course is your privilege to think as you wish. They, however, don't think it would be a 'privilege' to be so labeled. They, by the way, may be just as "hungry".  Sending the mentally ill to a 'job centre' is **not** so that they can be reassured that employers discriminate against them. It's so they can be forced to accept whatever a 'caring' bureaucracy feels or is told to feel is appropriate.   In Britain there was a move to place a mental health clinic in a government job center. Both the mental health workers and their clients protested *because* 1)it implied that unemployment itself was a sign of mental illness, 2)that unemployed people would be pressured to accept the label of 'mental illness' and 3)the mentally ill would be under further pressure to accept whatever job the employment center offered/forced on them. There are other reasons that the article explains. The last part is a sarcastic jibe at what is implied by this government move ie that the unemployed have "something wrong in the head or they wouldn't be unemployed".   I'm sure that that wouldn't have fitted into the title box.   It looks interesting, and the price is not too outrageous. I wonder what shipping is though. Probably more than the book itself. What did you have to pay for shipping ?   I see. I guess those are legitimate beefs.    What did you dislike about it ?   Thanks. It's been a time since I have read anything on the dwarf planets, and Haumea was quite interesting when I looked it up.   Isn't it always that way ?   The IWW *definitely* wouldn't endorse Sanders or any other political candidate. It's one of their fundamental principles that union action and organization shouldn't be mixed with partisan politics of any sort.   My mistake. The proper term is "oblate spheroid". It's flattened at *both* poles, not just the north one.    Only "more or less" spherical. Consider Earth's 'pear shape' and its equatorial bulge.   Vers le bas avec la dictature des microbes.   I think Felis domesticus and Canis familiaris are going to be very upset when they find out there are prior claims to domesticated humans.   It's government contracting. In that world if you pay a dollar for a toothpick you haven't looked for the 'best toothpick'.   Yes, but the molecular clock has its own problems in terms of choice of gene/protein and therefore calibration. To a large extent people have relied on ribosomal RNA for comparing organisms.   I think that's generally true. The fat soluble vitamins (A,D and E) are the ones most susceptible to overdose. There are, however, exceptions to this, and people can be surprisingly creative in finding ways of getting themselves into trouble.   That congregation has the most incredible history. Thanks for the post.   I believe the article discussed the use of cyanocobalamin (B12) for actual medical conditions and at reasonable doses. It's particularly indicated in a lot of elderly people.   Thank you.   Thanks. I wonder what the scale in the photograph would be.   Yes, that may come to be due market mechanisms.   No, it's aliens girls.   I think that such plans are discussed quite frequently. One big roadblock I can see is economic viability. It wouldn't be economically feasible to mine iron in this way. Maybe if there were bodies that held significant amounts of 'rare earths' outside of Earth.   :) The 'War of the Spots' ? HG Wells returns.   I see. That holds water. There is still something, however, that I'd question. Are you perhaps 'begging the question' by initially assuming that one of the propositions *has* to be false ?   The dependence of production on a group of consumers wealthy enough to purchase their products has a lot to say for it, and is actually a fundamental belief of most modern economics. Its greatest proof in practice is (was ?) the Keynesian policies that guide modern states' economic policies. Quite frankly I can't answer your question in any certain way. All that I can say is that history has shown that states *can* exist for at least some time with different ways of managing production and distribution other than the controlled market that most of the world operates under today. I don't think that state socialism ala the former Communist countries exhausts all the possibility.  A long time ago I read a book titled 'The Disposal of Surplus Population in Managerial Society'. I've been trying to acquire a copy for some yaers now. Grim ? Yes.   Yes, it can be interesting up to the point of fascinating. Trying to figure out who might have written such a thing and why can be a real head-scratcher. I don't think it's a google translate, at least from any language I am familiar with. I'd go with a stream of consciousness free association, penned for a reason I can't comprehend.   Oh my God. I wonder what the poetry means if anything.   For those interested in following events in China here are a few sources:  1)China Labour Bulletin http://www.clb.org.hk  2)China Dialogue http://www.chinadialogue.net (Environmental news. Based on the mainland but surprisingly open with criticism of official policy)  3)Free China Feminists http://facebook.com/chinesefeminists (Concerning Chinese feminists recently arrested and prosecuted for feminist protests in China)   I presume there were crop losses in Ukraine as well.   In terms of 'surgeon' it may be further broken down. You note that ordinary doctors and nurses don't score so high on psychopathy. I'd lay bets that orthopedic surgeons top the list.    A little while ago I read an article saying that the constraints on physical constants in other universes may not be so strict in terms of ruling out life as some have thought. Damned if I can remember the article's title, but I'll try and find it.   Interesting. I'm sure the Fermi paradox has lots of holes in it, and you have pointed that out. Time travel, however, seems to have such a paradox in it via the old "kill your grandparents" story. What do you think of that thought experiment ?   He'll come running at top speed.   You are right. There has been a lot of international discussion on the subject but so far no really firm plans.   OK. You brightened my day.   Thanks.   And their own benefit as well.   Yes, that's a very important part of the report, and it is something to note.   Short, sweet and to the point. :)   Thanks for the link.   Both points are valid even though it comes to my mind that wind power is actually quite an ancient technology. Even so a little good news is better than none.   In the morning light I see what you mean.   Indeed. Looking over the offending sentence I'd say that it would have to be totally rewritten. It's beyond simple word substitution.   That would be an extremely good idea economically, but it's impossible politically.   How so ? I have to confess that the first thing that comes to my mind is that if China is a "communist-capitalist" apocalypse then Canada must be a "capitalist-communist" one. Sorry. It's late at night.   Sit back in your chair. It's time for a lecture here. Are you ready ? Steven Pinker is *Jewish*. Let me repeat that. Steven Pinker is *Jewish*. He was born to parents in the Jewish community of Montral. You can easily verify this by any biography about him. The only way he is not Jewish is the same way I am not Catholic. He says he became an atheist at the age of 13. I didn't do that until I was 15, but I guess Pinker is just smarter than me. He remained and perhaps still remains very much a 'cultural Jew'.  Here's the lecture part. A lot of people who are on what passes for a 'left' in the USA immediately reach for a political correctness clich in lieu of having any sensible arguments. I have seen that a lot of the 'cultural studies' left in the USA have been told to hate people like Pinker because there is a popular (in restricted circles) belief that his views are somehow, in a rather mystical way actually, supporting the social structures they oppose.  Now I don't know your views on Pinker's scientific work, but if you are of the 'cultural studies left' I hope you keep this incident in mind. PC clichs are not arguments. In fact they are very much neurotoxic. They destroy the brain cells that American leftists very much need if they are ever going to build an effective left in the USA. If you are not in the PC left ballpark then this is merely a bit of correction. Wanna hear some 'Catholic stereotypes' ?   Yes. The authors had a poor choice of words there.   Looks like an incredibly comprehensive list. I wasn't aware that Christie had been keeping up his film projects since the end of his TV channel.   You might say that he is now no longer "fashionable".   I'm fairly confident that there'd be something comparable for amphibians considering all the press they've received over the past few decades. The [International Union for Conservation of Nature](http://www.iucn.org) maintains what they call a 'Red List' of species at risk. It includes plants and a few fungi, but it mostly concentrates on animals. I don't know if this will be of any use, but have a look.   Well yes there are socioeconomic factors that make certain people in India particularly vulnerable. That's a given in any system that is highly unequal. These sorts of problems are not unique to India. I recently read an analysis of the heat wave deaths during one episode in *France* a few years ago. The inequality in India just happens to be particularly glaring. It's something like the effects of an earthquake. Think Nepal recently or the comparison between earthquakes in Chile and Haiti a few years ago. Socioeconomic factors and poor planning certainly contributed to the death and damage toll, but the immediate cause *was* an earthquake. The factors that make a society vulnerable always have to be kept in mind, but they don't abolish other causes.     Apparently so, but I'm not really up to date on that.   My God. It seems that my ass is capable of at least kindergarten reasoning in pointing out the obvious. That's one smart ass.   Yep. You are the second person who noticed this. Of the 4 'rocky planets' only Earth is *known* to harbor life. Mercury and Venus definitely do not. Mars is still an open question, and only time will tell. I can remember two times of 'great excitement' about that. One was a report of 'organic structures' in a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica. The second was the first chemistry reports from one of the landers finding supposed metabolism from a Martian soil sample. Both failed to hold up on further scrutiny. The question is however still open as you note.   Yes, governments can be inconsistent.    Yes. The latest news is that he has been fired. You might say that the spin doctors performed an amputation. Given the pictures of him I've seen I suspect he will soon have to settle for a lesser degree of sartorial display.   The usual sources say 97 to 98 **or more** given uncertainty. The "or more" is always there. Here's a couple of the usual sources - [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus). NASA also lists the 18 American scientific societies and 200 international societies that publically endorse the anthropogenic causation of global warming. The [Skeptical Science](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm) site also has a goodly number of links. They quote a figure of "97 to 98 % **or more**'" even though their survey of published peer reviewed papers **couldn't find one single paper dissenting from the consensus in the period of 1993 to 2003**. In science there is always an allowance for error.  A better and more comprehensive survey was carried out by geochemist [James Lawrence Powell](http://www.jamespowell.org). In a survey of 13,950 papers from 1991 to 2012 he found 24 that deviated from the consensus. This is a consensus of **99.83%**. Things progress. In his survey of 10,883 papers published in 2013 (he expanded his search) he found **2** that dissented from the consensus. This is a consensus rate of **99.987%**.  The consensus is pretty well universal and has been so for many years. What amazes me is the level of hostility and anger displayed by many of the deniers. You'd think all these scientists, their societies, worldwide government agencies and other international bodies were involved in a gigantic conspiracy to murder their beloved grandmother.     Indeed. But Mars is far enough out that the craft doesn't get (solar)winded.   That's true. The crucial thing about greenhouse gases is that their effects are *automatically* world wide. India's incredible pollution problems are a separate subject from climate change. At the same time I sure wouldn't pick Delhi as my favourite place to live.   Finally, real irony. Thanks. it lightens the mood.   El Nios and La Ninas are not a matter of one year on and one off. The present El Nio is still developing. The future does not cause the present.   Two points that you try to dodge with sarcasm:  1)The big one is that the El Nio you are trying to blame isn't fully developed yet.  2)The main financial interest in this debate lies with the fossil fuel industry. As to any conflict of interest amongst the 97% or 99% of reputable scientists who can recognize reality I doubt if their total salaries equal 10 million, let alone 100 billion. I gather the 100 billion sum includes every manufacturer of any renewable energy plant in the whole world. The conspiracy thickens.  As to your rhetoric it is as childish as that of a **very** small number amongst the the billions of people who can recognize a reality that triggers an emotional reaction in you.  Please check your great hero and victim hat at the door when you leave the room. The only "camp" you need is a summer camp that teaches manners.   I guess that 99% of the world's scientists, climatologists, geologists, meteorologists, etc. are *on the take* along with the scientific societies and the countries and international organizations that they work for. Conversely the small number of climate change deniers hired by the fossil fuel industry are obviously the very soul of objectivity.  Now, to speak to the specific question of drought in India. The **yet to fully develop** El Nio may have something to do with the temperatures and drought if one holds that the future can determine the present. Even if El Nio *was* fully developed you should consider the analogy of the eight ounce glass. Call El Nio two ounces to be poured in. Without climate change the glass holds 5 ounces. Pour in El Nio and the glass holds the full amount. If, however, with climate change the glass has 7 ounces there's a big mess when you pour in the 2 ounces of El Nio.  Every single weather event always has a number of contributing factors -always. You cannot 'prove', however, that one factor doesn't count just by noting that there are others working as well especially if the others are yet to come.   I wonder how long it will take for him to want to sell the suit *cheap*. I'm in the market whenever it happens.   That's good to hear if true. If it is I'm sure he can get a job come Christmas time playing Scrooge in Christmas pageants.   I just had a look at the photo in your link. Looks like he'll have to adjust to a bit lower sartorial style in the future.    Yes, I keep seeing news stories about this. The air pollution in Delhi seems to be especially frequent.   One other thing about the exec in question. He should 'definitely' be spoken to about him and alcohol. I liked the pun by the way. Good one.   Yes, very culty and also absurd. It does an incredible amount of damage. Even if it is pretty obvious that it is 99.999% pure bullshit and chest beating it can take on an air of so-called 'reality' to people unacquainted with the level of illusion on the internet. It serves a few other functions as well. One is that it is incredibly useful for information gathering on the part of domestic spy agencies. Every fool who mindlessly shouts out their approval for a silly piece of bragging is automatically added to a surveillance list. What is more all people in contact with them are correlated as well. Gotta keep those lists up to date.   Another thing is that such foolish diarrhea of the mouth is actually 'evidence for the prosecution' in future trials. This simple common sense fact is beyond the imagination of those whose idea of 'politics' is an opportunity to get their aggression out in a forum where they have an illusion of anonymity.   There are other practical considerations as well, and behind them all lurks a cosmic sized fact. Nothing can be accomplished with childish displays of identity and hostility. It leads nowhere. Actually creating something requires totally different thought and action. Slow and steady reaches the destination.   Welcome. I had a quick look at your subreddit and subscribed. I see you're just starting out, but I hope you'll grow. My own tastes run towards reports of actual actions and especially organization that is making a concrete difference in the real world. I notice some articles of that type in your sub. The one about Masai women and solar power stood out in my mind. Feel free to crosspost here especially stories of that type. Do use "cross post from r/worldfeminism" in brackets. Take care.   Very good.    You're welcome.   I don't think that the J. Crew crew were *not* upset. The reason *why* they were and what they intend to do about it, however, are an entirely different matter.    The 'problem' could be stated this way: terrorist attacks motivated by right wing views were at least an order of magnitude more frequent than those coming from the left or from Islamists *before 9-11*. After 9-11 this remains the same. If the 9-11 policies were aimed at preventing the most common terrorist attacks then they are an obvious failure.   Another thing to take into account in relation to 9-11 is to look at like it was a football series. One team wearing black hats got lucky *once* and won big. May I suggest that it wasn't and isn't that the guys in the white hats are so good but rather that the other side is so bad. All this is, of course, concerning Islamist terrorist attacks *inside the USA*. *Outside* the USA Islamist terrorism chugs merrily along, and no reduction can be seen. The victims of this are overwhelmingly other Muslims. If 9-11 had been prevented (as similar plots were in France) the 'top dog' of terrorist atrocities in the USA would have been the Oklahoma City bombing.  No I don't think 9-11 policies have been effective at all, but that was only *one* of the reasons they were brought into being.   That's undoubtedly the sad truth.   It should be noted that the list was last updated in 2005. A good number of the items listed no longer exist. I'm afraid that there is no more current listing that I know of.   I have a hard time understanding your points. Your first paragraph seems to be saying that I am advocating voting for Sanders which I am not. I wasn't advocating any such thing. I was describing a process that inevitably eats away at the hopes of any 'left-winger' who thinks they can push a slightly left-wing party further to the left by faction fighting within the party. These sorts of attempts are *far* more serious and sustained than a campaign around a particular candidate for leader, incredibly *far* more. This experience within a political party is actually far more 'democratic' than the 'football game fandom' of cheering on an individual leader whether in contests for leadership or in an actual election. They are to 'democracy' in the same way as a sustained series of any sort of events is to a 30 second blurb on the television.  Now I may have misread your intentions. I assumed that you were some sort of 'left-Democrat' who wished their party to be more connected to ordinary people and blamed the disconnect on a cabal of unsavoury manipulators within the party, blaming the personalities of the manipulators rather than the actual party structures that give them their power.   I am most certainly *not* saying "democracy fails". In the case of a federal party in the USA nobody could say that with certainty because said parties have never been "democratic" (small d) to begin with. I *am* saying that there are other ways of political action that are much more worthy of the name "democracy".  As to your second paragraph saying that the movement is "towards money" is nothing more than saying "rightward" in different words. Moving "towards money" is nothing more than a gradual accommodation with possessors of power outside of the political game.   American politics were not always as empty as they are today. Before they degenerated into the 'fandom' they are today there were *serious* parties contending for power such as the Populists, the Farmer-Labor Alliance and even the American Socialist Party. I leave the sectarian left out of this for good reason. Even today we have the American Green parties where the process of accommodation plays out as it does in social democratic and green parties elsewhere in the world.  So, hardly a "load of crap" unless you wish to maintain the illusion that dominates American politics today that personality is all that matters and that all that is required is that the 'good guys' get in and the 'bad guys' are removed.   My first thought is that if such a thing were possible it would still be ongoing. There is no evidence of such creation of matter in any of the black holes studied to date.   Once a political party becomes an established organization it develops certain 'levers of power' that are often (almost always) not explicitly stated and may in fact be invisible to 'outsiders'. The Democratic Party is no exception. Rather than discuss its complexes of influence let's take the case of pretty well *every* social democratic party in the whole world, from the Canadian NDP, to British and Australian Labour, to the French Socialist Party, to the SPD, to Greece's PASOK and so on and so forth. **All** of these parties began with a much clearer conception of socialism and an idea of fighting for the lower classes than the Democrats ever had. There was less compromise or collaboration if you will to begin with. In every last one of these cases the parties moved rightwards, especially rapidly if they gained power. In *all* these cases there were movements within the parties to 'reform' or 'return the party to its roots'. They *all* failed. *All* of these parties could be said to have much healthier 'roots' than the Democrats ever had.  It's an inevitable progression. The bureaucrats *always* outmaneuver the 'idealists', and if the idealistic reformer can't be ditched they are either marginalized or the 'Roman Solution' is applied ie "buy the barbarians off". It's a sad but inevitable process.   Possibly. Human politics versus baboon politics = We don't always follow the brightest ass.   Are there any online links ?   Yes that's true. My first thought is that the 'cores' that lead to active geology on such bodies aren't ionized like Earth's core. Or maybe it isn't cores at all but rather due to an equivalent to Earth's mantle. Or maybe the magnetic field of a moon is swamped by the much stronger one of a giant planet. Very puzzling in any case.   There has been a lot of violence, perpetrated by *both* sides in this long simmering dispute. The trouble is that the Chinese government can't see how acts of repression, sometimes quite petty, have exactly the opposite effect than the one they want. Petty repression will lead to *more* terrorism, not less.   Yes, the decree has its absurd implications.   Thank you. That was a wonderful essay. It explains a lot.   I think mining on Venus is still quite a distant project.   Apparently Venus has no magnetic field which certainly seems contradictory to its having active geology. There's a lot of mystery here.   Thanks for the link.   I think we're in good company. Black holes are an endless source of theories so I guess it's safe to say that nobody can claim a complete understanding. At one point the big question was whether they existed or not. When relativity and quantum mechanics are properly integrated then I'm sure things will be much clearer.   I'm afraid I am not capable of answering the question. You probably know more about the process than I do. I guess the best way is to have a look at actual holograms and the technology to produce them and then moving up from there.   I'm afraid that I can't explain it myself. I have read articles about the entire universe already being a hologram. It is moving so I presume one on the surface of a black hole would do likewise.   Yeah I know. My usual practice when I think a noun or an adjective are anything but their usual denotation is to put commas or quotation marks around the item in question. Sometimes I put a clarification within brackets after the item in question. I'm pretty sure, given the general orientation of the Guardian, that is merely a fault in writing style.    People can be strange quite often. From the way the author describes the hate mail it seems to be mostly coming from 'the left', or what passes for such. I can see how it could come from some segments of the anti-science right, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  The author says that the haters are angry that the money supposedly devoted to her 'de-extinctioning' could be better spent on other conservation projects instead. She points out that there is *no* active ongoing research on reviving extinct species in her lab, but people will hear what they want to hear.   There are also anti-science beliefs common to the 'right' (think evolution, climate change and general environmentalism), and they are actually far more common than the anti-science of the 'left'. From my reading her angry critics are probably far more 'leftist' environmentalism.  There is, of course, the fact that some people can't seem to speak about anything at all without getting angry and offensive. With the internet such people have the whole world as their playground.   I believe the author was speaking ironically. It is, after all, from The Guardian, a paper not noted for its subservience to corporate designs. I agree the irony could have been better conveyed.   Well, I can only hope that there is enough noise about it that the State feels it expedient to take it down, even if only temporarily.   Yep. When they die they'll all be beatified immediately, and within two years it's canonization/sainthood for them all. The necessary miracle ? Well the whole world economy didn't circle the drain no matter what they did.   :) They'd also burn up from the inside out because they have a lump of coal where a heart should be.   Well I guess so. One thing argues against this though. I have it on good authority that there are no tax collectors on Venus.   The question is whether Venus is 'geologically dead' like Mars, the Moon or Mercury or active like the Earth. Surface temperature under a runaway greenhouse effect doesn't necessarily mean an active core or volcanos.   Whether it is the "only" one is arguable . Argentina went through a sovereign default in 2001 as did Russia in 1998. It could be argued that Russia and Argentina are not "developed" countries, but it is a grey area.   I realize that, but the usual use of a colon in print is for a subtitle. On the internet people will sometimes use it to add their own expansion to a title. If you use it to mock or disagree with either the title or the content of an article it is best to add some sort of 'irony mark'. In the text of an article in both print and internet this is usually done by bracketing the part you feel is bad by commas. In the title substitution you use it would have perhaps been a bit clearer if you had put a question mark behind the title or added some other indicator of irony.   I don't know. Loss of bathroom privileges perhaps ?   Optimism about immunotherapy has come and gone before. The difference today is that we are seeing it in the context of much greater basic knowledge.   You should have stuck with the article's original title. The title above leaves an impression that you are advocating for the bill. I know you aren't, but a quick glance would imply that you were.   There's a Japanese term for death by overwork, "karoshi".    Double thanks here. One is that you jolted my conscience awake, and reminded me that I should really get around to finishing part 4 of the translation. Another thanks for jolting my memory about your Bakunin library project. Very interesting.  Interesting article by the way. The old 'name dilemma' happens to almost every anarchist who has been active for long periods of time. At some point the disgust with some of the anti-social trends the movement attracts begins to gnaw. Trying to correct public misconceptions about the meaning of the word becomes even more difficult when there are 'comrades' who are overjoyed at promoting the worst labels imaginable and all the labels imply.  'Libertarian socialism' is the most common euphemism, and one I have often used. 'Libertarian communism' in its Spanish or French renderings is probably the most common. Prefixes such as "social" are probably the most popular in English. Implying, of course, that there is such a thing as "anti-social" anarchism which is unfortunately true.   I think your criticisms carry some weight. I'm going to have another look at the survey to see if I can find the exact form of the question. I follow Gallup and Pew, both of whom are fairly reputable, but I know there can be problems even with them. When I think about it there is yet another category to add to your list. I call them the "vagues". They pick this from one religion and that from another but basically don't take any of their "beliefs" too seriously. There's a lot of them.   Well it may be a bit off topic, but I think you might find the history of the Jesuit 'Reductions' in South America of interest. It is sometimes referred to by Latin Americans but rarely looked at in North America. These were 'colonies' of native people, centred on Paraguay but also in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, run by the Jesuit Order and independent of the colonial authorities. Their economy was basically communistic with a small sector involved in individual production. They raised their on militia which was usually used to fight off slaver parties from the Portuguese colony in Brazil, but were sometimes called on to fight in other campaigns.  The 'reductions' certainly shouldn't be idealized. They were totalitarian far beyond modern examples such as Nazism or Stalinism. Everyday life was drastically regimented. The very highest authorities were also, of course, members of the Jesuits, but other officials were freely chosen from amongst the local people. What can be said of the Jesuits ho ran them - they were *far and away* more committed to a voluntary poverty that equalized their conditions with those they ruled than any modern ruling class has been. It's amazing what the fear of God can do.  Have a look. Modern liberation theology is not a direct descendant, but these experiments have at least an indirect effect today.   Looks like this is going to be a bit of a contest. Mammal (me) versus reptile. As with many **dozens** of other posts the one above was lifted probably via a bot from r/worldanarchism without either permission nor proper attribution.    As has happened **many** dozens of times the post above was acquitted from r/worldanarchism **without either permission nor proper attribution**.   ONCE MORE - The post above is a bot acquired copy from one posted * 9 minutes before this* in r/worldanarchism. It is, as usual, like many *dozens* of other examples reposted with neither permission nor attribution.

The post above has been copied, as many others have been, from r/worldanarchism without proper attribution.   Maybe not from simple warnings, but there are other factors in play.   Its goal is to set a world's record every month.   The report is almost certainly true. The record says that totalitarian regimes often (though not always) attempt to cover up natural disasters. As for NK their policies have *never* worked, and I don't think their present failure is any more dramatic than at any other time.   OK, this has gone beyond ridiculous. There are no less than **nine** items posted on this single page which were originally posted at r/worldanarchism. They have been reposted here **word for word** except for the attribution to r/worldanarchism. It seems you have a bot that scans that subreddit and reposts things here. The time between the original posting has varied from a high of 1:49 hours to a low of **21 seconds**. Over the past months this has happened repeatedly, to the tune of **dozens** of items. I have already requested that you attribute your source if you wish to continue this practice, but there was no response on your part.  Now...you are totally free to do this with others items that I may post in different subreddits. In such cases I don't give a shit. The r/worldanarchism subreddit, however, is one that I wish to promote, and I do not appreciate what you are doing. I have little doubt that my case isn't the only one in which you engage in this behavior.  So... when I return to this tomorrow I hope to see that you have properly added your source in all nine posts that are presently visible on this page. You can leave the dozens of others alone. I would also hope that you will not behave in this way in the future.     I have no idea why this, of all items, should be downvoted. It seems to me that 'Breaking the Silence' is a quite credible and admirable organization. The report stays on basic humanitarian territory, and I find it hard to imagine how anyone except a true believer in the eternal rightness of the Israeli government could object to it.   Actually the title of the article is misleading (but who am I to correct 'Nature' magazine). I was pretty nonplussed myself when I first saw it. The trick is that the treatment isn't really a vaccine at all. Mycobacterial preparations are non-specific immuno-stimulants. One of the earliest to be developed was BCG (Calmette-Guerin bacterium - an attenuated organism used in TB vaccines). There are numerous others, and some are in use for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.  The idea is that non-specific immune stimulation makes the organism less susceptible to inflammation  provoked by stress such as ptsd. Here's where the mystery comes for me. This increased potency must be directed at either aborting a response to pro-inflammatory molecules or in preventing the production of said molecules. I am puzzled by the 'hows' of this. I suspect the microbiome is somehow involved.   One problem I notice that the article doesn't discuss is the likelihood of colonization of Nicaragua's rivers and lakes by invasive species. This is not so much invasion from the oceans as species that travel along with the ships.    Thanks. I'll try to have a look at that.   Well I'll be damned. Thanks.   Thanks. I wasn't aware of that review. How far did it progress ?   That's a thought.   Actually he was a quite efficient bank robber. As to some other matters in his early career you wouldn't be aware of the debate about whether he was an Okhrana (Tsarist secret police) agent or not unless you were a student of Russian history. My opinion, for what it is worth, is "no", but I believe he did betray political rivals, both outside the Bolsheviks and inside, to the police for his own benefit. It's just an opinion, not a demonstrated fact.   Nope. It clicks through quite easily. There's something strange happening in the background here as per both your complaint and a strange notification from a bot.   Who was the other guy ? It skips my mind for the moment. Now I remember - Harpo, my favourite. This little exchange has the potential to equal the nonsense I see over at many 'anarchist' boards on Reddit. I **DON'T** include you in my 'silly list'. It is always good to be reminded that all the idiots and fools are not necessarily 'on my side'.   I guess so, but I am in a different position than you, being as I am much older and our social circles are probably totally different. Enough time on the internet has taught me the vague way that 'fedora' is used as an insult. The problem is that I rarely meet someone dressed up in such an uniform. As to 'Mountain Dew' I am totally at sea with that. Is this some sort of fad or is it yet another insult that is theoretically directed towards environmentalists.    You are living in a dream world. Nobody is pushing *anything* "down your throat" by voicing an opinion different from yours.    I guess I'm safe on at least some of this matter because I am personally not a believer in nor an 'advocate' of *revolution*. So that particular question is outside my own field of 'worry'. The point I was trying to make is that the date of the source you cited (1898) was a mere three years after the founding of the French CGT. Whatever one may say about anarchosyndicalism, pro or con, it has to be admitted that it was **THE** most popular and effective attempt at bringing the vague and often highly rhetorical ideas of anarchism into the world of actual effective action.   Many anarchists argued against it or, like Malatesta, pointed out its limitations. As for M. it should be noted that in his final years he was perhaps just as much a gradualist as I am, and he certainly had abandoned the myth of the 'anarchist revolution'. To my mind anarchism is not like paleontology. Its history has to be useful rather than 'stamp collecting', and I think the debates at the turn of the 20th century have a lot to teach us today. It is indeed possible that Nettlau, as a very skilled historian, has a lot to say about the so-called 'revolution, and I am very happy to read the links you provided.  As for my own 'position' when pressed I call myself a 'mutualist', but that's only *when pressed*. I certainly don't agree with a lot of American mutualism. An example would be that I don't think the 'labor theory of value' is either true or useful. Neither do I think that the 'market' is anywhere near as magical as they do. My own mutualism harks back to the original French version with its emphasis on cooperatives, its gradualist approach and, yes, its belief in the efficacy of industrial combination ie syndicalism. This doesn't mean neglecting the communitarian aspects of anarchism, merely putting them in their proper place. That 'place' can't be determined by theory but only by practice.  Perhaps we agree on more than we can imagine though it seems that I am more "anti-revolution" than you. In any case I am in full battle mode now with a strange collection of 'Canadian internet conservative warriors' so I have to get back to that. Strange stuff. They sort of remind me of the cult that runs r/metanarchism. Change the names of the demons and you couldn't tell the difference, aside from the fact that there have been no threats yet. I'm sure it's coming.   I don't think here. I've met the CPC internet brigade before, and they are usually a cut above what I see happening here. I like the free advertising by the way.   Actually not. There are Marxists and there are Marxists, but I can't say that I resemble any of their schools. I'm afraid I don't feel up to trying (desperately) to educate you on all the various points of Marxism with which I disagree pretty well down the line. There are online resources where you can educate yourself, though I doubt you'll take the opportunity.   " Please remember, do not drink and text" - This has been a public service message from MADE, Mothers Against Drunk Email.    That is one strange bot.   The (mis)use is similar. Even though right wing forces often use 'junk science' or simply ignore science I don't think it has reached the level of Stalin's USSR. Yet...   "Trotskiest goose steppers" ?? That's a new one on me. I love replies like this. Whatever I may or may not know about science, even though I am not a "Trotskiest" I know something about the English language. The proper spelling would be "Trotsky*ist*". If you were one of their Stalin*ist* enemies it would be "Trotsky*ite*. As to the "goose-step" part personally I favor the "Bluebird Boogie", but to each their own. If I were doomed to "goose-step" I'd demand it be a "Canada goose-step".    Yes, I mentioned Nemesis in reply to another commentator. From what I remember the 'Nemesis Hypothesis' says that said 'intruder' returns at regular intervals. That being said the two theories are similar.   I'm not that familiar with her, but what I do know says that she is quite the reliable mouthpiece.   People have been working on it for some time, and here's an interesting fact. It's well known that the Canadian federal government has literally thousands of people employed to keep tabs on social media. Guess where these supposed 'ordinary citizens' defend their employer's plans.   It sort of reminds me of the 'Nemesis' hypothesis.   The term used in science literature is 'translational'. It is somewhere between basic and applied research. Many great programs are not readying research for the market but rather for other social needs.   Philae sends a high five from way out there.   Sounds like you're already very much on the trail of my impression. Once more I merely skimmed your last reference, but it seems to me that Nettlau was very pessimistic about the future of anarchism in the article you cited. I can see the guy's point. What I will say, however, is that the author wrote his essay at *precisely* the time that anarchosyndicalism was being formalized in France, giving a clear and definite alternative to the loony-bin politics of 'propaganda by the deed' which had poisoned anarchism for almost two decades.  Once more it's on the reading list.   I had never heard of him before today so I went and looked him up. It seems that he is mostly active in terms of campaigning against intellectual property. That's fine and good, and I'd probably agree with most of his points. What I *didn't* find, however, was any indication of his views being connected to socialism of any sort nor any indication that whatever money he has collected has gone towards the building of any political network even in terms of his own concerns. Perhaps you can enlighten me as to his relevance to the subject at hand.   The reconstruction of dinosaur biophysics is a great field. I'm sorry that I haven't been following it as well as it deserves.   Though mercifully less so than the USA. At least in Canada it is pretty well 'snuck in' rather than loudly trumpeted as in the USA.   Indeed, and perhaps there are research proposals contained in your question.    It's a big step from bacteria to mammals. Myself, I don't know.   it seems to me that any such choice would be totally subjective, but I can see what you mean. Without a visible set point longitude is totally meaningless. Basically I don't know how.   Actually I realized that after I wrote the comment above, and it's true. If say I'd like the money to spend every last day of the rest of my life pissed to the gills until I finally expire with cirrhosis of the liver I wouldn't get very far with a kickstarter that told the truth. If, however, I were to raise money to supposedly feed hungry children I could merrily use all that money for alcohol (or, as actually happens, printing Bibles and demanding the kids recite verses before they got their soup).  So, true, point granted.  I do, however, stand by the statement that there is *no* 'after the day' plan to do anything when the 100% predictable loss happens. There is a big difference between throwing money at TV ads and actually having a remainder of active social democrat *activists* who will be about their business the Monday after the Friday Convention where Sanders will go over and shake Clinton's paw. Hopefully they won't hug and cheek kiss. As to the 'staying power' of whatever propaganda the Sanders campaign may kick out consider the following. How many of the tens of thousands of ads that a person is exposed to in the course of a year can be remembered a year afterwards ?  Please understand that despite my own anarchist viewpoint I don't have any great animosity towards social democrats. I'd like to see more of them. But... I also know one hell of a lot more about how such parties operate, having once been a member myself many decades ago. At some point I'd like there to be a viable social democratic party in the USA that was worth talking to, influencing and/or negotiating with in a truly cynical mindset/manner. The circus of a Presidential campaign with no planned follow-up does nothing to build such a party.   Think about the "wider narrative strategy" that you mention. Where on God's green Earth is it being hidden ? What might it be. After the inevitable happens and he loses the nomination what further plans have been are being or will be made to take advantage of the publicity generated ? I realize what might be done depends very much on how badly he loses, and I personally can't predict that.   That, I'm afraid is the eternal problem with populist campaigns, of *both* the left and right, in American politics. Organizational alternatives are *never* put forward beyond vague feel-good statements. Here are a few names: Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Ralph Nader and every single Green Party candidate ever nominated. They all shared the same defect as Sanders' does. After the defeat all the supporters wandered off and were never asked to do anything beyond send more money. That is what will happen here as well.  Will his candidacy "force Hillary to the left" ? On a few days it will seem so as Clinton makes left wing noises to certain audiences. But then she will travel on to make different noises to different audiences. I'm sure that Clinton is a shrewd enough politician to know better than to *ever* make a substantive proposal when fine sounding rhetoric will do.  As Sanders' campaign progresses keep track of the money it has raised. As the total gets larger and larger start thinking about what else could have been done with that money.        Perhaps they will. It depends. Total capitulation would involve ending the occupation for a vague promise of a space sometime in the future. Partial capitulation would be accepting an offered space that was unsuitable for one or many reasons. From what I read here the occupiers seem fully aware of the 'trap' that negotiating with social democrats (the new Madrid administration) can become.   This looks like an interesting book. Thanks for posting. I haven't had time to read it all, but a quick scan through reminds me every much of Rocker's [Nationalism and Culture](http://libcom.org/library/nationalism-culture-rudolf-rocker). The date of publication of the latter was 1937. Nettlau's book dates from 1927. Seems Nettlau was perhaps an influence on Rocker.   Yes there are indeed problems with the Mondragon model, and their role as an employer which you point out is, in my opinion, the greatest one.   Thanks. The lists in that article are fascinating.   No, it's not frequent, but there have been other cases.   The point that struck me is that this is merely one of many such incidents.   That seems like a reasonable hypothesis to me.   Well, it's very much the same as a situation where you would want to stop a shipment of something from New York to Illinois. If you'd like to stop that you have opportunities at the borders of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. That's what they are doing. To get from point a to point f you have to pass through points b, c, d and e.  	199
 yay! :D   Zed pretty pleaseeeeeeeeeee? :D   As a Zed main FUCK 4.10 first the exhaust buff now botrk is fucking awful on him :(   It's best if you download more RAM first   A HOUR!?   Welcome to the big dick club.   Just download more RAM, np.   i would love the cursor to be a cross hair like attack click, just let us choose from a selection of cursors rito   FUCK.   I wish i was as cool as you :/   just the new one is plugged into my motherboard, the other 2 are hooked up to my PSU   I recently bought a new 140mm fan for my PC to replace the old noisey one. The one i removed was one that simply connects to my PSU, the one i installed has a 4 pin pwm connector that i plugged into my motherboard.  Installation was simple enough, booted up my pc and the fan i had just install was spinning pretty slow. So i opened my PC up again, unplugged it, vacantly gawped at it and as im not a hardware kinda guy just plugged it back in assuming it was just some weird one off issue.  and BOOM the new fan started running much faster, was definately shifting some air about, however now a different fan, an old 120mm fan was now rotating much slower when before it would move some serious air just fine.  So what's the issue here because ive searched online and found nothing, is it a problem with my PSU??   Thank you, kind sir :)   ive never understood it :( ELI5?   Azoh the legendary Zed main said he really liked my name and wished he had it (A to Zed) made me all warm and fuzzy inside.   just look at the public chat rooms on the clients, there are thousands of people advertising elo boosting :/   I THINK EVERYONE IN ALLIANCE AND DIGNITAS IS REALLY AWESOME AND COOL   I can picture every person ive ever met smiling, Even if ive only met them briefly or have never seen them smile.   I'm worried for my baby :(   I played all the champs and settled with Zed.   ok, thank you :)     	22
 The paint likely wears off.   Booked like the rest of you but will certainly give it a shot.       They can add it to my list.   Cool, thanks for the pointer      I wouldn't call it an egg. I'd call it a run of the mill, porous sedimentary rock that is easily stained by iron from other rocks (and yes, possibly rust/iron/impurities in the water). But it's likely not coming from the inside of the rock. And again, it's not an egg.   I got mine at Cabella's--they are for fishermen and yes indeed, these are certainly something you want to try on before you buy. They're not cheap but they'll last a lifetime.    The handiwork of iron...         Cherokee National Forest area is a great place for finding things. Sometimes you can get permission from local land owners (pay them $20) to let you roam their lands. People have huge parcels out that direction and always need some cash. I bring the dog and off I go.   Glad to upload some when I'm home again in a week or so :)   I realized as soon as I hit enter that yes, of course it's metal...ha. Not plastic, not glass (certainly)...   Cool find--the antiques sub has a lot of specialists in certain areas, that might be a good place to ask. Is the lid metal or what tripped your detector? Not the glass itself, right?            *rubs hands* -- thanks for this...will explore this evening      I marvel at your incredible fortune at finding this bag... Can you provide some closer shots of glass vial stones. Not sure they are diamond but would like to see closer. Where were these collected? You probably have no idea/backstory, do you?   My bucket list just got a little heavier...   North Carolina is known for its precious stones. Emeralds in particular. Also an abundance (relatively, of course) of garnet (almandine for the most part); Hiddenite (only found here); ruby/sapphire (lots but not a lot gem quality). My favorite finds in NC are amazing quartzes, some of which are clear as glass and as large as my hand. Most of these found in Western NC.    Or resin...quite honestly in the right casing, it looks like stone. Can you scratch it off with a needle?      That's what a call a flower vase with a backstory ;)   I live nowhere near WA but just spent a solid 30 minutes learning...very informative site. I wish all states would have such a by mineral/by location resource.   So what are they then? Can you share once you've paid your people off so people can learn? That's why a lot of us are part of a sub like this, after all.   Thane of Cawdor!      Well, that was a very pleasant virtual walk in the morning. Lovely.   Ah--you answered my other questions in one neat sentence there--who is it aimed at. Do you have a site with more details?   What kind of performance drag is expected for the complex simulations?   Ah...fond memories of playing CyberMorph just came flooding back. With awful memories of the dentist. I am conflicted.   This would be the equivalent of collecting everyone's used (loser) scratch-off lottery tickets in a pile and double-checking them to see if there are any people who decided going back to the store for their $2 winning wasn't worth the effort.    I am waiting for someone to say "slag" ...   Any and all tourmalines, hands down   It looks like a tiny leg, doesn't it? Nice piece--these are best cleaned up with a stiff toothbrush and warm soapy water. You can "file" them down a bit this way as well and expose more of the crinoid--I have many of these from the great lakes region.      Is it magnetic? Also, photo is not good quality but does it look glassy? Cleavage "swirly" or angular?   Oddly enough, over by the airport there are some construction sites that are abandoned. I found some great barites, geodes and other great stuff similar to this. I was just there for a work trip but rockhounding me--had my ride leave me off to go search through the dirt first.   What a great little piece of land they have. Unfortunately the larger photos of their recent finds aren't showing. Beautiful piece though!   These look a lot like those that can be found in abundance around Boulder (aptly named) Colorado and the surrounding area. Cool!         Would be helpful to know where they were found for the fossil one at the bottom...these look similar to some small marine specimens that are common in the Great Lakes region.            Thanks! Is there a certain curvature or other feature to keep an eye out for? I am nowhere near Utah but I will be near other places smaller ones will be found. Your insights very valuable, thanks!   Incredible finds! How did you ID them at first (were they partially exposed, etc.?)         Need some size reference for one thing...        	56

 My deepest, sincerest condolences.   I hope you can see the experience as a gift.  I truly, truly do. I think it was a gift bestowed on Diane, because she's way more deserving of it than me. I'm very thankful for every single moment she spent in my life.    Thank you very much.    Thank you, sincerely. I feel like sharing it lifts a small portion of the burden off of me. Sometimes I feel guilty that I was given an opportunity that people more deserving than me long for.   I can only guess that it was either: actually a blessing bestowed on Diane (as she deserved a granted wish more than anyone I know), or that I *needed* an experience like that more than most, due to my own spiritual weakness.   Thank you. I think I will. Eventually.    Thank you for your kind words. I'm grateful that my experience can be meaningful to others.    	5
 Dabbbbbbbbbed   Hell yeah I will! I need a large cover up here soon, will stop in on a day off!    Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon.   Love from Toledo   Cheers from Sylvania!   Having an alcoholic father and being an alcoholic myself, please do not stop this journey. I found my father for dead after a long day of us both binge drinking (not together) and was so messed up I couldn't save him myself. I hope the best for you and your journey. I wish my father could watch me go through mine.    Wait- do you have an extra tooth?    Gummo!!!!! Wtffff    TaTU   Danielle? Doug? Greg?    The pimple does not do the mustache any justice...   I love you sir.    Handsome!    A dream of mine.    Confradulations Johnathan! You are an amazing being. Keep up the good work and always remember there are people out there you don't even know who admire you!!    /r/popping plz we would love this there    She had her "Dead girls Don't cry" tattoo then and a few others, smaller breasts, added a lot when she got into the film industry. I'm from Toledo so it was an easy drive.    She's one of my favorites. When she used to strip in Dayton friends and I would go see her.    The only porn star that has absolutely flawless skin is Bonnie Rotten. Plus she's stunning without makeup which is hard to find these days in the adult film industry.    My eyes   You poor thing.    First off I agree with the people that are saying it's the eyebrows. That's a big part of it. Also, the woman is AGING. We all get older and all age differently. She hasn't been using fillers either...leave the woman alone. We have other issues in the world to worry about other than her appearance. Priorities people.    Damn Catholics.   You are beautiful!   As a graphic design artist you can clearly tell this is photoshopped. Better luck next time!    Ypuuuu first set are gorgeous.   This melts my heart.  	26
 Thanks. It's always nice to hear how anything i've written affects someone else so this was good to read. Thanks =]   Northern Lights by Philip Pullman, that one?   Don't have any examples I could see do you?   Thanks =]   Things didn't turn out as planned.  That's an understatement.  It makes me feel sick to the stomach,  and I can only just see it from your point.  But see it from mine!  If you were in love with someone else  You wouldn't give me a second though,  Wouldn't think to care how I feel...  But it was me you loved, me  You left someone else for.  I could call you a fool,  Say it was your fault,  That you shoulder the blame.  *  But Ive always been a realist:  This is my burden, and my fault.  Fuck the lessons, we dont want to be kids anymore.  But thats out of our hands, and so that's what we are: kids.  Prone to mistakes, slaves to feelings.  Greedy, malicious.    I should have seen this from the beginning.  Should have known how it would turn out.  Should have predicted the tears.  But I couldn't care for your heart,  because I don't have mine:  When you're in love that's what you give away.  *  I won't make excuses, you deserve more than my childish  cowardice,  Trying to worm my way out of it, with no where to run.  I told you what I was like, you chose not to believe me.  Unintentionally I taught you the hard way what I was truly like.  And now I've lost myself trying to see myself for what I truly am.  Nothing, nothing.  That's what you would have seen me as.  *  I meant every kiss  if it's any condolence,  If you can believe, for even a second, anything that comes from  my mouth,  Kiss or words. But I'll leave it up to you to decipher true from  false.  Though I deserve nothing but your hatred.  And if it means anything, yes, shivers swept down my spine the  first time we kissed,  And I enjoyed the moments that we shared.  But I couldn't keep it up,  Because somehow she got back into my head,  into my heart.  And I want you to know if I could have chosen,   I would have thought things through, and, for now, I would have  picked you.  *  I want to end this poem saying  I'm in love,  but not with you.  And it doesnt matter, as hard as you wish,  It's not you, and it never was.  I always loved her, I always will.  Neither of us will get what we want,   thats the way it's going to be.

But I feel it would benefit from punctuation. That is really my own opinion, and discard if you wish. But for me the poem is slow, it's thought out, and it reads meticulously, it rewards the slow reader. But without punctuation there's no pace, or style, it's just one solid read through. No chance to break, and consider, or think about what's been wrote.  Just my two cents.   Really love this poem - as does everyone else.  My only issue is the second line of the fourth stanza, 'I already care' doesn't feel smooth. And the rest of the poem is super smooth, it reads really nice. All except that one line, which feels a bit hemmed in.   Interesting start to the poem. I love it! :D  Feedback: I get that you're repeating yourself, reinforcing that the recipient is a 'cunt'. But the repetitions doesn't read well with only a comma. Try placing a full stop there. It rounds off the first 'cunt', and reads easier for the second one. Equally keep the comma, and remove the second 'you're', but I think it reads better with a full stop, as it is.  Third line: That rhyme, it's distracting, because it's the first rhyme in the poem (pretty much the only one). It feels a touch forced, and very much out of place. I get what you're trying to say, and, this is my own personal input, I didn't like it, it felt wrong. Perhaps try rewording it, find another word for defeat?  Fourth line: Touch of interpretation here. Does the person come back shrouded in' love you never going to know?'. Or is it a separate line, a second taunt. Might need breaking up, or the meaning you want (conjoined, separate) made clearer. Love the line after that.  A lot of comma's in the sentence after that. Which reads fine, it's not a fast poem. It's mostly when it comes out of 'year' into 'sitting contempt'. The whole line might need tweaking, it reads fine without any comma's between weeks, months, year, but I see what you're going for with all of those comma's. Here's an idea, try separating the list with dashes;   and share in the revelry, but tonight - as in the past weeks, and months, and year - I sit in contempt of love lost...  Reads a touch smoother, but doesn't detract. Even if you don't take on board that idea, I think there's still something there that needs doing.  Great poem. Perfectly angsty, eye-catching beginning, and it doesn't wane for a second. Excellent final line, really homes in what the entire poem is about, and makes it count; a perfect ending.   I always purchase faster than I read. I have a back-log of about 15 books.  How did you find: John dies at the end? Paper Towns? And, The Maze Runner?  Those are the only ones I've read.   A poem about night terrors? Most awesome! Wonderfully captured, I might add.   Start: amazing, the alliteration really draws you in, rolls off the tongue, easy to read. Perfect. (Missed capital on 'Your').   Not sure what that dash is for between 'you are sure - has been bestowed'. I found it kinda distracting. It reads fine without it, and I don't feel the need for it in the least.   That first sentence, second stanza, is pretty long, a real mouthful. Perhaps put a full-stop after 'bestowed' and remove the 'as'.  has been bestowed. You resiliently calculate the servitude of the coming episode.  Works really with the 2nd person theme, as well.  At the end of the second stanza you switch from past to present tense in the last section;  where an ugly face it showed, an even uglier grin it bares.   This is fine if you want to say that in the nightmare it showed an ugly face, but awake an 'uglier grin it bares'. However as it reads it feels like the same, descriptive sentence, that switches tense.  Air capture? Interesting phrase. Respiration, perhaps?   This section: *'each of your ex and inhales'*. I read 'ex' as something different, and got confused, I had to go back and then I realised you meant exhale and inhale. Easy solution, bring them together: *'ex-and-inhales'*. Makes it read faster too, which keeps up the pace, and makes it more obvious that floaty 'ex' is joined.  Third stanza: you've got a comma, a single word, and a semi-colon and I can't quite get my head around you want it to be read. The comma speeds up the pace, it could easily be a full-stop but isn't, so; read faster. But the semi-colon immediately slows it right down. Read through that sentence, get a feel for the pace, and what each punctuation does to the line, and reel it in.   I would recommend a full stop between 'each thumb' and 'as the fear sets in'. It rounds out that last sentence, makes the 'knows it's nearly won' much more significant as it stands on it's own. It's also a long sentence that would benefit from the break.   Fourth stanza. It wasn't until this point I realised it was about night terrors. Which is nice, because the first portion is entirely me wondering what is happening, and then suddenly realising. The poem is *absolutely* fine as it is, but consider what it would do to the poem if you made it more obvious what it was about from the get-go.  Your third sentence reads like running water *and then* you hit that darned semi-colon before vile. You don't need it, it reads fine without it, it reads better, in fact. It really just brings this whole, wonderful beat you've got going in that sentence to a jarring halt, when it could continue until the sentence ends. Without that semi-colon, that is my favourite sentence in the whole poem.   Excellent, spine-chilling end to the poem, the rest is perfect.  You know I really liked this piece, it's actually superbly well written, and you've such a finger on the pace, it's controlled ever so tightly, you just let it slip sometimes. The word choice is great, I love it.   (It's possible you didn't intend it to be about night terrors, that's just my interpretation. You can correct me if I'm wrong. The critique stands, except that one bit about introducing the night-terrors sooner, it's all good)   Hello. My feeling is that you wanted *judging* to stand out more on it's own, so consider putting a full-stop after expressionless. It breaks judging off, and brings it more into it's own which I think is what you're heading for. It reads the same, just with a bigger pause.  I just want to bring attention to these two lines:  Swallowed by the sea of masqurade masks,  But yours broke long ago.   The first sentence is alliterative in two cases (swallow, sea. Masquerade, masks). And the sentence is smooth, and flows. But then it completely changes pace when you get to the next sentence and suddenly *'but'*. I think with the alliteration you can get away with the hard sylablles, (especially the 'sk' on 'mask'), but that is ruined with the, short, heavy 'but'. Perhaps change it to 'though';  though yours broke long ago.  Reads a bit smoother, coming from the alliterative previous sentence. I understand 'though' might change the story a tad - though the meaning is just as implicit. So if you don't go with 'though' I do recommend tweaking it a touch to something that leads off of the first sentence a bit smoother.  The rest of the poem is pretty darn great. I would say *perhaps* a semi-colon after 'smoulder', but I'm not sure if I'm reading that right, so it's entirely up to you.  Rest is awesome :)  P.S misspelled masquerade as masqurade (I'm sure it's just a typo, though).   That's an impressive list.    Yeah, I really liked this. Read it a few times and I like the story, it's different and unique and well written.  Not sure if it's a reddit thing but having it written like this it messes with the rhymes, which is fine - the rhymes come through - but it messes with the beat of the piece as well. Which, for a rhyming poem, you don't want. So consider playing around with the structure, seeing what works, what you like, and what suits the beat and those rhymes best.  Also, that comma after the semi-colon on the first line:   No reason is there to fear, What we see and what we hear.  It works better without the comma. But then you've capitalised the W in what, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say.   Otherwise, excellent =]    Interesting request for feedback. What kind of feedback were you looking for?   Oh yeah, other than the half of the book that wasn't. That was 20 pages worth of album reviews and in-depth looks at what everyone is wearing and everything about it.  I get the point, I really do, move on, Bateman.  Other than that, an excellent book.   The first two were incredible. Best fantasy books I've read. But TSRoST is nothing like either of them. I don't know though, you might like it.    I didn't read the short story. Just picked up the novel, and really didn't like it. It felt like so much happened, that didn't need to happen, it could have been half the length and at the same level of quality as it was.   You're halfway there.   NotW and Way of Shadows are two of the best fantasy series going. Good choices.  Ready Player One any good?   Already seen the film, really enjoyed it. I did want to read it first but it just appeared on Netflix and, well.... I really enjoyed the film however. But want to read the book because it's meant to be excellent.   Yeah, that's pretty darn awesome.   I really didn't like it. I have heard that mostly every one did, and I really wanted to like it, but ultimately didn't enjoy it. But that's just one guys opinion.    I like how you went on a little science spree there :).  How did you find The Picture of Dorian Gray?  And I don't think I've heard of Middlemarch...   You saying you liked Wool? Bleh, I hated it.   That makes sense. I don't think it was a bad assumption to say that it was a graphic novel, but fair enough, I was wrong.    Let me be the first to say: Ho-lee she'et.  I am impressed. Why the detail? It's good to know how long it took to read, but why the year it was published?  Ok, I'm super fucking impressed. You've put more work into this than I did on my University dissertation.   I've never had a problem with auto back-up. I trust it quite a lot actually. Sure, some files have crashed and I've lost some work, but never more than a paragraph or so.   I've been able to recover every file that was open without issue, really. Not the OO ever really crashes, just when my laptop does in general, taking OO with it.   Asimov's laws of robotics? Stated before the book? Is that an example...?   You can make money from Wordpress? How do?  I know this is super off-topic, but I had no idea, and would love to know.   Graphic novels? Awesome addition.  Haven't heard of the first two. And assume Fortress of Solitude is DC, also.  Interesting jump from DC to Faulkner, any good? Haven't heard of *all the kings men* sorry.   So the first three I *super* want to read. Haven't gotten round to it. And TFIOS was a decent read. You gave it a high score so I don't mind heartily recommending *Paper Towns*. Which was absolutely better than TFIOS.  However, if we're talking YA I have to have to have to recommend *The Virgin Suicides, by Eugenides*. It is the paragon of its genre, one of the best books I have ever read.   Aaww ah, man. Back in the day Runescape was *the shit*. I think I've played that game more than any other game - count it in months not hours or days.  If you liked Skyrim - you'll like The Witcher. Shadow of Mordor was a brilliant game, but not absolutely similar to other open-world-high-fantasy-rpg's like Skyrim or Dragon Age.   If you want to start on *decent* fantasy - you can't do better than The Witcher. In fact you've played Skyrim, easily 2nd best. Now all you need to play is Fable Anniversary and you've hit the trifecta. (Though DA1 is always worth a play through).   If you haven't played a lot of MMORPG's, you might like TESO, I don't know. It depends what else you've played. If you haven't a lot of MMO's - like I have - you might really like it. When you play almost all of them, they all bleed into one. I'm just waiting for the next big one that *does something different!*  Being objective there was nothing particularly wrong with TESO. It ticked the right boxes, and it was a really nice feeling to be back in Morrowind.* Just that it was generic and samey as every other one. TLOTRO and WoW included. Atlantica had a different feel to it, and different combat. FLYFF is one of the most gorgeous MMO's out there, and the aesthetic makes it feel vibrant enough you can slightly overlook that it the gameplay is the same as every other game. Aion does a lot of things well, but at it's core is the same as every other MMO. The only two I haven't played but really want to is Wildstar, but, above all, Guild Wars 2. But I ain't paying for that when I expect I won't like it.  *Morrowind is the third installment into the TES game, and is better than Oblivion, and only marginally not-as-good as Skyrim. It's starting to show it's age (has done for years) but it's one of the most vibrant and alive worlds for a game you can imagine. It's TES so the story is good, and it plays the same as Skyrim, but without the dragons. To offset the dragons the explorability of Morrowind is top-notch. This is mostly helped by the fact it isn't based on medieval England, which most every fantasy game is (and even The Witcher is guilty of). Honestly if you want a superb fantasy game outside of the limits of medieval-england-fantasy, look no farther than Morrowind.   P.S This whole message is based on *fantasy* RPG's. Sci-fi, and otherkinds, aren't so much my expertise.   I've just never been the best. I've never really been good at anything so I struggle with that. I'd like to be that person, I would, to laugh and joke off my inabilities, but I'd struggle to do it. I'd just hate myself for being not-as-good, or not-at-all-good. And wish I could be better. Putting in the effort and getting nothing back...that's a hard pill to swallow.    Phahahaha. I'm sorry - wait let me laugh some more.  Ok.  You honestly want to compare that generic, tripe, pieceofshit "game", that really is just fodder for your HDD to waste. To what is, hands down, one of *the best* **games**, *not just open-world, or rpg,* **game**.  Get. The. Witcher.  Also, don't consider TESO. Really not a good MMORPG. The best MMORPG I've ever played (and I've played pretty much every one) is Atlantica. Also FLYFF.  Aion is a good shout, but there isn't much too it to separate it. Same for Rift. Wildstar looks like it might be good (one of the few I haven't played) and it's going f2p soon, so worth checking out once that happens.  Let me just enamour the Witcher 3 some more. Name an open-world game. It's better than it. Fantasy RPG's? It's the best. Over Dragon-Age and (dare I say it) Skyrim. You've been waiting for proof the new gen is worth investing in: VOILA!   Loki (Finished sci-fi, YA (fuck-knows) novel - 125,000k. Countless rejections.  New, untitled project - so far only 20k words but growing.  And then god knows how many short stories (very few finished) one of which is a decent 25k. And poems.   Are we talking Neopets as in...that bright website where you look after a Neopet, and battle it and minigames and such?  Because if we are, man I used to love the shit out of that game! Played it for years. It was the best. It quickly got pushed out by Runescape. That's how long ago this was. Over ten years haha. I thought Neopets was dead, tbh.   I would say Word but I'm poor so Open Office. Does the job. I've tried programs built specifically for writing and they're always a pain in the ass. So many things just get in the damn way. I'm sure I had one, and I couldn't start writing until I had written, a title, and chapter-title, and characters and all of this anal BS and I couldn't find how to (or it wouldn't let me) just write.  Nothing wrong with Word. Absolutely great. Does the job, does it simply, does it well.   Have to say that made me smile. Thanks :)   Neopet?   So I know sure if that's the right word for it. But I also feel quite inferior to people. Recently my friend got a 1st in his Uni degree. I only got a second. I hide behind this viciously by saying I never tried and put all the effort into my novel, instead. I put him down by saying "well I was smarter than you in High School" which I know damn well ain't true.  So like I said I don't know if it's an inferiority complex. But whenever I feel...inferior, I lash out like an asshole and try and put myself above him, if not about the same thing (say, academically) then about something else. And I don't like being an asshole.  And yes, it makes me super competitive, and sometimes a sore loser - but I know when I'm going to be beat, and I don't mind if I foresee it. Usually it makes me just not want to compete.  Inferiority complex? Or asshole-ism?     As it says: wtf is battle toads?   I've had mine going for 2 years this september. It's super interesting to look back and see what I've read. I have a .doc and also a goodreads account (for keeping track of the 52 books a year challenge).  Post yours, let's see 'em!  Here's mine for the year (also with the numbers since I started):  56. The Slow Regard of Silent Things  57. 1984  58. Holes  59. The Children Act  60. Fragile Things  61. Heart of Darkness  62. If I Stay  63. The Beating of His Wings  64. The Drowning of Arthur Braxton  65. American Psycho  66. The Scorch Trials  67. The Death Cure  68. Trigger Warning  69. Stoner  70. We Were Liars  71. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry  72. The Earthsea Quartet  73. Good Omens  74. Uglies  75. The Buried Giant  76. The Humans  77. The Cement Garden  78. Flowers for Algernon  79. Smoke and Mirrors     Dwarf Fortress is hella intimidating, I'm looking into it myself but it might prove too much.  Yeah, sorry about the minecraft thing. I think once it gets into it it will separate from MC quite drastically. By the looks of it it's much more of a "town-sim" to MC's "build-for-the-shits-and-giggles."   *Stoner, by John Williams*. One of the best books ever written. And the most in-depth look, the most human showcase in any book I've ever found. It essentially follows the life of one man, William Stoner, from birth to death. Truly an amazing book. But it does take place mostly early to mid 1900's, so it's not a contemporary setting, if that detracts anything for you.  I also recommend the hard-back edition with the grey cover. Not only does it look nicer, it's also the best binding *ever*. And how many books can claim that accolade?  Also, though to a lesser extend. *Humans, by Matt Haig*. It's about an alien who inhabits a human body and has to come to terms with what it means to be human. It's not a heavy book, and makes for a pretty light read. It has its moments, but it's not quite an in-depth look at the "human experience" as you might want.   Also a game in early access called StoneHearth (not Hearthstone) that sounds like it might tick all those boxes.   Support indie titles as much as AAA games. Whether on Steam, XBLA or PSN.    Oh yeah, I got that the day it came out. Did absolutely everything. Of course, on autodrive, I haven't forgotten a thing about that game. All the tricks =]   Fable TLC. I can do that whole game on autodrive. Never played a game so much. It still is absolutely excellent.   To put it bluntly: "Neil Gaiman is a God"   I like to think how hard I'm going to steal that name haha. :)  But also, yes. They would have been the best of friends. Aristotle and Confucius.    I didn't like AC1 to be honest. Far too repetitive. But AC2 was amazing. And I liked Brotherhood, and Revelations. Ac3 was a colossal disappointment, which I didn't even finish, because it wasted the first few hours of my gameplay as *not even the main character*. (It also skips over how hundreds of years of generations are Assassins but then suddenly, *templar!*,). Black Flag was simply great. And they really fucked up with Unity. Not just because it was shit, but because they took out the core mechanic that made Black Flag amazing.  But I am interested in the new one. I've been saying they should set one in London since AC2, so I'm pretty interested to play a title set in my own home. Having said that, will definitely be checking reviews before I get it.   Like they'd have to do anything to make it stand out. This is *Half Life 3* we're talking about.   Yeah, there's still just a lot to learn even to get it up and running. (That's why I like Unity - it does the hard stuff for you).   That is actually a super-duper-awesome name for a cat. I think Vinegar might even beat the philosophers...   I think there is definitely a market for that. Without a doubt. Can't be too hard to program either?   Yeah I'm really not that advanced. I can do basic Java. I haven't found the time to really put myself into learning C# (or enough Java to make a functioning game). So I joined a game as something I can do - write. Break(ing) into the industry one way or another :P   The good thing is we come up with the best names for out cats. When we got a new cat I wanted to call him Socrates, but my girlfriend didn't like it and called him Jaffa.   I'm mostly concentrating on C# because it's what Unity uses. But I know as well that if I can write C#, with a little application and some time it shouldn't be *too* big a leap to learn C++. That's a semi-educated presumption, I don't know how true it is. But I'm happy just being able to write for Unity.   I am taking your advice and taking my dog out for a walk :)   I've just never found Python to be of any use whatsoever. I didn't Java any more difficult to learn (and I learnt more of it), and it's more useful, more practical.   How's C++? I never made that jump.    I've looked into C# and it is true that once you can grasp one language (that isn't fucking Python) you can get your head around the others. Even knowing a touch of Java made some of C understandable.    The story is nothing like Portal. I can't say the game isn't similar, because, yeah, it was a huge inspiration on the design, but we have taken steps to differentiate, it's been a big part of both the story and game play to make it different. But a comparison to Portal is inevitable, which might not be a bad thing.   Good luck learning C++. I know basic Java, but struggled enough with that. I know how much of a pain any C language could be. And hey once you know it, you can make anything :)   The game is called Anomaly 1729. I think they're aiming for an October(? - Christ I should know this) release. The game was greenlit on steam so keep an eye out for it. The mechanics of the game and puzzle-design is, I think, genius.   This is true. Stop being lazy. People need to play your game.   I had a cat called Aristotle, who didn't come back one night. We lived next to a main road (doubly worried), so we had to go out round our neighbourhood, through this busy street packed with cars, stuck in congestion, watching us as we shouted *"Aristotle. Aristotle!*   My team greenlit the script for a game I'm working on, and it's being implemented into the game now. So I thought rather than work on my *other* game, I'd work on my novel for a while. Work on my own project. But damn...Sat at my desk on my laptop, I'm really struggling to find the energy to do just that :(  Please help me find the energy.   Put up where? Anywhere?   If the work was going I'd happily do it for free (for now). If I knew people who wanted a music video, I'd be all over it.  So, any advice on how to construct a portfolio from limited work?   Haven't really done any work. Most of it's all graduate stuff I did at University. I'm trying to build a portfolio. I'm looking for work, I really am, that's why I'm redoing my showreel. What do I do if I haven't done enough work to present even a semi-decent portfolio?   I wrote my whole novel this way. Just had loose ideas of where it was heading, but in general the entire novel happened organically.   It took me longer to write than it should have. I think that's how you pay. What took me the longest to write wasn't the writing, it was trying to figure out which direction to take it in.  My new novel I sat down, spent two months planning it out, making everything fit, so it worked and I had a decent plan I could follow. I haven't sunk my teeth into that project yet but now I know it won't take me as long. There are scenes that are harder to write, some I don't want to write. And that was true in my first novel, so I didn't write them, I put it off. Now I have a plan I know exactly what is going to happen in that scene, I've come to terms with it, so I can just get down to it.   I don't want to say planning is the best way to go until I've finished my current novel. But having worked on a novel that I wrote organically, I wouldn't support it wholeheartedly.    What do you think, having watched it, is most extraneous? Or least useful/strong?   Definitely useful. Appreciate it =]    You gotta sign up to see it? Did not know that :/ Thanks.   MMORPG  That is all.   So I'm trying to push to get some editing jobs and a decent showreel is really what's going to help there. Please give it a watch, and let me know what you think. It is on dropbox so the quality might be a bit meh, but it should be ok. If not, let me know I'll drop it on Vimeo.  [Editing Show Reel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ih4shqma75i8nzo/Editing%20Show%20Reel.mov?dl=0)   You ask this like there's some kind of trick, or magical secret anyone who's finished anything is keeping from you.  There is nothing. No trick. No secret. You don't need any tips. Just write.  That's what writing is. It's actually sitting your ass down and *doing something*.   What's wrong with pre-orders   Oh my god.  *Oh my god*  *OMAGOD*!  *AAAAHH!!!*  **ERMAGHERD!!**   Most important question of all: Do you have any job openings?   Pixar are champions for coming up with unique ideas and brilliant stories. How much time and effort do you put in the stories and scripts - long before production even starts - to make sure they are up to the quality of every film you make?   Actually over half-way through    When they're done swimming in the money from GTA5 like Scrooge McDuck. (AKA:Never)   Awesome name you have there ;)   I'm not. But my wallet is ;)   I don't really have an opportunity to 'show not tell' here. It's the first sentence of my novel. Not saying the advice is unappreciated, just that I don't quite understand how it applies. (which is a cry for help).   Having not seen his entire filmography I don't want to say his worst. But the best film of his that I've seen is "Inglorious Basterds"   No they left. They were for a good six hours though :'(.  Never considered doing yoga. Really not my thing. I'm really not into any form of exercise - but I'm trying. I'm gunna start exercising soon. Just not yoga.   I'm glad you found it funny.   Ah, there was some work I wanted to get done and they were too noisy, same with reading or anything really. I couldn't leave my room to eat, so I've starved all day. But they are working on the floor so it's fair enough I can't walk on it till it's done. So yeah, kinda annoying.   Hmm...Not sure what an English counterpart would be. Let me google...  ...  They look mostly like potato croquettes, but I don't think they are anything like that. (P.S potato croquettes aren't even half as posh as they sound. It's just the English language being all faux posh again).   I don't know what those are   Fries. What you call chips we call crisps. So when I say all I like is chips, I mean fries. Particularly McDonalds.   Just to make sure we're on the same page. Are you American? Because if you are then we're talking about completely different kinds of chips. Me being British and all. If you're not then we are on the same page, and I apologise. Just making sure =]   Acting is not the word I would use. Butchering. Profusely. That's how I would describe it.   No. I really don't. It makes for difficult eating. Mostly meat and chips =]   I seem to have stumbled into a hole in the theatrical market...   Vegetables.   A one-man performance of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar would be sure to confuse them.   Just youtube them and make your way down the list. Listen to a playlist or mix. They are excellent.   I don't see how that would help...   Not convinced I'm too keen on that whole yoga thing. But the talky thing, yeah =]   You've never heard of The Arctic Monkeys?   As you do...   But then I'm locked out my *entire house* :(   I am. Currently jamming to The Arctic Monkeys.   The floor is being laid out in the hall, so unfortunately I can't really leave my room. Help me stave off this hella boredom.   [The Cat Empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM_rIaUm7ac)  Shuck yeah!   What do you mean "going"?

He got her face down on the ground like cops are supposed to do when detaining people who are unruly or who won't follow instructions.             PLEASE HELP! That (now viral) video of the officer in McKinney subduing a girl in a bathing suit was in OUR neighborhood. The situation was NOT what is being reported    A DJ setup in a public space next to the private pool in our neighborhood on Friday and played loud explicit (F-bomb) music for multiple hours (it is unclear if he was invited by a resident as no one has claimed responsibility). The teenagers (both black and white) were being brought into our neighborhood by the carload because the DJ was tweeting out invites to a pool party for $15 (obviously unauthorized by our neighborhood). The teens began fighting with each other and pushing their way into our private pool. Some were jumping our fence. The security guard was accosted when he tried to stop the beginnings of this mob scene. Some residents who live around the park/pool area tried to come out and settle things down. The teens started yelling racial slurs at our neighbors and started assaulting people and property (throwing bottles at cars and attacking a mother at the pool with 3 young children). The first officer on the scene was by himself. At that time, the party had grown to a large, aggressive crowd. As the officer arrived, many teens started running through our neighborhood. Many of the teens were being very aggressive and yelling at the officers as more arrived.    This was a very dangerous situation for the officers AND the teens/residents not involved. The news media has refused to hear the neighborhoods side of this story. The video being distributed is only a very small segment of what happened. This information being distributed by the media and others is extremely distorted and in some cases outright lies.    PLEASE HELP US STOP THE BROADCASTING OF THIS IGNORANCE. The media is trying to make it look like our neighborhood is a whites only, racist area. Anyone who has spent even a few minutes in our area knows this is an outright LIE.  That is the account of a McKinney, Texas local.  http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/06/heres-the-rest-of-the-story-behind-the-police-abuse-at-the-austin-pool-party/  Edit: For those complaining about my source, here is the same info from NPR.  http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412889290/texas-pool-party-update-teens-and-residents-speak-out  The person who wrote what I posted here is a resident of the pool's community and they sent this out to media outlets. The man even provides his name but I won't post that since it's personal information.    most  So some did not and the cops were called because they were trespassing.              "Tresspasser" is just a codeword for a black person amongst inhospitable white folk.  No, it's code for people that trespassed by accosting the pool security guard and climbing over fences to get into the pool when the rules of the pool state that you're only allowed to bring in two other friends with you to the pool. Random people showed up to this pool after some DJ tweeted about it and they didn't have a right to be there. The residents heard all of the loud noise coming from the hip hop music that was blaring, saw all of these people that clearly weren't residents of that community flooding towards the pool, saw altercations and fighting going on and then called the cops. They were trespassing.   most of whom clearly lived there  You just supported my point for me. Not all of them were welcome there. Most might have been. Some were not and the cops were called because they were trespassing.    their parents' HOA dues pay for  Some of them weren't from that community and neither were their parents so I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe try facts when you make points.    And as for the non-residents, black residents are entitled to have guests just like everyone else.  Yeah, only when they follow the rules which they didn't. Some were trespassing and those who weren't brought more than two friends to the pool which is against the pool rules.      but why did he feel the need to pull his gun out?  [Because he thought that someone there had a gun and was about to pull it out on him.](https://imgur.com/a/hDZ0N)    He committed a crime so he ended up in jail like he should have. He stole something and was jailed for it. The issue in his case was that he stayed in jail too long without a trial, not that he went to jail.     So it's the children's fault  Yup, they were the ones trespassing and who were asked to leave by both the community residents and the cops and failed to do either.    Rapinoe is really good.

Lena Dunham sexually molested, groped, and masturbated next to her sleeping sister yet the media have little to say about her being a disgusting sexual abuser. I hate Sarah Palin and think she's a moron but I wonder why the media was largely silent on Dunham's disgusting transgressions that she spoke about without coercion while being all over The Duggars.   http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/sarah-palin-lena-dunham-pedophile-josh-duggar  http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/lena-dunham-describes-sexually-abusing-her-toddler-sister   Sarah Palin called out the mainstream media double standard of going after them while giving their feminist golden child Lena Dunham a pass for sexually molesting her little sister for years. I think Palin is a retard but she does have a point and anyone who pays attention to the media knows that they have a liberal bias.  http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/sarah-palin-lena-dunham-pedophile-josh-duggar       Ronaldo had a birthday party organised after the Atletico match and of course he didn't know we'd get hammered.

 Where did you get all your star wars knowledge from? did you build it up over time? From where?   What IS canon?   Because of the force awakens right?   Thanks, do you have a link to where I can buy it?   I need to expand my knowledge of the SW universe, what are some good books, websites, tv shows etc that can help with this? I want to know more about the whole world including people, events, planets etc. Thank you very much!  Also, just a side question, what do we know so far about Episode 7's villain Kylo Ren? What is his place in the universe?   NSFW just in case.      Somebody needs to edit it onto the Batman v Superman trailer   I forget the name but there is one about the making of Apocalypse Now. Heart of Darkness I think it's called, it's about how much of a fucking nightmare the production of the film was.  Also, there's another one about film vs.digital cameras, the evolution of them both, which is better and why and where they are both going as in the future. It's called by Side by Side.   Fallout: Mad Max  Not that that's a bad thing...   Where is a good place on the net to start learning about the basics? Things like the different types of cameras, lenses, cameras in general and just the technical part of cinematographer, if someone could link me to a website, video etc that covers the basics of these topics, I would much appreciate it!  Also, does anyone know of any REALLY good books/essays on cinematography that would help a beginner like me?  And finally, does anyone know of any cinematography analysis videos/ essays? Anything that analyzes famous scenes or shots from films, or just analyzing someones work in general.  Thanks in advance!!    Where is a good place on the net to start learning about the basics?

That means every DC movie up until then will have IMAX scenes.   Murph   I am no pleb, I am a disciple of /r/moviescirclejerk   Thanks   He had a small role in Lincoln (2012). He was pretty good in that, but Daniel Day Lewis devours the screen.   What does that stand for?   American Beauty and Fight Club made me have a completely different outlook on life. After watching those films, I decided that I would NOT get a job where I'm stuck in an air conditioned room for hours on end doing a job I hate. I thought that waking up every morning at 7:00 and driving to the same place in the same clothes doing the same shit was NOT the definition of life and living. Unfortunately, I find myself looking down at these people who are stuck in this world; prisoners unto themselves and their jobs. I need to live, I can't be held back by working for people I despise. I want to be a cinematographer, a job where I can be outside and in different environments using my hands and skills to create films; a job where I meet different people, a job that I can learn and grow into.  Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg) youtube video also helped shape my new way of thinking.     If you liked it, check out Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels as well!!   That would be Snatch.  Awesome movie.   Well this is interesting. I actually liked the first one, but it's faults were definitely in it's writing. Fingers crossed for this and Blomkamp's Alien film, which I am skeptical about.   Only a poster. http://i.imgur.com/0rlgnID.jpg  I should imagine we'll get one within the next 2 weeks.  edit: He said on Twitter it comes out this week   http://screenrant.com/girl-dragon-tattoo-movie-sequels-fire-hornets-web/      I was just waiting for the fucker to bite the guys arm off.   * Daniel Day Lewis - Daniel Plainview, There Will Be Blood  * Brad Pitt - Tyler Durden, Fight Club  * Jake Gyllenhaal - Detective Loki, Prisoners - Louis Bloom, Nightcrawler  * Not a movie but Mathew Mcconaughey - Rustin Cohle, True Detective     This may be the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I mean, sure I have my doubts, but this looks like a fun movie just judging from the trailer. Kids will enjoy, maybe even the parents. This could be a fun film the whole family can enjoy. Just kidding, this will probably be fucking terrible.      Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be. (I mean come on, the remake is written and will be directed by the same guy who did True Detective!)   Im looking forward to The Visit. Looks like M. Night is going back to his roots with this one. Fingers crossed!   Dazed   Confused...?   I love it. I love Finchers style, so smooth and subtle and not over the top. I love the twisted eerie soundtracks that he uses in his films, I also love his under-lit environments. He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.     "Honey, get the shot gun"   "Do you bleed? You will"  That is an epic ass line.      We'll need more info   I wish.   [What Batman thinks about your opinions of the new trailer](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/037/e/1/middle_finger_batman_by_babs9-d5u3guy.jpg)   Is it as intense and sleek as the first 2?   Please don't spoil anything or give away too much, I'm just looking for some opinions on S3, is it as good as the others?  Thanks!   Anything that analyses the graphic novel. A link to a website or video would be great! I missed a lot of stuff in the book, i really want a better understanding. Also, the same for Arkham Asylum, anyone know a good analysis for that? Thanks a lot!!   oh...   The statue is not CGI, or the graffiti.  At some point in the film, public opinion will go against superman. Maybe something will happen, I don't know.   When that 'something' happens, that's arguably where Bats comes into it.  People will turn against Superman in this movie, he might lose friends, politicans will want him, the military will want to contain him, all sorts of variables have been brought into the game as described by the teaser. So despite all this, will superman lose it? Will he lose faith in humanity? How do we know he won't be influenced by a villain, or be corrupted in some sort of way? The theory is that batman will be this sort of test, physically he wouldn't be much of a test, but mentally he would be.    Oh damn    Wassat?   An old Joker.  Imagine the possibilities...       I've never seen a film in IMAX. How good is it, honestly?   Is this IMAX quality?    OP, can you please explain?   Because if you've seen the film Birdman, you'd understand. Also, it's a parody/turn on [this](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=birdman+poster biw=1536 bih=731 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=IjwzVZT2B4X5mAWdpIHoDg sqi=2 ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgrc=5P4cztbW0Xn-nM%253A%3BMNdGgvPqs7I3DM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fposters%252Fbirdman_xxlg.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fbirdman_xxlg.html%3B1278%3B2000) poster   Its a turn on [this](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=birdman+poster biw=1536 bih=731 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=IjwzVZT2B4X5mAWdpIHoDg sqi=2 ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgrc=5P4cztbW0Xn-nM%253A%3BMNdGgvPqs7I3DM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fposters%252Fbirdman_xxlg.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fbirdman_xxlg.html%3B1278%3B2000) poster   Ok, does he kick ass?   Without spoiling it, how much is Vision in the film? Pls don't say too much!   I feel jealous, because you had the absolute pleasure of watching it a first time.    wow, thanks for that.  However, could you elaborate a little more on why batman and superman fight? What did you mean by batman testing supermans resolve?    Did Batman ever take any shit? ahaha   As of yesterday, a cross between Whiplash and Birdman.   Yes, I shit you not.   Now that you mentioned it, I totally agree. I thought Gosling was supposed to be directing it, my bad!   What can you guys learn about this bruce wayne from the trailer? Any comment/speculation would be much appreciated!  I'm trying to get a solid idea of what this portrayal of batman is about. What are his motives and values? I can tell that this is a completely different BW/Batman altogether, I just want to know why?   I hope this happens, but I'm not sure if Gosling is the right choice.          what?   Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before. I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.  For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book.   The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.   I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman. Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.  Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant.   Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.  TL;DR- I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen.   where can I get me one of those figurines?   ARRGHHH PLEASE TELL ME!   Reservoir dogs    Since the first season did feel like a 8-9 hour long movie.      A have heard talk of a stand alone batman film, DC have announced it, but it is far from production.   At first I was laughing, then I remembered that this movie is actually coming out, then I cried.   Legend.   Hahaha      No order:  - Avengers  - Star Wars (hmm that trailer though)  - Spectre  - Mission Impossible Rogue Nation  - The Revenant   Edit: also movies like fantastic four, ant man, Jurassic world, Southpaw I am also looking forward to.   Fight Club style?   Oh damn.   This film is going to be biblical.    I recently watched the documentary 'The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness'. **SPOILER AHEAD** It says at the end that he has retired, but on his retirement sheet/form or whatever it says that he wishes to continue making anime for 10 more years. What does this mean? Is he working on something right now? I am so confused, I have found so many different things on the internet about what is going on with him. Can somebody PLEASE explain what is happening? Thanks so much!!  **I DON'T WANT HIM TO RETIRE :'(**   I just googled your whole description except for the beginning.   I think the movie you are talking about is Wild (2014)   I doubt it. I think he took the pictures with a very good camera and later uploaded them to instagram via his computer.   I have asked people, they say I am not selfish and they say that I do not sound that way. Maybe it's just them trying to be nice. I just feel I sound that way, I'm not sure if people think the same or different to be honest. I said 'I' way too many times in this comment :/   No of course not.   Thank you very much   I find that when I talk to people I sound snobby and selfish. I feel like the tone of how I talk sounds like only my opinion matters. I do not have any of these intentions however, It's just how I feel I sound. How do I get rid of this? I don't want to come off any selfish to people, as I am not a selfish person. Any help would be much appreciated, if you want me to elaborate further just ask! Much Thanks!   Oh, I got mine from JB-Hi-Fi, they had The Wind Rises, Kiki's Delivery Service and this.   Yep   Where did you get it?   You are welcome :)   Where's Spirited Away? O_O   Sleuth?    O.O  *sigh* Now I need to watch it again..   You can get one [here](https://www.mightyape.com.au/product/Howls-Moving-Castle-10th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Blu-rayDVD/22816515)   Haha, I was in the shop just looking for the normal bluray for Howls moving castle when I look towards the end of the isle and I see a stand with that edition sitting on it. I just stared at it for 30 seconds straight. Then, as plain as a robot, I put the normal bluray back onto the shelf, walked towards the 10th anniversary edition, picked it up bought it, and marched out of the shop. My face was as blank as paper.   I wish they did one for Spirited Away....   I am looking forward to ALL of those as well, also the new Steve Jobs movie is going to be awesome as well.   For The Revenant Im guessing.            Absolute shite.   I was too goddamn late, but thank you.   The Godfather part 2. Because I haven't seen it and it's meant to be one the greatest films of all time.      Sorry, but what goes on here? Can someone please explain!   Awesome collection! They must be worth quite a lot by now.   Actually, I really quite like it. It's almost like that idea is a minimalism in itself.       You are very talented   Yeah it does have some unexpected humour.   I am currently 3 quarters of the way through the book, I am enjoying it so far, it is a little slow but that never seems to bother me in books or movies. Most of what's happening in the book seems to be build up, does it pay off in a big epic awesome way? Without spoiling anything, is the ending satisfying? What do you guys think of the book overall?    I am happy that he mentioned that infinity war part 1 and 2 will be separate stand alone films, instead of cliffhanger bullshit they pull nowadays.    I read that wrong. I read 'Stephen King to adapt Dark Tower series for Sony'.  :(      'It' is my fav, is the stand better than that?   hahahaha thats Vampires kiss   Everyone keeps saying its his best book. Please, I want to read it, I just need some encouragement from people who have read it!!   The Master. The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.The Master.   They announced that as the series progresses, he adds padding onto his suit. Has anyone noticed this yet? I am only up to episode 4, for those of you who have seen further, does the suit get bigger/ better?   I have no idea why I want to know this but whatever, thanks!   Oh, I think his line delivery is very authentic and overall good.   why do you think that?   So Marvel's Daredevil has just been released on Netflix, what do you think of it? I am liking the dark and gritty tone, also Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock is working out very well, supporting cast are also great. Let me know what your thoughts are :)   you're a little late   Nic Cage.      /r/TrueFilm will help you out.   What the actual fuck.    I approve.   Really?   big hero 6   He looks pretty good. My hopes for this film have only escalated.       About time.   onetruegod is hilarious.    The goddamn fucking pop-ups. The only thing that should be popping up is..well.....you know...  	137
 A LOSS TO INDIANA????  Ferentz...what the hell?      Seriously some of the funniest sports writing on the internet.   Watch out everyone, Negative Nancy showed up and now we know this is not cool!

Sometimes she would laugh so hard she would snort, it was so funny.      Thanks a ton for answering questions today.  You rock.   My question is which one of your characters do you think has been portrayed the best on film?     I wish there was an emoticon for waving your own hand over your hand when a joke/reference goes over someone's head.  I would use it now for all the people that didn't get the RDJ reference.  But I don't know one...so there is that.   That is the best thing I have seen in some time. Kudos.      There are two Capua's now I think, the one you just updated as well as in the disputed territory (SW of Albuquerque)  Not sure if city name was used twice, or a typographical error.    burn...   www.Blackheartgoldpants.com  Its an Iowa Athletics blog, that is ridiculously hilarious, and insightful.

 You can move 400km a year in a 4 acre plot of land.    Like a social net to fall on once you hit the streets. I know life can be extremely difficult for felons outside of jail (US), from getting jobs to finding a place to live. I'd like to see the differences between Euro countries and the US in this because I'm guessing that has a lot to do with ire-offending rates.   I also think a big problem is the cultural stigma attached to felons outside of prison. Someone does 4 years and gets out but never loses that tag that makes him different.    This was a great post until the last bit where you went completely over-the-top-smug.  I agree that prison is for rehabilitation but it is also a fucking punishment for the crime/s you've committed. While I 100% agree drugs should never land you in prison, and jay walking shouldn't throw you in jail; there need to be appropriate consequences for people's actions. This man raped, drugged and murdered at least one girl. He was a doctor who was in a position of extreme trust. He drugged other people so that he could rape in peace. He hid from society (at least French society) to avoid punishment.  All I'm saying is some people absolutely deserve the attention and humane treatment that fosters rehabilitation; some people deserve to sit in a jail for the rest of their lives and be reminded that being a member of society is something for people who don't rape and murder kids.   Also correlation/causation all that.    Quite a bit more than that bud.    I like how one minute she says "we're about to three-pear(lol) and the next sentence she tells him to move to Vegas to become a psychic because that's all he's doing."   Maybe because the question is 'what is something I can take to a party to make it great', not 'how can I throw a great party'.   Cold makes people tired over heat? Huh?   "Here Colby! Here boy! Goooood dog"   He was a rocket a couple seasons ago, we're familiar with him :)   I'm pretty level headed and I get downvoted for innocuous posts enough for it to be slightly grating on my nerves. Just seems like a different set of rules are applied to Rockets flair than others. Been subbed here 3+ years, have seen a huge shift in general attitude towards us. Gotten to the point where I don't come here after negative Houston things because the hate train is so strong. Oh well.    I've stayed pretty far away from here :p   I agree with the first statement. Good pick up, overpaying him made sense as Dirks window is closing, just like it would have made sense for us if Bosh signed here. Think the Mavs will be pretty good this year (3-5 seed)   Frankly, my impression has been that Houston talks more shit about Dallas.  That's my impression as well and I've lived in Houston for 24 years out of a possible 26.   Right thought, wrong flair.   What's true?   No worries, it's mutual :p  Though I'd take you over a Mavs fan.   Been anti rockets for a while now. Kind of annoying.    Been hating the rockets for about a year and a half really. Ever since the Harden honeymoon was over.    Makes sense and I know he loves Houston. Even though apparently we treat all our players like shit now.    Remember his post draft interview? Golden.    Forgot about Ariza, thought you were calling TJones above average defender.    He butted heads with Adelman, got traded and I think he's playing overseas now.   He was spectacular against LA though.   His post draft interview was spectacular (Rockets originally drafted him). He was so so so raw when he first got in the league though. Ended up playing 2 minutes per game w/ us for one season.   Still a memorable player to me just because of his interview though.   E: lol jk thought I was in the Joey Dorsey thread    see: flair   welcome to the life of a rocket fan on /r/nba.  subscribed here for 3.5 years. crazy how different rocket flair is seen from just 2 years ago.   Confidence is unwavering I feel like. Cockiness comes and goes.    When did I say that? We didn't have any players worth being franchise loyal to before Harden and Howard. Can you really blame the FO for not matching Parsons once Bosh was out of the equation? He'd would have been making more than harden. The Rockets would have had zero flexibility moving forward with a team that didn't make it out of the first round last season.   I'll admit our roster has been a revolving door since Yao went down but franchise players don't just fall into your lap. Howard was obviously comfortable enough with the FO to take less over resigning with the Lakers.  /r/nba just has on shit colored spectacles when it comes to the rockets.   No, it counts towards luxury tax just not the cap. That why the NBA has a soft cap. Les would absolutely have been paying luxury tax.    See his comments last night? Doesn't appear so.    Asik didn't want to be in Houston. Do people not remember that? He was trying to move Asik to a team where he could play more and we wouldn't have such a redundant player. Did people really forget the whole Asik basically saying "trade me" after we signed Howard?   I'm sorry but how were Asik and Parsons treated poorly exactly?   Roy Hibbert?   Like shit? How was Parsons treated like shit? How was Asik treated like shit? Besides the jersey thing, which could have easily just been a marketing team's really dumb error, how was Lin treated like shit?  Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston  Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?  Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.  You people seem to think that this is a church peewee league or something.    How was Asik disrespected?   You realize just last year we made a major free agent signing with Howard right? And the year before Harden happily signed our extension. We haven't had anyone to be loyal to since Yao faced premature retirement. Which player has the Rockets had in the past 6 years who deserved the kind of loyalty that Duncan, Dirk, Kobe, etc. got?     It's a fucking organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In what universe are you expecting them to "be nice". Yeah, they didn't roll out the red carpet like a superstar for the guy, but he was treated extremely well while he was here and conversely he treated us extremely well. Had we signed Bosh, he would have been rewarded directly by us with an instant match of his offer sheet (which would have cost owner Les Alexander a tremendous amount of luxury tax). As it turns out he was rewarded, just by a team up interstate 45.   What more do you want them to do? Be nicer? Jesus, this isn't Sunday school.    And we tried pretty fucking hard to trade Asik before the trade deadline. Fuck Morey for snagging the #1-2 center in the league, right? How else were we supposed to treat the guy? "Well Asik, we have a chance to sign Dwight Howard but we gave you a 3 year deal so we're stickin with you big guy!"  Give me a break guys, this is a cut throat business.   E: also a funny point is that the reason it was so hard to move him last year was because of HIS FUCKING EXPENSIVE CONTRACT MOST TEAMS DIDNT WANT TO TOUCH!   They drafted him, gave him a starting role for 3 years where he has able to build up his product(him) to be worth 15 million dollars per year. By opting out of his 4th year option *they* created his market. Perfect storm for Chandler, desperate Cuban for a huge FA Signing.  So I'd say they did a little bit for him....    He could be the 3rd star if the first two were LeBron James and LeBron James.    He's done it 3 other times and matched instantly each time until now.    Our comparable Dirk would have been Yao. Yao's career ended prematurely. Sorry we weren't nicer to him so he'd stay injury free. You have to have that special player first before you can't treat them well. And I guess to get to that discount we have to overpay for him first (by the way think it's a good contract for y'all as Dirk's widow is small - but a bad contract for us). So while I think y'all are overpaying for him, it makes sense, like it would have made sense for us to overpay him if we had signed Bosh.    and the mods allow for all sorts of opinions. good community too.  thumbs up emoji   Fair enough, can't say I stuck my head into that area very much, or at all. I generally don't like 'fandom' or the entitled culture which surrounds a large population of sports observers/fans. Like, you (not *you* - the proverbial you) watch 3 fucking games a week, fuck off with your (not *your* - the proverbial your) self centered metric of success and constant diversion between throwing players under the bus when performing poorly and hand jobs when good abounds.    I really like the writers on the Rockets blog 'The Dream Shake'. Good basketball analysis mixed with (from what I see) fair shakes at the players.   lol funny you said that. just spent like 15 minutes writing this up.  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2agal2/lin_traded_to_the_lakers/ciusr4i  to answer your question: no, I stopped going to the forums a few years ago.   Yeah it's a pretty shitty forum. bsk4 must not have been going there for a long time. The whole contingent of 'player only fans' started with Yao when half of the posters were Chinese fans who only gave a shit about Yao and not the Rockets. Even before that though you had the old guard who would do nothing but compare the current squad to the championship era of Hakeem - dubbed 99ers (because they were original members when the board was founded in 99 - fun fact: i got banned from clutch fans about 5 years ago for telling Tinman (like The King of 99ers), to gobble on some dicks and stop talking the "good old days" so much). Honestly though, 'player/era only fans' aren't even the worst part. It's very knee-jerk, players (and coaches) get thrown under the bus constantly and are swiftly pulled out and kissed on the forehead when they play up to the expectations of entitled observers. Fickle, unintelligent posters abound, caution.  To be fair, there are a few posters there who are extremely solid and possess impressive basketball minds (DaDakota, Big Moe, HayesFan to name a few who stick out), unfortunately they get drowned out by what you're talking about.   I really did not see that much hate against him from Houston fans this past season. Apparently I missed it?  Always seemed like Harden took the brunt of the hate train when things weren't going as peachy as entitled fans thought they should be.   Houston is also just in general a huge market.    Crazy how much that trade nix changed the landscape of the NBA in the 2010s.    Poor DWade. Opted out of his 22 million dollar contract hoping LeBron would stick around. Now he'll be lucky to get 12.   **11** letters - 9/**11**  1+1 = 2. 2 Names. Dick Cheney.    Yet people act like him being benched for Beverly was some personal slight against Lin. 'Basketball reasons' is actually athing.   Wait, what? My jimmies looked rustled from my comment? I had a smile on my face after getting eliminated from the playoffs this year because basketball is cool and fun and getting stressed or angry over it is silly.   This makes me so happy. This is like, better than an ice cold topo chico on a hot summer day.   People act like the Melo thing was Les and Morey getting together and being like, "Lets show how little we care about Lin". While it was much more likely something like the Rockets design team making a innocent mistake.   Getting benched for a player who better suited the starting lineup is getting treated like shit? I didn't see the hate towards Lin that a lot of people on this board talk about. The jersey thing was tasteless but it could have been something as innocent as the design team not thinking the whole concept through, not a deliberate shot at him.    Yeah I don't remember the exact details except that the contracts were dubbed "Poison Pill Contracts".    That is the cap hit against Houston. Pretty sure it's the full 15 million for any other team. Could be mistaken though and maybe the 15 million cap hit was only been if the Knicks matched.   I've been on reddit for almost 4 years and I think your comment is like the 5th I've upvoted, so kudos on that.     just picturing you literally sitting on your computer incubating your comment until the right time.   Wrong Chandler  AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!   Know what else wouldn't be fair? If Cleveland cloned LeBron 10 times and then bombed an orphanage.  Or if an elephant sat on the last bowl of ice cream.    And Bosh just swishin 12-15 footers all day erry day. Bosh is such an obscene upgrade for our PNR defense alone. Jones was absolutely garbage in that capacity. His team D was atrocious.    Chandler is coming to Houston in this scenario though (i.e. the SW being the Rockets division to lose by getting Bosh and resigning Parsons).   Wait what? That is such a sleek Spurs move. You just won a championship, now you are tricking the Mavericks into joining your cause by making them think the Rockets are more of a threat to win it all than y'all.  Sly. Very sly. And that's why the Spurs are the best.   Honestly thought it was too big, still do for any team that couldn't go over the cap to sign him.     And trying is half the battle!   win/win   Right but the reward is still the same. The reward in both scenarios is Parsons. The likelihood of retaining the reward simply increases the larger the contract is. Same reward - Parsons - either way.    You'll never hear me defend Kevin McHale as a good coach, bruh.   I know it doesn't mean shit, I was comparing two meaningless sets of statistics.   Do you seriously think the Rockets would have beaten the Spurs  I never said that, but Dallas didn't beat the Spurs either.  The argument was that Dallas played good against the champs, so did the Rockets. The Rockets didn't have to play against the champs in the first round because they played better than the Mavs during the regular season. See how dumb all these arguments are?   The more they offer doesn't increase the size of the reward, just the likelihood that they'll get to keep the reward. Same reward either way.    If you change the 16 years to 26 years our historical perspective looks better than y'all's. What's your point?   I'm sure players measure historical precedent when they're deciding whether or not to join a team with the mission of winning a championship.  Pack it up everyone, the Mavs have reached the 2nd round more often than the Rockets over the last 15 years, clearly they're the superior horse to ride going forward.     And the Rockets swept the champs in the reg. season.    Oh shit...my mistake.    Lol was just being silly. My error!   I read it as *will take* at first and was like argh ! ! !    thought you said it wouldn't matter without them   Uh no, I'm saying they wouldn't have won them without Odom, Pau and Co.  e: i misread you i guess?   It's not at all true.    So is Macintosh Plus just another name she goes by? All the albums on that page are Vektroid even when they have another artist name on the bandcamp linked pages?  My music library needs to know for uniformity sake.   To be this is one of the most evenly matches knockout games so far besides CR and Greece.    Nothing to lose? How about a chance to play in another World Cup game?  I highly doubt the team is sitting around going "whelp we made it this far, let's just cut loose cuz we got nothin to lose."   Disagreed   I got some serious asperger vibes from this post.   "My mom wasn't there to introduce us" - as a 20 year   See, regardless of whether he ends up a Rocket next season or not is irrelevant. This is Morey 101, if he feels that Parson's is being overvalued by the market, he wipes his hands and wishes the player good luck. If the market dictates a price that Morey feels is not only within his valuation but also fits with his 'grand plan', he'll have a new contract waiting for Parsons before he gets on the plane.    Everyone's loyal until they aren't. I could see him giving a small discount (-10% max), but he's only been here 3 years, has no historical ties to the area, and he already helped us out big time in getting Howard (and just in general by being the best value in the NBA during his contract). Hope he gets whatever he deserves.     That or she doesn't remember what attractive is.    I enjoyed this. It gets a little slow on the back end of some of the lyrical verses at times but otherwise good stuff.    Ouch. I can see this on a late night monologue soon.    Agreed, instead of talking about basketball let's not talk about basketball.   So how about that Elon Musk? Cool chap, aye?    y'all are cute   "karma"   satire?   teehehehehehehhee   While I agree the fans are better, it's definitely not more entertaining. Collegiate football is not nearly on the same skill level as the NFL, it's like saying you'd rather have an architecture student design your house because 'they're more passionate'.  The difference between the NBA and NCAAB is even bigger.   Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride. You honestly have no way of actually knowing if something happened or not, so why get bent up with negative feelings that someone is "tricking you" for "karma"?   You take reddit way too seriously.   Therefore, they're all lies.   Thanks for letting us all know what is funny and what isn't funny, arbitrator of comedy.   he has said all the right things   not that I disagree, but saying and doing are two very different things. he had the reputation for a reason.   No he signed an extension after the playoffs.    Bosh would have to take a min contract for that to work out.    Gotta beat them for a ring either way.    Really happy for Costa Rica. Spent one of the best years of my life living there during my senior year of high school (which incidentally was the last time y'all made it to the world cup - 2006). Unfortunately y'all didn't do as well then as you are doing now (think y'all went 0-3?).  Buena suerte Costa Rica!   	107
 You are 100% right. I can't believe how stupid people are by assuming that yellow card meant the occupants are worth more than anyone else because they have a child in their car. In an accident, a car can suffer extreme compaction, as a result, a small child might be overlooked in a crushed part of a car. Hence the baby on board sign.    Is that the subreddit for Korean 50's music?         They obviously gave those snacks to SOUTH Koreans. If they had given them to North Koreans they would have gobbled that shit up no questions asked         Shooting anyone, even if totally justified, will change your life. I personally go to great lengths to avoid drawing on someone even if it is legally justified.   Carrying a firearm is a great responsibility. Slights, insults, and other infractions by others can be ignored because you are carrying and those insults are thus not real challenges to your honor or manhood.   I was not there so I am not trying to criticize. I just know that drawing on someone or shooting them, even if 100% justified, will open up a Costco sized can of worms that will likely not be pleasant for everyone involved.    I may be wrong but I think OP may have exacerbated the situation by playing dumb and asking the guy why he was angry. Obviously the guy was angry because his car was blocked by OP's bike. OP knew his bike was blocking guy's car and that was the only reason he was angry. It seems as if OP may have been trying to bait the guy by leaving bike there for longer than necessary.  If I were investigating this situation I would have asked both if they had had any previous negative encounters with each other. I would ask why the delay in moving the bike. I would ask why bike was not stored in front of OP's car rather than requiring him to move it every time he wanted to use his car.   I may be 100% wrong but something does not add up here.           What is the rate?   The rate of increase? Is it significant in terms of being a major factor in climate change?     rate of increase in global emissions that stalled.  What is the rate? Is that rate significant?  This is only from the energy sector. Not the transportation or construction (i.e. cement) sectors.  A flatline in one major sector is significant. If there was a relationship between world economies and CO2 levels then ANY increase or decrease from any CO2 producing economic sector should effect general ambient CO2 levels.   I thought forgery was illegal...                              The reasons Conservatives and the GOP are against climate change is  because:  1. We believe that Leftist political interests have corrupted climate science.  2. Saying that an area of science "is settled" is contrary to the scientific method.  3. The proposed solutions to climate change by the Left involve increasing taxes, increasing regulation, and empowering elites. These so called solutions are extremely expensive and any results achieved would be miniscule and not guaranteed.    Al citizens whether Conservative, Liberal, or in between should oppose this type of legislation.    Probably the easiest way to deal with police at your door is to keep door shut and locked. If they break it down, then  sue department.  If they were justified then you lose. If they were unjustified then you get money.   missing this river http://i.imgur.com/zlyQ2.jpg   In Berlin, if you refuse to get measles vaccination you must wear an "M" patch on your shirt....

May I ask a serious question? What is it with r/guns and r/firearms? Both seem to be filled with humorless, angry, uptight individuals. This puzzles me because in the real world shooting community, the people I encounter are very easy going and  friendly. Can you offer any advice on what I am missing? Thanks                                 It is amazing how  pets think your most foul odors are the greatest smells ever    At what age do they lose their second head?                        Should be x posted to r/aww         Actually those instances are not examples of alarm bells sounded by the right. Look up fluoride in the water. THAT was a communist plot   Aren't you concerned that the ticket would be too far to the Left? Sanders is a self described socialist. Warren is not too far behind. Would America embrace such a ticket?      Southern Strategy:  The Southern strategy is often misunderstood because of an interview with Lee Atwater in which he uses the term "nigger nigger". Some who do not understand what he is saying consider this snippet to mean the GOP is embracing racism to attract disaffected Dixiecrat voters.  That assumption is incorrect. What Atwater was saying in plain English was that the GOP DOES NOT have to resort to pleas to racism to attract disenchanted southern democrat voters. The GOP had to only appeal to economic issues to attract them.   The link I provided proved that there was no Southern Strategy to use racism because the data proved that the shift of southern democrats to the GOP was NOT as a result of the civil rights movement. The shift was a long continuous 4 decade process.  Please consider the logic of this. Why would any party embrace a tiny portion of the voting public (racists) at the expense of offending 95+ percent of the voting public? Such a strategy would doom a party to failure.    If conservatives are so opposed to big government and government spending  You have to realize that the GOP does not equal Conservative. The GOP consists of several factions including big spending establishment RINOs such as McCain, Christie, Bush, etc, the Tea Party Conservatives than want smaller, less expensive, less intrusive government, Libertarians etc.   Conservative Tea Party opposes expansion of government regardless of if it is proposed by the Left or the establishment wing of the GOP.   equate socialism to communism which its not.  According to Marx, socialism is an intermediary step on the political continuum towards communism. All socialists aren't communists but all communists are socialist. As a Conservative, I oppose all forms of socialism or communism.   You need to study some history man. Europe has thrived under social democracy so has canada.  Are you including the noted socialist regimes of the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, Hitler's nazis Germany, Castro's Cuba, Mussolini's Italy? Those regimes are responsible for the deaths of 150 million people over the past century.  Please don't confuse full socialist states with socialist lite systems such as Scandinavia or Canada. Such systems can afford social welfare because they are rich countries who do not have to pay for their military security. Such states are not paradises. They are dealing with very real economic issues, declining population, and a deteriorating immigration policy that allows non integrating outsiders to change their societies. Such systems are not likely to survive.  I believe that the Tea Party movement is a response to a black man in the Oval Office and conservative appeasement of these whack jobs has done a serious disservice to the right. I used to consider myself a centrist until people like Michelle Bachman and Sarah Palin hijacked the gop and all the Anti-scientific and pro-religious sentiments were amplified and became central to the party.    1. Can you provide proof that the Tea Party is racist? No such proof exists.   The Tea Party stands for 3 things:  Lower taxes, less regulation, and smaller government.  I am a hard core Tea Party Conservative. I am also an atheist, a scientist, I don't give a shit who smokes what or who marries who.   Conservatives are not anti science. We believe that the issue of climate change has become polluted with political ideology and thus the data can't be trusted. The solutions to climate change proposed by the Left involve massive tax increases and empowerment of elites.   Conservatives believe Liberals are wrong.  Liberals believe Conservatives are evil.    The first thing I'd like to say is look up the Republican southern strategy. It is an openly racist policy that is denied or spun by conservatives but their policies don't match their words.  Southern strategy claim debunked: http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php  More white people are on welfare, food stamps etc than minorities  37.6% of food stamps were being allotted to White non-Hispanics. African Americans were allotted 23.6% of SNAP benefits.    http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2012Characteristics.pdf   Welfare statistics. Black and white percentages are essentially equal at 39%  http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/  Being opposed to socialist, Leftist, Progressive policies does not equate to racism.  Conservatives are opposed to a huge government constantly getting bigger, taxing more, and making regulations endlessly. We view power as a zero sum game. Power is finite and with every right or freedom the government takes over, the less rights and power the people have to decide their own destinies.   Not directly but conservative policy would effectively strip or limit the country of its social safety net  We want smaller government not no government. Liberals always play this false all or nothing claim. We feel that economic opportunities are far better for all people than endless government subsidy slavery.  So you don't judge policy on its merits you judge it on its political leaning or political class that proposes it.  We are philosophically opposed to Leftist policies. Period. I do not view Leftist policies as being beneficial to the country or our people. I view Leftism as a cancer on society, government, and the people. This does not mean I am against helping the truly needy with government assistance. I simply reject Leftist government turning entire classes of people into dependent slaves to social welfare programs.   You sound like your indoctrinated as opposed to having a political affiliation. Any thing that is from us is good, anything that is from them is bad. You don't see the problem in this?  This comes down to political philosophy. I follow the beliefs of the founding fathers, classical liberals but not Leftist Liberals. I view today's Liberal progressive Left as being a static, rigid path to classical socialism... nothing more.   As a Conservative I believe that America offers a different path towards raising all members of society economically, politically, socially, personally. Socialism is diametrically opposed to my political, economic, and personal goals. Socialism has been a disaster for  every society that has tried it historically. There is a reason for that failure. Please consider why it has failed in the past....  I'm not gonna bombard you with a battle of links because I'm sure you realize we can both find Internet sources to back up anything we say. I'm trying to keep things on a general level. I'm not a hater and I'm not looking to trash you or your beliefs.  Thank you                                 Wiping tear from eye...   It was lost while plowing and found while plowing.    More white people are on welfare, food stamps etc than minorities.   Being opposed to socialist, Leftist, Progressive policies does not equate to racism.   I and other Conservatives are opposed to almost ANY progressive policy and ANY progressive politician. Race, sex, religion, orientation is totally irrelevant.   If Hillary becomes president, I will oppose almost everything she proposes. If Al Gore becomes president I will oppose almost everything he proposes. Same with ANY other Democrat/Leftist/progressive.   It is my belief that the whole GOP=racism is a Democrat lie, intentionally told in order to stifle debate of issues. Democrat philosophy is to demonize opponents so that voters don't even have to explore contrary opinions. Why would you even entertain the views of a mean racist?    If you really don't think the GOP has racist policies you have buried your head in the sand, a quick Google search will not disappoint. I can provide you with direction when I get home.  No crazy opinion pieces please.    But "progress" in American politics only means a static march towards classical socialism? Progress does not mean an open minded attempt at finding real working solutions to problems?  Conservatism in American politics means a desire to follow Jeffersonian representative democracy. Embracing those policies that have made the US an economic superpower.      How has the GOP been racist?   If you actually read that article you will understand that the Democrats did indeed give up their overtly racist policies.  But you will also read that the Republicans did not switch and become racists or support racist policies to win over racist Democrat voters. The so called Southern Strategy is spelled out in a Lee Atwater interview in which he stated that the GOP could appeal to Dixiecrat voters by use of economic arguments and NOT by means of crying "n*gger n*gger".   http://www.redstate.com/2012/07/11/the-southern-strategy-myth-and-the-lost-majority/  People often misinterpret the Southern Strategy as a point when the GOP switched and became supporters of overt racism. This incorrect belief  has been proven wrong by use of demographic data that show that the migration of Southern Democrat voters to the GOP was not a sudden movement as the result of the civil rights movement. The migration was a slow and steady movement over 4 decades.   One only has to ask why ANY political party would embrace racism as policy. Such a move would ensure defeat in national elections. The percentage of voters who vote based on racism is astronomically small. The percentage of voters who would be offended by such policies is well into the majority. Logic dictates that no such policy would be followed by any major party.       Yes, the Democrats changed their racist history after the civil rights movement. The Republicans have always been against racism as a policy.   True the Democrats renounced their overt racism but the Republicans have remained the same          Never ever vote D again ever.   Sound advice. I am honestly beginning to wonder if the Dems even like America or if they are capable of telling the truth about anything.    The drops are amazing. As soon as you put them in you can feel the liquid penetrate deep into your eye canal. If there is anything "bad" in your ear you will feel it fizz. All the bad stuff is getting eaten. I then use the bulb to flush the ear with warm water in the shower.    1. Go to drug or grocery store.  2. Buy "Debrox Ear Drops"  3. Use monthly. You will never have ear problems again                                                               Only if you don't count decades of Democrat racist policies involving Jim Crow laws and segregation.                   light beer                     http://pjmedia.com/eddriscoll/2015/03/01/wapo-walker-hit-piece/         John has a long mustache.  The chair is against the wall    Why are you calling those who dislike the federal government gaining power at the expense of the people "loonies"? Do you believe the federal government understands and can solve issues that effect you locally better than you or your local peers can?                            http://college.usatoday.com/2015/02/27/u-of-wisconsin-asks-walker-to-remove-redundant-sexual-assault-report-requirement/      The university reports sexual assaults to the DOJ via a different statute. Two different statutes required reporting the same information via two different procedures. Walker merely removed the redundant requirement at the request of the university.     The university requested Walker do this as the sex assault reporting requirement was redundant.       The Tea Party, actual Conservatives are for smaller government, lower taxes, and less government regulation. Put differently, Conservatives are against increasing government influence in our lives. You may be philosophically opposed to such ideas but how can you honestly claim such ideas are in any way extreme or crazy? I simply want to be left alone by government as much as possible.       I am against any government entity using any political ideology as the basis for enforcing or abusing the law. Every thinking person and every true American is against such abuse. Are you against such abuse by any party? Be honest   I supported no candidate in the last election. For the same reason, most Conservatives stayed home on election day in protest. That will not be the case this election. The revolution is coming.       I support Scott Walker and Ted Cruz. There is a schism in the GOP between establishment RINOs like McCain, Christie, Romney and true Conservatives like Cruz, Walker, etc. During the previous election, the establishment element made up all of the GOP frontrunners so I supported none of them.  The revolution is coming...  Obama's legacy will be a footnote in the dustbin of history   Mitt did not get elected because he was a RINO faux Conservative. I did not support him. This election will be much different. Scot Walker / Ted Cruz ticket will be embraced by Conservatives. Say goodby to Public Unions, Obamacare, "immigration reform", high taxation, foreign policy mismanagement etc.   How does it feel to know that the Obama dream is dying? Be honest   There is no difference between Liberals and snake handling pentecostal baptists. Both group's reality is determined by faith and not by facts.   I am going to laugh so smugly when the next president is Scott Walker and he dismantles the Obama debacle piece by piece. The age of Obama is coming to an end. LOL    "The truth is incontrovertible, malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end; there it is." -Winston Churchill  Liberals live in a community based reality. They base their "facts" on ideology. A fact is only a fact if it passes through ideological scrutiny. I laugh at your faith based religion. hahaha    The facts of the case is that the IRS paid heightened scrutiny towards conservative non profit groups than liberal non profit groups. This heightened scrutiny was at the orders of the Obama administration.   Liberals such as yourself approve of this practice. I will laugh at you when you complain when president Walker instructs the IRS to deny the non profit status of liberal non profits.   Just being honest   It is obviously an assault weapon. It has a barrel shroud and a shoulder thing that goes up. Why would anyone legitimately use this unless they wanted to kill up to 5 people in under a minute?   Would it bother you if the IRS gave special scrutiny towards Liberal non profit groups at the direction of president Jeb Bush? Be honest                              I would be more impressed if they drew a Mohamed cartoon.   "Stay off my lawn"      Suddenly I am craving Domino's Pizza        	199
 Did no one tell them that storage manufacturers say 1 GB is 1000 MB and most software techs say 1 GB is 1024 MB?   How can we say that dark matter isn't the 'aether/ether' of our time similar to how at the turn of the 20th century there was aether/ether to explain things that were eventually explained by general relativity, Brownian motion, and that sort of thing?

       This isn't the 1990s where SSL slows down the connection to a website, we have servers and computers powerful enough to handle that issue now.  Also, anyone can spy on you without SSL enabled on all websites.   Also HTTP2 protocal and update which is coming out is going to force the majority use of SSL which makes a more secure internet in the end     	4
    Good Luck!      Definitely the worst thing about these games, to be honest, anything that fuels the war machine makes me sad. Glad we have games like Metal Gear, Spec Ops and This War of Mine to spread the counter message.   Bokoblins are definitely un-serious asses, haha! https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i rct=j q= esrc=s source=images cd= cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CAcQjRw url=http%3A%2F%2Fzelda.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FBokoblin ei=Cdk9VYO_IobdmAXo94CQBw bvm=bv.91665533,d.dGY psig=AFQjCNGckN7KRDSiWz1l4-N4jfQ8zVuHvA ust=1430203024278442 scare the hell out of me in SS though, dunno why!      He's super right about the unhelpful behavior on people's part. Gopher seems like a very cordial and kind hearted individual and I agree with him that the negative rage/abuse/bullying etc. is not helping the point of view against the current system. I feel sorry for the mod authors, simply taking an opportunity presented to them, it's not being a horrible person to want money for your creations.  We just need to be empathetic towards each other as human beings, ya know?  3  Peace   He's super right about the unhelpful behavior on people's part.

But why does one thing being a problem mean that we can't try and fix other things?  I agree with you, I'm not saying it's a reason to not try to fix things, I'm more trying to tease out discussion on the topic :)   Thanks for your response, the power angle is very interesting. I often compare the power difference when contemplating other subjects, good idea to apply it here.   Could you expand on that? I'm aware of that idea that sexualized women + the violence can direct the tone in a really unsettling fashion (e.g. hitman), but does sexualization inherently and problematically tie into violence for every game? Bikini chainmail female warrior fighting a monster, is that sexual violence when compared to a beautiful man in no clothes fighting the same monster?  I'm not arguing the idea, I can feel there's something wrong there but I need further clarification to build my own understanding.   Thanks :)   Thankyou interesting point.   Yeah Jim Sterling did a very good video about this a while ago, actually. Its an interesting point.   good point, changed my post specifically about the design and not other elements of objectification.   Accidently deleted my text in my post, so I have to redo:  If 50% of objectified characters were adult men, in the exact same fashion as the sexualized adult women (not the male idol fallacy, but actual objectification for the straight female gaze, or whatever) would that help the situation of objectified characters?  I should note I'm not talking about third person leery camera movements, I'm talking about design of the character. I don't think anyone really likes cringeworthy camera shots of a boob or bum or a package, but if a character is wearing skimpy clothing and they own it - equally between the sexes, does it become less of an issue?  I understand two wrongs don't make a right, but if we are going to focus on moral issues in games, isn't violence more problematic in that regard?   I'm a sex positive bisexual male, so I'm definitely not interested in sex and sexuality being a taboo and I don't mind looking at objectified men in games either!, but I am not in the right position to make a clear assessment myself so I'm curious what people's thoughts are on adult characters being treated 50-50 equivelant.   That is amazing!   Hey man, sorry you didn't like the post, what do you think immersion means in terms of gameplay?  Cheers :)   This game sounds a lot more interesting than I initially assumed, the art style looks beautiful and the adventuring looks simple but fun! gonna have to try it out, nice!   If a game has a female protagonist, it much more easily grabs my interest. I just really enjoy playing as another gender than my own, it's like games give me an experience I don't have in my day to day that I can empathize with and find appeal in.  Saving this video.   Thanks everyone! I have added a revised art style at the top of the post :) lemme know what I can change :)  	22

 lisa simpson bart imagination. proof:  1) every1 in the family is dumb but also bart is dumb and homer and marge is dumb and maybe maggie is dumb but lisa be smart. this leads to conclusions that she is adopt or in barts imagine  2)lisa simpson is not truly around all the time sometime she not around sometime she is but always because bart imagined her  3) bart bad grades = dream up lisa amsipon so he feel good about bad grades  4) lisa simpson  5) in some episode lisa simpson in other episodes bart simpsons  6)you never seen ne1 alse talk to lisa simpsons but when they are its actually they are talking to bart who look like lisa for the audiance or lisa is imagined next 2 bart for audience  that is my teory   There is no widely accepted theory for either.  When people say shit like that, I doubt they're seriously considering the existing of Universes, let alone assuming that all universes must be 'parallel'. They're simply creating nice thoughts from their current situation, so those thoughts would naturally depend  on re-assuring them, which a parallel universe would serve to do.    You're right, but I think it's a fair to assume he doesn't have a source in this instance since he opened his post with "I THINK"   No, opinions are fine on ELI5. You're acting as though they are worthless. Opinions, supported by reasoning, precedent and logic can still potentially be valid and are just fine in lieu of facts. The only issue is if it's presented as a fact, which 004forever didn't do, it's clearly an opinion.  Edit: You're fucking retarded.   Not a stupid question, your logic is sound. Your assumptions are not.  My thinking is that if a shitty video doesn't load, I'm more likely to go to another website and do something else, rather than watch more videos.  Google has this data. They can see how much traffic they can get. They can read through piles of feedback. They have the resources to make the change. But they haven't. The odds of it just being pure stupidity on Google's part is quite low.  Most likely, any people refusing to use YouTube because of the occasional video hiccup are probably not anywhere near enough in size to warrant a massive and expensive change in infrastructure. As far as I can tell, YouTube is still growing or at least stabalised in the first place, so I don't even think this problem exists. Lastly, what alternative? There aren't many competitors and what few there are certainly aren't popular.    I'm thinking so. It basically just seems like it would be TOO strong if it prevented blinking with just the Aghs. This puts higher limits on an OD Aghs wombo combo. It would just be too easy to set up, as opposed to heroes like Magnus or Enigma who at the very least have to jump into the fight first.   Correct, doesn't change the fact that over time that style of sitcom has become boring to me. I still appreciate that it was unique at it's time - like I said, I loved it. But I was simply saying that, over time, it loses what makes it unique because it is now the standard. Hence why it probably doesn't appeal to today's market to quite the extent it did in the 90s.  It's just one of many options today, and many people are sick of the formula before even considering giving older sitcoms a chance.   Way, I was even further off than you guys. I thought it was "gotta love those Starbuck's lovers", as some sort of stab at the hipster movement or... something.   To an extent. I used to really, really love Seinfeld, but each time I rewatch it my opinion of it lowers a little. It was great... for it's time. By today's standards it is very much the typical sitcom. Especially in the later seasons.   I think there are two reasons people believe this whole thing about 'ridiculous law suits':  1) People misinterpret the word 'sue', as OP has clearly done, or assume that because someone is suing someone they've probably won. A newspaper reports that a burgler is suing a homeowner because he tripped over while stealing their TV. People jump on ship and say how wrong it is, without realising that it hasn't gone to court yet, and he'll probably lose.  2) The flipside: the newspapers don't report enough detail, and people assume the party doing the suing is wrong, when in reality there is a good reason for it. The famous McDonald's hot coffee suit. People see a woman suing McDonald's for her coffee being too hot, and they laugh at her and say the country is going to hell. What they don't do is read into it, where they'll find out that she [severely burned herself (NSFW)](http://blog.3nips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stella_liebeck_burned_by_mcdonalds_coffee-524x373.jpg) and required expensive medical treatment and had permanent damage to her vagina. Nor do they read about how that particular McDonald's was serving their coffee too hot on purpose so people would take longer to drink it and increase their chances of ordering more food. Nor do they read about how the McDonald's had been warned several times in the past to quit this practice by health and safety authorities.  These, taken together, greatly reinforce the perception of how common ridiculous lawsuits actually are successful.   I'll start by saying I understand that just because countries aren't punished for breaking rules doesn't mean the rules are ineffective - they can be preventative. However I'm specifically interested in cases where Country A broke specific rules of warfare and the United Nations (or historical equivalents) enacted a punishment on said country, rather than just a list of ways the UN is effective because of the laws.   Source?   Pedantic... Replace it with antigay and respond the his post again   Ditto, was thinking the same   Just wondering what themes I should use when browsing the net at night: light or dark?      Take away Mayweather's ability to win on points, it's now a no rules, fight to the death/knockout/surrender. Who wins?  Round 1) Modern day  Round 2) In their prime  It's all fair game - kicking, punching, grabs and throws.  Hopefully you guys aren't sick of the Pac/Mayweather/Tyson threads yet!   The first rule is if they are shown dead, they still may come back to life anyway.   Awesome idea. Also a balancing nightmare, but if Valve can make him work, I'd love to see him in the game.   I don't even eat Nutella!   It would last around 21 minutes before Mike Tyson's lung condition started to effect his performance. Just a few Mayweather's could wreck his face then.   It's strange to think that there could be a time where you didn't know what you looked like. This isn't really up to the standard of most answers on askhistorians (I'm usually the one asking the questions!), however I mostly wanted to reply to suggest that the average person could probably see their reflection in water in ponds and what not.  Apart from that, I know we have had mirrors throughout most of human history, made of bronze and copper, so some people definitely would have access to a clear reflection of themselves. However I'm unsure if the typical medieval commoner would have had access to them. Which leads to a follow up question of my own: assuming easy access to reflections were not available, would it have been common for towns to have publically available mirrors or reflecting ponds specifically for this purpose?   I'm not upset, but I'm definitely disappointed with some of the content that gets upvoted here. But I guess TIL =/= Interesting Facts no matter how much I want it to.   TIL that a TV show uses a common writing tool that most TV shows and movies use. Fucking wow.   Because you cherrypicked a movie where it wasn't the case. Most zombie movies do actually seem to follow this rule.   Hence, Mayweather was the better boxer.   Fuck off.   for no reason  Because they're bad. Just because something is the same as its source material doesn't automatocally make it good or immune to criticism...   But that's a conscious choice. They could have made him less based on Stark. It doesn't make the criticism any less valid   He also had a team of writers to fill in for his weaknesses   He is just trying to downplay Whedon criticism as being reactionary to his popularity, as if that makes it less valid somehow   Bullshit. People have always had this criticism about him, it's just easier to share thanks to the Internet   They could have written it so Ultron wasn't based off Tony   It's Prime Tyson and he gets a canon of his choice.   Round 1: any real world canon Round 2: any canon from fiction Round 3: can Mayweather clinch him mid air (non fictional canon)  Tyson must survive.   6.85 when?   I really disagree. May weather and Pac are no slouches. A 2v1 is hard. Lots of room for them to just grapple/wrestle him and wail on his face    People tried it against Tyson and still got BTFO      People are welcome to express their dissatisfaction with something. If the boxing world doesn't want to change, then fine, no one is forcing it to just as much as those that aren't enjoy boxing in its current state aren't being forced to watch it.  However, if it does want to change, maybe as viewership declines, or simply knowing there is a larger market to tap into, then the feedback is valuable. People are just expressing their views, there is no right or wrong.  Don't like others opinions on boxing? No one is forcing you to read them!   Right, and I think people want to see some changes to boxing to make it more interesting to watch.  Most people are admitting Mayweather won fair and square, but they just don't want this to be the way to win. Change may be needed in the sport.    I think if someone is a good person at heart (and nice does not always = good, btw), they can never be truly ugly.  Was Hitler ugly?    That being said, I'm sure you're lovely. I honestly do not believe that ugly people exist,  This is just condescending and makes what you say sound hollow. Ugly people do exist and they need to learn to cope with it instead of being deluded and thinking they're attractive.  Edit: I don't know why I'm being downvoted. If someone tells me that they think I'm smart, that would fill me with confidence. If they follow that up by saying "I think everybody is smart, including those guys over there who huffed paint fumes every day and can barely remember their own names" then it would make the original compliment have far less meaning.   'Support' in this context means continuing to watch and pay money to the industry.   There's a tradeoff. Using more strength may score you the same, and seem like a waste, but it deals more damage to the opponent. Some boxes prefer going for points, while others for damage.   I don't see why dodging and blocking scores any points...  ...? It doesn't. Go look at the punch stats, Mayweather landed more punches than Manny. You can call the sport boring and Mayweather's style is absolutely awful to watch, but at the end of the day he landed more punches. Were we even watching the same fight?   Well done.   ITT: People who don't know shit about boxing repeat stuff the heard on TV, the internet, from their friends, etc.  How ironic that those people were exactly right. Not just in their prediction of the winner, but how it would play out. Textbook Floyd, I made some easy money off people like you.   Logic dictates that being punched in the head for a living isn't healthy.  Only if you make the assumption that being punched in the head is unhealthy to begin with. Personally I think it makes you smarter by exercising your brain more   Why?   OP doesn't know that. Just because the answer is 'we don't know' doesn't mean it's a bad question. Also people might have written about the masses, like if the characters in a lot of plays from that period where stressed about work it would open some discussion. Diaries aren't necessarily needed   Haven't they found evidence of injured early humans being cared for? They can't hunt for themselves, so others helped them.   Care to elaborate?      Who hasn't Mayweather fought?  Pacquiao.   Bruce Lee could easily beat Mike Tyson in a fight.   Any source I can find (all of which should be taken with a grain of salt) puts his networth above $100m. This also means he will be doubling his net worth from this fight.      The best change Alch got this patch wasn't to Alch himself. It was decreased creep bounty, as Greed is now a larger percentage of gold per creep kill. This aghs thing is an interesting change, but I can only seeing it ever being meaningful in ultra lategame scenarios on a core Alch and if you actually have a gamechanging ult on your team that is still meaningful lategame. It's super niche.         Oops.   Enjoying titties is degrading?    Actually I hate their inclusion in the films. Every enemy Widow or Hawkeye, or even Cap take out is just another enemy that Thor or Hulk would take out with an effortless AoE attack.   It also makes it harder to have the villain go full force. Any villain that can go hand to hand with Thor should be able to snap Widow in half in a heartbeat. But they don't. So we have to see these characters getting hurt enough to make the villain seem strong but not so badly that they're seriously hurt. It makes the villains seem inconsistent.  Their inclusion just hurts the movies imo.   I'm sure he is aware of kryptonite by now   Absolutely.   And Zuckerberg was a programmer, not an economist, and he ended up just fine. There is clearly a bit more to the story.   a day  It's three $333.33 meals   Being evil isn't the defining quality of being a monster.  Being a monster or a monstrosity by definition refers to extremes though. I'd say a pure evil person is more of a monster than a human being that struggles with moral dilemmas in ever episode.   But the term 'monster' itself refers to an extreme to begin with, so I'd say someone who is purely evil to the absolute extreme as is so from birth is still more of a monster than someone who slowly becomes bad/evil (but not quite as evil) over the course of time.   It's saying that someone is more evil if they're less evil and gradually become a little evil then someone who is pure evil. It makes no sense because you're either more evil than someone or you aren't, it doesn't matter if you were good to begin with.  Someone who quickly become evil from a young age, perhaps because of upbringing or a traumatic event, is still more evil than a good person who slowly starts to do morally questionable things.   Seriously?   Lunk alarm? For real? Why have heavy weights at all in the gym?   Awesome! Sounds great, how much detail will I get out of the globular clusters? I remember seeing them through a telescope once and it looked amazing. Are there any recommended clusters to start with? I'm in Australia so it's night now, going to go and see if I can locate Jupiter's moons!         Don't forget Fox Engine too   What are you basing this on?   Except no one cared about Indonesia's death penalty until Australians were involved. And no one will care again in a few months time.   Dank   Do we know how much money Microsoft made off the Zune? Perhaps they pushed it for four generations in the hopes it would take off, while making barely anything or losing money. Didn't Microsoft only start making money back on entering the console market quite recently?  It could also be considered a failure if their return on investing in the product was far below their goals.   simple and concise  But the other answers were simple... and more concise.   What did he mean by 'you're not man enough'?  Did the reporter threaten him during the 'inaudible' part and he was saying the reporter wasn't man enough to take him, or was it just a random, empty insult?   Careful. He WILL destroy you   Title is a bit of a mouthful, so I'll provide an example: I have a gun that holds 20 bullets. I have 200 ammo in reserve. I fire ten bullets. I reload, throwing the old clip/magazine/whatever away. I now have 190 ammo in reserve and 20 in my gun.  Wouldn't it be more realistic and more interesting mechanically to only have 180 left (since I discarded 10 bullets that remained in my gun earlier)? Whenever I play a horror survival or a more realistic styled game I always wish it worked that way. Even for more fast paced multiplayer FPS games I think it would make monitoring ammo and deciding when to reload more interesting.  So... why ISN'T it that way? Seems like it would be the natural default? What started this trend, or has it always been this way?   He's wrong. Lee wasn't beaten because he never fought. That is to say he also never won.   almost  I can't seem to find ANY tournaments his in.   I'm going to voice a bit of a controversial opinion here: but I'll just say he seems to be a good EXHIBITIONIST, not necessarily a good fighter. He showcased his (still incredibly impressive) speed, accuracy, strength and technique in highly controlled environments. A lot of claims about Bruce are more legend than fact.  There are plenty of martial artists that would hand his ass to him on a plate in a real fight. I'm not trying to undermine his accomplishments, he wasn't trying to be a fighter in the first place, so it doesn't matter. I just feel a lot people put him on a pedestal and assume the man must be an unparalleled fighter.  I've heard people say he could beat Mike Tyson (in his prime) in a fight.   You're getting downvoted for being obvious of course it's reversed   Stay in school kids.   Mmmm... yeah   But Evil Dead 1 was good too   I got bored of the movie halfway through and turned it off. Did they really win by dance off?   Well what happened to your $500,000?   Agreed.   I disagree. I think he knows full well that it doesn't apply here.  He's just deflecting their arguments and his fans will eat it up.   Is ammonia against the rules in boxing?   Whatever came of your cousin stealing your brothers business idea?   What does this mean exactly? They have a patent on a product and make all their money by suing people who breach it?      The scepter buff is an icon buff, right? Does this mean it can be purged?      For example, work sent me on a training exercise where we learnt things like "You only use 10% of your brain" and some people are "left brained while others are right brained" and basically played a bunch of pre-school tier games that would somehow making us better workers... or something, while my actual work piles up at my desk.   One quick Google search completely tears the very basis of these training sessions apart. I wish I could remember some of the other pseudo-psychology I've heard, I just remembered those two examples because they're common in the real world too.  I've been to about four like this in just two years, and dozens of employees came alongside me to each. The amount of money lost on labour, travel expenses and to hire these people would be phenomenal.  So why do companies, who are probably finding ways to cut costs everywhere, have such poor quality control for these sorts of events.  My perception about how common this is may just be distorted, but these training sessions have occurred in multiple workplaces for me and my friends have shared similar sentiments.   It was non-stop laughs, right?  Not really, but I can see where you're coming from an agree. Perhaps spending so much time interacting with certain communities has affected my perception on what is and isn't 'cringed' at by the broader community.   Paraphrasing a reply I made elsewhere in this thread:  "It doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.  I'm really more interested in the thought process of the advertiser rather than whether or not the ad is effective. Are they disconnected, or deliberately producing material that communities will cringe at but remember anyway."   True, but on the other side of the coin I barely remembered it and I only saw the ad yesterday and probably won't remember it by next week. I can't think of another example off the top of my head. I guess that's just me though.  At any rate, it doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.  I'm really more interested in the thought process of the advertiser rather than whether or not the ad is effective. Are they disconnected, or deliberately producing material that communities will cringe at but remember anyway.   /r/fellowkids is full of examples, but most recently the (Wendy's?) ad for a new burger that featured The Memer.   Guess I'll plug /r/fellowkids while I'm at it.      I guess they'd be good for riot control, but wouldn't a sword be better for fighting in close quarters? Did any civilisations use spears? What are the more common patrol weapons in medieval Europe? What about Ancient Rome?   A frog jumping into a pond qualifies as poetry now?   Then don't allow him to grow really big.  Once upon a time there was a shapeshifting monkey. He could have grown really big and got them but he didn't and we'll never address it.  Also a terrible story.   Haha, interesting image.   No problem, let me know if you change your mind.   Hey baby, let's fuck.   Not enough cock.   CM looks like she could use some cock. I'd give her a good dicking if she asks nicely.   They can, in theory. Now we just cross our fingers and hope another studio wants to foot the bill.   Worse is Mighty No. 9 looks like shit.   Yeah... what?   I disagree. I'd say any more that I get so bored I turn off halfway through qualifies as bad. So that would be Iron Man 3, Captain American 1 and 2 and Thor 2.  Bored dead through both Avengers movies too and don't remember Thor at all.  Why do I keep seeing these movies...   How's it going?   Source?   Maybe X-Men could be 'stage two' of the Universe one the current actors are done with their run? The Avengers are long since retired/dead, the major threats to Earth dealt with.  OH SHIT, ORDINARY PEOPLE WORLD WIDE ARE GETTING POWERS NOW?      I'm just going to copy and paste my response from that thread:  For me, whether modding or not is good for gaming depends entirely on whose perspective you're referring too. Obviously, this change is only a benefit to modders. They can still put their products up for free, if they want, or they can look to make a profit (no matter how small it is, it's more than nothing, I don't think "only 25%" is a valid argument).  However, most people complaining about this are complaining about it from the point of view of consumers, not modders. For us, it is bad.  The most probably positive is it will lead to higher quality mods. But honestly, I don't see that happening. People already put a great deal of care and attention into their mods. The marginal increase in quality that paid mods might create is in no way worth the several dollars I will now be charged. And even if the increase in quality is substantial, I think most consumers would prefer hundreds of great mods for free instead of just picking 2-3 paid mods that are of slightly higher quality than usual.  On the opposite side, we're already seeing downside to paid mods ignoring price (issues over ownership, one mod already has in game pop-ups in its free version, issues concerning mods breaking or not interacting together, making them worthless after you buy them, and so on).  I think it's a real stretch to call this immoral, or to say Valve/modders can't or shouldn't want to be paid for their services. However, that's not the question. The question is if there is anything WRONG with it. And I'd say yanking away hours of enjoyment and a strong community built around modding for joy, not money, is seen as wrong by a lot of people.  On a final note, it's one less thing about Steam I liked taken away. The workshop wasn't perfect, but it was convenient (if a mod is on both workshop and Nexus, workshop is a slightly easier install. Now I won't use it at all). So, for me at least, it's making want to purchase games on Steam even less. Anyway, that's my two cents.   The modders can make their own site and sell it. But they'd probably make less money than selling it through Steam with a 100% cut on their own website.  They're not paying for the hosting costs or effort on Valve's part. The paying for being in a highly visible (and therefore highly valuable) location. Anyway, I think the 25% cut is the LEAST important part of this debate. It's a number and it can change.  The more important issue is how this will affect the quality or mods and the value of games that are highly dependent on mods.   For me, whether modding or not is good for gaming depends entirely on whose perspective you're referring too.  Obviously, this change is only a benefit to modders.

I suppose the same might be said of other villains in the franchise, but as far as I can recall they all had plans that at some point required them to make a big scene.   So... Ultron could have easily won if he just didn't make his presence know to the Avengers, right?  The only times he had to make his presence known for his plans to work was when he first encountering Jarvis. But he could have killed Jarvis, escaped though the Internet and laid low. Stark wouldn't have been able to work out the AI came alive, just that it caused a huge issue with his network.  He could have built his robot army/meteor machine in private, unknown to the rest of the world. Once the thing went into motion, it is unlikely the Avengers could work out what was happening in time.  But what about the twins? Or becoming known to the scientists who he tricked into building him his new body?  He wouldn't need either of these things if the Avengers weren't after him in the first place.  TL;DR: Ultron dun goofed.   I disagree. Enough bullets fired in Bane's direction, eventually one will hit.   This. I could have a decade of training, I'm not going to beat modern day Mike Tyson, let alone Prime Tyson. The only answer is 'no one', since I don't want to spend my last year alive training.   mostly jokingly, that there are other factors in being attractive than having a big dick or broad shoulders.  I think most people would rather date a 7/10 personality than a 7/10 looks than a 10/10 personality and 5/10 looks. For a lot of people for already have nice personalities, their bodies are probably the area they need to work on most.   What exercises increase shoulder size?   What the fuck was with the first one. Why did the allow him on the show??   My biggest problem is the tiled walls.   That's too dark, but George can kill his wife and hospitalise a bubble boy?      Dank explanation bro. Cheers   Maybe you should try playing it instead of watching it   uTorrent recently experienced some severe backlash after including malware in one of its updates. I suspect this downgrade possibly has something to do with that (why they don't just release an update that has it removed is another question).   It's really not that hard to follow to be honest. There might be lots of movies, but they're still quite simplistic movies.   I fail to see how that's relevant to what he's said. I've seen them all in order and I still agree with him. They're just bad movies, but the hype train won't end as long as there are fans to eat it up.   Well what were you expecting from capeshit?      It also costs a fortune. There's no real reason to buy it yet. If you haven't got any Civ games, you're best off getting Civ V + all expansions for less than BE. They need to make some fantastic expansions to make that game worth buying.      Yeah, but the question is can you do it with a transporter.       In the TNG episode "Relics", Scotty and his friend (Franklin? Let's call him Franklin) where trapped inside transport buffers. Scotty's pattern was saved, but his friend's was lost forever.  So, it's possible to eliminate a pattern to prevent re-assembly of Superman.   Who is operating it would be a factor.  What's Data's fastest feat in terms of hand/eye cordination? Perhaps he could pull it off?  If we really want to cheat we could have Q man the machine and use his wizard powers to time it perfectly, and it's just a matter of pressing the buttons as a formality.      Followup question (if that's OK on this subreddit, trying to save myself making a new thread): Did the treatment of the Jewish people improve much immediately following the war? Would it be a far argument to say Hitler's extreme treatment of the Jews could have had the effect of improving popular opinion of them in the long run?      hahahahaha OP that meme is dank!! BAZINGA!   I can't say I'm surprised by a billionaire wanting even more money, but I kind of see where OP is coming from. To my knowledge, Valve wasn't started to be like your typical company. It was a guy who loved videogames wanting to make videogames.  If I were a billionaire, every extra dollar would seem marginally less appealing. Eventually, I'd care more about pleasing my fans (and stroking my massive ego to my own circle jerk) than making any more money. OK, maybe that tune would change if I actually were a billionaire, but at the moment I guess the idea of having that much money is so alien to me I just can't imagine why you'd NEED any more - especially at the expense of your own fans and your own 'child' (Valve).   People realise this. It still has potential to effect people that don't use the Steam workshop. If a person wants to sell their mod, they can remove it from all sources except the Steam workshop.   Interested in knowing this too.   I'll play Devil's Advocate here: were you banned for copy + pasting a comment? Perhaps it's just an automated filter.   While many fans were expecting the surprise announcement Valve had been hyping this week to be news about the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, Valve fanboys were still pleased when Valve instead showed off their latest product: Valve possession vans. Currently being tested in the United States, these vans will repossessing your personal goods and belongings in exchange for money owed for mandatory mods, Valve updates and Valve Gold Subscriptions. The vans are expected for a worldwide launch next year.      "who the fuck thought this was a good idea".  Considering Sandler's box office pull, I'm guessing the answer is "people who like money".   You're right, I was completely wrong on the details. Men seem to cost more as their accidents are expensive. Same principle, swap genders and ignore the part about men's accidents tending to not pay out.   Watch from 0:42 seconds onwards in OPs video. You see the guy jump on his car (coinciding with about 1:16 in the video you linked).  You can see he is completely blocked by traffic 'stage left'. [Here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Jv37wtR.png) (the traffic is clearer if you watch the video though).  In fact, I would not be surprised if this exact angle is exactly what the Defense Attorney was discussing in this quote here: "When we saw the first video **[I believe he is referring to the one you linked]**, it could have been interpreted in a different way, but after looking at other videos **[this is referring to OPs video, which was considered vital to getting a proper interpretation of events]** and putting it all together, I think we must be careful not to take a decision too quickly," Vaillancourt said."  	163

Source: I was just attacked by a dachshund while trimming its nails.    It's been a crazy ride for sure. I just want to share some of my story and experiences. Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now.  I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt.  One day a friend told me, "Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. So I did. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse.  I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace.  I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. Just weed.  I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We smoked. We drank. We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days.  23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober.  I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. Lonely. A mess.  I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice.  Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view.  I can't really dish out advice. I don't feel like that's my place. I can just share what I've gone through, and it was hell. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, even if that happens to be me.  Life today is beautiful. And i'm glad to be hear to share it with you.      I actually don't know what you mean, it's my original content.   Do you have sources? Quotes from him?   Brilliant.

I don't even know if our love was ever real.  Maybe it was just all in my head, my weak and fragile head.  Regardless of what I experienced, I walk forward, blinded.  I don't walk back and ask for help, I simply walk forward.

My thoughts exactly. Karama-bait.   Any one else feel like this?  I slack off on going to meetings and keeping up with my marijuana sobriety, and the guilt just builds and builds until its all consuming and I treat people around my like 'things' and not people.  I had a friend tell me he wanted to relapse this morning because of an exboyfriend he was trying to get in contact with was ignoring him. That could easily have been me. I obsess over people. I try rehashing old relationships and getting butt hurt about it. I just broke up with my ex and now that guilt is building on my guilt of not going to enough meetings.  So I let go. I just go to a meeting. I let go. I go on a date with someone else. I let go. I pray and write poetry. I let go. I write to you guys seeking our shared experiences in marijuana sobriety about what guilt means to you and how you deal with it.   Thanks.

Also creating the appearance takes years of parting and maintaining. Once you have the pattern set and each dread about an inch wide, it maintains itself to an extent. They make great herding dogs, especially the black ones, because Hungarian farmers can see them easily inside their flock.

Cool! haha   You relapsed and you start the clock over. It isn't the end of the world. Be thankful for what you have and remember how important being free of marijuana is to you.  I don't know what to say about her. I can tell you about my experiences. I've relapsed only when it was tied to romance. Something about  *that* mood and marijuana go hand in hand to me. So I cut those people out. Or the terrible relationship does that for me, and I'm broken up with because I can't stop smoking once I do.    Another cool app? Marijuana Anonymous. They have a chat feature. Meetings. Lists of in person meetings in major metropolitan areas. Tis cool.   As addicts, we are powerless. Marijuana is going to be on our minds forever. Might not be that strong, and it might not be very often, but anything could happen tomorrow.  As for me? My boyfriend still smokes. It sucks, but I really don't care and he doesn't rub it in my face. He doesn't do it around me, and when we were living together, he had his weed, bongs, and pipes in a separate cabinet that i wouldn't go in to.  Personally? I would not live with people that smoked weed that I wasn't in love with (as in people that I have been inside of, or have been inside of me... American Dad reference...) I know I'm a sucker for peer pressure. "Come on man, do it, do it, you know you love it." "Fuuuuuuuuuck, I do, how'd you know." **BAM** Almost a year down the drain. It hasn't happened. But it could.  If you can't move out or don't want to? Boundaries. And stick to them.    Congrats on coming to this conclusion! That's awesome to hear. I'll tell you a few things other people have told me.  If it's fucking you up, don't do it. Weed, alcohol, pills, whatever.  Don't worry about cigarettes. They aren't good for you, they cause health problems; that said, you have bigger fish to fry. Staying marijuana free, money, family, friends; if the future holds you not smoking, then it will happen.  We aren't fortune tellers. We don't know what tomorrow will bring. So brace yourself, and live a single day at a time. Sometimes a minute at a time.  Again, congrats.    Edit: I only identify as a recovering marijuana addict, though I've done other things. I choose complete sobriety of most mind altering substances.  My one year of sobriety is coming up soon. I don't usually open up about my journey too often, but today I had a moment.  I went shopping for cold medicine, and caught myself actually reading ingredients.  "No, can't buy that for such and such reason."... "No, people get messed up on that"... "No, that'd make me feel weird, forget it" I realized, not only do I feel like an old person, but I feel like a person that takes personal responsibility for what goes in to my body. May it be cough medicine, or THC, or vodka, or that one weird pill my friend gave to me in high school at our church small group; sobriety is a complete overhaul of all of your previous beliefs, dispositions, and experiences.  I'm better for it.  With that, I still have no idea how I'm going to celebrate my one year, but I will.    I wonder if that's common with rare species.      ...What other board games would be good with a Pokmon theme or element?

Explain the stress it's putting you through, that you 'enjoy' the responsibility, and want to see the shop succeed. You believe in the salon, and have high expectations for it. In order for the salon to move forward, you need the salon to work efficiently and safely. And this all might involve another bather? Maybe a receptionist? She's known you for... half a year?

From what I've seen of him, this sadly doesn't surprise me at all. The church I used to attend prides itself in being able to speak every language, being able to convert every culture to evangelic christianity. Think of that.

       [Nope. It was 'shooped for a Nokia comercial](http://www.snopes.com/photos/advertisements/pingpong.asp)            If this is a run and gun disaster, I'm fucked. I'm at work right now, and in my pockets are two sets of keys, one small knife, a pack of smokes, a lighter, a wee bit of smoke, a wallet with about 35 bucks, and a pen.  The only useful things on my person right now would be my lighter, my small knife, and my shoelaces. I don't know how long I could last with those.  If this was a hunker down kind of scenario though, I'd be in pretty good shape. I work in a restaurant that cooks with a wood fire. Plenty of food, the ability to cook most of it off if the power fails, access to knives, fresh water, and supplies like a well stocked first aid kit.

Got some room to add a few things, thinking about switching in a Shark3, and I want to test throw a blizzard Beast a couple times before I add that in to the mix as well.

I even told her that after everything got chilled out. Their good, but take your time, you can always bring some home!    You would think so, but our standard customer might be aware that the internet exists, but that's about it. Old people, they smell funny, and don't chew their food, apparently.   I was walking food to the table next to them. She was getting up, and wheezing hard. I heard it, and went over to check on her, and right as I got to her she inhaled and I heard it block. She didn't do the traditional hands to the neck sign, but at that point you could see the panic. After her throat cleared, she was wheezing hard and claiming to still be choking, but after talking her down and getting her calm, she was alright.  Fukin' pork chops. They're good, but slow down!   Heimlich maneuver. Know it. You might need it.   Old lady out in FOH, chokes on a too-big piece of pork chop. Fully choking, customers standing around like dull eyed cattle. Jump in, three thrusts, out shoots the chop, everybody's happy.         As in using it as a poaching liquid? Absolutely safe. Right way to go about there.   No, not the meat (other than different bacteria or microbes to deal with)  The marinade itself can be made safe with application of heat over a period of time. But before heating, contact with marinade with kitchen implements, hands, spills on counter, etc are all dangers.  EX: You use a spoon to stir the marinade, and lay it on a counter. You cook the marinade, at temp, over time, and make it safe. You sit it aside as you plate your food, and then use that same spoon to dish the marinade/sauce. You have now re-introduced bacteria and microbes into your food.  This is a danger in all cooking, the difference here is that the marinade allows the bacteria to grow quickly, so you have a higher concentration of bacteria/microbes to deal with, making any accidental cross contamination possibly dangerous.   The danger here is that even under refrigeration, the microbes will continue to reproduce. Like I said, safe if heated correctly, but dangerous because of the introduction of liquid media.   The chicken has the slamminella naturally. As the bird is butchered, it gets spread about. Under refrigeration the salmonella will continue to reproduce, slowly, but mostly on the surface. When introduced into a liquid, you've given them room, and energy (food), and invited them to turn it up a notch.  It will still grow slowly under refrigeration, but it will still grow.  You can do it, but the danger here is cross contamination. A dirty spoon, a dirty knife, your hands, anything that comes in contact with the marinade that isn't heated or sanitized is going to allow that growth to continue, and it don't take long at room temp for a problem to develop. Now you use that knife, or spoon, or hand, and reintroduce bacteria and microbes onto your food.  Can be done, just have to be super safe, and super conscious of what you're doing to ensure safety.   Food science, here we go!  The reason that we are told to discard marinades is because of the danger of bacteria/microbial growth. Bacteria/microbes in our food=bad.  When you put chicken in the marinade, you're also (probably, likely really) putting salmonella in that marinade.  Now your marinade is a microbial bacteria soup ready to spring into death-bringing action, as long as a couple of things fall in place.  If your marinade sits out at room temp for any length of time, it's like the bacteria's parents have gone away for a long weekend and they've called everyone and let them know that it's bacteria party time, and the bacteria are all up in the parents room dividing and shit, microbes and bacteria partying together, replicating and reproducing. This is super bad. (This really starts happening just as soon as you put the chicken in the marinade, keep that in mind.)  If you marinate your birdmeat in the fridge, keeping the temp below 40 deg F you can slow down the rate of growth. It's like the bacteria are nerds, and only invite a few microbe friends over for some Minecraft action, and a couple of them get lucky and boom! Bacteria babies. They still grow, just slower.  How can you put a stop to this madness; this bacteria baccanalia, this mass production of microbes? Heat baby. If you heat anything up to at least 165 deg F for at least 4 minutes, you're gonna kill *most* bacteria/microbes in whatever you're cooking. *Most*.  So, with the question of marinades, if you have kept the marinade cold, and are using it directly after marinating, and you haven't let it sit for more than four hours, and you heat the shit outta of it, then you should be okay, but it's still a little bit risky. If you marinated at room temp, or longer than four hours, you have allowed the bacteria party to go on way to long, and when you apply heat to it, you're going to kill most, but not all. Most bacteria/microbes to begin with=more bacteriamicrobes after bringing the heat death.   Personally, I have used the marinade after marinating it, but only rarely, and only in applications where I know that I can heat the shit out of it as part of the cooking process. (Now I make the marinade, and reserve some to the side if I want to start a sauce or something.)  As far as using the marinade as a poaching liquid...I've never tried it, if you bring it to a rolling boil for a few minutes and then reduce heat to simmering, you technically should be okay, but there is a great opportunity to screw up. (Cross contamination!)  As far as the poaching liquid alone goes, go for it! Simmering happens just below true boiling, a temperature that is on the other side of that safety barrier of 165 deg F, so as long as you don't abuse the juice (by leaving it at room temp for too long in between uses, or cross contaminating the pan or some such), totally safe to use in a sauce.    Safety first. I say no go on the marinade, just too risky. Technically safe, but the window for fuckin' up is just too big. Poaching juice, do it. Safely.  Enjoy! Happy cooking!

[Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman (Hebrew name     [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])[1][2] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota,[3][4] and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range west of Lake Superior. His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.[5] His maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.[5] In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from Kazman in north eastern Turkey.[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)    Hmmm, funny.

Why?  Cookies fall apart because they are soft and gooey? Check the temp of your oven. Check your cooking times. With the addition of peanut butter to this recipe, there may be too much fat, or possibly to much water. Try refrigerating your dough before cooking. Maybe even as simple as smaller cookies might solve the problem.  Cookies fall apart because they are dry and sandy? Try removing one or both egg whites. Try changing flour. Recipe just says "flour". I use AP flour, bread flour, oatmeal flour, and winter flour, and combinations of these to get the consistency of cookie that I want.

Big things for Big Green! GO HATS!!            Some jobs are hired with a salary range, not a set salary, but that's not really what it's about.  Knowing a ballpark figure of your own worth shows self confidence, but it can also show a complete lack of knowledge about the job your applying for. A CPA might be worth 65k a year, but not as a fry cook.  Knowing what the ballpark for the job you're applying for means that you've done your homework. You've researched the job. It means that your serious, you're not just doing the legwork and hoping for the best. And, additionally, to a small degree, it shows a bit about your character.  EX: If you're applying for a mid-level management position with a banking company, you do you research, you know what people in that city are making for that job, you know how the company is set financially, and you walk in knowing that the position being filled starts at 30k - 40k. When the interviewer asks you how much you expect to make, and you with no experience, just out of school, young, ask for 41k, we know you don't know what you're talking about. Inversely, if you have lots of experience in the job being offered and you low ball yourself, there are going to be questions about your self confidence.  Shoot for the middle, unless you are absolutely sure you are the most qualified applicant for the job. In that case, go high.                  Hmmm....Siracha. Garlic. Honey. I can a lot with those things.  Or...Cilantro. Dry Ranch Powder. Cinnamon. Some fun things there.  Or...Vodka. Whiskey. Beer.

The 12th fret is the octave from the open string...when you release the note, the vibrations easily translate from the 12th fretted note to the open note.

Living downtown would be terrible, unless you truly enjoy all the nonsense going ons that happen every other weekend there.   Daytona is the larger city, and it has its goods, but I personally don't care for it. Much of Daytona is a little rough, and the parts that arent' are expensive.  Go, check it out, talk to some locals, but as long as the bigger city issue isnt a dealbreaker for you, I recommend checking some of the outlying areas. South to New Smyrna Beach, and north to Ormond Beach. Lots of very cool seaside towns (lots of old people though) and most of the places are very ped/bike friendly. And, Daytona is right up/down the road when you need the Daytona experience.  Just my opinion, I live down New Smyrna, and I love it. Very touristy, lots of old folks, but there is so much good here it makes up for it. Prices are right too. I rent my place, across the street from the beach, 3/2.5 for 1K month. I walk/ride my bike to work/grocery store/bars/kids school. Got friends that live in other smaller towns along this strip of Volusia county (Port Orange and Ormond) and they say the same things about their towns.  Enjoy the trip, get to the beach, have fun, and good luck.   I used to, but I developed some habits to help me with that. Someone else mentioned a checklist, and I'm thinking I don't want to walk out doing paperwork; I'm sure I've done enough of that for the day.   I sat down and wrote out my "closing walk". (Saved it for training incoming supervisors, too). I made sure that I covered every detail; lights, AC, TV's, alarms, locks, everything. I did it in order, and I make sure that I do it the same way, every night, every time.   Now I don't have to think about it. I don't read my list. I just do the same thing every night, including little things like when I lock the front door, I put the keys in the opposite pocket of where they usually reside.   Doing it the same way every time, combined with little clues like the key trick (I also say "OFF" out loud every time I check that something is off, little things like that) I never have to worry about it. Every now and again, I will doubt myself, but I can just tell myself, I've done it the same way a hundred times, I know I didn't forget anything, and I haven't in a long time.            I can grow/tend crops.  I'm a pretty decent carpenter.  I'm a professional chef, and know food, and food safety. I know canning, preserving, salting and dehydrating food.  I can shoot, both gun and bow.  I can fish. I can trap.  And like a whole lot of Redditmen, I have thought about this scenario way too much, and I feel like I am fairly prepared, both in the beginning, in survival, and in rebuilding.  I am also a natural leader and love to teach, and would be great with a small group, not so much with larger groups.  Perfect scenario for me would be a small band of survivors with a stronghold. I could reinforce the stronghold, I could grow crops, I could protect the stronghold, I could lay up food for the leaner times, and in down times I could share my knowledge with others.   Not a bad theory, but I don't know if it fits the canon...have you read the Stand yet? Both early and late in the book it talks a little bit about Flagg, and how long he's been around. Stilson may be one instance of Flagg, but certainly not the first.  IMO, I think that Stilson fits more into the ideas talked about in Insomnia...that people serve the White, the Red, or the Random. Where Stilson fits, either Red or Random could be a lively debate.            I'll start, but with the opposing view.  I'm a diehard Gator fan, have been my whole life, but I lived and worked in Tallahassee, home of the Seminoles, for almost a decade.  I loved it there. Great fans, great tailgating, plenty of ribbing for being a Gator, but I was always made to feel welcome, always had a beer for me at the parties, and I always had a good time.  Inversely, I've seen how our Gator fans treat visitors, and if the shoe was on the other foot, I don't feel that I would be as comfortable in Gainesville being a fan of whoever they were playing as I was made to feel as a Gator in Seminole Country.  If I had to complain about anything about the Seminole Nation, I would point out that their students didn't stay for whole games. Far too in a hurry to get to the parties/the bars. Saw the student section empty out game after game when I was there. But the parties were pretty f'in epic.            I regret many things that I did, and have no wish to share them here. But I also recognize that each time I did something that I shouldn't have, I learned a very important lesson, and each and every one of those lessons helped me become who I am, and I am happy with that.  I regret nothing, while I am shamed by much of what I have done.   I though you were gonna say scratched up and broken in.    I have had a little trouble with this as well. From my studies, I get  1. The difference is between the verbs estar (to be) and ser (to be). Estar is a transitive state of to be, while ser is a permanent state of to be. If you are studying, that's not something you are always doing, so "estoy estudiando" whereas if you are American, "soy americano" because that is something that you always are. The difference in the two party statements seems to be that the wording of "where is the party at?" implies that there is a party going on somewhere that won't be there forever, while "where is the party" has more permanence. It's pretty advanced grammar for so early in Memrise. (Side note: If you're using Memrise, use Duolingo.com as well, they support each other well.)  2. The simple difference is in the state of doing. "Tengo que" (I have to) is something that you feel you have to do, while "Debo de" is something you must do, because of outside forces. "Tengo que ir al bano" I have to go to the bathroom *because I have to pee*, vs Debo de ir a la catedral" I must go to the cathedral *because my mom told me too*.   Better speakers than me please correct if wrong, but that's what I get from my reading.   The earliest advent of progressive forms in English came from Latin translations. In languages without a lot progressive forms, like Spanish and French, a simple verb-phrase like "I eat" could mean several different things: I eat now, I eat regularly, I eat today, etc. Latin has different verb forms for all those statements, and languages without that verb structure had to append adjectives to describe the same idea. (Spanish "I eat" is "Yo como", I eat now is "Hoy como" or "Yo como ahora", etc) So in translating the Latin, English took the route of appending verbs to a progressive form, to easily translate the Latin ideas.  [Here's a quite wordy article about some of this](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-lamont)  As for the increasing usage of progressive forms, I think they gain popularity becuase they are brief compared to fully explaining your meaning, and English, specifically American English, is lazy.                   These would also work on Catholics, but you'd have to shoot them on Friday.   There are many rules.  "You can wear a pink shirt. You can have a pony tail. You can have piercings. But you shouldn't have all three." ~ Willie Nelson  The dude in the pink shirt with confidence, drinking beer is more manly than the uncomfortable blue shirted guy drinking wine, but if the pink shirt guy starts drinking wine, there are too many conflicting images. Imagine instead the burly lumberjack walking into the bar, setting down his axe, sauntering over to the bar, and ordering a glass of merlot. That works. It's better if he orders a bucket of wine, but still a glass is good.  Additionally, beer has traditionally been for the masses, while wine was enjoyed by the elite and the artistic. More bonuses.    A fair question.  Perhaps an argument that between classes you could make judgements of manliness...a passion fruit wine cooler is definitely less manly than a quality import beer, but overall, beer is less manly than wine.  All men drink beer. It's a given.  To be a man, you must have confidence, and presence.  Bustng out some red wine at a beer party, as long as you drink it from a paper or plastic cup, shows that you are apart from the herd, that you stand out, that you are your own man, and you follow your own rules.  But mostly, wine gets you hammered quicker and harder than beer, hence manly. Plus, technicolor vomit is a plus.   From hairless to hirsute...  Beers (and other malted beverages)  1. Zima 2.

The people that shop at Lowes are far more likely to be able to id me, while Home Depot has plenty of drunks and illegal aliens, neither of which want to rock the boat!  3. Home Depot is just closer.   Me, I like [this guy](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-D-Grip-Steel-Square-Point-Shovel-1594300/202562612#.UcjbU5yWl4M) right here. Nice square nose for quick digging and even sides, and can transfer a fair amount of material in a hurry, which can be important in this kind of project.  I never worry about disturbing the surface with this guy. I like to pick a place that's not so well traveled, and covered with ground litter....whether tree leaves, dead grass, or even trash that gets blown in to the area, this shovel allows me to get in, get dug, and get out. Kick the ground cover around, and it's like I was never there!  As far as rope or duct tape, I don't use either in any project murder hole, so I'll answer your question two ways.  One: For transfering the product to the murder hole. I like whatever is handy. I try to grab something ahead of time, but sometimes it's sort of a random unexpected thing, so i'll just use whatever is handy. Carpet, old tarp, trash bags, hell, there was this one time I had to use plastic wrap!  Two: For binding. Nothing beats rope. It really gives the feel of "oh shit, this guy is fuckin nuts! He's gonna eat my liver" to any proceedings. I keep some duct tape around, just for gagging or covering the airways completely, but I'm a rope guy! Try [this stuff here,](http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/203837266?productId=203837266 storeId=10051 langId=-1 catalogId=10053 MERCH=REC-_-SearchPLPHorizontal1-1-_-NA-_-203837266-_-N#.UcjcsJyWl4M) it really gives the scratchy ropy feel that you want, the kind that brings the real terror when they regain consciousness!  Hope that helps, and good luck. Have fun!   Several organizations that represent the Disabled recommend against this sort of idea.  How to treat people with disabilities is just that....treating **people** *with* disabilities.  The people-first idea of disability etiquette states that you should first always remember that it is a person with a disability, not a disabled person. (Not a blind person, but a person, with blindness).  Changing language may seem like a good idea, but can be insulting to those with disabilities.   That sort of thing is acceptable among close friends, but in general, stay away from special language that points out disability in others.           Stop using them. Those cloth reuseable bags are like a buck apiece. Buy one, each time you go shopping, and you'll have plenty in no time. Get plastic bags every now and again to use for mini trash bags, but get away from them.  Makes no sense to use bags made of petroleum products that took millions of years to create, but you're done with in less than an hour.   Because it makes good TV.  I don't watch the show, I'm a dedicated TV hater, but I checked out a couple of episodes back when Danny Veltri was on. He worked at a restaurant that was next door to the place that I worked, local hometown hero and such.   I watched one episode in full. The job that day was to make some sort of fancy salad.   I've worked in the food industry for a long time, and what I got from watching that particular episode, is that for all the money spent on that show, it is one of the worst kitchens ever set up. Here the contestants/cooks were having to run around from station to station to find all the ingredients that they needed for these salads, while Ramsay screamed at all of them for being retarded donkeys, and the only thing I could think of is why on earth would you have to go to more than one place to make a dish? What kind of set-up are these people working in? Ergonomics, flow-through, and mise-en-place were ignored in favor of making these people go four different places for four different kinds of lettuce while Ramsay got to call them all idiots.  The only thing that I took away from that episode was that the idiots were the people that thought this approximates a real kitchen in any way, or represents how things work in a professional kitchen. It may make good TV, but it certainly didn't make good chefs out of these people...Danny Veltri won, worked at Ramsay's place for what, 8 months? Got fired, tried to open some new place here in town, failed, and went and got himself locked up for DUI for driving will fucked on pills.   It's TV, and like all TV, it doesn't represent reality.                 If you're going to pump out conspiracy theories at least do your homework.  President Obama is black. Sort of.  Michelle Obama is black.  Kim Kardashian is white.  Kanye West is black. (Did you know that?) He's also a douche, but I don't think that matters.  So, here's your title.  US government contracts media outlets to push stories about Kim Kardashian's mixed baby in an effort to get Americans to accept future race mixing.  White American is becoming a minority, but I don't think that there's some cabal of old white men pushing stories about a mixed baby in order to preserve white america.   I'm not gonna cross off an easy win off our list yet....yet.          Find gear online. Check locally, there might be local shop, but that depends on the scene around your disc golf course.  I like [primediscs.com](https://www.primediscs.com/), and [marshallstreet](http://www.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/), and [discgolfstore.com](http://www.discgolfstore.com/), but that's just like, my opinion, man.   Discs can be a pretty personal thing. If she's gotten into the game at all she may be quite picky about what plastic she will throw.  As far as discs go, if you're going that route without knowing what she's into, sneak a peek in the bag and she what kind of discs she has already, and get the upgraded level. (EX: Innova bottom line plastic is DX, she has a DX Beast, get her a Champion or Star Beast; same disc, better plastic)  Out side of that, accessories will be the easiest. A new bag is always a welcome addition. (I keep growing out of my bag, got a bit of disc collecting problem) I think someone mentioned a practice basket; that would be an epic present for someone starting out.   Nowhere near as cool, but giftcards to a discseller might be an option as well.  And go out there and play, it's fun!   [Someone sold one on Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/RARE-INNOVA-PRESENTS-PRE-RELEASE-PROTOTYPE-CHAMPION-APE-/140976210819) and listed it as an Ape.      Yes, yes I will.   Perfectly, every time. Chicken release is now what I'm calling that, too. I hope my wife appreciates that.  RELEASE THE CHICKEN!!!      Haven't made them yet, just ran across them this morning...but I do my baking on the weekend, so giving it some thought...but I just can't do all the premade crap, gotta go scratch!    I thought about doing a bar cookie and then topping with creme brulee, but once cut into bars, it would go all mushy. Gonna have to go with mini muffin cups, and press sugar cookie dough into little bowl shapes...thought I may try a shortbread crust as well.   She is alive and well in my SO's imagination.   What a great idea! I can't see how this could possibly be abused by anyone! Sign me up!   I think my brain broke. But not the most difficult thing I ever masturbated to.    Dude is straight-up eye-fucking the camera while working that chicken leg...that's bad enough, but it's the shirt that tells you "I'm saving you in the spank-bank for a later withdrawl."   Your daughter needs love and attention and cuddling and nurturing.  But you know what else she needs?  Diapers, food, a roof over her head, shots, doctors visits, immunizations, clothes, toys to help her learn, more diapers, more food, and about a billion other things that cost money.  What you're doing is hard. It's hard work, it's hard on you, and it's hard on your family. But if this is what you two have decided is the balance of labor, then you have to stop feeling guilty. You are helping when you can, and the time that you are not at home is not time *not* helping, it's just helping in a different way.  IMO, I don't think mama is being very fair here. If she's giving you hell because you are not there through the hard times she's having, it's because she's not recognizing how hard it is for you to get up and leave your family every morning to go make the money that gives the both of you the ability to create this family.  There is the possibility of some form of post partum depression here, but overall I think mom is feeling overwhelmed (just from what you described) and I think she's taking it out on you.   You need to talk. This could get a lot worse, and if things are the way you describe them, you can't change things. You have to work. She has to care for the baby. Time to sit down and work this out, and if you can't, it's counseling time.  This is a serious issue, and if you have a good support network (parents/church/friends/etc) maybe get them involved, but stop feeling guilty for doing what you have to do. It's not healthy for you, and not healthy for baby.            Still haven't pulled the trigger on the 3....I've already got 3 Sharks in the bag, I'd have to give something else up to pop it in there. River? Amp? Hmmm, maybe my Zombeee?   Now I don't feel so lonely.   I love the Shark. I putted with the Shark exclusively for the first five years I played. I still use the Shark on iffy puts from outside my comfort zone, but am slowly transitioning to Anodes.   My game has gotten better since weaning myself off of my Shark addiction (still my go to fairway and upshot choice) but while I can sink the long ones now with the Anodes, I still pull off a minor miracle every now and again and ring the chains from distance with the Shark.   Good on you, fellow Sharker, go with what works, and ignore the hivemind...but don't let habit get in your way of making improvements, either.       I don't know how it would work in hilly terrain; I don't play on hills, but I put an air bounce shot towards a short basket. Throw nose up with a straight putter that won't fade, and as it gives up its energy, it will float down almost vertical, with just a light fade. Got a hole on my home course that I use that shot on often, and I can't chain it that way, I guarantee the bird.   I had a very similar power problem on approach shots for quite a long time....75' to 100' feet out, should be able to plop it right next to the basket, and I would sit 20' or 30' out from it.  A local on my home course said he dealt with the same problem, and approaches it two ways.  One, if the shot is clear, he overpowers and takes a big hyzer line, arcing into place into of a straight shot. (It took a while to practice it, but I can do that with some finesse now)  Two, if a straight approach is necessary, target a tree/bush/garbage can/random junkie that's about 20-30'+ *past* the basket (that's the distance I was having trouble with) and try to shoot *through* the basket to the target beyond it. Improved my approach game quickly, and now it's automatic for me on upshots; can plop 'em down with little trouble. I applied that same thinking to a lot of my longer putts and have been sinking 'em from farther out, too.      The dollar store may be your friend, but the internet may save your life. Save up some money, get a pre-loaded Visa gift card (or equivalent) and visit an on-line sex shop and purchase something safe! Not everything laying about your house is safe to go jammin up yer bum.   You mentioned your sister, and I have no idea why, because I don't think that she would fit up there.   If you're worried about them, you're not going to be able to stop thinking about them, so use that energy and apply it to something else.   Work on some sort of crafty thing that you think will make them happy. A homemade card, a photo collage, a custom made get well gift. Write a short story about them as a superhero.   Doesn't really matter what, whatever art it is that you do/have, use that energy in a positive way to influence that art/craft, plus you have a great gift to share when that loved one/family member returns home!

        (rich whites) do have the power to continue to suppress the economic mobility of poor people  But basketball players!!!11!!! MURICAN DREAM!![Insert additional anecdotes that belie statistics to support the bullshit idea that there is a ladder to financial success in this country in line with American exceptional-ism]   It's not "an internal affair" - it's being covered by media outlets all over the world. Some foreign media outlets have been covering it extensively and even sent correspondents (some of whom were arrested by American policy) to further investigate. When authorities in your country appear to be doing ridiculous things and the world is interested - its no longer an 'internal affair' - this is not some liqour store robbery...   So, basically, all the facts were true, but the conclusion that should be drawn is not as simplistic as the one he offered?  By analogy, OP reads "80% of blacks more likely to flunk out of school due to socio-economic conditions and disparity in public education quality in less affluent neighborhoods that are predominantly non-white. It's not because of race or inherent cultural differences, but directly casual to poverty" and then begins to post all over reddit "blacks inherently stupid, nigger stupidity irreversible - 80% blackies flunk - see link. This is science inb4 stormfront, racist"  Yes, the fact is true, but the fact itself is drawn from a study written to dispel the exact conclusion OP was coming to. OP is citing facts from a source, and interpolating the **exact** conclusions the study is arguing against. Hopefully that helps...   There's a lot more fucked than just the electoral college when it comes to systemic problems.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5b3M4vdJc8 index=11 list=LLX-zuJEf4Rdu4R1TMRDfiAA   Because at the time of his death, all we had to go on was the police fabrication that he was threatening the cops with his fake sword. You can't raise fuck-all with a story like that. As for Mike, outside of the Fox News watching half of the country, the fact that somebody stole some cigars and was than gunned down cold in an unrelated shooting certainly isn't controversial - let alone that being a crook isn't a good reason to get gunned down.   Killed someone? Lied about the situation leading up to it? How is this not a murder one?  Because the gov prosecutor is supposed to bring criminal charges - they can't be brought by third parties. Since a branch of government has a monopoly over the pursuit of such cases, and the envisioned separation of government into multiple parts has become an effective facade in modern times, no charges can or will ever be brought. Unless the prosecutor has a grudge with a particular cop.   I think what we're saying is that if the opportunity presented itself, we would loot the pharmacy. That's it, that's all.  That's exactly what I described you as: **Opportunistic** worthless criminals, exploiting the death of a kid and potential abuse of authority by cops to get your fix   Totally. Ferguson and ISIS led to this. The amount of baseless speculation in the 'news' is getting ridiculous.   Typical opiate troll, this bumps for you.  Oh - I don't mind at all. If it wasn't for junkies like you, I would've never got out the shit hole to the suburbs...  I'm just commenting on how you guys play to stereotypes in this sub so well. Opportunistic worthless criminals, exploiting the death of a kid and potential abuse of authority by cops to get your fix (at least in your imagination). I love it.   Darren Wilson was not acquitted of murder. The Grand Jury doesn't rule on innocence or guilt. They ruled that it wasn't even worth charging him and allowing the judicial system to determine innocence or guilt. False Analogy.   I know the first place I would hit would be the pharmacies. I would have so many pills, I would be set for a good minute. Anyone else thinking they would do this if they had an opportunity like this?   Junkies living up to popular perception - nice!   Can you show a comparison of the money "in huge amounts" for ea side?   Instead - the cops picked up the rocks that were thrown by the kids. This is not gonna end well. Cameras - from guys who were taking photos and videos coming in from the police side, quickly turn away.

Bigots tend to be retarded though so no biggie.   I know that they're very unorthodox and would be deemed heretical, but how did this stuff all start?  His political followers came from a large region. Some of them knew nothing about Islam, a lot about their old religions, and he wasn't able to focus on these issues due to the rebellions during his caliphate and he didn't rule long enough to do so either.   It is an Alawite belief then, not a Shi'a one, there is a difference.  Alawiyya is as much an off-shoot of tashayu as Ithna Ashariyya   1.5 billion people call themselves Muslim. If there's *any* idea about *anything* in the world, I'm sure you'll be able to find representations of it. That said, unlike with Jews in modern times, Muslim groups are less inclined to embrace these variances.  And unlike differences between a Talmudist and a Karaist, the difference between the sects isn't on simply (how do we interpret the holy book) - but different sources of religious material. So in addition to the Qur'an, Sunnis rely on certain books of Prophetic tradition like Muwatta of Imam Malik (~750 AD), Musnad Ahmed (~840 AD), Sahih Muslim (~860 AD) to name a few. Amongst Sunnis, you'll have a bunch of different interpretations (comparable to the Sages arguing issues in the Talmud). But different sects rely on their own books. For most of the major sects, like Ibadi Muslims in Oman and Zaydi Shi'ites (not to be confused with the version of Shi'ism predominant elsewhere) in Yemen, these traditions aren't fundamentally different from Sunni traditions. Many of the traditions are shared - especially since Orthodox/Sunni scholars were meticulous in sourcing reports, and collecting reports - while other Orthodox/Sunni scholars focused on authenticating reports.  The main difference comes with the major branch of Shi'ism in modern times, Ithna Ashari Shi'ism. They have their own religious texts that are generally anti-thetical to Sunni texts. In fact, the fundamental idea of the sect is that the early leaders of Shi'ism were preaching one thing to everybody (and hence why Sunnis have very Sunni leaning reports from the purported originators of Ithna Ashari Shi'ism) - while preaching a secret message to their devout followers. That's why you'll notice if you flip open to a page in a Shi'ite hadith book on a particular legal topic, like saying the word 'Amen' as part of the first prayer, that there are several reports and they mostly unresolvablely contradict each other. One of those reports is what the leader is known to have publicly said about the issue, while the other is his purported secret teaching. They have their own books of religious tradition like al-Kafi (~940 AD), al-Istisbar (~1000 AD), etc.  This branch itself is divided into 3 primary sub-sects: Usoolis, Akhbaris and Sheykis. We won't get into Sheykhis. Usoolis basically argued for a more Sunni style science of tradition (relying on authentication of traditions, Sunni concepts like 'consensus' as a basis for law, etc.). They didn't adopt Sunni religious texts, just some simplistic applications of more refined Sunni hadith sciences. Akhbaris were the more textually inclined, but didn't adopt Sunni-style authentication and favored a more subjective basis for verifying traditions.   I think that's an interesting point. I would argue though that suggesting that God must be in this world, which is itself a confined space, requires God to be confined in something material - or at least a "part" of God to be so confined. Would you believe that God is confined, or a part of God is confined, or that God is subdivided into parts? More importantly, I don't believe that our existence is 'real' in the sense that God is literally "The Reality" in Islam, and our plane of existence is itself not something from within which we can ever truly grasp the existence of what brought it about.  To me - that question is a lot like the 'Can God make a rock so heavy that he himself can not lift it' paradox. We affirm that God is unbounded, undivided, infinite and so forth. Than we suggest that God brought into our perception of existence a bounded, divided, finite space. Is God in that space or outside of that space? Or is the question itself flawed?   It surprisingly manifests itself in sects of all major religions and some religions (like Sikhi) are completely based on it.  IMO, that's not surprising. If there is an idea, and enough multi-cultural interaction, and the population proclaiming a faith is large, it'll eventually be host to tons of differing ideas. Some of those ideas will die off and we'll never hear about them again, other ideas once niche may become mainstream. Sometimes those ideas will develop in enough of a bubble for something new to be formed and completely new philosophies/religions in entirety can be developed.  In Sikhism, you have for example your more mainstream adoption of the last book as the final Guru while I personally know of at least one sect that has a living Guru even today. The later idea seems to have died off for the most part today, but given the breadth of the religion now in Punjab anyways, it's not hard to find different expressions of it while it's still a very young religion.  Re:Pantheism's expression in Sikhism -India already had a Pantheistic tradition as you know and Muslims/Hindus living far closer than in other areas Muslims occupied - so it would make sense to me that Guru Nanak Gee would've taken some of the ideas from the ancient traditions preserved by Hinduism and incorporated them in Islamic philosophy - then again, we probably have a fundamentally different understanding of what Guru Nanak Gee was accomplishing.  I don't think its completely unworkable within Islam, otherwise Ibn Arabi and others wouldn't have tried. But I feel it already exists to the extent that the 'Knowledge of God' (his ability to perceive) is all existing and all encompassing. In that sense - whereever you are, he's there.  I guess it was easier in Judaism (Kabbalah) because they didn't have a strong opinion on the afterlife.  I think it also has to do with the strain of Judaism that survived and is now mainstream. Judaism took on tons of expressions over the world with new innovators, prophets, Messiahs, Saints, Scholars and what-not. Today, to be a Jew has become so broad, you can have two people who don't agree on anything still be ascribed to the same grouping. It's the ideal environment for Kabbalah to become far more popular than it was in the past when it was confined to a few regions.   I am willing to look with brutal honesty  Brutal honesty? You're simply repeating the same tired absurdities.  The Almohads (Sunni followers of madhab al-Zahiri)  There you go again. The almohads didn't follow the defunct madhab (which is a school of law - following the school of law doesn't make you Sunni regardless if your aqeedah isn't Orthodox...), even if their legal system was inspired by it. Their leader Ibn Tumart declared himself the Mahdi - given that the world did not end, in Sunnism, he could not have been the Mahdi. Contemporary Orthodox scholars condemned him and his sect. His Messianic sect has no real association to Orthodoxy just because they gained control of some regions - or to 'the generality of Muslims'...  There were sects and expressions of Islam  Which are irrelevant to the initial assertion I was disputing if they have no tie to the majority of Muslims over the generations - Ahlus Sunnah...those cults killed more Orthodox Muslims than they killed Jews, what's disingenuous is your conflating aberrant sects with Muslims as a generality. It's no different than if I had treated Jews as some sort of monolithic entity and conflated violent expressions of Messianic Judaism through the ages with - Chabbad for instance...its an imbecilic over-simplification.  He himself on a very personal level knew the ravages of Islam and spoke about them in his letter to the Jews of Yemen who themselves faced brutal oppression at the hands of yet another Islamic sect:   You either enjoying talking about stuff you know nothing about or happen to be a very dishonest individual. That letter - assuming it was actually Maimonides who wrote it - was specifically referring to Shi'ites - who've killed far more Sunnis over 1,000 years than Jews, that were ravaging the Jews of Yemen. And of course, let's completely ignore a violent Jewish Messianic movement that was taking root in Yemen concurrently - because of course its just evil Muslims massacring Jews randomly out of the blue. Maimonides appealed to Salah-al-Din, the Orthodox Muslim leader to handle the mess and save the Jews - but hey that's unimportant to the narrative of random persecution by the generality of Muslims...   It is well known that the Quran has a rule that later passages super-cede previous passages.   You mean naskh (abrogation) in Islamic law? Can you show me where any Muslim scholar has suggested that the prohibition of killing clergy is mansukh?   Thought about it for 2 min, and I was just being preposterous and regurgitating somebody else's stupid conspiratorial claim.  The reason that post is at the top and this one is at the bottom is that the members of the sub are collectively pandering imbeciles.    It's an endless cycle that needs to stop.  The same could've been said about the 'endless' tit for tat between Muslims and the Crusaders. Nothing is endless.  Thinking that things will get better through violence is mindless nonsense.  Things won't improve through mindless violence like this. But there isn't really a way to organize, or for the occupied people to make hijrah and regroup for the future. They're between a rock and a hard place.   I understand where you're coming from, and the knee-jerk reaction to defend against potentially false claims against a minority. But it doesn't look like you've actually looked into this riwayah or its versions for us to really have a meaningful discussion on it instead of going about in loops. This'll be my last post on the topic  - but feel free to look into it further on your own.  But then why does he say   ? Why wouldn't he just say  ?   That's irrelevant to the fact that its still tantamount to shirk (the guy who's statement I was simply providing evidence for and got dragged into). Qaseem Allah still makes him *The Judge*, even if the interpretation is that he was appointed by Allah to be the Judge. The same way saying that the Aimah are all-hearing and can comprehend all languages, by a miracle of God, still flys in the face of what Monotheism means. A sect of Christians used to believe that God pre-existed but assigned Jesus to create the Universe. Taking His attributes, and reassigning them to intermediaries, even if you're still verbally affirming tawhid is still shirk. Being The Judge on the Day/Creator are some of those particular things exclusive to Him.  And again, you seem to be ignoring the footnote of the source you provided  We must be reading something different, in both footnotes, the editor is affirming that the world is divided amongst those who acknowledge their wilayah and those who reject it...it's not saying that he isn't actively doing the division himself of the people into the places - just explaining what the division is about...  and it's a pretty terrible translation of al-Kafi.  Compared to what? It's the *only* translation into English of this much of al-Kafi...And I'd hardly think somebody who's 'Arabic isn't the best' is in a position to call this translation 'terrible' because (like any translation) there are mistakes.  [source: Al-Mustadarak Ala Al-Sahiheen, volume 3, page 134; footnote says sahih though some Sunni scholars say the chain is weak]  Apologies in advance if I'm coming off pretentious - but here you're conflating **this narration** with completely separate narrations - instead of looking at other versions of this same narration say or even the context I showed of this narration itself - which is leading you to your anachronistic interpretation (that mirrors the Sunni sanitization in Tabaqat Hanabila of a very very short version of this saying that doesn't have the context I provided you from al-Kafi - or any of the other additions beyond the asl). There are other versions of *this* narration on that same exact page of al-Kafi which provide the obvious meaning that I alluded without the apologetic gymnastics you require to sanitize it:       ,**       ** ,    . He's *acting* in that narration, literally doing the determination (). There are tons more versions of these statements with various phrases about how he'll judge in Bihar al Anwar as well...                          http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1457_%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A2%D9%A6/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_128  Care to explain to me how he's taking the names of the people in Heaven and Hell (and using it) if it isn't him Judging and he's simply a basis for the Judgement done by Allah himself. I don't know how you can get clearer than that on what the narration obviously means...    It's just disgusting to see people come to their aid trying to undermine any articles that are critical of ISIS.   What's disgusting is your mentality. Let's throw away any semblance of critical thinking because questioning an assertion by an obviously biased party is now tantamount to defending the criminals of ISIS.   The Almohads were outside of Ahlus Sunnah (Orthodox Muslims - 90% of Muslims) and he did just fine under Salah-ud-Din when his family was in Egypt...to you, there might not be a distinction - but it would be like me accusing Jews of intolerance because of what Abu 'Isa (leader of a Jewish Messianic cult from Isfahan) did. The person before me asserted a culture of intolerance amongst Muslims as a generality. The generality of Muslims are Orthodox/Sunni. There wasn't the kind of rabid antisemitism that exists today before the 1900s amongst Orthodox Muslims and Maimonides' success in his adult life under Orthodox Muslim rule in Orthodox Muslim society is testament to that.   Cutting off the heads of the family whose daughter they couldnt rape isnt that surprising.  'I wouldn't be surprised if you did something like this - therefore let's not even question it and just assume you did'  I hope most people don't think like you.  Does the iraqi government really need more propaganda against ISIS? They do a damn fine job of showing how much of a filthy human beings they are.  It appears that producers of the propaganda feel that [they have needed propaganda](http://revolution-news.com/fake-isis-news-triple-verify-graphic-images/) and [such propaganda has been exposed on multiple occassions](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/claims-isis-buried-women-and-children-alive-should-be-treated-carefully--lJIsWao2Ml).  It's not like the Iraqi govt has any sort of moral high ground demanding that any reasonable person accept anything they say about the conflict w/out question **(NSFL)**.

Your understanding of it means qasim/faruq have effectively the same meaning - so 'Ali is mindlessly repeating "I am the Divider between Heaven and Hell AND I am the Great Divider" - That's the point of the context I provided, Qasim here means (noun) someone who distributes. Not someone who is the basis for a division done by somebody else. [And this is how Shi'ite scholars translated it as well](http://www.al-shia.org/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part4/part4-ch14.htm) and I'm sure it wouldn't take me all of 20 minutes to find Shi'ite scholars corroborating my plain and obvious reading of that Shi'ite tradition (versus the sanitizing here).   My mom heard from an Egyptian once that you believe Ishmael went up to be sacrificed by Abraham, but the Torah says that it was Yitzchak/Isaac. You were taught that also? Did you learn that Isaac antagonized Ishmael also or was it not addressed much, their relationship?  It's actually not very clear in Islam, and it also isn't considered important either (it's not an article of faith unlike for Christians because of certain NT passages). Since neither the Qur'an nor Hadith are clear about it, Muslims relied on Israeliyat (traditions of the Jews in Muslim territories) and these Jews narrated contradictory narrations. Some said Isaac, some said Ismael. Muslim scholars by majority seem to have adopted that Ismael was to be slaughtered. I've heard a case can be made for it being Ismael from the Torah as well unless you consider the Hebrew version of the Torah as absolute and preserved.   Doesn't sound like he knew much about his own religion and its reverence for Moses than.   Blaming the Jews for widespread antisemitism? That's bold. And baseless. Fuck you with a rusty crowbar. The earliest recorded act of Arab antisemitism in the modern era was the Damascus Affair in 1840. French monks imported the blood libel to harm the local Jewish population for local Christian gain. Antisemitism is a mind-virus that spreads like wildfire; it's very easy for a population to hate the Other and very tempting for those in power to use scapegoats for their own ends.  The question isn't about the earliest recorded act of antisemitism. The issue here is when "antisemitism among the Islamic community started to flourish". If you want to pretend that antisemitism in the community that brought you Maimonides just came up out of nowhere because Muslim communities just randomly became intolerant and antisemitic for no reason whatsoever out of thin air, that's bold. And baseless.   The title of Ali as the distributor of heaven and hell is mentioned in a few Sunni books  Saying "Sunni books" doesn't mean the narration is a Sunni narration, or an authentic narration. Sunni books have quotes from early Shi'ites, Kharijjis, etc. etc. etc. Simply pointing to a gharib hadith in an obscure book isn't the same as these things actually being a part of anybody's aqeeda.   Kanz ul Ummal  Kanz ul Ummal is a tertiary source, you need to find the asl of the narration to a different book if you want to suggest this is a Sunni belief, or even a truly Sunni tradition.  Tabaqat al-Hanabilah  This explanation of the tradition by Ahmed b. Hanbal, which is sanitizing the obvious meaning of the tradition, is from several hundred years after him and also without a chain. But you're comparing this sanitized Sunni reinterpretation of a likely fabricated Imami Shi'ite tradition (in its origin) that is *indisputably* referring to 'Ali as the Judge on Yawm ul Qiyamah (see the full context in the link):   :           http://www.alseraj.net/maktaba/kotob/hadith/kafi1/html/ara/books/al-kafi-1/78.html  and the hadith mentioned by Ibn Hanbal is found in Sahih Muslim:   There's no dispute surrounding that hadith. The ahadith in question are the ones that support the other guy's claim that Imami Shi'ism supports the idea that 'Ali, and not Allah, is the judge on the Day of Judgement on God's behalf. This is tantamount to shirk as the Qu'ran is pretty clear on Allah directly, and exclusively, being the one you answer to.   After all, if God is always separate from creation, how could He draw near to us or us to Him?  I don't know that ought to read it as Him drawing near at all necessary. It's simply a poetic statement about how we should try to draw close to God and we'll be recompensed for it by Him in a way that's disproportionately beneficial to us - as I see it.  that is God doing an action that we are experiencing here in time and space, not in the realm of God.   Doing an action within Space/Time, versus Him existing bi-dhatihi in Space/Time is different IMO. The fact that He is the One who originated Space/Time through the Big Bang, or what-have-you, already necessitates that He is able to act on Space/Time without being in it.   There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.  I don't know about this incitement against Jews in the Muslim world. I've been fortunate enough to meet, or know of through others, Jewish communities that thrive in Morroco, Syria and Iran. An incitement against Israel? Sure. But against Jews that have been living in Muslim countries for generations and aren't (at least not overtly) gung-ho on the Israel issue, doesn't seem to generally be an issue.  There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.  Nobody in the Muslims world doesn't accept the existence of Israel. It's hard not to accept that there isn't a place called 'Israel' on the map nowadays. If you're saying that you hope Muslims would just cow-tow to this recent geo-political change though and accept the new state of affairs into perpetuity, then you've misunderstood your neighbors. The Crusaders lived in Palestine for generations. They had children, and their children had children and their children's children had children -all before those who refused to live as subjects of Salah al-Din were sent packing. As much as you want to maintain the status quo, and many Muslims want to revert it, only time will tell how the Middle East will look in 50 years.   It wasn't until after the crusades that antisemitism among the Islamic community started to flourish.  I don't think its attributable to post-Crusades - I think there's a point in the early 1700s when the more successful Jewish Messianic agitations started and the early 1900s when the first overtly Zionist 'Aliyah's began that led to modern issues.   link?   But I don't know if those views take them outside the fold of Islam.   It wouldn't - it might take them out of the jama' if there are some institutionalized ideas/practices aberrant from the jama' - but I don't think its a valid basis for takfir. Deobandis in Pakistan/India tend to be critical of some of these ideas but the foremost sub-continent scholar, Mufti Taqi Usmani wrote a rather [balanced piece](http://www.deoband.org/2010/05/hadith/hadith-commentary/wahdat-al-wujud-wahdat-al-shuhud-and-the-safest-position/) on the topic.  A lot of poets used language that may be considered shirk in common place talk, but they are given the benefit of the doubt (I believe Imam al Ghazali discussed this issue as well) without endorsing any literal understanding of their statements.  The key idea of tawheed seems to be that the Creator and Creation are separate and will always remain separate. Despite being closer to you than your jugular vein, Allah does not actually exist there.  Exactly - its a matter of context. Wahdatul Wujood is based on mindlessly literal interpretations of statements like that (against the norm of the scholarship). There are other traditions which state things like 'God approaches you as you approach him', 'if you walk to God, God will run to you' - where likewise, mindlessly literal interpretations that fly against the general consensus of their reading would lead to the opposite of Wahdatul Wujood, even possibly to outright anthropomorphism.   Right - because the Iraqi government (the source of this claim) certainly couldn't have made this up. We all know ISIS is barbaric but the amount of straight up retarded propaganda being put out is ridiculous.   Ridiculous concepts like infallibility of aimah may not be shirk, but making 'Ali Maliki yawm ad-din is most definitely shirk....   I'm not saying to walk around toting guns like some of these modern confederacy loving nutjobs. But having *the ability* to defend yourself by arming yourself, under your fourth amendment rights isn't an insane concept to me. Keep spreading honey, but keep a gun in case the bear comes.   In LA, New York, Chicago and Seattle - I've seen people sleeping and tweaking out only a few blocks away from high end boutique shops in downtown areas. Yes, it's generally not directly under the boutique stores so you can say the image is an exaggeration in applying it to most 'Western' states - but you're just missing the point than.   Part of that is that Judaism, unlike Islam or Christianity, started as the religion of a tribe more than a universal Truth.  However, Judaism has been a more conversion-centric religion in the past.  This doesn't make sense to me. On the one hand, you mention yourself that ancient Judaism was a proselytizing religion (Khazars, magicians in the court of Pharoah, several passages about how the Temple was intended to invite goyyim etc. are some examples). At the same time, you're suggesting that ancient Judaism was more of a "tribe" than a "universal truth" (i.e. the way it is today). That appears to be a contradiction to me - but maybe you can explain more where you're coming from here?   ISIS seems barbaric and heartless.  ISIS leadership is barbaric. Some people do believe in Shariah, but don't take the actions attributed to ISIS as being Shariah. Their most recent apparent execution of a man who converted to Islam before he was taken into captivity isn't even allowed under any interpretation of Orthodox Islamic treatment of POWs for instance.  But then again, you're lumping up ISIS - its a large group of loosely knit together groups. Some of these groups have been responsible for positive things in Iraq and Syria, such as maintaining the safety of Hindu female nurses and returning them to India without a ransom or anything - rebuilding roads, public transportation, court systems, welfare distribution, etc.  My western society seems so much better with much more freedom and justice.  Is it though? [Look around](http://i.imgur.com/k0Cowji.jpg). The amount of destitution, serial homelessness, complete neglect of the mentally ill, depression/suicide, no qualms with commercializing female sexuality (almost exclusively), selling your life away to a 9-5 - drinking yourself retarded to forget on the weekends - and hoping you live long enough to cash in on social security, mass exploitation of your elderly by casino/gambling industries, **Comcast** - it isn't justifiable in countries with GDP that happens to be multiples of GDP of countries with greater levels of polled human contentment around the world.   I found it interesting that action fans cared most about directors. But at the same time, I feel like that metric might be a bit skewed by all the people using Google to determine if Uwe Boll directed so they can avoid the film like the plague.   It's basically a large info-graphic advertisement for the entertainment industry to adopt more of the professional services Google offers in its Youtube brand.   Few corrections. It was there before Mohammed, but after a flood and before he started preaching Islam, he helped the tribes over a conflict of who gets to replace it.  Pilgrims also aren't pointing to it, but they do touch/kiss it. Umar, the second Caliph of the Muslims after Mohammed, reportedly said in front of other Muslims (to the stone), "I know you're a rock and can't benefit and harm anyone, I wouldn't kiss you had I not seen our Prophet kiss you." He was exclaiming that he's carrying on a tradition, out of love for his predecessor and not because he even understood the point behind it.   But where's Waldo?   The black stone is actually outside of the building structure.   Regardless, you're on a list now just fyi :)   There are militias all over the country, especially the south, without any popular support. They exist and thrive because they strongly believe in making use of their fourth amendment right. No need to go around killing people, but being armed and able to protect your own (what a militia effectively is) is a positive thing. As a most recent example, compare what happened at Bundy (no violence, just militias taking positions) versus the suffering all around Ferguson.   Keep rolling along. Truth is clear from falsehood.   Not even an estimate, its just a bullshit number. The Kurds want more foreign aid and intervention, making the situation appear more dire (when its actually improved) is a great way to accomplish that end.   Yes, lets pretend the Umayyads dynasties which had such precious Caliphs like Yazid were the epitome of tolerance and generosity  Right - because one anecdotal leader is reflective of the whole. His father's reign was the exact opposite of what you're accusing his of being like, with even Christian annal's reporting on how just he was (see 'Seeing Islam As Others Saw It...' - the extracts from Jon Bar Penkaye). As far as Yazid, would love to see any authentic reports on how he was 'intolerant'. Yazid had at least one Christian adviser (Sarjun) close to him for the short period of time he governed - doesn't come off as terribly intolerant...but I suppose its easier to just make things up?                                  Wow - He's talking about the divisions between these groups allowing for easy pickings / divide and conquer - from the same passage:        . At-Tusi explicitly helped and became an aide to the invaders - how on earth is al-albani's criticism of disunity and infighting even comparable to outright treason by at-Tusi in your mind?  Or even Ibn Abi al-Hadeed stated in Sharh Nahaj al-Balagha, Volume 8 page 237:  Right...Because a reference to a late religious commentary by a Mutazili Shi'ite scholar, on a Shi'ite religious book - that has no asl for half the narrations it contains with a sanad in any reputable religious text of Sunnis or Shi'ites - is a great basis for **a historical claim**...  Finally, if At-Tusi was such an evil man as per this fairy-tale of an allegation, ibn Khaldun wouldn't have ever studied at-Tusi's famous works.  Brilliant logic. If you don't like a person, you'll refuse to benefit from their knowledge. I hope it works out for you - but historically, that's not how Sunni scholars operated. Every book of history and ahadith has plenty of reports from non-Sunnis, even political opponents like Khawwarij. Orthodox scholarship's openness to benefit from the information recorded, even by political opponents isn't an indictment of them or an exoneration of the man in question for what he did to Baghdad.    I don't think things are simple as making their own laws, issues about leadership (which started this) will arise, and it seems like one group will try to dominate the other, as seems to be the case historically.   I agree - it won't solve the succession problem, but it eliminates tensions that arise in modern systems. In spite of any violence under the Ottoman's over power, there was nothing like the random sectarian intra-religious violence in former Ottoman regions today. I don't think that style of decentralization is impossible in modern times either - the Ottoman's fell like 100 years ago. That's a lot of time for you and me, but in the grand scheme of things, their collapse was pretty modern and they seemed to be doing just   The fact of the matter is that Islam doesn't seem to be a uniting force at the moment, and with all the bad blood between Sunnis and Shias  I'd argue the opposite. Sunnis today are more tolerant of one another than ever in history after all four of the madhahib had become well-established. You don't get Hanafis beefing with Shafi'is for the most part and so on. You have disagreements, but they're dealt with in populist munazaras, not out in the street with fists or guns. There were certain points in time when there used to be riots about these issues. Sunnis and Ithna Ashari Shi'ites + Alawis may not be close - but that's 90% of people who call themselves Muslim vs 9%. Likewise, Sunnis and Ibadis have gotten closer than ever in history in modern times as well. We keep seeing the results of one or two conflicts blasting our news station that paint a much bleaker picture, IMO.   I didn't suggest that 'sectarianism' is inherent in the "shariah of Allah". Just that the peachy view you suggested of Sunni-Shi'ite relations isn't as close to reality as you'd probably like.  People can turn sects into political groups or tribes and use them as an excuse to kill each other.  The issue here is that Ithna Ashari Shi'ism, as a sect, is inherently a political group that vyes with any existing system. Especially post Safavid Ithna Ashari Shi'ism, most especially modern Usooli Ithna Ashari Shi'ism after Khomayni's introduction of waliyat-ul-faqih in Shi'ism, replacing the need for somebody to pretend to be a Shi'ite Mahdi to establish political dominion.  Yes, people can manipulate religions for power politics - and yada yada yada - but Sunni religious texts don't promote competition with existing power, even if the ruler isn't a jolly fellow, as long as the ruler is Muslim. Sunni political quietism even allowed praying behind Khawwarij that took over territories. Or the non-violent responses of people like Ahmed b. Hanbal to 'heretical' ideas being imposed by the Amir of his time.   Everyone wants to end bloodshed, which is why the popular solution to this sectarianism seems to be secularism.  Dunno how popular that solution is, but it isn't always a working solution. After the Ottomon's, who ruled with some sort of Islamic law and allowed parties paying jizya to rule according to their own laws, we had secularism across much of their former territories. It only gave rise to violence along ethnic, religious and sectarian lines - along with newer, violence along ideological lines. Adding more abstractions and calling people to them only makes the violence worse, imo.   Sunnis and shi'ites have been living side by side for hundreds of years.  There have been problems, but up until modern times...  What are you smoking? Shi'ite sects created their own states and fought wars with the major Caliphates since the inception of Imami Shi'ism. From the Fatimids, to the Hashashins to the Safavids (just to list the more successful examples). At-Tusi, one of the major mashaykh of modern Ithna Ashari Shi'ism and an author of several works basically personally escorted the Mongol invaders into Baghdad to rape, pillage and raze the centre of the Muslim world.   The Daily Mail. /R/WorldNews' favorite bullshit tabloid.   None of these got shit on Fox news.   If you can't beat them, let them beat themselves up.  Several red states have been beating themselves up economically. They still vote Republican. Because Jesus.  Same way blue states have been eating their own shit for ages. They still vote Democrat. Because butt-secks.   What's the point? Our senators [will just filibuster him](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/us-senator-filibusters-live-coverage-powerful-palestinian-testimonies). Informed democracy and all.   No, they are most def not lol. And also, how many republican Jews do u know?  Koch is a pretty Jewish last name...and being Jewish doesn't mean. Nice ignorant generalization of Jews as some sort of monolithic entity.  but as other commenters point out, that's a pretty easy citizenship to obtain  Uh ya...if you've got at least one Jewish grand-parent, easy as pie....   The title is a blatant rip-off of the Vice video from a while back.  I wonder where they're selling their oil though - as it looks like the entire thing is built on their take-over of Syrian production.   Their economy seems to be entirely based on black market oil. Who's buying their oil?   Of course the eventual demise of the Zionist entity in the Middle East is approaching, sooner rather than later.  Every Arab country with a military capable of actually taking on Israel has been thrown into chaos. Not so sure about your take on this.   Ah - gotcha. Executions don't make for exciting footage. IMO, its not much different from an explosion though. Actually, a far more humanizing reminder of why we naturally are repulsed by war.   What do you expect? When you remove people's ability to express themselves democratically, all you get is bloodshed.   but I just can't take actually watching these videos anymore.  Really? I've said it once and I'll say it again - the production value these guys are putting out is amazing. I've watched a lot of videos over the years put out by different governments to propogandize their military achievements. What's being produced by these non-state actors is some of the best by far.  This one is just a long propaganda clip with a bunch of action (executions, drive-bys, battles, explosions) with a bunch of Arabic anasheed in the background. It starts by encouraging people to oppose 'oppression' and then breaks into the various clips of their activities in the region as well as some posing (going into sujood near large explosions). Very well-edited, practically professionally. They have explosions for instance which if you got a keen eye, you'll know they threw into the video even though they didn't connect. They also use great effects. Around the middle of the film they begin their standard preaching and what-not (the boring stuff) but get right back into the combat footage after a few min.  Edit: Also noticed that whereas with ISIS videos and the like, a lot of the fighters are obviously older men. This video - they're all kids. Almost everyone in the video is under 25. The video is very tailored to the kids without jobs who likely lost family members or friends during the Sisi coup.   The results of protracted, perpetual war. Your enemy improvises and becomes more adept.   Can you post the translation directly here (or in a self-post)?   People who don't understand how the blockchain works believe bitcoin provides true anonymity (in spite of the premise being that it runs on a public ledger). Anonymity is key to criminal and terrorist organizations.   Which is why they'll have average citizens of IS trade in their common currencies. They'll use that currency as needed, but the cities under them will conduct commerce with the new coinage. If this reporting is accurate    Probably no punishment, but you can imagine they'd issue an edict that everybody needs to transfer their common floating currencies in exchange for ISIS dinars. They'd implement it the same the United States did when each of them moved away from gold and average citizens were robbed under threat of imprisonment.  ISIS is also largely a welfare 'government' - so there wouldn't be too much seizing necessary to boot.   They have plenty of territories under their control. Trade functions in literally the same way as it does in any other place in Syria/Iraq. People still work in local industry, or they join militias for money, and they participate in local markets (buying food, books, etc.)   I don't think it's the mayor. Quality mainstream journalism is at an all time low.   Also expected that they seize a lot of gold jewelry from men, it being haram and all.  Men wearing gold in the non-upper classes of the Arab world isn't as popular as it is in the ghettos of America. I doubt they would have much to seize.   They've designed a Caliphate in the modern age with zero air power, and attracted some of the best-equipped militaries around the world to fight a proxy war against them. I don't think they'll let a little bit of 'lack of preperation' or 'not enough metal' get in the way of their delusions.   Guy's got huge balls but no brain (pun intended)   The whole point of getting what will soon be a rare collectible piece is to keep it in mint condition. You melt it down, and that value is gone.   Video is removed - no mirror?   They should be - this is a pretty big step for violent non-state actors, one of unprecedented ingenuity.   isis apologist??? hhhhhhh. I just don't believe in the black-and-white good-and-evil story tale of world history and current events...  As you say yourself, there are people like yourself who 'as bad as isis is, we are worse' - that's all I suggested.   Taliban eradicated it because they had a hold of power. When they came under attack they needed a quick and easy supply of money, and thus they re-planted the opium fields again.   You sound like you're insinuating that NATO is behind the increase in opium cultivation, and that is complete BS. You belong in /r/conspiracy if that is the case.   Except...that you're full of it. Even after the invasion, they had prohibited opium production whereas [NATO was explicitly allowing it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6589113.stm). In fact - NATO was advertising itself to the common man under that EXACT premise (we allow you to grow opium - Taliban doesn't). You are categorically wrong - that article is from *well* after the invasion while opium production was beginning to rise again.   You can't take one case to be representative of the whole given that Daesh has a very autonomous structure.   Not to mention that Israel has intermittently launched strikes against SAA hardware at various points in time, including during the recent rebellion.   yes i know i have issues.  You absolutely do.   What you are supporting is that Iraqis should stoop down to the level of these barbaric Daesh dogs.  Stoop down? No doubt Daesh are barbaric, but I don't know of one credible assertion of torture by them. The closest thing to torture that they've provable done would be their **allowing** Rafah citizens to beat Syrian soldiers to death. They kill their captives and don't give the 'right of repentance' to Shi'ite prisoners - sure. But that's not the same as torture. Whereas Shi'ite militias have been torturing Sunni captives to death since the removal of Saddam:  [The Independent 2005](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/britishtrained-police-in-iraq-killed-prisoners-with-drills-516158.html) [Amnesty 2013](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/iraq-torture-2013-06-28)  And mind you, this isn't the selective torture that Saddam or the United States have been accused of for gathering intel. This is pure sadism, they were literally torturing men to death with one military objective over the last several years. You don't turn a majority Sunni city (like Baghdad) into a majority Shi'ite one without some persuasive techniques. ISIS didn't gain this clout in a vaccum, there's plenty of context. If you followed Golden Brigade on Facebook prior to our recent entry into that country (that's a US elite trained group within the Iraqi army) - you would've seen videos (NSFW) [like this](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) proudly posted on their page.  We might hear about the crimes of one side more often, but if you critically look at the evidence, its a bit hard to establish moral high ground for any particular side.   The big losers from this will be the Palestinians and rioting Israeli-Arabs.  Maybe - but there will be **no winners**. None.   They kill POWs, as well as torture them and desecrate corpses. Daish doesn't have some kind of monopoly on executing POWs. Daesh manages to capture and kill more in a single sitting **and** brag about it in high-production value propaganda videos. Doesn't mean army/Shi'ite militias don't do it - in fact, I've got quite the depressing collection of videos to the contrary.   These guys rival Daesh in production quality   It's a conspiracy theory about the video. A pretty shitty one if you know anything about guns or camera phones. But skepticism is always a step in the right direction so I guess this may be a good thing in a way.   Because they're evil and they hate Jews for no reason.   Can someone explain why Kobane matters to **anybody** militarily? Minus all the so-called symbolic bs...   Best part is, we have to assume they can't use the internet from within Syria. Somebody had to get the video to Turkey/Lebanon to upload. And somehow they still pull off with better video editing and live reporting than the white house.   Can't believe this didn't hit front page - in light of everything recently..   Washingtonian here, and local history buff. Seattle grew prominent later on in the game. Olympia however was our original primary city of port commerce. In the mid-1800s when it became the capital, **everybody** thought it would be the center of the state given its than-existing role and its exponential rate of growth. It wasn't a good 30+ years later when we were about to join the union that different cities did vye for the title.   Yezidis are both an ethnicity of Kurds and also a religion that often get conflated (think Jews), especially recently. This family is Muslim.  It's really strange (for me) to be hearing about all the alleged persecution of "Satanic Yazidis" of late since I know for a fact that Mandeans and Yazidis are almost non-existent religions. But we can't play the genocide card to justify more ground troops unless we can sell a plausible story - and Muslim extremists being harsh against an obscure religion sounds about right for what we need.   Well, I'm never making it to the ruling class. Is there a waitlist for the roving marauders?   Let's hope people confront their foolishness without being run over.   A lot of people have lost friends and family members in this war. You can expect the children growing up in this conflict to be affected by it.   What's odd is that every piece of media that comes from that organization does precisely that. Everything they put out seems to help justify foreign presence.    One of the seven deadly sins is vengence/wrath...is this true in Islam?  Vengence is not a sin in Islam.  Wrath is also not, in and of itself, a sin. Islam differentiates between thoughts and actions. A "bad" thought isn't a sin. Acting on a "bad" thought is. Having a "bad" thought, and not acting on it is actually good deed.    Something like revenge might have a neutral value - it is not wrong, but it is not exactly righteous either.  You're right - and the religion treats foregoing permissible revenge as being a 'good deed'   CONGRATS! Don't care what anyone says, if you got the gall to come out while a public official, you earn a lot of my respect. That could be political suicide, even in a liberal society because y'know, people care about shit like that.   Depends on where you're located. In Seattle, the fact that the mayor was all about the butt secks is what allowed him to capitalize on voters. He than went on to repeal police reform, destroy any chance of municipal internet, diminish the effects of the $15/hr wage reform campaign - and generally every single thing he could possibly do that his progressive voters would never have anticipated.      The Iraqi army and Iraqi mobs also do the same thing. Countless videos, of explicit torture, using corpses as decals and dragging corpses through the street. Nothing in this video is unique to just ISIS or the Syrian rebels. Minus the production value on the video - that's somethiing only ISIS can pull off.   Fines disproportionately affect the poor. Corporal punishment is comparatively equitable...   Excuse me to break you, but there's now for a first time ever an actual Islamic terrorist country  The US said the same thing when Iran popped up. And when the Taliban popped up in Afghanistan. The British government was saying the same thing about what would become the Saudi Kingdom. It's not the "first time ever" - so-called "Islamic" states have long existed and Western powers have always considered them "terrorist" states.  a stated ambition to conquer no less but the entire world  Their stated ambition is to have a borderless state - capable of expansionism (as in, the sort of states that existed not even 100 years ago all over the world). So - at worst - they're people who hypothesize about perpetual war but have never experienced it. Since it's inception, the US has ACTUALLY been perpetually in conflict - not just in theory - but in **actuality**. You want to focus on scary international politics? Check your backyard.   Were my words to complex for you?  too*    Nobody else here is mentioning this? Y'all need to step up your game. This is what happens when the neo-nazis chase off all the intelligent people.  It makes more sense that they conspired to make a profit than that there was an ulterior motive with a conspiracy to eliminate particular negative genetic traits...   You rock.   The internet: where everyone makes 6 figures and has a 12 inch cock.   Mission Accomplished!   ~~This~~ war is so fucked up.  In previous 'good' wars, we justified mass civilian casualties from firebombings like Dresden to nuclear attacks against civilian populations. This war is only as bad as it is because its happening in our lifetimes.   By that logic, you can't blame ISIS or FSA for anything either. Individual units that gave their bayah to their leader, or are part of FSA, act relatively independently (with the exception of taking orders on locations to post for the former).   I don't see how you guys can conflate one anecdotal alleged assault on a guy with "OMG Turks, in general, support ISIS". It's just bad logic.   Sounds like your average nationalist, nothing special...   Nah, it's not that bad. These are just corpses. Iraqi Military Shi'ites burned alive followers of Sarkhi and used to document torture of alleged ISIS members. Here are some of the videos I've posted previously (it's part of the narrative that isn't going to be covered in typical media reports):  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/29t7z4/maliki_shiite_soldiers_cut_the_backs_of_captured/  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/2akqhz/shiite_gunmen_accused_of_mass_execution_of/  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/29xygw/malikis_shiite_soldiers_execute_tied_up_sunni_for/  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/2a124h/malikist_shiites_burn_alive_sarkhist_shiite_and/   The only way to know for sure is to invite her over and wait completely butt naked on the couch. Come back and give me gold after she bangs you and then breaks up with her man.   I do the same thing and spank their ass while yelling. Let them really know who's king of the korridor.    People shit on the floor in my store about once a week  The fuck - what city is this?   I didn't say Orthodoxy encourages secularism. The leader still upholds religious law. He's just not a source for jurisprudence. His opinion has value in that he can declare wars and what-not, but he doesn't tell you how to pray for instance.  As for ISIS, there's plenty of evidence of beheadings/mass executions - don't think I've seen anything verified suggesting they torture people.    Just out of interest, if he ever became legit, as a caliph, he is like the pope, so surely he would be refered to as "His Holiness Abu Bakr al Baghadadi"  No. In Orthodox Islam, the leader of the state isn't also (necessarily) your spiritual leader.   Let's be *a little rational here*. The source for this is quoting the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights on a statement allegedly made by al-Baghdadi. If that doesn't give you pause before blindly swallowing the claim...  Also - burning corpses and living people isn't IS modus operandi, barbaric as they are. It's more something a group we support, like the Golden Brigade from [the Iraqi Army is known to do.](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=602_1404665038) **NSFW**   No. Dave Firth isn't the idiot. You are for believing an anonymous source from the Daily Mail...   And to boot, the claim about sectarian motive was purportedly made by his anonymous friend. There is no result from the investigation yet - just a bullshit editorialized headline.   This is the daily mail, not a particularly reputable rag. There are literally *no* known facts yet. The claim that it was even a sectarian attack is entirely based on the purported statement of the man's friend.    These elections undermine the agreement   But they don't break the agreement right? Russia with the technical win.   Woah woah woah, don't be rational here. We're trying to have an anti-Russian circle-jerk and you just want to ruin the fun  3--- 3--- 3---   Yep, but certainly not as above board and legit as post war elections in Iraq and Afghanistan while those nations were still occupied, right?   Not Sunnis in general - looks like only those Sunnis who align themselves *against IS* while in territory *controlled by IS* suffer. Minus the level of brutality and summary nature of their punishments, it's not much different than aligning yourself against the government of any region you live in. Just a generally unwise thing to do, seeing as how everyone killed was [Sahwa or with the Iraqi govt apparatus](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/why-did-islamic-state-counter-terrorism-implementation-task-force-execute-over-300-sunni-albu-612737)    Don't question the repeated stories of 10-20 guys overpowering and executing hundreds. Over and over.   Yep - unbeatable KDR   The numbers sound a bit huge. These guys are really good at rounding up 100s of opponents at a time and just dumping on em.   There are **literally** over a hundred groups operating in the region. Even the major buzz-words like FSA, Shi'ite Militias, ISIS, are actually conglomerates of other smaller independent groups.  	140
 Wouldn't mind hearing Muse have a crack it. As I understand, they were being considered for Skyfall. Supposedly [Supremacy by Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avM_UsVo0IA) was their take on a Bond song, pretty catchy.   I recommend Arrow as well. The first half of Season 1 can be a bit silly as it is trying to find its footing but towards the end of Season 1 the show becomes really special imo. The character development is really great, especially for a show like Arrow. Season 2 is amazing as it becomes more of a personal battle since they bring in a pretty big villain (not going to say who), they just do a really good job of world building imo especially since they are going to cross over with the Flash as well.    That George Costanza look alike always kills me.   Hey there, I live in Sydney and visited HK for a week in Jan and loved it. Realistically how long do you think the protests can go on for before the government decides to implicate some kind of martial law? Sorry if this is a dumb question as I haven't being following the events too closely.    This may sound dumb but I really enjoyed the mid credits sequence in Fast 6.    PS4/Australia/V-MAN_24   Driveclub, I have been yearning for a racer on the PS4 since launch, NFS Rivals did very little to fill that gap unfortunately.    How the fuck are two dresses valued more than an Aston Martin DB5?   I also thought that the shot of the Star Destroyer flying overhead was pretty awesome as well.   Is the term black mark specific to PSN or just games in general.    Nooo ad break fuck you one hd   While that does suck that there will be people who will just troll race, i'm actually surprised at how smooth it looks online. Usually you have racers just appearing and lagging around most of the time.    Yeah that was was my only real gripe with the episode. I kind of preferred the blocky looking TCW wookies.    So my question here is whether Disney would allow for a gritty Star Wars cable television show for a network like HBO or among that realm of quality. Something along the lines of the Star Wars Underworld series that was promised before Disney bought Lucasfilm.    Sorry to be that guy but I am an Australian who has started to follow this subreddit due to the events happening, can someone translate this?   Hopefully if the new Star Wars Battlefront will be as epic as we hope, then you may very well be able to experience it.    To be honest I would not completely rule out marvel picking Mel Gibson to direct Iron Man 4. They tend to go with directors who aren't huge or are obscure choices, however all of them have worked out great. Here's hoping Mel gets a big gig like this, so he can flex his creative muscle.    I'm lucky enough here in Sydney to watch it on the biggest IMAX screen in the world. Ghost Protocol and Dark Knight Rises looked amazing on them. Especially in GP when Cruise is climbing the tower. [Here's a picture](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y379ux1lBg8/UFFw5EC3TwI/AAAAAAAACNw/ocDNs1BxZUM/s1600/50.jpg)  [Here's the outside](http://australia.panduanwisata.com/files/2012/08/IMAX-Theatre-Sydney-3.jpg)     Ah I see, thanks!   So did the hiring of Claire mean that the asset in the previous episode was hired in the same way? It seems the asset had a bit more training and was more professional but given time I feel Claire may become as ruthless.    WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?!   I also have an MSI R9 280x which has been factory over clocked, however because its over clocked it does make the game artefact. Download MSI Afterburner and down clock the card using that program. These are my settings and I haven't experienced any artefacts or weird texture stretching.  Core Clock: 1020 Mhz Memory Clock: 1160 Mhz  Everything else is left at default settings. Give that a go and see if it works. I'm currently running it in Mantle.     The script didn't really ask her to deliver much though.   I'm not American but the USA is a very large country with lots of people so it's not unexpected that you would see more Americans freaking out, especially when a lot of people in America have access to phones with cameras that can instantly upload said freakouts.    What I mean by this is the blue computer like hud interface they had. I felt it looked more slicker than the one in BF4. Especially when you're getting points/killing opponents, the way the points screen animates on the bottom really made me prefer it. Maybe i'm wrong however in that the one in BF4 just works better since it's more simpler and straight the point (been a while since I played BF3).   Thanks for that buzz killington.   God damn why can't we get something like this in Australia. I wouldn't even eat the food...   I don't think a list of 10 can contain this guy. Film's like Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, Da Vinci Code and Man of Steel are all fantastic soundtracks.    Knifing in BF2/2142 was the biggest shit show.    Haha ah right, thanks.   I see, thanks guys.    I enjoyed it mainly because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are great in it, the story however is pretty much a misfire unfortunately.   I belive P.T is exclusive but the final game will be multiplatform.    Can someone tell me what the mask is for?   Can someone please tell me what this is from? I keep seeing it said in relation to fat people.   This game was so frustrating for me. It was beautiful and had amazing art design and it also had the setting for an amazing story but they didn't go anywhere with it. It's annoying because Killzone has such fantastic lore and characters to explore but they seem to squander the opportunities.    If they actually address the problems with the UI then yes. I don't really care for themes, I would rather have folders, more streamlined notifications and faster loading of the friends list/messages.   Man the mud in that game blew me away when I first played it, was so fun just doing donuts in the mud!   I remember being blown away by it when I first saw it in GT3.   I know that most people hated this film but I thought The Counsellor was an interesting tale as it basically shows us that bad things will happen when you involve yourself with bad people. There's just the blunt consequences and no redemption in the film.    I would say the Nolan batman films lean more on the realistic side.   This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

[Zhao's Penthouse](http://blog.localditch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/deus-ex-human-revolution-tai-yong-palace.jpg)    That's the one Batman jumps off in Dark Knight right?   I really loved this scene in Man of Steel and feel it was easily one of the better superhero moments in any of the recent comic book films that have come out in the last few years.      Every choice of song in the show as been on point in my opinion.    Hmm the trailer points it out to be fairly generic but then again so did Edge of Tomorrow. I'm hoping that it's actually a really smart/cool sci fi film and the trailer is just aiming to get as many people into theatres as possible.    I'm so torn because a Blade Runner directed by Scott with his signature visual flair would be awesome but Scott is also a director who is dependent on having a good script to make the film come together. I was in the camp of people who enjoyed Prometheus but obviously felt it was very flawed and the counselor was a strange one for me as I could not really pin the film down and how i felt about it.   Yep very reasonable price imo which means this will be my first AAA game to be purchased digitally on my PS4.   2015? I saw this like 3 weeks ago in Australia. FYI it's actually a surprisingly great film can't wait you guys think of it.     No that's probably due to the actual animation of the game and whatever kind of motion capture they used. It's just uncanny valley.    It's a whole new audience today compared to 2005. Things have changed considerably in that time frame, also Avatar had the benefit of having higher 3D ticket prices which no doubt played a vital factor in it's crazy box office gross.    But we already have the VW Passat in Australia, just seems really weird to be testing this car here.   If anyone wants to relive [the feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkrXd37BYIA)   I reckon the machine has already gone ahead and set up a bunch of equipment and computers and that's what Finch is in awe of.   To be honest it's pretty hard to avoid trailer's these days since they show them before the actual film...   It still burns me on how Gearbox fucked AC:M at the expense of Borderlands. Did Gearbox ever officially comment on why the game never looked like it's initial reveal?   lol who the fuck would buy the 2nd cover, looks terrible.   Honestly dude wouldn't recommend the cross (especially because of the lockout laws), personally I am more of a bar person. There's usually nice bars around the darling harbour area also if you are into whiskey there's Baxters inn on Clarence Street although it can be a bit difficult to find since it's in an alley and its underground.    Where is this?   Yep this is the obvious one and I also love it. Watching that in 3D on opening day was an experience. Say what you want about the story but but as purely technical film it is flawless in my opinion.    Yep another great one. Also a shout out to Inception as well with the Japanese castle at the start of the film.   You could check out Almost Human although it was unfortunately cancelled by Fox and they ran the episodes out of order for some retarded reason.   Same here, I live in Sydney and have only ever seen undercover falcons or commodores.    By this I mean a scene in a big budget film, from which the viewer is first introduced to the world. My favourite is possibly in Tron Legacy when [Sam arrives onto the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6V69KaG4a8). The music combined with the visuals make it such a treat!  EDIT: higher quality link   Nice fact about this trailer is that it was directed by Joseph Kosinsky (Tron:Legacy, Oblivion)   I might be wrong but I think they may have both credits when the director has a hand in producing the film as well or his production company has helped produce it.       I live in Bella Vista which is right next to Hillsong and the crowd that place draws is fucking huge! I'm an atheist but my cousin is super Christian and into these hip youth churches like Hillsong and Nexus Youth, anyway I had to drop her off into the church one day and the guys managing the car park seemingly make it a hassle to actually leave the carpark since they constantly misdirect you and ask you questions about why you aren't staying etc. Also i'm pretty sure Hillsong own the Gloria Jeans just across in the shopping center which is super popular amongst the church goers.    I think it will be a flat 8   I predict this will have hilarious outcomes.    That scream...   [Mirrors Edge soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05wiQQbFLU) is perfect in my opinion.    So i'm Australian and we don't get those here, what do they taste like exactly?   Thanks man! I would never have found that haha   This is my theory at least, I feel that AI hasn't necessarily gotten less complex but we as players have been given a much larger range of skills and moves for us to use in a games which may be above the skill set of A.I enemies.   Is it confirmed if Deakins is the DP again for Bond 24?   Not sure about programming but Michael Mann's new film Blackhat is about a hacker so that could be interesting since he does a stupid amount of research in films on said subjects.  EDIT here's a [link](http://collider.com/blackhat-comic-con-panel-recap/) on the reasearch he did.   **As part of his research, Mann started hanging out with some black hat hackers, and discovered that they can do 7 to 8 hours of coding in one go, and it creates both a sense of escapism and a bit of an opiate feedback loop.  But its important to note that its not an escape because their work goes into the real world and can create serious repercussions. **    I dunno I can respect the choreography in Equilibrium but the fight scenes just looked a bit too silly imo     Anyone know the song used in the trailer?   Man this actually looks badass! The shooting looks awesome.   Sorry i'm just a bit bitter that we have to have front plates on our cars haha :/   So I recently rewatched both 28 days and 28 weeks later and was curious as to what you would want to see in a sequel and what direction you could take it in? Do you even think it's possible to make a sequel since it's been so long since 28 weeks and is the market even there anymore?   It's obviously not in the USA since it's a right hand drive car...I live in Australia and its against the law to NOT have both plates on.   Yeah supposedly he's back to his regular role.   He was not the only big name attached to the Counselor...

It truly is amazing in person.    Has the soundtrack been officially released? I can't find it anywhere!   I actually really liked the 3D in Dredd, definitely one of the better 3D films I have seen.    The only things I agree with you were the personality of the robots and the performances from the actors. The pacing however was one of the biggest offenders of the film along side its product placement. The film was pretty much 3 hours long and it did not need to be at all. Just when you think it's almost over...BAM the whole Hong Kong section begins. It did have some cool elements such as the main transformer villain and the dinobots but that was it for me really.    While I haven't seen Ninja Turtles yet, I feel that this will probably be true.    So guys if Michael Bay really does pass on directing Transformers 5? Who would be your pick to direct and why?   So I saw this last night at the movies. I really can't find any discussion on or relating to the film at all, is it not out anywhere else in the world but Sydney, Australia? I quite liked it although I am still trying to wrap my head around the ending and would like an explanation if possible.    ICO could be goddamn perfect it studio ghbili make it imo.   Even though the story may have been a bit predictable I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The look and sound of the film alone made it one of my my favourite sci fi of 2013.       Yes, this scene. I was about 9 or 10 when the film came out and seeing this scene made me really sad and scared!   Last I heard, Logan's Run was being written by Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinite's writer/designer, Ken Levine.    So I keep hearing on how obesity is considered to be a disease, why don't they just quarantine all fat people until they can contain and cure obesity?   In a way I really liked Inside Job since the bankers themselves can kind of be viewed as criminals.    OP Do you think you could do my PSN?   Looks similar to the [Cyberpunk 2077](http://abduzeedo.com/files/originals/cyberpunk_mainpic.jpg) font, which I also love!   Alien 3 was his first feature film and the studio essentially directed that film, he had very little input throughout the production. To his credit the assembly cut of the film actually makes it a decent film and you can see his some of his original vision in it.    I have only ever seen one 3GT on the road, it was like spotting some deformed unicorn.   We don't talk about that one.    Does anyone know the actual story behind this gif? How does someone monumentally fuck up like that, unless they did it on purpose for whatever fucked up reason.    The actual film is wrapped and they have quite a lot of effects work to finish off. Special effects can take quite a long time also they showed a small trailer of the film at comic con and the orcs supposedly look amazing for cgi characters.    Honestly release it on the PS4, even though I bought the game on PC I felt that the overall population of the game was cut down somewhat by not having it on another platform to build a name brand for itself. Now i'm not saying that was the only problem but they also segregated the community quite early on which lead to it being pretty much dead here in Australia.    I always felt that the first part of this fight is awesome. Also that music is just amazing.    Fucking hell! That's a lot of dosh!  	112

 Maybe I didn't say it clearly. In the example the poorer man still has the same income $10, but the richer's man income has nearly doubled $190.   But that's just a hypothetical example.   But that's not how its working.  The wages and incomes of the lower 70% (or so depending on whose numbers you use ) have remained relatively flat for decades, while the incomes of the richest have grown dramatically.  In your example it would be more like the total wealth has grown to 200 , and the rich man is getting $190.   And honestly do you really think the left 'the left would rather everyone made $15 instead, less for everyone but at least we're equal'.  Why would you think making caricatures out of other peoples opinions is  convincing anyone?    God created them in the Garden of Eden.  Don't they teach anything in Bible School anymore? /s   The remark was meant as a dig at our politicians (especially the ones who seem to think income inequality isn't a problem and is what those lazy people deserve anyway), not our citizens. But your'e correct, a more engaged citizenry would make something happen much sooner.   We've even got Fortune magazine telling us wealth inequality is bad for business.  Maybe somebody should do something.      As a nation we have a lot.  You're right though, a small group of people have a whole lot of it.   I can hardly believe this is happening in America. We have so much, and we let our kids grow up like this. You should write some more about what you've seen.  More people need to know about it.    The company executives, Mr. Berman said in his speech, must be willing to exploit emotions like fear, greed and anger and turn them against the environmental groups. And major corporations secretly financing such a campaign should not worry about offending the general public because you can either win ugly or lose pretty, he said.  My cynicism about lobbyists just took an unexpected jump.   True and too bad, because we'd have a much better nation if more of them voted.    Depends on where you live, too.  If the Northeast was its own country , it would be pretty respectable in the international rankings.    Or get short scheduled so you're not working full time. Or get laid off. Or have a family member that needs help.  Or live in an expensive city, or .. .    Poverty persists in America because [real income in the lowest quintile has fallen by 16% over the last 15 years.] (http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Household-Income-Distribution.php ). and that's largely due to wage stagnation.  Talk about government programs failing to solve poverty misses the real cause.    Damn that's rough. Good luck in finding the kids.       I'm genuinely curious. What percentage your Dad's tax money do you think goes to lazy potheads on welfare?    So, for Christ sake young people, do remember to vote.        Democrats, regardless of income, see the Republican party as favoring the wealthy -- as do about half of Republicans.   [Chart illustrating the survey.] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/10/28/the-system-favors-the-rich-say-the-americans-preparing-to-vote-republican/)  The Vox article doesn't really state this properly. It's probably better to go back to the Washington Post article.          True. But it improves your odds.     Parental expectations and involvement are the most important ingredient to success in school. (I knew someone whose father was a  massive steelworker who was determined that his children would do well.  She told me there was never any question about doing homework in her house.)  But the isolation of inner city students has a big role in the failure rate and making the schools dysfunctional. I live in a smaller city, not big enough for us to have segregated ourselves too much economically, and all four of our high schools have a significant population of students from impoverished families. (At my kids high school there are students from both the wealthiest part of town and from a couple of rather grim housing projects. ) While the schools have their issues, all of them are reasonably successful and manage to serve economically diverse populations. But that kind of high school has disappeared in most larger urban areas.  Instead we have some schools that serve almost exclusively impoverished students, which clearly has a multiplier effect on the difficulties and discipline issues.    I'd agree with some of your statement. Building a nice high school building might make it easier to learn, but it doesn't guarantee successful outcomes.  And unfortunately, far too many lower income families don't understand the need to take schooling seriously.  But , 1) High school is too late. Student are far better off going to good elementary schools and a lesser quality high school. What a student brings to high school matters more than the school itself. 2) Isolating the poorer students tends to reinforce the social problems. Of course you're going to see more gang activities in one high school if it's the only school attended by kids who tend to get caught up in gangs. If the staff needs to spend a lot of time on disciplinary and violence issues, there's that much less time and resources for teaching, and more disruption. Students who are not disruptive themselves wind up with less education, through no fault of their own.  3) The quality of the staff probably matters more than the building.  I know in my town we had one elementary school that was barely functional, until they replaced the principal.  The place still has it's issues, but it's a whole lot better. I obviously have no idea what the staff is like in the schools you mentioned, but I think better teachers tend to avoid the worse schools.  Although I disagree with much of what you've said, I think it's a well written and thoughtful comment. Keep at it.        The goal is to make post secondary education available to everyone, which would include technical or skill training.   Scott's Walker's Wisconsin - Just like Mississippi, only colder   You should write more about your experiences.  Not a lot of people understand that schools for lower income students are chaotic and dismal places.     The new American dream will apparently include a large reservoir of cheap, poorly educated, and powerless labor.       An article that manages to work in a couple Monty Python references while discussing the risks of deflation       Reagan and Nixon gave the Democrats everything they wanted?     Well that's horseshit.  Have a consolation upvote.   So is the name Reason supposed to be ironic?  Now things make a lot more sense.    A fair point, but I think the more an idea is repeated, even with dubious sincerity, the more likely it will become part of the public dialogue.   Doesn't matter who says it. It's true if it's true.    When you include all the taxes (Federal local and state) we all pay, US taxes are not particularly progressive. In fact the top !% play less taxes that the 80-99%.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/  Why progressives don't work on making the true tax rates better known, I'll never understand.   Could voter suppression decide the November elections?    And when only the wealthy have political rights, the government will only serve their interests. Perfect, no?   Yes, because, correctly or incorrectly, they address the subject.  Cato faults the government in dealing with poverty, while ignoring the issue of falling wages and increased inequality.  You can't have a serious discussion about poverty over the last 30 years and leave out those changes.   I love these articles by conservative think tanks.  They always skirt around the [biggest reason](http://www.epi.org/publication/top-1-earners-home-20-americas-income/) American poverty has continued  and the [best solution] (http://www.epi.org/publication/increasing-wages-effective-poverty-reduction/).   Look no further than Republican attempts across the country to disenfranchise voters and suppress Democratic efforts to register and organize black and brown voters. The fact that the party of organized money thinks the right to vote is worth taking away says that it must be worth quite a lot.        A college major in a subject isn't the professional qualification.    They're not economists either, but they somehow seem to all have ready opinions about how to improve the economy.    In 2012, Gov. Brownback called his states tax cuts a real live experiment in how tax-cutting affects the budget and the economy. So far, the main result of the experiment seems to be that cutting taxes causes the government to lose revenue.  Let's not rush to judgement. The experiment needs more time before it fails completely.   There's nothing better for a nation's long term economic prospects than saving money on education.    In the early years of baseball, some managers needed to be in uniform because they were player managers.    Although I'm inclined to agree with you, there's some debate about the net effect of illegal labor.  But I've always thought if someone was really interested in ending illegal immigration, they'd crack down on employers as well, which I don't see any Republicans advocating.  What they're doing about illegal immigration is like fighting drug addictions by arresting the addicts and letting the sellers go free.   If you're a weenie, everyone seems like a bully.    Extracting billions in unearned riches is what they do.   Republicans are often perceived as indifferent to working-class struggles (because they sometimes are).  I think he's going easy on the Republicans here. I can't recall anything they've done recently to address working class struggles. Even Rich Lowry (the editor of the National Review) says Republicans aren't addressing middle class issues.      Well ,it was a long time ago when I went to the University of Illinois, but I think the ID cards said whether you were a state resident. I haven't heard of any cases of the scenario you describe.  If they had, I'm sure the voter ID advocates would be publicizing them.   Ruth Ginsburg, in her dissent on the supreme Court decision,  has a different view about Texas IDs.  Texas will not accept several forms of photo ID permitted under the Wisconsin law the Court considered last week. For example, Wisconsins law permits a photo ID from an in- state four-year college and one from a federally recognized Indian tribe. Texas, under Senate Bill 14, accepts neither. Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Those who lack the approved forms of identification may obtain an election identification certificate from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), but more than 400,000 eligible voters face round-trip travel times of three hours or more to the nearest DPS office.Moreover, applicants for an election identification certificate ordinarily must present a certified birth certificate [which] can be obtained only at significant costat least $22 for a standard certificate sent by mail.     1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud. 2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.      There's no better way to illustrate one's advanced maturity and originality than by typing 'Grow the fuck up', is there?   OK, Tell me about some legislation the Republicans have passed that contradicts that statement. I can sure find a lot of legislation that supports it.   Complement them on their vast and thorough ignorance.    I think some do care, but you're largely correct. I don't think Karl Rove spends a lot of time pondering his personal relationship with Jesus Christ.   Let's also send everyone a photo id for voting when they turn 18.  Would solve a problem that some people don't really want solved.   I've always thought the best indicator emotional maturity was the ability to take responsibility for one's failures and successes.  Which would put Brownback (and our dear, dear Scott Walker here in Wisconsin) at the maturity level of a middle schooler   Do you really think we could do better with the Repubs against any change?  A question I would like see posted every time someone complains that 'the two parties are the same' or 'Obama hasn't done enough'.   You're incorrectly assuming Republicans want to fix America's problem. Looking at the legislation they've passed over the last 3 decades,  they want a country that serves the interests of a tiny wealthy minority, and impose an evangelical morality on the rest of the population.   The magazine did endorse George W. Bush for President. And Bob Dole. And in economics it almost always endorses free trade and lesser regulation. (Though not in this article.)  I was trying to contrast it with the other sources, but I  overstated it. Probably should have left it at centrist.    Here's another article favoring minimum wage increases, from a more centrist (if not right leaning) publication. http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not    Maybe not. Maybe he's just drunk all the time.    Wrong verb tense. ' Rising Income Inequality **Has** Seriously **Harmed** The U.S. Economy  '   But I have never seen a public official lie as easily and as relentlessly as Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback.  Nice work Sam. It's truly difficult to distinguish yourself among this strong  competition.    Of course he has affinities to Africa, he was born in Kenya ... wait, have we stopped using that one?   Yeah, but that was before he realized what a sweet deal being a Senator is.   He is, to be sure, a lucid nut, rather than a raving nut who accosts passersby on street corners.  Modern technology allows Ryan to accost an entire nation with his lunacies.   I'd put my money on Hillary against the Republican field, but I would never say it just can't happen.  Republicans are improving their ground game and, in the states you mentioned, are doing a pretty good job at voter suppression    This article is genuinely hilarious. Republicans score an average of .7 more correct answers in a news poll (about a 6% difference) , and the author is wetting himself because that proves Republicans are better informed than Democrats. And do you notice the article doesn't link to survey?  Wouldn't want people checking the survey for themselves, would you?    There's no better investment in Wisconsin than buying a piece of Scott Walker.   Because he might be President in 2016.   "I don't know the answer to that question," Ryan said. "I don't think science does, either."  This quote from a man who accepts inane economic theories that serve his agenda as fact.   I suppose I hardly need point out that Scott Walker is in favor of school vouchers.      If you want an example of dissembling and misleading through selective use of the material, you could hardly do better than this article.  Go to the actual [Pew survey](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/02/from-isis-to-unemployment-what-do-americans-know/2/) (which oddly enough, the author somehow overlooked providing a link to), and see if you think the writer is giving a fair representation of the survey.       Over or under?   Think they'll investigate ALEC's role in influencing legislation while they're at it?  Just a little bit please?   Right, because food safety can be regulated by the free market.  After people die from tainted food, they'll stop buying it.   Or global warming deniers.  Assuming there's anyone left to write history.   They're only saying that because the Pentagon is full of dishonest squishy liberals who are chasing grant money and hate freedom with  ... oh wait, that's the scientists.    I'm going with an alternative theory, that Brownback is a arrogant asshole with a shitty economic plan who's about to get what he deserves.  Unless the Koch Brothers manage to rescue him.   Predictably Alito, Scalia, and Thomas dissented.       I'm not thrilled either.  But when I think about a President McCain or Romney, I'm OK with Obama.   I think he's dribbling it on his chin. Perhaps if we get him a sippy cup.   [Totals tax rates (Federal, State, and local) aren't very progressive.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/)   So far in this recovery, corporations have captured an unusually high share of the income gains, said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.   Course he doesn't know what he's talking about either, right?   If a nation reduce worker's bargaining power by eviscerating unions, ignores  wage theft, allows inflation to erode the minimum wage, taxes investment income less than wage income , and reduces the tax rates on the highest incomes, it's made political choices that effect the economy.

If the money was going to increased wages instead of profits, you wouldn't be posing this question.  There's no iron economic law driving the concentration of wealth at the top. It's a political choice.    The biggest problem is the concentration of wealth at the top.  Start electing legislators who see that as a problem, instead of something to abet.   Those boys can do it all, can't they?   Brain damage from the prescription drug addiction.  Only explanation that makes sense.   I think it's rule 5 that makes the right hate him so much.

[Here](http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2014/0831/Labor-Day-anxiety-Will-wages-ever-start-rising-video)  Many economists say that, as the economy continues to gradually strengthen over time, the wage picture should improve.

Thomas Cruise Mapother IV   I hate those motherfuckers.   I'd hate to see your pool.   Correct.   I may as well be the one to point it out. *you're.      There's a moment just before this when some kids challenge him to a snowball fight, and he assumes a karate stance. Cracks me up every time.      Booger.    I noticed that too. The little girl also shows a resemblance.      Yep. Safe, and not scary.   She jerked.      To be honest with you, this is one of my most favorite internets ever.

    [This](http://pawvillage.com) website has a huge database of dogs and breeds with some going back to the dogs that were bred to start the breed. Check it out!   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/iJlJahd.jpg) is a picture of our dog with her mother and her siblings. We can trace her lineage back to the founding dogs of the breed, but I understand that white huskies cause confusion. We get people asking us what breed she is all the time! :)   From my wife- the raw expert and also a dog trainer: "It varies depending on what sources are available and what version of raw. We do 'Prey Model Raw' and to feed two 40 pound dogs and 2 cats is about $2-3 per day. We get a lot of free meat from hunters as well, and get great deals by buying in bulk from co-ops." Hope this helps!   I can't speak for the other dog, since I just met him today, but my dog is raw fed, which helps with their coat.   I care. That's my dog!   Actually she's a full Siberian Husky from a reputable breeder, registered with the AKC.   Yeah, this was taken near Rangewood. Nice pic!      Thanks! Hopefully the wait for Fallout goes quickly!  	10
          Life means just nothing for the ruling Communist party, if its own interests are threatened in anyway, still.

 Stellan Skarsgrd has always been my pick for Blofeld.  Waltz always seemed too animated for the role.  Skarsgrd would be perfection.  If anyone is good with Photoshop, feel free to turn this fella into Blofeld...  http://i.imgur.com/OprHZR0.jpg   Just the full 5ish seconds from 7:54 to 7:59 where the bear's head tilts with the 'amazement' text over him.  Thank you so much!  High Res would be fun, yes?  or low res?  Maybe both?  I don't know GIFs.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB0-i6cdpcg   Feel free to include any details you want from actors, scenes, plots to marketing campaigns, to Rampart references...         State the subreddit, then the initiation.   1.  Everyone has plenty of time to flee their area as it sinks very slowly, but the land's sinking is non-reversible.  Plenty of time to save movable objects, personal items, relics, certain masonry works, etc.    2.  Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria's lands do not change beyond Jordan acquiring plenty of beach property.    3.  Though the land sinking is a far-fetched, absurd idea, the thought exercise of thinking about the land and the people is an important one.    4.  You can address any issue that comes to mind.  The people, the geo-political ramifications, the refugee statuses, reactions of other countries, the idea of a holy land, Zionism, conspiracy theories, etc, etc.    I ask this question seriously and look forward to you thoughtful answers.  Thank you.      I would secure more international financial backing and a firmer distribution strategy before directing it myself the same way that Coppola directed Apocalypse Now and The Godfather.  The script is the book (and radio broadcast transcripts) with my notes in the margins.  CG would be sparse and hidden with purposeful in-camera tricks and props.  Casting would take several months with some favoritism toward lesser known performers of unusual backgrounds (puppeteers, acrobats, interesting speech impediments, etc)  The entire movie would be shot in the UK if possible, though some exteriors may need to be shot elsewhere.  I would hire a towel expert to find me the perfect towel prop.  Absorbent, trustworthy, and intergalactic.   I would film it the way I first envisioned it in my head as an older child.  With all the gloomy bright colors, characters played straight rather than silly, Arthur more as a square always trying to pretend he understands what is going on rather than just a (babel) fish out of water.  He has more depth than just a simple 'where am i?' arc.  I would shoot the film partially on Super 16 Color Reversal Kodak film and other settings of the film in other formats to get different saturations of the different atmospheres.  The UK portions would be filmed in a similar fashion t I, Claudius and the BBC's Hitchhiker miniseries.  I would deaden the contrasts between them a bit as to make it less of a gimmick.   Before shooting, I would bring my script (the book and radio transcripts with my notes) to various accomplished Adams lovers in academia and the acting/writing world and get their take on it.  Holding reading sessions on various scenes with famous improv actors to elicit new takes on the material.  It would be set in the late 70s as well.  Also, i would not take an enormous directorial/writing salary, though I would let my agent work on that.  There is enough material in that little book to make a hell of a funny/intriguing/enchanting/superweird/remarkable movie.  Just need to hire the right people to get my vision onto the screen through a rigorous, well-planned path I have planned.  (Also, may need a mud expert to get that bulldozer mud juuuuust right).         Can't trade picks or draftees.  Just five players to add to your roster.  Have fun and show your work.      Board game, card game, DVD game, dice game, miniature game, RPG, etc, etc.     Just the absolute worst game that is currently in your collection (however which way you determine what 'worst' means for you).     For kicks, tell us why it's the worst and why you still own it.  Have fun!  :)   Key element is you get **one vantage point**.  You're not physically there, but you sense all your surroundings.     For instance, you can be on the grassy knoll during the JFK assassination 2.5 minutes before he's shot ending 2.5 minutes after he's shot.  Basically your senses are there for a **360 degree vantage point experience**.     **You cannot alter history**.  You are intangible, ephemeral, ethereal, and imperceptible.  Think 'Being John Malkovich' but without having to be inside someone's head, and you don't end up on the New Jersey turnpike afterward.     You are just sensing the 5 minutes through sight, sound, smell, taste, temperature, etc from one single point.     The single point can move with a person, object, vehicle, comet, etc.  Your senses are 'harnessed' in relationship to one collection of mass.   For instance, you can be in JFK's motorcade in Dallas, a fixed point in front of Neil Armstrong's helmet that moves with him as he takes his first steps on the moon, or just beside an asteroid as it flies past a distant planet.       **Thus, mention the specific place you'd be as well as the 5 minute gap.**     Have fun!  (Edited for clarification.)   So with Roger Goodell's comments about Los Angeles and London, it made me wonder which other cities might be added in the future.    The NFL could add four more teams and go to three divisions of six teams in each conference, but I love the idea of adding eight more teams to have eight divisions with five teams apiece.  Realistically, eight expansion teams would stretch the NFL quite thin, but it's fun to contemplate the circumstances and invent new teams.    Feel free to move the Jags to L.A., change Buffalo to Toronto, move teams around divisions, change the name of the Washington franchise, or anything else you want.  It's your hypothetical NFL.    If you're feeling extra ambitious, write out the divisions, locations, and team names like this and specify which are newly named, moved, and/or expanded teams...    **-AFC East-**  Buffalo Bills  New England Patriots  New York Jets  Miami Dolphins  Montreal Rapids (new franchise)    **-AFC North-**  Baltimore Ravens  Cincinnati Bengals  Cleveland Browns  Indianapolis Colts (moved from AFC South)  Pittsburgh Steelers    **-AFC South-**  Kentucky Bluegrass (new franchise)  Houston Texans  Jacksonville Jaguars  Mexico City Aztecs (new franchise)  Tennessee Titans     **-AFC West-**  Denver Broncos  Kansas City Chiefs  Oakland Raiders  Salt Lake City Snowcats (new franchise - Black Diamonds would be a cool name too)  San Diego Chargers     **-NFC East-**  Dallas Cowboys  London Bridges (new franchise)  New York Giants  Philadelphia Eagles  Washington Warriors (new name with same emblem)    **-NFC North-**  Chicago Bears  Detroit Lions  Green Bay Packers  Minnesota Vikings  Toronto Argonauts (new franchise - CFL team disbands)    **-NFC South-**  Atlanta Falcons  Carolina Panthers  New Orleans Saints  San Antonio Caballeros (new franchise)  Tampa Bay Buccaneers     **-NFC West-**  Arizona Cardinals  Portland Roses (new franchise)  San Francisco 49ers  Seattle Seahawks  St. Louis Rams     (Edit: Formatting)        	18
 In June of 2014 I was on the verge of needing medication to cope with job anxiety.  I was six months pregnant.  It was hot outside.  My former company forced me to go on two last business trips before I left for good in August.  I was salaried and working about 56 hours a week.  I'm really glad it's not June of 2014.    OMG... the parallels!  I read and knit... My husband shaves his head, right?  I joked that he was basically Nostferatu once... He did not like that at all.  Ahahaha, this is such a small world.  Thank you for the comment. 3     Someone is going to click on this and wonder what the hell happened.  Ahahaha.    I try to be a good wife.  I pre-ordered [this](http://store.misfit.com/products/bolt?gclid=CjwKEAjwqLWrBRC-_OaG-IfL0kASJAAbzKsVbpRky11625fR9yZLmpV-PYcJf4H17n_Ui0fOQ2pUhRoC-dvw_wcB) for him for his birthday... I think it was the most successful gift I've ever given in my life.     I like your spirit!  However, I'm married (and not to cabinet maker, to someone who can't hold a screwdriver) so my cabinet acquiring days outside of the Home Depot are over. :(  Such is life.    When they legalize polygamy in one of our countries, we'll make it happen.    Until you wrote this, I had no idea that melatonin had to do with circadian rhythm function... You might be on to something.... he never comes to bed on time.  Basically, if this were Harvest Moon for SNES, he would be abandoned by now.      In our old apartment, if I needed to see something properly, I had to go into the bathroom.  It was the only room in the whole house he never tampered with.    Well, your comments are awesome, I upvoted a ton of them, but sorry cool kid from the UK, I'm married.  It's okay, though, I'm sure I'm too old and possibly too short for your anyhow.    He hates being in a properly lit room.  I'm forever coming home to find all the lightbulbs have been switched to the colored kinds that don't actually throw light.... It's very frustrating to turn on a lamp and have things not get brighter.  It's also annoying to leave the room to take a leak and come back to find all the lights have been turned off.  All my houseplants are dying because of the black-out curtains.    I'm not making this up.  This is a real point of contention in my marriage.    Well, this did make me laugh out loud, and that's always a plus. ;)   Probably a cabinetmaker.  That would indicate to me that a man is precise, patient, intelligent, perfectionistic, artistic, strong, handy, and focused.     If money can't buy happiness, you don't know where to shop! ;)   That buzz of connection when you talk to someone and they understand you and you understand them.  It's the opposite of loneliness.        This is very hard to put into words because it's not logical in any way, shape, or form.  It's an anxiety behavior for me.  I see a text (especially from someone who makes me uncomfortable like my mother in law) and I don't know what to say.  I agonize over it for a moment.  Come up with nothing.  Get illogically angry at the sender for putting me in this situation, set it aside.  Remember at a later time, fret that too much time has passed for a normal response... continue to do nothing..... I actually cut my former boss out of my life completely just because I never knew what to say to her and couldn't force myself to guess what she might've meant.   His mother.  You NEVER criticize an SO's family to your SO.  They will take it personally and it accomplishes nothing.   "Where is my Mind" by the Pixies reminds me of the Tracey Fragments.  When they released the film, they did a promo where they released all the raw images to be re-mixed by fans.  Someone did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjY7xD6W24) awesome reFragment as it was called.  They did a better job than the movie in a lot of ways!    My sister had a car she had totaled twice.  I was driving the damn thing around with the steering wheel airbag compartment and the glove box held shut with zip-ties.  My stepdad had cut the airbags out with a carpet knife, so they were just these raggedy tatters you saw peeping out behind the zip-ties.  I didn't really care, I mean, it got me from point A to point B for much longer than I would have thought it could. :)   Edit: I finally remembered the name of it!  It was a '96 Ford Contour.     This kid and I went out for breakfast.  He made no effort to make conversation and his answers to my questions were monosyllabic or brooked no discussion.  The one that took the cake was when I asked him what kind of music he liked and he said "Don't really like music.  There was a Greenday song that was alright."  WELP.  I guess I'll see you around...    Well, it was my understanding that Brits had an even larger tendency towards modesty than we did, but I could be wrong.  It's to do with the fact that we don't like to admit that we have to eliminate waste bodily.  See what I did there?      Be awkward and malnourished.  I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type.  I like 'em hungry looking.    Killer Mike has a song for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU   I'd like to point out that in my experience "taking a leak" is something men do.  I like to say it as a female, and I almost always get derisive laughter when I do.  We call it a restroom because we don't have bath tubs at work, so it's not a bathroom! :)   WOW.  That sub-comment.  Really though, I don't wear leggings with anything but a dress, HOWEVER, I can give you my guess.  Our hips are shaped in a way that is not super conducive to comfortable pants.  Add to this the trend that jeans need to be tight, the comeback of the highwaist, and the fact that all work pants are miserable, it's likely just a comfort thing.  We can't put things in our tiny pockets anyway, so we're not really missing function by ditching them.    I think probably by sending their nudes to their place of employment.... Or maybe by kidnapping your child and disappearing... really anything that not only ends the relationship, but also ruins the rest of your life.    I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys.  Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process.    Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified.       100% down hill, no other answer.  Walking UP the hill relieves the pressure on your feet.  Going down you feel like you're going to topple over and lose your shoes!    I was a pretty literal child.  I had a constant fear of not being able to accomplish a directive my mother had given me.  So when she told me that I was to keep my hands folded in my lap and be still, I was very concerned about the fact that my hands didn't seem to want to fold.    I was also TERRIFIED when a babysitter told me if I didn't do something I would be "dead meat."  I thought she was going to kill me and put me in the freezer.    It's okay... when I was four I told my mom I wanted to be an artist.  She told me that artists don't get paid anything until they were dead and so I needed to be more realistic.  Flash forward to a year later, I attended my first funeral and decided I wanted to be like the friendly mortician I met there.  This lasted until I was about 14.  I hope you laughed at this, I was trying to cheer you up.  (But I'm also 100% serious.)  Edit: I totally said I wanted to be a mortician in more than one school publication in the local newspaper.  Ha ha, mom.    I know that feel, man.  For me it was my mother.  She also told me that if a group of people don't like you, because there are more of them than there are of you, they must be seeing something you are doing wrong and have a valid point.  You and I will forever second guess ourselves, but at least we will almost certainly survive any crisis since we're constantly imagining the worst possible scenario at any given time. ;)   My sister and I have the same nightmare... if we see a swing or a tether ball or anything else that hangs from something, you can bet we're going to end up swinging wildly around in the sky while we panic.  It's quite awful...    You know, there is an exchange about this very thing in the dystopia movie "Antiviral."  In it, they sell cloned meat made from the DNA of celebrities.  Syd Winter says to Arvid "I still don't understand how this isn't cannibalism."  Arvid replies that the current popular opinion is that what makes us human is more spiritual than physical.  Our soul in other words.    It's commonly believed that it means one of two things:  You're afraid of your own mortality.  Teeth are a sign of power and health.  You lose both as you age.  You said something you wish you hadn't.   Uncomfortable.  You have to understand that your outward appearance is hardly an accomplishment that says anything about what kind of person you are.  Just like having dimples or a big pregnant belly, being beautiful makes people think you're public property in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  You owe people things, people get defensive more easily, you're not taken as seriously.     Yes, my astonishment at the fact that a huge part of my job was reformatting things in Microsoft Word and ghost writing e-mails for people with three more college majors than me was quite great.     Almost anything they sell in an infomercial.  If you want to laugh until you cry, go to Amazon and read the reviews for the MyPillow and the NoNo hair remover.    [Thank you for being a friend.](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150420/golden-girls-01-800.jpg)   It is like this: you put in at least 1% and after 1 year they will match 5% OF YOUR SALARY.  At the 5 year mark it jumps to 10% OF YOUR SALARY.... Can you even believe that people still decline participation?  It blows my mind!    I've decided that I have to stay here at least until my daughter stops needing daycare (and I can divert 20% into my Roth 401k), no matter how brain dead it's making me.    It's a really stupid story involving my younger sister and the Simon and Garfunkel cover of "My Little Town."  A totally inane story that I never get sick of telling anyone who has ever met my sister.     I told my friend about the retirement matching in my company (it's mind-bogglingly good), and he got very excited for me.  Then he made a comment about how we must officially be adults since this is what we're congratulating ourselves on. ;)   Well, because you can learn a lot from fiction as well.  A lot of people are not able to apply third person narrative to their lives... it's too abstract and objective and lacks feeling.  When you are reading fiction from a first person perspective, you become that person.  Learning isn't just about facts and figures, it's also about having compassion and learning not to judge everything at face value.  I hope this helps you! :)    In high school I had hair down to my hipbones that I pretty much never brushed and I tended to wear a minimum of three shirts... yes, like a homeless person.  When I graduated high school, I cut off all my hair into a pixie cut and moved to a place where it was too hot to pretend to be Rivers Cuomo.  I started working at a Gamestop.  I got phone numbers daily.  Boys would hand me things and "accidently" touch my chest.  My assistant manager printed movie labels he trimmed as commentary for our name tags... I got "The Hot Chick."    Now, I suspected then that I might be cute, but figured it was more like I was a skinny 6/10 with boobs who played video games.  It wasn't until Tiny Chat that I realized I was regarded as actually beautiful.  When strangers on the internet start hiding all cams but yours and taking screenshots, you just have to wonder.  It wasn't until someone who I literally think is a 10 asked me out of jealousy what it was like to have everyone vying for my attention that I was like maybe I'm missing something here.    I don't treat anyone differently, I'm just now all the more anxious because it's one more thing that isn't how I think it is.   IS MONOPOLY MONEY OKAY???? :D :D :D   Yessss, I will take three Quarter Pounders with cheese... oh, and can I get a diet Coke with that? ;)    I think we can all relate to not having anything to say to certain people, right?  I've never really made fun of someone for their height, but I'm uncommonly short (just under 5'), and I don't think people do it very seriously.  They're just trying to get my attention and not very clever!  What I think is more obnoxious is how if you tell them this is not clever or original, you're the bad guy... hahaha!   tl;dr: We can't talk about the weather all the time.   I'm not going to type out a huge long story, but my worst boyfriend used to use me as an excuse to get out of things he didn't want to do.  He would lie to his family and work about me being super controlling or about cruel things I apparently said so he wouldn't have to see them or work.  It took me a long time to work out what was going on.  If his mother weren't such a direct person I probably never would have... she called me out on things I had "said" and I felt like the floor fell out from under me!  Yeah, he was a bit crazy, I'd say.    I've read that it takes 1 year for your stomach muscles to go back to pre-pregnancy shape if they didn't damage during the late pregnancy.  My stomach looks normal until I eat something.... when I get bloated my stomach is round like I'm 4 months pregnant.  This is hilarious (in a sad way) since I'm down to 107 lbs (I'm just under 5'), but I'm sure it'll pass.  I don't think the droop goes anywhere though.  At least we're in good company! :)   Good: Be random.  I have a very abstract sense of humor, I like people who can hang. :)  Bad: Pouting.  I can't handle pouting.  Don't pout.     You can't win 'em all. ;)   Right, I used to tell people I was named after the "CALL ATT girl," but I haven't made that joke in years since no one has CALLED ATT in a very long time ;)   http://i.imgur.com/oReaT.jpg This one made me laugh my ass off.  Relevant!    I like it! :)   Using a card catalogue.  Guys, have you gone back and checked what World Book had to say about the solar system in 1992?  That shit is hilarious!  This is how we used to educate ourselves?!     When my mother said "Maybe it's time to switch to a less reliable form of birth control."     If you do not eviscerate all of the children under the age of five within the next hour, we will nuke your entire town.    I have neighbors.  They know I have a baby... how the hell do I get her out?  Terrifying.    Tom Arnold.   And I remember my social studies teacher telling us about people using a wheelbarrow to transport all the cash they needed to buy a single loaf of bread in Russia!  Inflation!  It's real! :)    There's a lot of shame for physical issues/conditions that are gender specific.  People don't want to hear about lochia or episiotomies or yeast infections.  I'm trying to think of something a guy could bring up that would cause a similar immediate reaction of distaste or disgust, and I'm coming up short.  I was familiar with the term "pre-mature ejaculation" before I reached my adult height!     Name the Wind.... My best friend told me it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, but I'm just like son of a bitch, I'm sick of these spiders...    I actually think it must just be poor context.  The only context of this word that I've ever heard that stuck with me was when it was used in those mid-90's Duncan Heines commercials... Moist is totally something I like in a cake.  Now congeal?  Or coagulate? PASS ON THAT.     Did you know that in 1920 the average cost of a house was a hair under $4,000?  Obviously if we all got $1,000,000 the inflation would kill our economy and while I'm not quite sure what the worldwide aftershock would be, I'm sure it would be horrifying.    This is why I volunteer with a hospice!     No, but it's for a totally practical reason: That would wreck the pH in our little lady environments.  I mean, lots of things do, but hell, let's not totally throw reason out the window here... If that wasn't a concern, I'd totally be down.   Well, this is irrelevant now being that she is too old to be president realistically... but for awhile there I was hoping Arnold would succeed in his bid to have the constitution amended to allow foreigners who have had US Citizenship for x number of years to be eligible for presidency so that Madeline Albright could have run.  It didn't happen, but she's the person I would have wanted leading my country in 2000.      Oh my god, you guys.  Upvotes for everyone.  Thanks for making me cry laughing in my office.   Contribution so this isn't just a useless post: raisins.  I can't imagine eating raisins could ever be sexy in an unironic way.    I think it depends on whether you bought one on impulse or if you're a serious quantified lifer.  I know a kid who has been using his Jawbone to create sophisticated Excel charts that cross reference all kinds of crazy things.  It's pretty much his favorite hobby.  He's been doing it for years!   Anytime you have to have what my former boss called "the smelly kid conversation."  Nothing is more awkward than setting someone down and telling them their coworkers are concerned because you don't seem to shower, use deodorant, or change your clothes.  I've had to have this chat with three employees and I've sat in as a second for many, many more.  Remember kids, don't ever have this or a conversation about dress code without a witness.    My anxiety makes it very scary for me to think about watching movies I haven't seen before with other people, and if they have already seen the movie, it ratchets that anxiety up to 11.  I know this probably sounds really silly, but it's a thing.  Your friend could be coming from the same place.  It's worth considering.  The last time I had to see a movie with friends, I read the novel and another film adaptation of the source material to "prepare," I haven't seen a movie with friends in almost four years!   Well, sometimes you can't do anything that's obvious, you know?  He clearly loves you and trusts you to tell you about it.  He might not ever mention it again, and that's fine.  If he wants help, he'll probably ask for it.   When a sexual abuse occurs, the person involved feels powerless and out of control.  One very subtle way you can help your father is to ask to do things with him that he's really good at and that you're only so-so or bad at.  I can't give you a great example, but say he is a master fisherman.... ask him to take you fishing, ask questions, thank him for teaching you if you think it won't embarrass him.   I don't want to give you advice about how to handle your uncle, because every family dynamic is different and there are a few factors.  I guess the best advice I can give is to remember what you know and use that knowledge to sort of keep an eye out for any other potential victims.  Intervene in a subtle way when appropriate.    I'd be happy to talk about this further if you want.  Just shoot me a PM.   This is just like Batman vs. Superman.  OF COURSE the ants will win, they are ants... Just like Superman is an ALIEN.  Batman and humanity can only hope to get a few shots in with our expensive toys and our wits, but we all know it's just a matter of time...    Well, judging by the films made in the 70's that were set in the future, I think it would be hard to believe that smoking became LESS prevalent, not more!      I don't know what you all are talking about... my mom makes mom jokes all the time... they're like this: "Well, you can do what you want to do... BUT YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ;)"  or  "I know you think I'm stupid, so you'll just do what you want..."  It's a joke because no matter what you do, you're screwed.  All you can do is laugh... until you cry.    I actually never had any.  I was tempted to lie since people took this as license to have a very long and stupid conversation about their disbelief that this was the actual case.  When you're that pregnant, you don't want to have the same unoriginal conversation every two hours.  I also got tired of people coming to my office and saying "You're still here!"  YES, OBVIOUSLY.    I got a breadmaker for Christmas one year.  I was trying to make bread a week later and I couldn't find my half-cup measure anywhere.  I asked my husband about it.  He said he "maybe, might have thrown it away, but can't remember exactly..."  I was understandably annoyed and told him it would be very difficult to make bread without it since you have to be so precise for things to turn out well.  An hour later he came into the house from outside with the measuring cup and said to me "Look!  It's a New Year's Miracle!"    I blitzed through the "His Dark Materials" trilogy in a weekend.  If you're asking for the purpose of school, I recommend it purely on the basis that there are a lot of topics in it that make for great essays.     Something that I really like is when a guy is handy.  If you can do car repairs or build things it indicates to me that you have a natural curiosity about the world and that you're pragmatic.  Handy guys who spend a lot of time out in their garages also don't tend to be co-dependent.  They know the value of personal accomplishment.  That is a beautiful thing! :)   No screen time before (and definitely not in) bed.  Go to bed a bit earlier than you need to fall asleep (I like an hour), and read.  I like to read things I'm interested in, but are unarguably a bit boring like novels by Thomas Hardy or Jane Austen.  They are great to sleep to.  You don't want to have coffee or other caffeinated drinks within 8 hours of your bedtime.  Don't exercise before bed.  It can be helpful to start a night-time ritual, like taking a shower, putting on your pajamas, turning off all the lights in your house in a certain order, reading for a half hour.  Studies show that our bodies respond to memory of ritual and you will begin to get tired during step one after your body begins to correlate that you only shower before you sleep...it also lowers your body temp, which makes you tired.  Invest in a white noise machine (not a sound machine).  Be active while you're awake.      This actually reads very nicely to me.  My only comment is that if this person is going to be a supervisor you may want to focus more on things that make a good supervisor (constantly developing personally, sensitive to the needs of others, hardworking, innovative, diplomatic) and a tiny bit less on their great deal of heart (for lack of a better term). You don't want him to seem too emotional for the job, and let's face it, a lot of people can't do supervisor work for just that reason.  You get pretty beat up!    After I had my baby, I tried to go back and play the Sims 3 one day... I managed to snatch an uninterrupted hour (a miracle) and accomplish decorating half a Sim house (read: absolutely nothing accomplished).  It put into perspective that I had probably dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into video games.  It's good that you would like to go out and do things, and therein lies your opportunity to meet like-minded folks.  Now you're probably going to find that at a wine-tasting there's going to be a lot of 40-something soccer moms that zone out when you try to speak to them, just don't give up.  Eventually you will find someone in your various activities that will jump at the chance to do other fun things with you.    You're right about body image, it starts on the inside.  If you're serious about bulking up, there is a lot of science and theory to be had, which will appeal to your intellectual side.  I recommend you look into intermittent fasting in muscle building.  It will challenge everything you have been brought up to believe about eating.   If you really have anxiety, you will probably always struggle with it to some degree.  I'm high-functioning, but still very high anxiety.  I will notice little innocuous things I'm doing, like putting off a phone call and then have to talk myself up in my head to stop that behavior.  The key to avoiding missed opportunities due to anxiety is to just question your negativity.  Try to see things from another angle.  If you think "Wow, this person is really rude... they must not like me. :(" Take a step back and think about the last time you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person.  You probably can't come up with one, because that's not really how we function as human beings.  That other person is the same as you and probably meant no harm.    I hope this helps you! :)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q72cK8MyEUk 3:00 to see Johnny Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls talking about wearing a dress around his apartment in the 80's.     Drizzt Do'Urden   White ratty gym socks with pants that are just a hair too short.    Hard to argue with happiness, I suppose, but man... how awful. ;)   I have a cousin whose middle name is "T," as in just a letter, nothing longer.  Apparently "T" is the first initial of his mother, his father, both uncles, and I think a few other people besides.  She couldn't think of who to honor, so she left it open to interpretation.    Aw snap, here we go.  The first time my mother met this old dude next door, he was walking around with bread bags tied over his shoes... he was phobic of dog feces.   He told her that he used to work, but didn't because he had a total meltdown and ended up in a mental institution for five years.   He used to randomly fire his hunting rifle into the woods behind our houses from his deck.  Not aiming, just firing.    He didn't play the radio, because it transmits the sound from your house to the government.    One time my mom was watching birds in the backyard with her binoculars.  There was Milt... watching her with binoculars from his yard.  We were under strict orders to never talk to him alone.     Peppermint Schnapps.  Listen guys, don't ever play a drinking game like "Never Have I Ever" with Peppermint Schnapps.  It's been 7 years and thinking about it still makes me gag.    Eating more than five olives in one sitting will give you an amazingly painful stomach ache.  Apparently my mother was very passionate about keeping the olives in the house.     Black Hills Energy was the only utility company that I ever encountered that treated their customers as their number 1 priority, and I have encountered a lot of utility companies in my former profession.  Would recommend/10.    After I put in my two weeks at Gamestop, I just like, gave no fucks.  The best time was when this kid came in.  I greeted him, as was required.  He ignored my greeting.  Pretended to look around, then made his way back to me to turn in a job application.  I said "Let me get this straight.... you want me to give you a job, but you didn't even return my greeting?  You do know that greeting people is, like 30% of this job right?"  He was actually a sport and said "Oh man! I didn't know I was at a pre-interview, how can I convince you?  Do I still have a shot?" I said it depended and what did he know about video games?  He proceeded to reveal that the only game he had ever played ever was Megaman on SNES.  You better believe I slapped a do-not-bother post-it on that application.  No regrets, I'm 100% sure he didn't want to do what I was doing for the pitiful wage of $5.15/hr.  He dodged a bullet and didn't even know it.    Get yourself one of these puppies: http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Baby-Food-Grinder-Light/dp/B000GB0NZA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432999738 sr=8-1 keywords=food+grinder+baby  Mix it with other things once it's the texture of mashed potatoes if you don't just want to cook it with garlic and olive oil and eat it like that. :)   Brocoli is pretty much a super food, so I get it!  I'd also try it a few other ways... like is it raw that bothers you?  Just cooked?  Heads? Stems?  Identify what bothers you, and try to work around it.  Good luck, friend!    Have you tired /r/kindvoice or /r/needafriend ?  Both tend to have offers all the time with a/s listed.  I'm too old for you, or I'd offer. :)   Not to sound like I'm wearing a tin-foil hat here, but a number of things I've noticed went hay-wire on the internet on Memorial Day.  I think the government knows why and possibly were involved while we all celebrated what Facebook tells me isn't national barbecue day.     List action:  What's that got to do with the price of salt? Variation: What's that got to do with the price of tea in China?  You get more bees with honey than you do with vinegar.  I pinned her ears back.  I'm snug as a bug in a rug.  Your eyes are bigger than your belly.  I've got to go so bad my eyeballs are floating.  You make a better door than a window.  Tough tittie said the kittie, but the milk's still good. (Variant: the milk's still free.)  All the grace of a newborn elephant.  I'll be there with bells on.  You're fine? Fine as frog's fur?   Absolutely, man.  There could be something bigger at play here... like a company reorganization or the company being purchased by a parent company.     Thank you for using "tall poppy syndrome" which prompted me to google what that means, which informed me there is a word for a thing that I see all the time!  I'm going to be speaking much more efficiently now! :)   mfw it is already happening.  We're expelling carbon dioxide.  If we don't, we die.  Did I just break your time-space continuum?  Tell me, bby.    Right, I'm not going to name names here, but a very large utility was paying their direct hires $35.00/hr to take phone calls, while they paid only $16.99 per dedicated hour for our agents to take the same calls.  (We paid these agents about $8.50/hr)  As one of the other contributors pointed out, pay differential aside, they didn't need to cover any benefits for us.  They also weren't spending money on coaching.  All of that was on our dime, so they had the freedom to mandate we meet certain goals, save themselves money while we worked with the agents, and ultimately leave if we didn't deliver.   There is a reason why these numbers are normally private and thus why you would be confused.     I think it's quite beautiful to recognize that you're young at heart and to be young for as long as you can be.  I mean, we're only getting older, you'll never get the chance again.    I think you just need to do some things that make you feel smart and competent.  For me, that is traveling.  I never feel as smart and free and independent as I do when I'm in an airport.  When you travel alone, you can indulge in your childlike wonder at the world around you.  You can be you without thinking yourself to death the way you do when you're just home alone.    It's good to think the best of people and to be curious about them.  That alone will get you far as many people love to talk about themselves.  If you ask questions, typically you don't need to worry about expressing yourself too well, because the other person will go on a bit.  While I can be a chatty Kathy (obviously) I'm intrinsically curious about why people do what they do and how and what they feel about it.  So while I am largely awkward, having met my best friend at 23, a lot of people consider me to be their friend merely on merit that I've asked them things and listened to their answers and remembered little things about them.   The wonderful thing about being a human being is that if we don't like our circumstances, there is rarely a situation where we can't change them completely.  I totally encourage you to think about the things you like to imagine you are brave enough to do and to just do them.  No one ever lies in their deathbed and says "I wish I had spent more time worrying and waiting to start my life," right?  Be brave and be you and do everything you want to do.  You deserve it.  You only live in this wonderful world once. :)   I'll chime in again, hey, why not.  Another thing my husband gets a lot is the description that he looks like Mr. Clean.    What?  My husband is 160 lbs soaking wet at 6'2"... he's not a ripped old man in a small t-shirt.  He also doesn't have bushy white eyebrows or blue eyes or a killer tan.  He doesn't have a pierced ear and he doesn't wear jeans.... Are you saying he's bald?  Yes.  He happens to be bald.    I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time.  I can't speak about your culture and I won't presume to, but you asked if it was true whether no matter where a man is from, he'd be bothered.  The answer to that is no.  I'm an American.  I did not come into my marriage as a virgin.  My husband could not care less.    I hope things get better for you.  Please feel free to PM me if you're ever lonely and need a sympathetic ear.  You are more than your currency as a potential mate.  	101
 I would Insta hug that Amumu, tears or sweat. We would be friends FOREVER!   Are you sure you aren't in the wrong league?   Teleport on dominion OP.  	3
 *"Bum's being a real Jew out there."*   NO   Even year magic!    *Shutters*   Edit: *shudders*   How do you Yost, that which is Yost.    You shut your mouth!    Did you guys see the late break on that snot rocket from Bum?    This exact comment was posted in an earlier game thread. NEVER FORGET!    Hot girl in left field bleachers.    Hosmer might be my favorite non-Giant.    Still a lot of baseball to be played.   We might get to see the best bullpen in the league sooner rather than later.    This pitcher needs a nickname that suggests he plays well in important games.    There's something you should know about reddit...   *"Hunter Pence looks like one of the burglars from Home Alone."*   More commentary from my sister.    *"None of the other team's players are cute."*   My sister's analysis of the game so far.    I started lifting in my garage where I have a bench and a barbell, so I can do the major barbell lifts with the exception of squats. Am I doomed to be a deformed freak who looks like he skips leg day?    CONGRATS ON THE DIVISION TITLE, DODGERS!   And now he has cemented his place in baseball history. Cool that it happened to him instead of a superstar    This is the funniest thing I've read on Reddit in months. How did your first time with the seat down go?   Dynasty!   If I would have put a piece of coal between my cheeks at the beginning of this game, I would have a diamond right now.    As much as I say I hate games like this, it really is what I love about sports.    Walk off balk.   Not in the third inning.   DAE Wainwright???   Painfully awkward Rob Lowe hits a little too close to home.    Posey. Bum if he deals tonight.   I finally got around to alt-j's new album, This is All Yours. I was a fan of their first album, but I'm really disappointed with their latest work. It's very boring to me. I found myself constantly checking to see how many songs I had left and I could listen to something else. Anyone else feel this way?   On a related note, if you're a fan of alt-j, give Battleme a listen.    Harold just said, "Oedipus pitch."   What kind of adult would want a pirate themed living room?    Just don't watch highlights from Monday night ^too ^soon?   If Buster Posey and Hunter Pence had a child together, it would be Matt Duffy.   He said, "...100, and 99, respectively."   His real name makes him sound like a bare knuckle boxer.   Why do we need to see Tim Hudson while he's being interviewed? I want to see the game!    *"Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now."*   *sigh*  A's fans tying to manufacture a rivalry.   I knew exactly what this gif was going to be, but I still opened it.   OP pls, what does the meme say?    This is an album that I normally would never listen today, but I work in a store that sells CDs and quite a few people have been buying this lately. This morning, we played it at the store and I like what I heard, so I listened to it more closely when I got home from work. I have to say, it blew me away.    While it definitely sounds more like a Tony Bennett album than a Lady Gaga album, Gaga knocks it out of the park. Her voice is a natural fit for this genre of music. In fact, she blows Tony Bennett out of the water.    When I played this album, I couldn't help but imagine myself in a 1950s club, sitting at a table with a cigar and a glass of scotch...wearing a silk robe, while Bennett, Gaga and their band do their thing on stage. Even if this isn't your usual genre, it wasn't mine, give the album a spin because it truly is outstanding.    Scoring on a bad throw? How basic.   We won more games against STL than the Dodgers did!    Wild throw to first, you bum.   Our turn to walk off!    So 4th and goal from inside the 2. We opt to go for the TD and put the game away rather than make it a 13 point game and force their rookie QB to lead two touchdown drives.   4th and 1 near the STL 40 yard line. We opt to go for it rather than punt and pin the Rams inside their own 15. Instead, the Rams, who need a TD and a field goal to tie the game, only need to drive about 25 yards to get into field goal range.   Why go for it on 4th down when the Rams can still settle for a field goal. Now they're working on a short field.    Vernon is having a horrible game.   Just finished *Moneyball*. I'm looking for another nonfiction book, but something easily digestible.    I know there are a lot of Giants fans like me who live in the Sacramento area. Even if you don't, you should show your support for the Giants' AAA affiliate and join /r/SacramentoRivercats. The mod team there and at /r/AAAMiLB have worked hard to make sure each AAA team has a subreddit. Unfortunately, I think most of the current subscribers are still A's fans. Let's show them how loyal Giants fans are!   If only there was a system in place that would allow the two teams to play each other several times, then we could know which team is better.     We should pinch hit Bumgarner.   Almost every game in the playoffs has been close, but we haven't had a close series yet. Odd...   Saved by a wild pitch AGAIN!   http://i.imgur.com/FbuwEh4.gif   When you only face 4 batters, one home run is huge.   Had back surgery a few weeks ago.   If the Rockies are cheating, they sure are bad at it.   Matheny might have to put on the pads and catch the rest of this game.    Lance Lynn was 1 pitch away from striking out the side in order. Now he leaves the game and can do no better than a no decision. Rough.   He probably thought it was foul. It was hard to tell.    I gained a lot of respect for the Cards fans last night when they cheered when Jay was hit by a pitch when every other crowd would have booed like trained monkeys.   John Jay thinking he's Lorenzo Cain.   After what Matt Carpenter did to the Dodgers, I can't be mad at the guy.    Pitching one more inning will do that.   I've been waiting since 8 o'clock this morning for game time so I can pop open a beer without being judged by my mom.    I took Broncos -10.5 and was saved by the pick 6 as well. I got a second miracle with the Packers ML.   I like the Chargers -7.5. San Diego has been rolling this year and Oakland may be the worst team in the league.    Even Bumgarner's snot rockets have late break on them.    Crawford has the third best BA against lefties among left handed batters this year iirc.    Ball dude was on that like white on rice.   This comment is NaCl positive.   Giants and Cardinals are being way too civilized in this thread. It doesn't feel right.    Chrissy Redford is a babe.   Giants baseball. If it's not weird, we don't do it.   Was that an appeal to the 1st base umpire on a left handed hitter?    *"Cliche cliche cliche cliche?"*    *"Well, cliche cliche cliche cliche."*   When will the Giants/Dodgers playoff series that LA fans kept taking about start?    Cardinals uniforms look like they were taken off a field 100 years ago. Love them!    Well, if we're talking about the best hitting pitcher in baseball this year, can anyone top .258 with 4 homeruns?    He also hit .258   I like Harold Reynolds on Baseball Tonight, but he's insufferable as a color commentator.    Because Harold Reynolds.    One inning in and I finally realize how much I like having the regular play by play call. It's weird watching without it.   But then we would only have Joe Buck to complain about.   It's basically like Snapchat. You take a picture and all of your matches can see and "like" it for 24 hours. It's really pretty stupid, but if I can think of something funny to do, I'll do it. Android has moments too.    I've never had much luck with parlay bets, especially in football where upsets are fairly common, but they sure are exciting! I usually only do parlays when there are two events that are near sure things. You can usually find them in the early rounds of tennis tournaments when two top seeds are playing unknowns or in Champions League soccer when a great team is playing a team from a much smaller league. For football, I usually stick to single bets. If there are two games that I feel especially confident in, I will parlay the money lines.    Don't let that scare you away.    I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me.    The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet.     That's just tthe odds. In order to win $100, you would need to bet $105. Not sure why the Pats don't show the odds though.    Only a few likes so far. Will update if anything changes.    His Snapchat name is dickbaby69. He doesn't post much, but I usually get a chuckle when he does.    I took it from a guy I follow on Snapchat who does the YouTube channel BroScienceLife. He did It about a month ago.    Brian Cushing looks like the guy who would have sex with your girlfriend and then get mad at you when you get upset about it.   Good thing Carey isn't a ref.   Awesome, man! Looking forward to catching some games this season.   I'm assuming most of the mods are A's fans and the change in affiliation probably affected their interest in the River Cats. Are there any plans to change moderators and/or add moderators? I'd hate to see this subreddit be neglected.   As far as I'm concerned, Vogey cemented himself as a Giants legend last night. Couldn't be happier for the guy either.   Probably the MVP of the series, even in a losing effort. Not a fan of the guy's...baseball persona, but he really is a special player.    This is the first player to retire that I can remember coming up as a young guy. Weird.    At any rate, he had quite the career.    Honestly, no one likes those self gratifying posts anyway. As if a Cardinals fan saying, "Great series. You have a good team. I would have rooted for you if you had beaten us" would make them feel any better.   Dude, don't be *that guy*.   This comment tests positive for NaCl.    Giants  Dodgers   Come on, man. Don't be like that.   Super creepy Rob Lowe  Far less attractive Rob Lowe   I think I saw him shit in a gutter in the Tenderloin before game three.   Romo has been nasty the last month.   That play might lead to a Posey Addendum to the Posey Rule.   	108
 YourMovieSucks is hilarious.   You're the coolest. I'd love one.    I can get you one of those, real cheap.    Oh yeah. Good one.   Pretty much anything from Korine is hard to recommend.   Mine would probably be Hunger.    Viola Davis in Doubt   That's cool.   HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME   Cat's Cradle would be nearly impossible to do well enough to deserve the name.   You should watch the movie "The Hunt".   I could care less about the bat-shit storyline. The gameplay is phenomenal, though. I've put a lot of time into it.   Blue Valentine and Punch-Drunk Love. Blue Valentine is just dark and sad, but Punch-Drunk love is actually pretty sweet and funny overall but it deals with emotionally fragile/disabled characters and gets pretty dark at times.   It's amazing to play Infamous: Second Son and then this game and think that they're from the same console generation. This game looks miserable.   Yes fucking please.   It's worth noting that it has 100% on RottenTomatoes.   Cranston couldn't?   How long until dead actors are starring in new movies?   I've been listening to Chance the Rapper ever since he was part of Instrumentality. I got 10 Day the hour it came out.   That was the first thing that came to mind for me too.   What accent is that PSH is using?   Please God, more of this. The funniest Lets Play in recent memory.    Payback and then Get the Gringo for that unofficial "Porter" Double Feature.   It's on Netflix.   Of course Seattle.   And he does a damn good job finding it.      Someone else that did this recently and owned the fuck out of it was Jake Gyllenhaal in Prisoners. He added so much depth to an otherwise relatively 2D character.   I mean, they do say "DO NOT REMOVE THIS CARD FROM AIRCRAFT".   Fantastic Mr. Fox or Mary   Max. Both absolutely incredible.   That's not my point. Fisher is an aging, American, raspy-voiced, father. Hardy is a young Brit. I have no doubt he'll make a great Fisher for the movie, but it won't be the same Fisher from the games.   I disagree. Not to say that this movie will suck or anything, but it will most definitely be just another action movie that happens to have the same name as a beloved video game franchise. Tom Hardy is a great leading man for an action-thriller, but he's not a great Sam Fisher.   I wish they kept this a secret so the movies had more "FUCK YEAH!" moments. However, "FUCK YEAH MEL GIBSON!". I hope he's just porter again. Watching Payback Straight Up and Get the Gringo back to back make me long for more.   Good luck kicking Statham's or Wahlberg's ass.   What's the worst that could've happened? Super powers?   Thats poetic, I think.   I like it, but I think it looks to vintage and quirky to represent Inception well.   Either.    **The Dark Night**  (Everything's in order.)   Are you sure it's not Gahndi, then?   *Ghandi   I'd give you gold for that if I wasn't so lazy   Hell yes.   Oh fuck off. You know this is great.   Somebody please make a font.   I think he might get a best adapted screenplay nom.   Which episode was he in again?   Little bit of column A, little bit of column B.   You are a younger him.   I can't wait until the miniseries spinoff. It has a lot of great people involved, so here's to hoping they don't fuck it up.   He can. Once he lands in water he starts treading.    My last year of middle school was the last year of real dodgeball. Now they took away the hard rubber balls and replaced them with soft foam balls that are impossible to throw at more than 5 mph.    Explains why Google is so productive. I've been to their NYC office and it was the coolest building I've ever been in. It was like a playground for adult geniuses.   Better safe than sorry.   Corey Stoll. Taller, bald, younger, thinner, more handsome, famous for playing a politician and talking to a woman.   Tell me I got it.   Because I said "They apparently forget all about it after [](#s "they kill Silva")."   Which was before [] (#s "they killed Silva")   Skyfall started off being all about this disc with the names of all undercover agents in M16. They apparently forget all about it after [](#s "they kill Silva").   First thought: Of course Jack knows everything about bowling.   The time stamp failed me, but he's at 1:19. It's uncanny.      It's a brilliant black comedy. You won't be disappointed.    Rubber Dingy Rapids, bro.   ~Copies and pastes Screenplay to *Four Lions*~   Rainbow Six Vegas. That game was a fucking blast to watch.      Fuck that other "comedian". There's no way anyone going into comedy professionally should be that easily offended. Solid joke, not offensive.   FUCK now I can't remember either. Let me know when you find out.   A Cartoon Network short series called "Purple   Brown", if memory serves.   So then what (other than morals and what not) prevents me from going to Redbox with The Princess Diaries in hand, renting Thief, taking the Thief disc and putting The Princess Diaries disc in the pouch and go claim that the previous owner switched it?   Not surprising considering the song was written for the movie.   Yeah I know. I thought that a funny 5 second clip out of context would be appropriate though.      I just watched Prisoners. It came out last year and I hadn't seen any of Denis Villenevue's work prior and it blew me away. I've already rewatched it and I love it. Incredible performances all around and an incredibly tight and intense thriller/mystery. For me, it's easily up there with movies like Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs.   Earl?   Can we just talk about how great "legal eagles" is?   The guy had a goddamn fan club. People tend to be fucked up.   Oh yeah. Here are some more serial killer's handwriting samples: [Zodiac Killer](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkj2ohBcpq1qel48oo1_500.jpg) [Jeffrey Dahmer](http://www.annakoren.com/images/jeffrey-dahmer-handwriting.jpg) [John Wayne Gacy](http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/5/8/7/2/8/2/i/9/3/7/p-large/john_wayne_gacy_mud_felons_claw.jpg)   For a little comparison, [here's Richard Ramirez's](http://www.crimelibrary.com/blog/files/2013/01/night-stalker-letter-billy.png) [and here's Charles Manson's](http://cassandraparkin.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/charles-manson.jpg) from a book called Little Billy's Letters.    All due respect, I don't think "passed away'' is the appropriate term for his case.   I didn't see it. But there shouldn't have to be a shitty sequel just to clean up after the first film.   Not Viggo. His voice isn't raspy enough and I don't want to hear his country accent. Plus, he may be too old. Maybe Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Josh Brolin, or Joel Edgerton. They've all done good country accents in the past.  	82
 Yeah I love the STi just I really want a fully loaded vehicle. Would be really tight getting the fully loaded STi    That's what I've been thinking, can get it fully loaded whereas I can't afford a fully loaded STi. Although I will miss the STi badging (which I can live without I assume). Will really miss that big wing on the back (wondering where I could find one for the WRX and how much it would cost me) lol   Gorgeous, should be illegal to get an STi without that big wing though :P   Shout out to Sauga boys!   Oh there is a car in the picture? ;). Yeah the ride is pretty sweet too!   Congrats, still debating between WRX or STi   Absolutely gorgeous, congrats!   Thanks for sharing, I'm in a similar situation. Big into gaming but have been wanting to get back into shape. I was 165 my whole life pretty much (I'm 6'0). Now I'm up to 212 and hate looking in the mirror. I got a fitbit and have discovered MFP which I've been using for the last 3 days or so. I've just been eating right and going for daily walks. I would like to get back into going to the gym to get a body like yourself but I have no idea where to start. What foods to eat, what exercises to do at the gym, do I write them down etc etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated!   I hate the lapis blue lol, if I were to ever get blue it would be the WRB or that new blue they unvieled. :P   I never thought of it like that, thanks for sharing your POV and enjoy the new ride!  	10
 where the fuck are the shop/security  party hats located  pls enlist  thank   but I only have quarters.    Phantom guy yes    beautiful   Yeah,you should've posted this to the [Five nights at Fuckboys subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/fnafb) though   I was wondering if I needed my serial code on the back of my 3ds to still trade it in. After a long time it came off of course. I remember trying to trade in my old DS lite before and gamestop didn't let me because the serial code was gone. I was also wondering how much money is knocked off if you don't turn it in with the charger.  	6
 no   Even Rotten Tomatoes gave it 92% and those cunts are strict as hell. So, without having seen the movie PERSONALLY, going to just go ahead and assume you didn't understand it.

 I can see him getting the start in LF tonight.   Nice!   How can you defend this decision? Gyorko was atrocious last year and looks just as bad so far. You're literally going to keep him rostered because some random guy had him on a sleeper post?  Guerrero is killing it. He's done more in the past 4 days what Gyorko will do all week. Worst case scenario, if Guerrero does horrible, just pick Gyorko back up, no one is going to claim him off of waivers.   Oswaldo vs RHP   Keep cueto and Hernandez. The others are replacable.   Best response here. You're getting fleeced, guerrero might not even play tonight. Tell that owner you don't want a bench player.   Would def drop Crawford for him. If it's a 10 team league there's probably better options than semien on waivers though.   Went 3-5 with 4 rbis yesterday while filling in for Uribe. Apparently he is awful defensively, but after that performance perhaps he earned some playing time. Considering starting him over Melky this week in a 6x6. Anyone have insight into this?   Travis could be legit this year. Check out today's buy/sell column at razzball.com he's the front runner on it.   You're overthinking, as the season goes on it their starts will disperse, contract, etc.  Squad looks good, congrats on starting up fbb!   Honestly it's too hard to tell, improvement would probably be negligible, the guys on your squad look fine. If it's your first year congratulations. Read up on these guys, if one of the waiver wire dudes seems more intriguing for some reason, scoop him. I'd probs drop Quintana for Warren, maybe even Gausman.   Over thinking   Lol I'd shudder to think he's that bad. He did get unlucky last year. He's also like what, 24? Apparently he worked his ass off this offseason. I had him in 2013 so will forever have a soft spot for the little guy.   Pretty encouraging projections for him actually. Check out what fangraphs says about him, looks like he could be a great sleeper this year.   I love segura this year. I think he's due for a big bounce back. Hopefully the brewers trade him so he gets into a better lineup. I expect him to be hitting at the top of the order by May.   He got very lucky last year. Look him up on fangraphs there's a good amount of material on how his peripherals screamed regression for this year. Still a good player, just probably won't repeat last years effectiveness. I'd try to deal him to someone looking to buy low.  EDIT: I still think he's better than the waiver wire fellas you mentioned    I wish, too. Unfortunately he was part of the Craig Kimbrel trade, might get called up in Atlanta soon though.      Who's his replacement?   Why'd you leave cbs? You were easily the best analyst they had.   Baez taking over at 2nd then?   I assume this means Baez is being brought up?      Is jean segura available?    How would you rank Joc Pederson, Marcell Ozuna and Charlie Blackmon for 2015?    Great post, wasn't aware of a lot of these performances.  Why the sell high on Cespedes? Peripheral stat analysis I've read says he could hit a ton of bombs this year.   H2H categories. AVG RBI RUN SB SLG  This is a non-keeper league. I keep reading high rankings on Ozuna and I don't really understand it. 25 HR with a 260 average and negligible speed? Doesn't do it for me. Blackmon the concern is he might platoon at his position and his stats outside of coors are underwhelming. Pederson obviously has the highest ceiling, but will have the struggles of a rookie.   Right now I'm leaning towards Blackmon and Pederson.   Well said. I wouldn't be surprised if managers have been tempted to do that but stopped themselves due to the barrage of media questions that would ensue.  Have you closer shut out the 7thing inning only to have another arm blow it in the 9th? No one wants to step up to the podium after that.   Don't know who Donnie is, sounds like a swell dude..   Talking to a guy at work whose a dodgers fan about this, figured I'd see if the sub had any extra info.   I'd vote give it to the hottest arm in Paco Rodroguez. While a small sample size his minor league numbers are dope, worth giving this kid a shot.   Deepest apologies for the pun in the title. For the sake of the post, let's say committee isn't an option(even though that's the most likely outcome).   Oh my bad, I thought you hadn't drafted yet and you'd be losing your 7th. I'd rather have altuve then, unless your pitching rotation is in dire need of an upgrade.   I'm with you, keep Harvey. Could be a stud and be with you for the next few years of your league. Losing a 7th round pick for altuve is a big opportunity cost, and you have above average2B in Wong as replacement. Stick with your boy, he's trying to deal altuve for a reason.   Yeah he could be a solid rookie sleeper. For me, his ceiling this season isn't much better than what you'd find in most of the average second baseman available though. So while the cost is dirt cheap, he's a gamble, high risk for medium reward. There's more exciting rookies id rather devote a bench spot too and hold throughout the season.   Nytimes did a fairly comprehensive piece on it yesterday if anyone's interested http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/business/trans-pacific-partnership-seen-as-door-for-foreign-suits-against-us.html?referrer=   By balls to the wall do you mean the 31st ranked defense in the league that year? Perry would have been fired if we didn't make the playoffs. The only reason the D came together in the playoffs is from leaders like Antrel Rolle and Justin tuck stepping up and rallying it together as a unit. We were the first playoff team that had more point against than points forward during the regular season. Eli literally had to bail us out in the 4th quarter of almost every game that year, which is what made it so exciting. But our defense was atrocious and Perry doesn't deserve that ring.      Is there a running backpack I can wear that will safely and securely hold my DSLR?   Anyone know where the background picture is from?   Why? Because everyone who joins the police force is a bigot doing it to abuse power and oppress freedoms? There's plenty of cops that genuinely want to just keep the people in their community safe.    Awesome, really impressed with how well put together this is. Already feel immersed after reading, artwork also very cool. Never stop creating.   Baldur's Gate 2 or Deus Ex.   Thank you for sharing this.   Wow really impressive, lighting is awesome brings so much life to it. Animaton reminds me of the ps3 game "Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch"   I'm looking into buying my first DSLR. Been a lurker on this subreddit and some other blogs for a while now. Consensus seems to be the Nikon D3300 is a great entry level camera. My question is, is it worth to save $100-200 on a refurbished camera or should I shell out the extra cash for a new one?      Any recommendations on high quality shoes/underwear?   Awesome thanks so much for your response, definitely have a lot of browsing/thinking to do-   I'd mostly be doing this for weekends at the longest in Upstate New York to give an idea of the type of durability/terrain.         Nothing in the article on how old they're estimating these to be?   Nope this was the moon.   Correct that the main light source is the moon. This was November 2nd, about 2AM.  I don't think this was a Lens flare, as I saw this with my naked eye as well, and took a video that showed the same image.   Link: http://i.imgur.com/1aNpG3W.jpg   Sorry I'm a complete noob at astronomy. I took this picture 11/2/13 in upstate NY (not sure if this information can help me narrow down the positioning of what I was looking at.  Apologies for the iPhone screenshot, I couldn't find the original picture but had this as my background.  I'm not even certain this is a planet, but would love to hear what you folks think.  Thanks!   Could you expand on this a bit? Not a fan of either team so was following the game pretty leisurely, what decisions on particular?   This was fundamentally a completely different offense than what had been in place for the better part of a decade. Very difficult to learn and succeed during the season, naturally going to have a lot of growing pains. If you watch the team's performance throughout the year there is a lot of evident progress, I'm excited to see what it can do next year with an improved line.  Take veteran quarterbacks in the league who are considered top of their class: Brady, Rodgers, Peyton, Brees- out of these, these players have been in the same system their entire careers (I know Peyton changed teams, but he's on another level and runs his own operation- this scheme stayed the same). If you take any of these guys and stick them in an entirely different offense schematically, there's going to be significant growing pains. And while there was a good amount of miscommunication early on in the year, Eli still put up very good numbers overall, which is reason to have higher expectations heading into next season.  Other commentators have mentioned we were beleaguered with injuries- this is true, but honestly I don't like using it as an excuse because I feel good teams can overcome that.  Giants had a lot of games this year they were competitive in until the 4th quarter when they fell apart.  Defense was completely unreliable, truly atrocious at times. Perry Fewell would have been fired in 2011 if it hadn't been for Eli bailing out the defense each week and eventually winning a Super Bowl.  Special Teams is another black eye for the Giants and has been for quite some time. Our coach, Tom Quinn, I'm convinced is someone in ownership's brother-in-law, boggles my mind the man has a job in this league.  Giants fans have a lot to be excited about going into next year. The division has some powerful teams, but it's certainly within their grasp.               You're the man, Wesley!   12 team 6x6 H2H  I'm stacked with closers, would this be overpaying?   The show hasn't been completely faithful to the book, hence my worry.  	64
          thanks for your nice and you understand it very easily :P   why do you think so bro?  	5
 http://youtu.be/5xi4O1yi6b0   Understanding sarcasm.  I'm not sarcastic so I'm never sure if I'm on the receiving end of it.  Unless it's blatantly obvious.  Sarcasm through text messages are the worst.   Elaine?   Dateline!   I use a bit of twitter to get the word out.  My little blog also has lots of photos so sometimes the restaurants or stores use them on their Facebook pages.  I get a good boost in traffic when that has happened.  Edited for spelling   This!  The freedom of rolling around in your undies on cool sheets.     This will be my first Secret Santa gift exchange!  I'm thinking about spoiling my giftee with something homemade.  Perhaps some handmade candles + soaps :D       I think that he's wearing a woman's shirt.  The moobs don't help, but the shirt doesn't look like it's cut for a guy.   Awwww I don't know her and I already love her :D Yay for Alice!!   That poor assistant had to keep on smiling... how uncomfortable.   Maybe you could rub some sugar+olive oil+honey on your lips and let it soak in.  Then after rinsing off with warm water you could use a natural lip balm (non medicated, just simple oil+beeswax type) and try to stop licking your lips.  I know that when I get wind chapped lips I tend to lick it a lot ... which makes it worst.      Hot stinky breath, greasy hair, and musky clothes, this is how I imagine what Russell Brand smells like from watching that gif.   That was such a strange way of holding a cup with that much liquid.  It made the video more intense cause I kept thinking it would spill over.    I'm not really sure.. maybe a total of 20-30 minutes?  As soon as we got off the Bart, walked up the stairs, and we saw a line that was already formed outside on the corner.  Someone was there at a table selling round trip tickets.  The shuttle arrived after 10 minutes of waiting and the ride was 15-20 minutes.  Make sure you only use clear bags or gallon ziplocks.  We totally forgot about it, but good thing my purse was pretty small :D  Have a great time if you decide to go!   And we are back!  We jumped on the south Hayward Bart, transferred at bay fair, got off at balboa, jumped on the 75x then arrived at candlestick!  Thank you all for helping :)     I saw them on Yelp!! I'm tempted to go get some pumpkin beer lol :D   Just downloaded! Thank you :)   You are amazing!  Thank you so much for your help :D   Thank you so much for your help!  We tried asking the hotel staff and they had no clue.  After we get off the bart at Balboa Park, will the 75x bus be nearby?    Hi guys!  We are here for a 49ers game tomorrow and staying in Hayward.  I would love some help on figuring out how to get there.  We want to take the Bart but not sure which exit to get off.  I've also read that it's not really walkable from the Bart station to candlestick.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.   This is exactly what I was thinking...    If not the budget, then perhaps buying different items or presenting the food in a better way...     I just think that this picture looks a little sad for a big company like sirius to tweet out.  Unless that was part of the joke...    No, the sternshow Instagram account posted it.  The spread is kind of sad :( I think I could buy stuff at Costco that would look better than this.   Nice strong forearms on a guy.   When I make my own Almond milk, I like to blend a date into it.  Sweetens it and adds a great flavor.  But since you're on Keto, you could add a few drops of flavored Capella or flavored stevia.   I find that most people like to talk about their favorite movies or television shows.  You can open with " hey have you watched ________ yet?" then fill in the blank with the last movie you watched. Then BAM you're talkin it up!   Wow a Barbie face with a GI Joe body...   I think the whole styling + look she's giving makes her look like a cast member of "Real Housewives of Orange County."  She looks younger and fresher when she smiles.  She looks older, amateurish, and like she is trying too hard in this pic :(   What year is this? 1994? Thumbs down on Barbados.  However, I actually liked Online Sweetheart :D   I could not stop laughing!!  My favorite line was " my body is rejecting this."   I LOLed at the Venus fly trap comment.. ahahahah.  I killed 20 BSF adults yesterday and there hasn't been anymore today, so hopefully it's over.  I was thinking maybe they're trying to come inside since the AC is on and it's 100 degrees outside.  I haven't looked in the bin in 2 weeks cause I've been scared.  Later on today I'm planning on going outside with the vacuum hose and suck up any BSF adults I see in the bin.  Wish me luck.  eeeek   So I've been trying to starve my bin a bit and today I've started to see Black Soldier Fly adults inside my house!  ACK!  Is there a reason why they would want to come into the house?  We don't have any rotting food, our back door hasn't been opened, but I still see them gathering around the window closest to the door.  Could they be crawling in from around the door? Why are they in the house? AHHh help please lol.     You and your "huge-ass roommate" really are great people :D  Makes me proud that you live in Los Angeles!   I have a scentsy one that I love and a walmart one for our restroom.  I've noticed that walmart does have a great selection and new ones all the time.   Hm.. I've ordered from Candles by Victoria, Front Porch, and Grumpy Girls. I think there are more but those are all I can remember off the top of my head. Since I make candles, I just scoop out leftover wax from testing and use it in my tart warmer.     I haven't..but their melters seem to all come in Blue.. strange... ahahaah    I LOVE your blog.  There I said it :D That Pesto recipe looks delicious.   That's why I've left it that way for this long.  The thing that does bother me is it runs on with my posts titles.  For example, if a title of a page is "my first post" it looks like " My first posttest_subject6067.com" . Should I just leave a space after my titles or add a space in front of sitename .  I don't even know if that would work!    Was looking at my titles and it seems like the default has sitename in it.  Do I really need it for better Seo?  Thank you!  	41
 In my second year, still a lot of work but the first year is burtal. It isn't just the long hours but it is also that most of my friends did not get why I couldn't hang out like I used to. I found myself pretty isolated my first year. Now I have teacher friends , and my old? m  friends have come to understand that I am not a bartender any more. I love my students and my class room management skills have significantly improved from last year   Have the students do a Mini DBQ. For my US I have them watch the crossing and do follow a long question sheet and then write a short essay. It never hurts to have a review of the stuff we do in the beginning of the year. Also mini DBQ, and a movie are pretty hard for a sub to mess up.   Forgot to mention the schools on James island are good too   It depends on your definition of uniform, elementary and middle schools typically have a "uniform" that consist of certain colors they can wear to school khaki and navy blue pants , and white shirts. Its pretty much a stricter dress code , not a true uniform that the school issues. Most high schools let kids wear whatever as long as it isn't to revealing or offensive.   Teacher here, unless you are in Mt. Pleasant the schools in Charleston county are not ideal, Berkley and Dorchester 2 have good options.   There is a bar dt called prohibition they have swing bands play from time to time. Other than that I am not sure.   This is what I love ab the bi community, you would be hard pressed to find a group of people more open minded and willing to see people as individuals.   Cellar door    Great straight teeth with no cavities thanks dad, chronic teeth grinding and jaw clenching thanks mom   Mr. Feenie   I tell my kids on the first day, about my time in school , that I have ADD and dyslexia, that I had a difficult home life. I talk about excuses vs.  adjustment, that I will not accept excuses but that from time to time students need adjustments. I encourage them to let me know if they need an adjustment. As the year goes on I share more and more about my life when it seems to fit, for example we watch student news sometimes and their was a story about a teenager that committed suicide, I told my students I used to work for a suicide hotline and that I would always be there to listen if they needed to talk. I had a student come talk to me a couple weeks later about feeling suicidal. If a kid seems "off" I pull them out in the hall and ask if they are ok, invite them to come see me during lunch.  Even if nothing is going on  it lets them know I care, and more often than not something is going on and they share.     I don't actually use twitter, my school is pretty big on not being friends with current students on social media. I give them a post it and have them write a # after we read a short passage. So say we were looking at FDR's speech after pearl harbor, kids might write #teamUSA #WWII #daysthatwillliveinimfany it helps them pick out some of the major points, I use them as an exit slip sometimes.    I have been told I have certain set of skills, but I honestly think it is because I never sleep with people that I don't already feel really strong chemistry with.   You don't believe in laws like don't rape or kill anyone? I could see not turing them in for drugs or getting in a fight. But if my child severely damaged or killed another human I would turn them in. I would also get them a lawyer and continue to love them, but at that point they are beyond talking to.   My cousin was about 10 years older than me so she was an adult in my eyes. I think being around  stable family is great I know I really enjoyed being at my friends house , maybe just take the opportunity when you happen to be alone to ask how things are going. One of my best friends mom used to do this, I would wake up early when I slept over so I could have breakfast and talk to her mom alone.    I had two fuck buddies , both were supposed to be my first one night stand, but in both cases the sexual chemistry was so good that we decided to be fuck buddies. I have still never had a real one night stand.   Every time I have taken a break it has been because I wanted to pursue things with some one else. Needless to say none of those relationships worked out. The problem with a break is it leaves you in relationship limbo , you can't move on and you can't enjoy the relationship. If you are taking a break to ease the blow of an actual break up or because you would like to stay friends then I would suggest a clean break and an agreement not to talk for 6 months. At the end of 6 months go to lunch , you will probably be able to be friends at that point.    Sexual predators almost never attack just once, you would be putting countless people in danger and your child would think that you are simi ok with it because you talked to him / her ab it and didn't turn them in. Some times the hardest part of being a parent is disapline.      My parents went through a really nasty divorce when I was 13. I didn't live close to my aunts or uncles, but here are some things I wish the adults in my life would have done. Don't trash talk either party, I loved my mom I loved my dad but I felt like I had no one neutral to talk to , everyone had taken sides. I wish an adult had taken me to do something one on one, when your parents are divorceing they are so wrapped up in their own drama they forget to take time to be a parent. It is nice to have some one on one time with a stable adult.  My parents did get my sister and I into counseling, but I hated the counselor I finally told my cousin who let my dad know. I got a counselor that I liked after that. If she hadn't given me the space to talk ab my feelings I probably would have never told anyone. Remember that ugly divorces can go on for years even if the paper work is finalized, it wasn't until I went to college that I finally felt relief from my parents drama and manipulation. Unfortunately patent will use their kids to punish one another.     It depends on the level of the students. If they are higher level you may be able to use reading like a historian. http://sheg.stanford.edu/rlh I typically use a non primary source to give them an idea of what we are talking about and then give then a primary source document. We break it down as a class after each paragraph we talk about how we would say it. Sometimes I have them do a # that would follow it if it were on twitter to check for understanding. For the Gettysburg Address I break the speech up into sections and have groups re-write it on the white board. For my students primary source work is all bout understanding so anyway we can break it down is huge. You may also be able to use some mini DBQs they have step by step instructions on how to use documents to create an outline and eventually write a argumentative essay. Hope that helps good luck on your first year.   This is how pd should go, meet with your department for 30 min meet with your grade level for30 min , go over leagel bs that has to be covered 30min. Have the first years and new teachers meet with admin for an hour to go over school policy. Spend the rest of the day working on what you need to because you are a fucking professional and you know what you need to do. Why is that so hard? I came back to school a week early because of all the pd we have this year. I pitty the teachers that didn't because they are only going to have one day to get everything together.      I have never cried because a celebrity died until today. I always felt that Robin Williams was the fun uncle of my generation. His work was peppered through out my childhood and brought me so much joy. He seemed to be touched by fire that made him both brilliant and self destructive. With a heavy heart Robin we will miss you.   Perhaps I can shed some light on the situation, I had been in only hetero relationships and while I was interested in f/f relationship it just never really presented itself. I met a lesbian and we hit it off as friends after hanging out a few times she told me that she thought she was developing feelings for me. I was really thankful for her honesty because it let me choose to experiment with her and not feel pushed into it. We dated for a little while and while the physical part of the relationship was good I realized I couldn't fall in love with her and I ended things. Because our relationship was built on honesty we both did minimal damage to one another.  So your assumption that for mostly straight folks it may not be more than a physical expression may be correct, I think that if you handle this relationship with honesty and respect then it could have a positive out come.    I used to be part of a studio that offered fantastic teachers and a variety of yoga classes, but I recently moved, and their was only one place in town that offered yoga. It is at the local gym and  they have yoga 2 days a week, the teacher is newly trained (200 hour) and the class seems to be for beginners. I honestly don't feel challenged in there I love the class because it gives me the space to practice with others, and I always feel more grounded after I leave. However I don't feel like I am progressing in my practice, I have been supplementing with youtube videos, but it isn't the same as having a teacher adjust you especially for more difficult poses. Any suggestions  or advice would be appreciated.   I think my biggest victory has been applying my practice off of the mat. I get anxious about things I have no control over and lately when I feel it starting I can focus on my breathing and calm my mind. It also makes me more patient with myself because I think about how many times I fell out of poses before I was able to hold them and that I was only able to do it because I kept trying. I also really enjoy that my body will crave yoga now, I feel what needs to be worked and what poses help me.   I get runners high but only after 45 min or so of working out. To be fair though my body is really sensitive. For example if I drink a coke after 12pm I will be up until 1 or 2 am. I also get drunk off of like 2 1/2 beers...so there's that.   I was having a discussion with a friend one time about religion, and she said if you don't believe in God then why are sunsets so beautiful? Her reasoning was that their was no evolutionary reason for humans to find sunsets beautiful. There for it was God's way of reminding us that we were souls everyday. It made me happy to think about it for a while. Often times religious people assume that atheism is a choice, it really wasn't for me. When I looked at the evidence I just couldn't believe anymore. Sometimes I wish I could, and sometimes when I watch the sunset I do.   Fantastic list thanks   The national archives maybe a good place to start, it would depend on what you were teaching but they would almost certainly have documents on how these nations have interacted with the US . http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/  this is the teachers link but the whole site has great resources.    Great list I forgot about some of those , thank you so much!   love crash course, use it in my class often!   I am putting together my emergency sub plans for the year and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for movies to show to my US History and Government/ Economics classes   I have 30 jobs total , but some of them are repeats my desk are split into 3 section and each sections has a specific person to get materials, collect papers, make sure the desk get re-organized after group work, some of my other jobs are answer the phone, open the door when there is a visitor, a person to fix typos on the power point, someone to water the plants, a person to let me know when the supply table is running low. a person to pass back graded work.I give them all very professional sounding names. It helps the class run smoothly and everyone contributes .    The first day I am planning to go over the rules, tell the kids a bit about me , and then I give them a dynamic duo card they have to find their partner ( think Batman and Robin , Bonnie and Clyde, Micky and Minnie ) I give them a few minuets to ask their partner questions then I have them present what they learned to the class. After that I assign class room jobs. fill out survey on learning style and home life. discuss materials needed for the class ask them to come see me after if they don't have materials so I can get them for the student ( I work in a title 1 school )  The second day, reviewing the rules , talking about classroom procedures (they will have gotten a preview of this when we assigned jobs) practicing some of the procedures . Start going over the syllabus , discuss the major projects and papers and when they will be due. Have kids practice their classroom jobs , mini lesson on what history is and why it is important.  	35
 I was 16, a couple months from turning 17. My mom, sister, her two kids and myself were going to be evicted. I was going to have to move to a new town and start going to a new high school. It was really scary for me. Then a friend's mom and dad offered to let me live with them so I could still go to the same high school. My mom urges me to do what I thought was best for myself so I went and stayed with that friend's family. I lived their for a year and a half and I've never been more grateful for something.   I woke up yesterday in my bed.    Step 1. Create an idea that will make sense to some people and will keep that group together. Step 2. Brainwash that group into believing everything you tell them. Step 3. Create rituals that are really just bonding experiences for the group.  Step 4. Do whatever it takes to expand your group/keep it together.  I don't really know how a cult works.   Dolphin and a bear.    The Social Network soundtrack. I think it's awesome and it's been great at keeping me focused.    I think it will be interesting to see what people have to say here.    So I'm currently nearing the end of one TV Show and I need to figure out what show I'll watch next. Many one here willing to give me reasons as to why Doctor Who should be next?   Hey everyone, I realize this probably won't get too much support, but I think it's worth a try. I'm now three months behind on rent and I would really love to be able to give my landlord at least a month of rent money ($400). I linked my gofundme page here. The goal on that is $1,200, but any donation will be appreciated greatly. Thank you. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c   I recently posted trying to get some ideas of ways to make some more money and I would like to thank those who helped! I have some ideas buzzing around to start up a small scale tutoring service at my college and hopefully that helps out a bit.   Although I have a job I'm not making what I need to make to afford my rent right now. I would love a quick relief for at least a month of rent. My rent is only 400 a month. I fell behind because I had to miss a good amount of work and it sent my life a little out of control. I would love to be able to give my landlord at least 1 month of rent ASAP. My fortunately at this pace I won't be able to pay it all off until sometime in 2015 and who knows if my landlord is going to be forgiving?   Here is a link to my gofundme, any donation is appreciated no matter how small or generous. Thank you!  http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c   Hey all, I'm in a tough spot when it comes to money and I haven't found much support. I did set up a gofundme, and I got a little money on it from Facebook friends, but that money was really only a little. I'm in college full time, living on my own and I haven't been able to fully pay my rent for three months now and I owe a couple hundred to school. I'm really looking for some ideas to make some money. I tried getting a second job, but the combination of my school schedule and not having a car made that impossible. I recently got over a fight with depression, but I'm worried it's going to come back. Any ideas are welcome, but be serious!   Big Ben vs Baltimore or RG3 vs Minnesota? Standard ESPN scoring    Cody Parkey vs Houston or Nick Novak vs Miami?    Jeremy Hill yes!   I hope he returns and plays well, I traded some good assets for him!    I have another open roster spot. My team is fine with 3 QBs. I never do this, but it fits my team right now.    I didn't know who Andre Ellington was at the beginning of the year. I tend to only care about the players from the team I support or whoever is on my fantasy team. I didn't know he was a beast. My team auto drafted him. I said "who is this guy?" So I traded him. Now I see him doing great and it's like watching a fat ex girlfriend look beautiful and not fat with Leo DiCaprio. I see these stats he puts up and I feel like I'm dying a little bit. I'm 3-5 (3 game winning streak though!) and his owner is 8-0. I'm a normal title contender in this league and I know that if I kept him my team would be in a better position. Mr.Ellington I beg for your forgiveness. Forgive me for my naiveness and impatience. I will live the rest of my life indebted to you if you allow me to make the playoffs in this league. Please, Mr. Ellington. Thank you Red Jesus.    This PowerPoint made me sad because I traded Ellington earlier in the year and I wouldn't be able to tell you who I got in return....    I have him a my 3rd string QB right now. My team is pretty top heavy so I've got a few expendable bench spots so I figured why not stick him behind Cutler and Big Ben. It prevents him from killing me if he goes to another team and what if he plays out of his mind and out performs Cutler and Big Ben? He's a high risk high ceiling guy and if you have a room for him let him in!     Had an open spot so I grabbed him up. Starting QB is Cutler, but my season long backup has been Big Ben. I'm rostering all 3 right now and now I don't know what to do.   Smallpox and anthrax   Selling Knowshon Moreno for $25 the week before he was placed on IR   So I got home from school a few hours ago (I go to community college). I live with two roommates who love to eat my food. I was expecting to make the rest of my spaghetti last until Thursday because I get paid Friday. It was gone when I got home. I get headaches when I'm hungry and they make it really difficult to study and do any work.  I had to walk home too because I forgot my bus money at home ($1.50 and it's like a 50 minute walk). All I have left is some bread now, but there's a couple pieces left and that won't get me too far. If someone buys me a nice pizza I'll post it with me smiling and then I will write you an appreciative poem!  I live in the US and my only option is dominos. Thank you.    For my flex spot standard non PPR. Victor Cruz, Odell Beckham JR (vs PHILLY), CJ Spiller (vs NE), Golden Tate (vs MIN) or Julian Edelman (vs BUF).   0-5 and giving up the most points in the league. Kid in my league who is 5-0 has scored the 3rd lowest total, but has given up the lowest total by over 100 points.    I try to fleece people, but so far I've gotten Demaryius Thomas for Sanders/Welker (kid dropped Welker a week later). One of my friends in my league was telling me that he would get these trade offers of Steven Ridley and Torrey Smith for Calvin Johnson (after his week 1 performance). Oh, Doug Martin, Vincent Jackson and MoJo for Peyton is a trade that happened. Sproles, Kelvin Benjamin, T.Y Hilton and Lamar Miller for Frank Gore and Randall Cobb also happened. Those 3 trades that happened involved the same kid. He's traded away Thomas, Manning, Gore and Cobb in 2 weeks.   edit: added two trades   Yeah and my team is now 0-5.   Things are looking a little better. Together we can do this!   Who else is playing the Seahawks D/ST and is furious with this Redskins offense?   I'm up by 3 points against his owner so I'm hoping for some fumbles and less than 10 yards total. Also the Seahawks D/ST need to not get any turnovers/touchdowns and allow a boatload of points.  This was the best week of my winless season so far and I really need this!   So I've posted here a few times and haven't gotten anything. So I would like to offer a poem to anyone that gets me a pizza meal. I'm in need of a large pepperoni with something to drink. No need to post anything about me, but times are tough I'll leave it at that. I'm not the best at poems, but hey I figured you're giving me a meal! I need to give something in return.    I haven't been able to pay my rent for the last few months and for me that is extraordinarily far behind. I'm supposed to be getting money from a car accident case sometime in 2015, but my landlord isn't having it. The money I get from work goes to food and transportation to work/school. I'm 20 years old and I will have no where to turn. My dad lives in Florida (I'm in Connecticut) and we don't talk. My sisters and mom all live together and don't have room for me. I've had to change my life plans recently to try to accommodate me as I am right now, but I might have to change them drastically if I don't get any help soon. I set up a gofundme and a few friends have put some money in. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c is the link to that. I've sold everything I have of value aside from my clothes, phone and laptop. I've tried getting a second job and have been trying for a few months now. If you want more details about how my life is almost ruined you can ask me. Thanks for anything. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c   This interests me... How did he start this and how could I start?      I need Gronk Seattle D/ST and Harvin to have under 19 points combined!    Bell and Jennings. You've got some awesome RB depth for a 12 team.    So I need to pick 2 of these guys for a standard espn league. CJ Spiller vs Detroit, Montee Ball vs Arizona, Ben Tate vs Tennessee and Andre Williams vs Atlanta.    Well, I'm lucky in that I have a lot of things I'm interested in so I was able to look at what degrees gave me the best chance at getting a job and go off of that. I'm studying microbiology and I want to be a virologist.   You people can learn about me.       Thank you just set up a gofundme   So I'm going to a local community college and living in my own. My mom is broke and actually asks me for money sometimes. The thing is I'm broke too. I had a nice summer job until I was in a car crash, then a month later I spiraled into a stress fueled depression. I've seen a therapist and I've gotten better, but the stress and anxiety is still taking it's toll. I missed work because of that depression and car crash. I fell behind on bills. I couldn't work at that job anymore. I have a new job now and I'm looking for a second. I owe my landlord  Nearly 1k and my school 230 before I can apply for the spring semester. I missed school full time last year (would've been my sophomore year) because I was stressing out over life. I'm scared it's happening again and I don't want to get stuck in a life without education. I should get money from the car crash in mid-late 2015, maybe later. Any amount of money will help out. I just desperately want to give my land lord some money and be able to pay back my college. If you need any verification I can provide it. Thank you so much.   Edit: I just set up a gofundme  gofundme.com/fdjd8c    Only $2? Can't even get a pizza pizza with that!   Of course I'm only joking, it's a nice offer!    So I made a mistake with my bank account and now I'm $35 poorer than I was and it put me in the negative. I'm in college and I'm used to going until the last dollar is up, but when there's no money what is there to do. I live off campus by myself and I have enough chicken for 2 meals. I would like to save those for Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday I'm fine - I go out Thursday night after class and one friend pays for us all and I've negotiated switching weeks with him. I was hoping someone could spot me a pizza tonight. Once I get paid I'll go back on here and buy someone pizza. It's only the right thing to do. Thank you!   He has 3 backups no one knows   Yeah and currently has 2 defenses and 2 kickers and 2 open starter spots   	45
 Wow. It's not your fault though, maybe tell Greg you found some picture associated with your account from his phone and that he should check that shit out. This is a funny fuck up. Also, stop going through the shit   That's a lot of coincidences; either this is bs or you have some bad karma my friend.  	2
    In all honesty I'd love to see Zac Efron in a really different role. Like something other than a comedy or romance movie. I think he is a talented actor, but he keeps choosing roles that are pretty boy roles. He wants to break from High School musical. He came close with the Paperboy, but he keeps playing the pretty boy. He needs to pick a role that will change his image or force him to play more than a pretty boy. Something like Christian Bales American Psycho.  Another talented actor is Robert Pattinson. Twilight may be terrible, but he was not the problem with them. He's good in what ever he does, but he keeps getting bad roles. Luckily The Rover looks really promising.      [Here!](http://vimeo.com/43883589)   Yeah, sort of. Like no one well known. Find fantastic actors who don't mind having sex, or good porno actors, and not make it sex with a story, but a story with sex. So I guess more like erotica. But have legitimately good writing, story, acting, a score, and cinematography.   I always picture it like, "What if Terrence Malick made porn?"   It was just a short skateboard doc. More about the philosophical side of skateboarding.   I take the interstate *to* because it's quicker. I take the backroads *from* because it's beautiful.   The girls from The Crucible.   Nope. But I did work on a movie that was released in a few theaters and a documentary that won best cinematography and best short documentary. I've made a few short stuff, but nothing major. Although, I have thought about making a "good" porno before.   What about zombies you see in newer fiction? Zombies who are living, breathing humans infected with a virus instead of the undead.   I guess it depends on what you mean by movies.    Cold.   Try turning all things off that produce light (tv, night light, etc.). Make your room as dark as possible. Maybe get some white noise like a floor fan or ambient natural sounds like rain or waves. Also keep your room at a comfortable temperature (not too hot, not too cold).    Got me through high school   Learn the notes and practice.   [UltimateGuitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) has tabs for just about every song.   Watch a movie. Nothing like losing yourself for two hours in another world. There are movies for all kinds of moods, all kinds of tastes. There's something for everyone.   Love :(   Dream job no doubt. I would fund my first feature length film and hope for the best.   Same it is every year: Be a better me than I was last year.   Made a post that was an album of screenshots of Mulan.   Mostly because of my religion. But even if it wasn't for my religion, I don't like needles.  Also the thought of a tattoo gives me anxiety. Having to decide what image/word I want to have on my body for the rest of my life is *too* much for me.   To move out west.   Movies and movie making. I guess it partly has to do with the escapism aspect of watching a movie. For two hours I can disappear into another world.  I love filmmaking because I love making stories and ideas a reality. I love telling stories visually. I'm good at it, and I've never really been good at anything really. When I make a film, I'm *creating art*. Which is so cool to me. I'm making something. I'm making an idea I had a reality. I'm bringing this idea to life and making it a physical thing.    My buns and thighs. I'm like the only guy I know who gains weight in his butt and thighs. All the other guys gain in their stomach or waist. I hate having a big booty.  Also, my face. I'm hairy everywhere else: my head, chest, arms, legs, butt, and nether regions. But for some reason I simply *cannot* grow facial hair of any kind. I'm in my twenties and I look like a chubby sixteen year old.   A Moment to Remember, a Korean film. I bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. It tells a story of a man and women who fall passionately in love, but their love is put to the greatest test when [Spoiler](/s "his wife develops Alzheimer's, develops dementia, and starts losing her memory. The last thirty minutes of it rips your heart right out.")   Sounds cheesy, but it's executed perfectly and feels genuine and never comes off as cheesy or hoakey.    There's a lot to pick from, but I really really love The Tree of Life. I think it's an incredible achievement in film. The fact that it can tell this ambitious, yet small story set across a cosmic, "greater power" background is incredible. This movie is very divisive I only know one person personally who liked it while the other people I know who saw it thought it was bad.  I saw it with my mother and we both cried. We could both relate to the story. I had a strict father who I knew loved me, but had a hard time showing it, and as a result I was closer to my mother than my father. The movie really resonated and affected me probably more than any other movie I saw. It's a beautiful film that tells a beautiful story and has gorgeous cinematography, visual effects, and music. With acting that reminds you that great acting doesn't have to be explicit, it can also be subtle.    Has to be Star Trek. The thought of just exploring the universe in what is probably one of the coolest space ships ever sounds incredible.   In no order  Inherent Vice  Gone Girl  Interstellar  The Raid 2  Knight of Cups (or any of the three Malick films that are supposedly coming out this year)   Right now it's Tarantino and Christoph Waltz. Mainly because I think they are a match made in heaven and it clearly comes across on screen. I wish they had gotten together earlier in their careers though. The more films they do together, the better.  Another match made in heaven are Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gossling as well as Winding Refn and Cliff Martinez, his choice composer.     1. 12 Years a Slave - I've heard quite a bit of criticism about this film being "pretentious", "self-indulgent", and "over rated". I love Steve McQueen and think he is a fantastic director. 12 Years is almost a perfect movie that I think will be considered a classic. I like how it was unflinching in its portrayal of slavery. We've often seen the hard labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. It also has some of the best acting I've seen.  2. The Place Beyond the Pines - Another movie that has received quite a bit of criticism, more so than 12 Years. I absolutely loved how this film almost felt like a stage play. How it was clearly broken into three acts. I think the acting, directing, and music are great. Could this movie have been better? I guess, but I still thought it was fantastic. I also really loved the father-son aspect of it. I'm super close to my father and this film really resonated with me and affected me emotionally more than any film this past year.  3. Only God Forgives - Probably the most divisive movie of the year. Heavily criticized for it's lack of story and plot. I think the minimalist thing works for this film though. What it lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style. I love Nicolas Winding Refn because he's unafraid to make the kind of movies we don't usually see. He doesn't care if you like his movies and that gives him more freedom. Only God Forgives probably has the best cinematography, set design, and score that I saw in a film last year. This movie isn't for everyone though so I understand why it's a divisive film.   There is /r/MoviePosterPorn   I actually found Looper to be underwhelming.    It's funny you say that because 4 isn't *that* bad and an "R" rating doesn't guarantee good. A Good Day to Die Hard returned to "R" and still was hot garbage.    There's a movie called This Means War about kids who have a pretend war with sticks and stuff, but you see it from their perspective so the stick guns look real and when they get shot there's blood. Pretty good movie.    Too bad they cut it off.   This has to be the *longest* Grammys yet.   Around $600   There was a post on here or r/gaming, but I'm sure it was here. It was an album of pics that turned skyrim into a desert. I can't find it anywhere. Anyone know where the post is or what the mod was called?   That sounds fantastic!   I've played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on consoles. I've finally decided to build a pc!  My question isn't necessarily "What are the must have mods?" My question is, what mods will freshen up the game and breath new life in it and change it up enough for someone who has spent hundreds of hours in this world?   You do know the first rule of being a troll is to not tell people you're a troll, right? Otherwise what's the point?   What does it do?   I don't want to out myself.   I'd change r/funny to r/AmeteurNight   Lost a lot of weight and got in shape. I'm now overweight again. Maybe *this* time they'll notice.   Movies have been around for a hundred years. Video games have only been around for only like half that at most. And they *were* originally created as a kid's toy sort of. But nowadays games are growing. They *are* a valid and great form of storytelling. I think in maybe thirty years it will get there. Honestly it probably won't be until graphics in games are nearly undistinguished from reality that they will be taken as seriously by *everyone*.    Injuries that involve bones breaking.    It's not high school.   I stayed awake for like 3 days once in Boy Scouts because we were cooking a lot of butts for a fundraiser.   I have to poop with my pants and underwear completely off. Like not around my ankles. Like off of me. It feels restrictive, and when I feel restricted I can't poop.   1. Graduating high school because I didn't take it seriously and almost didn't graduate.  2. Close second was becoming an Eagle Scout. I wasn't super into Boy Scouts, but I was so close to getting my Eagle and my parents really wanted me to do it, so I did. It made my parents super proud of me which makes me happy. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't give up entirely.    Sausage, beef, steak, six kinds of cheese, extra cheese, and white sauce instead of standard red pizza sauce.   Probably still in Memphis. Damn. Hopefully I'll be at least close to getting married to someone. Hopefully have a house. Hopefully I'll be a professor somewhere out west.   The toys I had. Kids today, and of the future, all their toys are electronics. Mp3 players, tablets, phones, etc. *My* toys were action figures, board games, stuffed animals, etc. These things still exist, but no child today wants these. When I was a kid all I wanted were G.I. Joes. Last year, my friends kid was asking him for an Xbox One, an ipad, and a moped.   Ate a lot.   Not really. I had probably close to twenty friends in high school. So far I only keep in touch with like four or five of them and only hang out frequently with like two of them.  With work and college, not only do you find it hard to keep in touch and get together with old friends, but you meet new ones.   I was babied pretty hard growing up. My parents never made me get a job and spoiled me and my sister. This led to me not being prepared for being on my own in the real world. Still love my parents to death, though.   So I'm 20 and I've only had two jobs. One was for a place I worked at for only a month before leaving for school. I went to school for a year. Then I got another job. I had every intention of keeping this job. However I was laid off after only a month because "they couldn't afford to keep me on."  My question is, when applying for a job, should I leave off the second job? My mother said I should because it makes me look bad because it looks like I quit jobs after only a month. But I said I *should* put my second job because experience is experience, even if it is just an extra month.  Is putting on the second job on applications hurting my chances of getting a job?   Fags are going to hell and shouldn't be given any rights, we already made this mistake once with black people, don't let it happen again.   Clothes, movies, definitely junk food.   I guess pretty far. Mine would suggest it was long.   Today I learned   I thought it had a fantastic first three quarters that were filled with suspense and great directing, but that last quarter turned into a generic possession/exorcism scene.   A 2001: A Space Odyssey remake directed by J.J. Abrams starring Brad Pitt and featuring Matthew McConaughey as HAL.   Blue Valentine. Very sad, tragic and beautiful movie.   Man the last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely fantastic!    It's a shame we likely won't see this movie anytime soon, if at all.   Charlie's Angels. Yeah the movie is dumb, but I think Rockwell kills it.   Bad posture.    She knows   Can they be purchased? Would love to have one in the dining room or hearth room.          I love movies that have spy stuff, secret agent stuff, undercover stuff, and surveillance stuff. But not James Bond movies, movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Body of Lies. Like the more realistic and maybe even more politically charged ones. The Bourne movies are another example. What are some similar movies?    Don't forget glamorous!   Any lyric that rhymes a word with the same exact word.   Also, "Baby can you breathe?/ I got this from Jamaica/ It always works for me-heeeee"  In that weird whisper voice of his.    I don't know, if my phone rings or I get a text, I'll see who it is. If it's my sister it's usually an emergency because she never calls me unless it's important. It's always usually a text. My phone shows me a preview of a text and if it appears to be an emergency, I'll look at it, but if it's just a mundane message it can wait.    I chew with my mouth closed in public but when I'm around my immediate family, I don't monitor how I chew. Is this still rude?      They can be comic strips, graphic novels, or anything. Just not a super hero themed one.   Really beautiful! Can someone with more knowledge than me explain what RAW is and what shooting in it does?   That's what I'm wondering. Why post this when the casting appears to already be over?   I'm shooting a documentary and I'm looking to get some nice skyline and rooftop shots of Memphis. What are some places where I can do this?   I'm not saying critics are always right. I love plenty of movies critics call "terrible." But ratings act as a guideline for people. Most people don't have the time to pick just any movie and hope its good. They want it to be worth their time. They want to know it will be good. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of horror movies are poorly rated, which hurts the genre. Now smaller, creative, and good horror movies don't get seen. Critics are most definitely not always right, but they do have a HUGE influence on what people watch.    Yeah I thought the zombie pov was super creative, but I guess I'm just so over zombies. Also, in all honesty, the eyeball one, while kinda cool in concept, was sooo dumb.    I agree, but I think the way to do it is to set up jump scares that don't happen. Here's a comment I made earlier.   "See the thing about jump scares is that they are only suppose to happen twice. Once at the beginning and once at the end. The point of the first one is to put the audience on edge. Showing them that anything can pop out at any minute. What makes this effective is that by not having a jump scare again, you put the audience in suspense of something that won't happen again. That's why the jump scare is genius. You make them think it can happen at anytime but don't. The point of the second and final jump scare is for the payoff. Now that the audience has been waiting the entire time for the next jump scare, they let their guard down because it's been like an hour or so. That's when you let loose the second and final jump scare.  That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes."

That's what I hear. I only saw part of the first season. Is it more supernatural stuff like ghosts or what?   I'm not saying horror movies need to be big budget, I'm just curious as to why everyone believes story, writing, and acting have to take a backseat instead of riding shotgun along *with* the horror.    I dunno. I always felt comedy is the hardest because it's the most subjective and broadest subject. I feel like it's pretty universal what most consider scary and horrific. Sure, there are specific phobias like heights, spiders, the ocean, etc that some find scary that others don't. But I think everyone can agree that murderers, creatures, and being alone in a dark haunted place is scary. I do think however that it's easier to creep people out than to all out scare them. I personally find subtle stuff like shadows moving in the background or footprints leading under the bed far more scarier than "in your face" stuff.    Inside, Martyrs, and The Devil's Backbone are fantastic! But Martyrs felt less like a horror movie and more like a depressing drama with horrific things happening to this person. Which I guess now that I've written that out could be considered a horror movie.    True, but I feel like with action and rom-coms, we may rarely see great ones, but we kinda consistently see decent ones. Whereas with horror, it's rare to come across even decent ones. Especially horror movies made by big studios.    The entirety of Enter the Void feels like a dream sequence because of how surreal it is.   The shining also has some creepy dream sequences.   And the obvious choice would have to be Inception.    I actually really want to see we are what we are. I hear it's great   It was the cult one with all the kids. Or was that the first VHS?  Edit: Yes it was the second one. The segment was titled "Safe Haven."   The problem with VHS 2 is that there is really only one part of it that is good and it's only 20 minutes out of an hour and a half.  As for the indie stuff, I agree that there are quite a few that I hear are good but I just don't know how to watch them without buying them.   I started thinking about this while browsing the horror section of Netflix. There tends to be a lot more horror movies that are bad compared to other genres. In fact, it's quite rare we see good horror movies anymore. Horror movies tend to hang around a 6 or below on IMDB or a 50 or below on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The most recent good horror movie I can think of is The Conjuring. Which had a great first 3 quarters, but the last quarter turned into a pretty generic possession scene.  Why is this the case? What's the cause of this? Is it the over saturation of them? Is it because they're generally easier to make on a low budget or what? It seems like the only truly good horror movies, with a few exceptions, are foreign now. Is it because most directors/writers/producers believe that story, acting, writing, and character development aren't as important in the horror genre?   Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection is considered one of the best Bluray transfers. Also, Samsara is jaw-droppingly gorgeous.   The Tree of Life is pretty killer as well.  If you want to find out which blurays are worth getting, [blu-ray.com](http://www.blu-ray.com/) has just about every bluray reviewed based on video, audio, and special features.   His other brother was also in a movie called Electick Children. A movie about a teen girl who becomes impregnated by rock music.   When Ohio is for Lovers came out I thought it was the sickest!   I know every lyric to this song.      I love Terrence Malick so much!   [The Divide](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535616/?ref_=nv_sr_2)  A movie about a group of people who take shelter in a basement after a nuclear attack. As days go by, their mental, emotional, and physical states start breaking down. It's a great scifi drama that focuses on the conflict between these people. Criminally underrated and filled with fantastic acting, music, and cinematography.  [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpieSNIfk). Kind of cheesy trailer that doesn't due justice to the movie.   I really liked Martyrs. I can't say I enjoyed it obviously. It's something I don't EVER want to watch again, but it's a unique movie and I'm glad I own it.   At a 5.8, the lowest I have is The Divide. Not super low because I actively avoid getting bad movies unless I love them. I love this movie. I wouldn't even call it bad. This is a REALLY good sci fi movie. It's about a group of people who retreat into a small bomb shelter during a nuclear war. The more time they spend in the shelter, the crazier and more unhinged they become.  It's not the best movie, but it has some fantastic acting, music, and cinematography. It all takes place in the shelter. Some want to go out. Others obviously don't. Who will break? Who will survive?  This movie also takes some interesting turns as the peoples mental, emotional, and physical state break down.  I came to own it after watching it online. I was looking for something to watch and it looked good, but I was not expecting what I got. After watching it, I had to take some time to let it sink in. It stuck with me days after I saw it. There is a haircut scene that was one of the best scenes of that year. It's a dark, bleak, and emotionally draining movie.  I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi that is more about the human drama and how humans react to disaster and tragedy. It's one of my favorite movies I own and it's so good.   1. Memphis, TN  2. August 4  3. I love a good crime movie, also really love surreal and mind bending stuff.  4. Either Spy Kids or Charlie's Angels.  5. Definitely Charlies Angels  6. In The Name of the King  7. I love Terrence Malick, David Fincher, Christopher Nolan, and Coen Brothers. Those are the only directors that I've liked everything they've done.  8. Either Enter the Void, The Thin Red Line, or Tree of Life.  9. As of right now, the bluray of The Chaser. Or a directors collection of any of the directors I listed.  10. Alphabetical of course!  11. Amazon wish list keeps track of the ones I want  [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/h5dec#0) my collection after about a year or so of collecting! Looking forward to adding more!     Enter the Void actually isn't all that disturbing. It's weird, strange, and trippy. It has some uncomfortable scenes, but it's definitely far from being one of the most disturbing films. It's actually a really cool movie from a technical and visual standpoint.   His name is Joel David Moore   So that's why she was nominated and will probably win. The Oscars just want a story.   I kinda agree, but I feel like I don't know enough about cinematography or the production of Gravity to say for sure.    Someone in the Golden Globes thread said this about Lawrence, "Her name alone gets her awards." Which I think is totally true.    I think while Gravity was remarkable technically, I think it is the weakest contender for best picture. There really isn't a lot of substance there that *I* could see story wise and the writing was okay. But I think the other films are all around great not just technically, but also story wise, acting wise, writing, etc. I just think the other noms are more well rounded.   That said, Gravity should take all technical awards.    I know this movie has gotten a lot of hate, but I thought the cinematography and score in Only God Forgives was fantastic. But I guess there was no way it'd get a nom.   It would've been nice to see Place Beyond the Pines get a nod, but it's a stiff competition so there was really no room for it.   All in all though I think there is a good bit of variety this year with the noms. Only thing I wish there was less of is American Hustle.    Honestly, I'm quite happy with the nominations. A lot of variety. Of course there are some snubs, there always are. But they did good this year. Only thing I'd like to see less of is American Hustle.    I know it's a longshot and was never going to happen, but no cinematography nom for Spring Breakers or Only God Forgives? I know it may not be a good movie but OGF was easily one of the most beautiful movies of the year. Also had a great score.    Just a question: Have you met every soldier?   You are *literally creating and giving life.* How is that selfish?    I believe in God and am a full on Christian, even Mormon. I do *NOT* let my religious and moral beliefs corrupt or interfere with my political or social views in any way. I'm able to separate the two.   Yeah I'm with you. I beat my child last week because he was being a fag. I mean, he just kept doing fag stuff. So I beat him and now *I'm* the bad guy? If he didn't want to be beaten then he should've 1) Stopped doing fag stuff, and 2) stood up to me. But he's a fag so obviously he didn't fight back.   I dunno dude. I partly agree with you. I was bullied super hard in elementary/early middle school. I'm in my 20s and looking back on it now, I wish I could go back with the spine I have now and put that bully in his place.  But that's kind of the thing. When you're a kid, like really young, you don't really understand that what a bully says isn't true. You're impressionable and you take it to heart. It isn't really until you're in your teens you start to learn to let things roll off your back.  But again, I kind of agree with you.   That's not entirely fair.   Exactly. There's more to the legalization of marijuana than "Stoners want it." There are plenty of economic benefits that could come from the legalization of marijuana. People who are against it obviously don't understand this and need to separate their own morals from the greater good.   It's funny you say you haven't seen any good arguments in favor, but I actually wrote a paper about the legalization of marijuana. I didn't really have an opinion on whether it should be legalized or not, but after discovering the economic benefits of its legalization I'm all for it!   I dunno dude. I went to school with a guy who killed himself. He had severe social anxiety as well as aspergers. He couldn't handle social stuff very well. This led to harsh bullying which led to depression. He eventually stopped going to school because he couldn't handle it and one day took his life.  There *are* some people who just are *not* in the right frame of mind.  I don't know though, maybe you're right, but sometimes there *are* other elements at play that mess with your head. Sometimes it isn't just depression. The human mind is a crazy thing.   What's the likelihood of running into scams on memphisflyer compared to craigslist?    I know I should, but I'm not about to go 45 while everyone around me is going 60-something. The last thing my anxiety needs while driving is people honking at me, yelling at me, and/or riding me.   I think something like [this](http://www.inc.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/preview/slideshows/03_9.jpg) may work. With or without the mustache. If you do choose to keep it, trim it on the sides some.  Also, because you have similar features, there's   [This](http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/wennpic/joel-david-moore-premiere-savages-01.jpg)  Also [this](http://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ENT_JoelDavidMoore_1009.jpg)  Honestly, I'd say go with either the second or third pic, shave the mustache, but keep the stubble.   My gamertag is my reddit username. None of my friends play so I rarely play. Would love to play with some people!   Same here. I'm not really good at it, but would love to participate. Seems like a lot of fun.   DBC?   I don't think so. We've seen the labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse.   But probably not.  Edit: So happy I was wrong.   I honestly think it's because there was no more room in the Drama category.   So I don't have HBO, but True Detective looks really great. I love detective movies and tv shows. So is there another way I can legally watch True Detective?      I'm so glad he did though. I wanted it to be him or Fassbender.   Which sucks. I love Jennifer Lawrence but how did it not go to Lupita?   Or Lupita         Someone mentioned they'd love for Tarantino to do a 60s era spy film. I thought that sounded right in his realm.    I'm so excited for another Tarantino movie. But I'm just a little bummed out that it's a western. I love westerns, but I'd much rather see Tarantino do something else in a different time period or location. I'm sure it'll be great though!   The body of Henry Cavil and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch.    I ordered a PPV movie when I was like 8-10. I thought the dude and chick were conjoined twins.   I think because it was one of the first movies to take an extraordinary situation and make it ordinary. Pulp Fiction was one of the first movies to be filled with dialogue and conversations that normal people would have. They were realistic. Not everything they said was important to the story or was dramatic. A lot of people don't like the whole "talk about nothing" style. But I loved it. It made it feel more realistic. In the beginning, Travolta and Jackson aren't talking about anything important or meaningful. They're talking about tv and fast food.  But on top of all that, it's just a well written, well acted, and well directed movie.   Hot Wheels.  In a dystopian future, the most popular sport is car racing. But the cars are super fast. Going up to 500 mph. The tracks are filled with crazy turns, jumps, and loops, making it the most dangerous sport. A young man, who has dreamed of being one of the best racers attempts to make his dream a reality.   See I don't see Jeremy Renner pulling off the comedy parts. I think he's a perfectly capable actor though.   They do actually snort it. It's uncomfortable, but harmless.   Like I said, my blue sky analogy sucked and was not meant to be taken literally. Just as a way to put things into perspective.  Well Jesus was whipped and had a crown of thorns placed on his head and, apparently, bled from every pore. He was covered in blood, yet when he was resurrected his scars were gone and the blood was clean from his body.  You're exactly right. We *do* have to consider that maybe other religions are right.  Look, I'm just going to assume that you have no intention of coming to any sort of agreement and you just want to argue. I'm trying to compromise with you, but you won't. I can't tell if you're asking these questions and pointing this stuff out because you actually want explanations or because you're trying to prove that all Gods and religions are all just a lie. So let me know. Are you *really* interested in answers? Are you asking because you want to believe? Or because you want to prove something?   I think it depends on what *you* like and also, who you're seeing it with.  I loved Wolf of Wall Street, but depending on who you see it with, it can get pretty uncomfortable. If you're going with family or a girlfriend/boyfriend, I'd say Lone Survivor. But if you're going with a buddy, you can't go wrong with either. I loved Wolf of Wall Street *and* Lone Survivor. But I thought Lone Survivor was more entertaining. That's just me though.  But again, it depends on what you like and who you're seeing it with.   It's cliche, but I want to improve my health. I used to be in good shape. Now my pants and shirts are tight, ripped a few pants actually. It makes me sad. I want to lose weight and get back in shape. I want to look and feel good.   Jamaica. I didn't feel safe there. Does this make me racist? No one there did anything to make me afraid, but I felt uncomfortable.   Anyone who has been to Jamaica a few times or lives there know if it's actually dangerous or if it's pretty cool?  	153
       VPN- I use Onavo Protect which is pretty decent, I can use social media and YouTube fairly well on it. I think its free in the Apple App Store   Really? I found that it disappeared so fast, maybe it would be better on top of a cream highlighter like the Topshop Glow...      Do you have Sleek's contour kit? They are amazing, so easy to use and there is more contour powder than highlighter (is it just me who runs out of contour first?). This can be hard to track down but they're definitely in the Marble Arch Superdrug or Oxford Circus Boots.  MUA matte lipsticks are very good for the extremely cheap price, they last fairly well for a matte but can be quite drying but less than MAC's Ruby Woo.  I really recommend popping into a TK Maxx if you happen to pass one, they often have great stuff, not necessarily exclusive to the UK but they're really cheap. They often have stuff from Nails Inc, OPI, Japonesque, Ecotools and loads of skincare bits too.   I saw this in store the other day, the pastel colours look amazing!   Has anyone else tried this highlighter? I finally managed to hunt it down in Superdrug the other day, swatched it on my inner wrist and proceeded to wander around the store. About 5 mins later, I looked at my wrist and the intense shimmer had faded to the subtlety of the Hourglass Ambience Lighting powders!   I have seen blogs saying its comparable to the Mary-Loumanizer but I was so disappointed when I tried this one out, it looked so incredible in the pan :(   Hear hear! Except I'm here like every 2 hours now that summer has started...   I agree, I put on my CosRX BHA A-Sol, BHA Blackhead Power and Mizon AHA and the acids huuuurrrrrttttt. Its a stinging akin to the sing you get from a spot treatment.    Have you tried the UD primer potion, if you have, would you recommend this over it? It looks great, but I'm trying to decide if the shipping hassle is worth it, haha   No worries, thank you anyway! I'm a #23 in Mishha's Perfect cover so this one is probably a little too light for me :(  I have heard that Innisfree's shades runs slightly lighter than other cushions though, which is quite odd   Can I ask what skin tone you are e.g. foundation or MAC no. and which shade of the Innisfree cushion you got? I really want to get a cushion but am unsure of which to get, this water glow one looks amazing though!   Ohhhh I'm really interested in that one! Is it similar in texture to the Missha at all?   So since I have finally finished my last A-Level exam today, I thought it would be good time to start reviewing some products I bought last month. Today: a review on Missha's Super Aqua Detoxifying Peeling Gel.   **What is it and how is it used?** A physical exfoliant that is applied onto a dry face and requires massaging/rubbing gently until the product 'pills', then rinse off.  **First impression?** I REALLY like the scent of this. If you like Lancme's Miracle perfume smells like, then YAAAAASS, this is amazing. Its a very light floral scent that dissipates as soon as you rinse it off.  The first time I tried it, I felt like it did absolutely nothing but then I realised you do have to use a fair bit; I used about a 4cm length of the product for just my forehead.  **Does it do what it says on the tin?** Yes..... but it won't get rid of any large flakes. If you have slightly dry skin that requires some physical exfoliation and you find the St. Ives apricot scrub too harsh, you may like this better. However, if you have any scabs or large flakes on your skin, this won't do very much for that and using a muslin cloth during cleansing may be more effective. This product doesn't clean out blackheads as well as the St. Ives one does, due to the smaller exfoliating beads.  **Anything else?** This also reminded of the Este Lauder Pore Refiner in terms of texture, its very fine and the granules are so small. You also have to stand in front of the sink for this product, the more you massage it in, the more it pills and the bits become larger until you rinse it off. (Imagine scrubbing your body to exfoliate all the dirt and grub off and bits of dead skin rolls forming *sorry* but on a much smaller scale)   **Repurchase?** Yes, it works well in conjunction with my chemical exfoliants and does the job without being too harsh on my skin.  I hope you've found this useful, hopefully I can do another one of these on the Blackhead Melting Oil soon!   I only realised today that my mother will be coming home from a 3 month work trip from Beijing at the end of this month and I wanted to source some AB products for her to use to welcome her home.  She's in her mid 40's and has quite dehydrated skin that can do with some plumping and tone correction (she has freckles due to careless sun exposure) as well as some bags under her eyes. She currently uses stuff like Estee Lauder's Advanced Night Serum, Lancme's Genfique eye cream and moisturiser. When she gets home, I plan on getting her started in chemical exfoliation and maybe some yeast products?....  At home, we currently have:  * Mizon's AHA 8% serum * CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid * CosRX Snail 96 Mucin * Mizon's Snail Recovery Gel * SAP Vitamin C serum  If you guys can recommend some products to get her into, I'd really appreciate it and I'm sure she will too! Thank you in advance!  Edit: Formatting   I'm really curious about the EH BB cushion as I haven't heard too much about it, please do let us know how it goes!   Maybe try some vegan places to eat out? I know a place thats vegetarian/vegan that was started by Buddhists. Its not cheap but you can probably order some dishes, I remember a lot of their 'mock meat' food was made out of Bailinggu, a type of mushroom.   Other than that, its probably wisest to eat at home.   YAAAAASSSS, so excited for this!   Also not AB but O'Keefe's Working Hands Cream (pretty sure its on Amazon, definitely is in the UK).   This stuff will heal cracked hands, split fingertips and everything. If you don't mind some chemicals (its got paraffin) it really does a great job overnight and you can reapply during the day as its not sticky or oily at all. Its got a very light paraffin smell to it, but is completely unnoticeable unless you sniff your hands.   I seriously agree with you both and trust me I would, but the exams that determine whether or not I enter Medicine in university are tomorrow through to next Wednesday and the stress is getting to me.  I do take on board your advice though and will get on it once these exams are done!   Yeah I agree, although my friends and siblings (read cousins, since I am Chinese) all like to try Belgian beers there too.  I believe the team currently ahead in Lush's pub quiz are called 'The Boner Condoners' so I totally get what you mean.  	22

 Didn't read the article yet but I'm going to guess, he's black.   Yes I need this so bad. 5 accounts on lol...   Mundo support is god   Rarely bought their shity meat anyway and now after seeing this heinous crap, never buying from them.   I don't care about Trayvon Martin or Chicago ratchets. You get involved with drugs and walk around trying to be "hood" and "thug", you are going to get shot at some point in your life. Natural selection.

Don't play after 3 pm   Fuck, my cheek bone is fractured and this made me laugh to hard.   Lost to a shaco top who did this gay shit today. It was my gold promotion =,(   	14
 I read this peer reviewed study and others like it. This 470nm light is produced by the blue spectrum hydroponic bulb.   "Don't eat bats". Thank you for the heads up. LOL   I agree with you. There is news stories of the mid-ages recipe of cow bile mixed with garlic.    I am not worried.  I have ideas though my new theory of multiple factor science which could make the pharmaceutical drug companies a lot of money. I am not religious but like this quote one  of  Martin Luther King Jk speechs.  " I"m happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing anyman. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord !"   You are not the first person too confuse the two.    I agree but still like video   I wish it was that simple but it doesn't work like that.    So you think his man boobs is the reason the polar bear is not interested in eating him .lol   Great.    He is such a good boy.    If that happens, it will probably be quick.    Thank you. Bleach baths don't work for me also. Wish you a MRSA free future. If your immune system figured out a way to get rid of it, you will be immune from mrsa in the future.    The common assumption is that man domesticated wolf's not that man and wolf affected each others evolution.  We would not even be the same form most likely if it wasn't for dogs and wolfs. Some even go so far as to think that wolf domesticated man not vise versa. I would not go this far. I think we domesticated each other.   Also check out my video of a retired microbiologist commenting on my mrsa treatment idea. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1nITz-sww   Cool. I am serious about changing the way that mrsa is treated.    Did you check out my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine video.    My half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX8HK4pqpw   My half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX8HK4pqpw   Research 400nm light then look at the spectrograph of the hydrolux blue 1000watt grow bulb.   I tried manuka honey and colloidal silver. Both didn't work for me. May work for some people though. Everyone is different.   Even though I treat my reoccurring mrsa with my method, about a month ago I saw an infectious disease specialist too see why I was getting reoccurring mrsa infections so often. She told me my reoccurring mrsa was most likely not from an external source but rather lived on my skin. She also told me , assuming it didn't kill me first, my body would eventually figure out a way to remove it from my system. I could have no more outbreaks or a 100 more outbreaks. Sounds as if you your doctor found proper drug plus your body figured out how to get rid of it. Good luck.   Glad you are ok now. You are  lucky to be alive. What drug did the CDC give you. Been on vancimyicn 3 times. Rough stuff.   Not sure what you are saying. Explain.   That's cool. MRSA does grow fast and is not a joke. You could use this method in  conjunction with antibotics if you were worried about this alone not being effective.   This man has guts.   I hope not but this could happen. Just hope bear don't have a bad day.    Yep. Got the idea.      Must obey hal.    Combining 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, bezethonium cloride mixed with epson salt, and alternation hot and cold.  Go to Blackwell synergy, a peer review search engine, and research each of these ideas. Each of these ideas have been peer reviewed to help with MRSA infections. It is combining all three ideas together and geting the 400nm light from a hydroponic grow bulb that is my idea  and has produced such a rapid and effective respose. People have claimed to treat mrsa infections with 12 watt blue spectrum LEDs. It may work for some people but was a failure for me. My idea, which no one is currently doing, is to obtain the blue spectrum light from a 1000w hydroponic grow bulb. Combining this with the two other methods produced a rapid and effective response to my reoccurring mrsa infections. Before this method, I treated over a dozen mrsa infections with antibotics. After inventing this method, I treated my last three mrsa infections with this combination method and without antibotics. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. Hope this helps.   Never heard of them. Thank you for suggestion.   I e-mailed over 500 microbiologists worldwide including every microbiologist at OSU. Had a couple of responses but was told the FDA would never approve of this idea even if it worked. The learned helplessness of PHD doctors was shocking.   Would like the medicial community to do a research study on this combination MRSA treatment. It is not science until it can be replicated in many different people. Then this scientific research could be submitted for peer review. This is my dream. Inspired by Dr. Jonas Salk and a special French woman.   Manuka honey didn't work for me but it may for some people. This is the reason pharmaceutical drug trials are done on so many people. What works for some people doesn't work for others.      Don't know much about it. New research project for tonight.    Is that the treatment used in Russia.    Agreed.    On youtube there is a dozen other video's. Videos are under patent-free MRSA. Read book "Missing Microbes" and read about the negative effects of antibotics.   Thank you for feedback.   Thank you for link.      Need other options in the democratic party besides Hillary Clinton.   Taxi drivers not doing there cause any favors. I am sure more french citizens will use uber just because of this poor behavior of taxi drivers.      Awesome.                Thank you.     	51
 You have a lot of Jesus says in that paragraph. If Jesus is preaching a trinitarian god, different from the unitary one previously revealed, why should we believe him?   I have answers, I'll type them up when off mobile.  Edit: Ok, let's break this down. I'm not going to address whether this Psalm is messianic or not, but the claim that the Messiah is also God. First, a readable text:  2                3            4       5           6          7          8              9         10          The first five verses are saying the king (or the hero of the king perhaps) is strong, righteous and blessed by God, and so will defeat the kingdom's enemies. Simple enough, and it could be referring to the Messiah if you look at it the right way. Then, right after the enemies are defeated:  7          There are a few different translations that could work here for the first half of the verse.  You throne, God, is established for eternity,  OR  Your heavenly/divine/majestical (lit: of God) throne is established for eternity,  The translation clearly goes by the second. The verse, like many in Hebrew poetry, has two halves which parallel one another. The second half says "your scepter of kingship is a scepter of fairness." Both describe an object that has two properties. The first has a godly and everlasting throne, the second has a scepter that symbolizes kingship and fairness. The parallel breaks down if you say that  addresses God. It is an adjective, not a noun. Note that the Christian English translation writes it that the verses are broken up differently to obscure this.  8              You have loved justice and hated wickedness, therefore, God--your God--has anointed you with oil of mirth beyond that of your friends" (friends could also be kinsmen).  The confusion comes from how the verse is punctuated; , your God, is actually a descriptor of , God. **The person addressed is not named in this or in any other verses of the psalm.** Why can't the verse be read like you translated above? Because the noun following the verb must be the subject, not the object, of the sentence. In addition, the object is already a part of the verb. Literally, it reads:  Anointedyou, God yourGod, oil...  The lack of spaces is deliberate in order to demonstrate how the grammar is written. The verb/object is the first word, and the subject-adjective are the second and third words. There is only one direct object contained in that phrase, not two.  Therefore, the person being addressed (perhaps the Messiah) has been (figuratively) anointed by God and given a godly throne. The next two verses describes his other blessings that he receives after conquering. There is no double God hinted at here.  P.S. Yes,  can also mean judge, FYI, like in Deutoronomy 17.   **That's the problem.** why should we change to a thread text which throws away the old when the latter tells us this is the exact situation we should avoid?   OK, under that criteria bar-kochva is the messiah, and he'll finish when he comes back any day now. He certainly got further than Jesus did. Why do you think he's not the Messiah and Jesus is?   And I'm not entirely sure how I got into this conversation in the first place :/  You posted in a thread about OT prophecies, so I'm not sure what you were expecting! :P and I know nothing about the epistles, so it's OK.  Can you explain to me the difference?    Sure. Since annointing someone was standard practice when they were raised to a position of authority, (king, priest, etc.). So these are all "anointed ones" or messiahs. The term The Messiah, the one who would lead Israel to redemption, came from the fact that the Jews had no self governing leaders for a long time, and thus no anointed ones. So it came to mean "the one who will be anointed" when the Jews are free.  I'll get to the rest when I'm off mobile.   Look at this thread on /r/debatereligion to see that logic in action.   In my mind, the definitive way to tell if Jesus was the Jewish Messiah would be to compile a list of all the Messianic prophecies and compare them to Jesus' life as documented in both the New Testament and in secular sources and see if he fulfilled every single one of them.  Luckily for you, this has been done before. Jesus did not fulfill the most obvious prophecies. /r/Judaism/wiki/jesus  Edit: Oh God, that site is awful. I'll take the time to debunk it if you respond here.   The trinity is not found in the Bible. They are one in purpose, but not in being.  Oh right, you're Mormon. Well, that's even worse, honestly. "You shall have no other gods before me."  [Citation Needed]   /r/Judaism/wiki/Jesus     I believe that that verse is one of the songs of the suffering servant, is that not correct?   That's right.  Is there anything about the Messiah that claims he is not a servant of the Lord? Messiah, after all, just means "anointed one".  First, there are two different meanings of messiah -- an anointed one, used a lot in the historical parts of the Bible, and **the** Messiah, which is used is some of the prophets. I've found that Christians often confuse the two.  Second, of course the Messiah will be a servant of God. That doesn't mean that this prophecy is about the Messiah, like it is claimed. :P Why do you think is specifically about the Messiah as opposed to anyone else?  I think this is talking about the children of Israel, not the Messiah. A previous write up of mine:   Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.   Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.   Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.          Jesus was, after all, an unlearned Jew  Wait, I thought it was claimed he was a rabbi?  I don't find the argument that they're pulling things out of context to pull the wool over those unfamiliar with the prophecies convincing.  I wouldn't find it convincing either, except for the preponderance of evidence. I don't see any other way there are so many seemingly deliberate mistakes.  looking at the context of those verses and finding it ambiguous whether or not it is referring to the messiah.   Do you want to discuss one or more you find particularly strong or noteworthy? It's why I made the rebuttal in the first place.    It's only talked about when Israel is killing them. It's ignored otherwise.   [Here's one](http://christianity.about.com/od/biblefactsandlists/a/Prophecies-Jesus.htm) that's been linked to three times on this forum that I've seen. [Here's](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/messianicprophecies.html) a second I've seen once. I've refuted them but have yet to see someone respond to my comment.  First debunking:       I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.    Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,    Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,    About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18    Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)    Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.    To break the last category down for further discussion:    Torah: 1, 15, 36    Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44    Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29    Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39  Second dubunking:   Correct: 7/8 (see disputations about genealogy),    Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,    About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 13, 14    Psalms: 12, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23/24, 25/26, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45    Not about the Messiah: 9, 10, 11, 14, 18 (all Isaiah sources), 20, 21, 25/26/27/28, 29/31/40, 30, 32/33,    About the Messianic age, not the Messiah: 14, 15, 16, 19    Not a prophecy: 1, 35, 36     What is Russia? I would have to learn the history of that country and region. Then the concepts of socialism and communism to understand the rise of the ussr and its leaders. Then how Russia got control of those countries behind the "Iron curtain." This would take me 2-3 hours at least, even granting that I already knew the terms contained within those articles.  I could go on, but you see how much background knowledge (memorization) you need just to read one sentence about the Cold War, let alone why it began.   I think it's pretty clear that it does not mean the city when looked at in the broader context.  My thought is that since Jesus didn't fulfill the messianic prophecies, the Gospel writers had to make up plausible sounding ones to convince people that he was actually the messiah. This, among lots of others, fit, so they took it out of context and (mis)used it. I've seen at least two lists of these "prophecies" recently, and the vast majority of the items are incorrect.   All of this requires concepts you only know through memorization. From a perspective of someone who knows the language but never encountered these terms before:  Was it the Soviets (who are they?), who reneged on their agreements (what were these agreements?) to allow the people of Eastern Europe (where is this in comparison to soviet? how many people are there? what is the culture?) to determine their own fates (were they kept locked in dungeons? what was their fate?) by imposing totalitarian rule (what kind of rule is this?) on territories unlucky enough to fall behind the "Iron Curtain?" (did the soviets hang a curtain around eastern europe?)    Jesus never called His disciples to follow other gods. All of His ministry pointed towards the father.  The trinity is a "god not known", for God revealed himself as a perfect unity, which Jesus then changed to a trinity.  The Jews were also expecting a miraculous Savior to rise to the throne and free them from the Romans.  uh, yes, because that is what the prophecies say will happen. Jesus didn't do that.   What do you mean?    No, it says that the Messiah will be born of Bethlehem-Ephratah, the area where David was from. It is just another way of saying david's lineage.   What do you think the civilian casualty rate will be in the latest bombing campaign? 50%? 80%? And will it be by the American standard of any male between 16-40 is a combatant?  More importantly, will anyone talk about it when Israel isn't killing them?   Poe's law in action...   You might benefit from the use of E-Prime.  Yeah, sometimes that happens when I write quickly...  the only possible interpretation, and anybody who sees it differently is just crazy  ...but I don't think I said this. On the other hand, I do believe I have the correct interpretation, and since this is a debate forum I state my opinion strongly and expect a strong rebuttal.   lol, ok   He never said that, just that these elements are present in Judaism. Which is true.  But they aren't used to coerce people to do anything, so it doesn't bear resemblance to the threat of hell and heaven in Christianity.   Judaism includes Satan. Whether or not that is the "main point" of Satan in Judaism is subjective, and as a believing Jew, you'll prefer strongly an interpretation which favors Judaism.  You're still not getting it. It's not that satan isn't a main part -- it's that there is no "trickster to explain contrary evidence." The accuser does not have that role. Read the end of Job -- the point is that everything comes from God.  What religion, you mean. Certainly many do. But what is relevant for the purposes of this discussion is that Judaism includes this element.  I said group on purpose. I'm pointing out this element doesn't matter because nearly all groups, not just religions, have included this principle.   The way Jewish children are taught  I'm still not getting it. What is this "way"?   I am not convinced it was designed to spread virally in as cynical and overt a way as Christianity was  That's because Judaism was never intended for that. Judaism is for the Jews -- or rather, Judaism is the religion for tribe of the children of Jacob, of which Judah was a remnant. It does not look to expand to other people; though it claims to have a supreme God, it also teaches that God made a special covenant for the Jewish people that only applies to them.     Are not things written by prophets to be considered prophetic?  No. Take the absurd example: a prophet's tax bill is not a prophecy, yet he still wrote it. Not *all* things written by a prophet are prophetic.  I showed that some Jews did consider them to be so.   No, you showed a Messianic splinter sect considered them to be so, relating the Psalms to themselves. Interestingly, "a Messianic splinter sect" is exactly what Christianity was at the time, so I was noting that they both used the same technique of taking random verses and applying them to the present day.  Why quote any of the psalms, then, if no Jews thought that they were prophetic?  As I said above, because it's a common Messianic tactic. See how easy it was to make you believe that because it is holy it is also a prophecy if you read it the right way?  I'm not quite sure what you mean. I have been citing websites as I go--perhaps you just missed those links.  Your original pesher link. It would be nice to get a link which has sources, or even better, a scholarly paper. After that, we can talk about the actual meaning of pesher.    Hey, you asked, I answered.    If you contact the Rabbi or another person in the leadership before the holiday, they will probably give you one.   At the time of Jesus' life, some of the Psalms are considered to be prophetic, because some of them are written by David.  You have not demonstrated that this is *because* they were written by David. In addition, you have only quoted one splinter sect of Judaism, who happened to be messianic as well (like Christianity). These types of groups in general like to take unrelated writings and interpret them in light of the present day. Can you demonstrate anyone mainstream thought of Psalms as prophetic?  Also, please quote a website with actual links. That could be made up as far as we know, but I'm reserving judgement for now.    He always went on and on about how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies  Also not true, fyi. There have been debates here before, and it usually comes down to "Jesus will fulfill all of them in the second coming."   Rav Kook and his followers, at the very least, are pretty famous.   It's the list again! I choose you, copypaste!  I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.  Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,  Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,  About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18  Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)  Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.  To break the last category down for further discussion:  Torah: 1, 15, 36  Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44  Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29  Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39    4 .- Unverifiable reward if you act in a certain way.  5 .- And/or unverifiable punishment if you do not act in a certain way.  Neither of these points are relevant. Reward/punishment in the afterlife is not the main motivator to do miztvot.  6 .- Invisible trickster to explain away contrary evidence.  Doesn't exist as explained above.  3a .- Promote marriage between believers, within the faith, and have large family.  What group does NOT do this?  3b .- Indoctrination.  Want to explain what you mean? Judaism traditionally teaches a lot of critical thinking. Why do you think so many Jews become lawyers?    What does this have to do with the Messiah? (Your translation is also awful, but we can get to that later.)   The same reason you don't analyze homer and at the same time discuss whether it actually happened. Every discussion needs to have axioms, or it goes nowhere. If you want to discuss the veracity of the text, make your own topic.   Nope. Being the messiah has nothing directly to do with God.   And Jesus didn't exist either, but we're discussing everything as if they're recorded accurately. We don't have to turn every discussion into a debate on the authenticity of the text.    A little bit. But they are generally well received or ignored, and they don't press if you refuse.   This is not converting, it's more like bringing lapsed Catholics back into the church.    Disclaimer: I'm not a Jew, so I might have misinterpreted my Jewish friends' answers to this question.  Nope, this is good.      I'll break it down point by point.  isn't Israel a specifically Jewish state,  Yes, much in the same way England is Anglican.  But aren't Zionists mostly European immigrants  I don't know what you mean by Zionists here; if you mean Jewish Israelis, it's about evenly split between Ashkenazim and Sefardim/Mizrachim, although the distinction is slowly disappearing.  isn't Zionism not much older than 100 years old?  Zionism, the ideology that Jews should create a state of their own to escape persecution is about 150 years old now, yes. The Jewish longing to return to the "land of Israel" is 2000 years old.   So up until just over a hundred years ago, waiting for the coming of the messiah before founding a state was something specifically about being Jewish, right?  Yes and no. Before the Enlightenment, there wasn't a concept of "setting up a state." A king ruled a territory, and the Messiah would be a new king who re-established the Kingdom of Israel. There is a thought (it's only one opinion) that Jews should not attempt to self-govern until we are worthy, which will be when the Messiah comes. But there is a tension here: how would you recognize the Messiah if you refuse to attempt to gather in from exile?  It all just seems paradoxical because Zionists seem like reformists  Do you mean Reform, as in Reform Judaism? No, most of the early Zionists were secular, not reform, though there was a significant religious minority involved in the early zionist movement. Most of the Reform movement actually criticized Zionism quite a bit before WWII, since their ideologies were so strongly opposed to one another.  and if we create a Jewish state, it seems like the reformists should have less of a say than the orthodox  They did. Israel is a mostly secular Jewish state, just like England.  but the orthodox don't want the state  No longer true. Many Haredim in Israel are disapproving of the state and try and undermine it, but many others support it. There are many other "Modern Orthodox"/Daati Leumi who are very much Zionists. Both of these groups vote and therefore get a say in running of the state in proportion to their vote.  so we shouldn't listen to them on religious grounds, but its a specifically Jewish state.  These two points have nothing to do with each other.   Its not like Protestants have much of a say on what happens in the Vatican, but even if they did the Catholics should have first say  Bad analogy. These are two different religious groups, not a religious and a secular group.  I mean if an Orthodox Jewish state is contradictory to the original tenants of Judaism,   It's not in any way contradictory. There is one opinion saying that Jews shouldn't attempt to return on their own, and I already discussed the tension inherent in it.  then is it still a Jewish state, or just a state obsessed with ethnic purity?  Why do you think Israel is obsessed with ethnic purity more than any other country. About 20% of the population is not Jewish. In addition, Israel is still a Jewish (or more accurately, Israelite) state even if it has no religious laws, just like England is an ethnically English state.  ...Unless its just an ethnically Jewish state, in which case wouldn't all orthodox Jews outside of Israel become defacto diaspora?  It is an ethnically Jewish state. And yes, all orthodox Jews consider themselves in the diaspora, but that has nothing to do with the state.   None of your points here are accurate.   Judaism was founded at the exodus and revelation, not by Abraham. He was apparently a great person who brought a lot of good to the world, including monotheism, but Judaism came later. Nor did he or does he fill a savior role (a concept which doesn't really exist in judasim).  Judaism is not, and never has been, a monastic religion. Abraham was famously wealthy, and the Israelites took lots of gold out of Egypt.   Judaism is a communal religion which doesn't work without family.  There are no rewards for believing or disbelieving, only doing.  There is no trickster. The satan, or accuser, is best likened as a malicious prosecuter in court.  There is no apocalyptic event, only a redemption.   This does not apply at all to Judaism.    Huh? The whole state of Judaism is waiting for their Messiah to return Israel to its glory.  Not true.  they rejected Jesus because the Messiah came to save the whole world, not just the Jews.  Also not true.   From below:   Who are "they"? The Jews prophesied about a Messiah. Read Isaiah especially. He prophesied of a coming Messiah who would be rejected by his own people.  Three strikes, and yoooooou're out!  Is it? Christianity started in Judea and was brought to Rome. And Asia. And Africa. All within the first century.   Not very impressive, considering you could travel for 5 days and reach any of these continents.  It is not based on the wisdom of a Roman emperor; it is based on the life and teachings of a middle-eastern Jewish rabbi who claimed to be the son of God, and Christ came for everyone, not just Western society.  No, it was based on Paul and early Catholic church, which was established in (guess where?) Rome!   I think they're one seat lower than Yesh atid now.   Do you want to have a discussion about your points?   Yes, it exists, though most people when trying to use it ask improperly. It is usually not formal though. For example, we had to get a passing non-Jew to turn off the oven.   Why not?   Because those rockets were fired, dimwit. Read the godam article. The false alarm was this morning, which hasn't been reported anywhere.    Wrong verse. [Numbers 23:19]   Not a ger myself, but it is probably because it happens so often outside of deep/personal conversations. I can see how it gets annoying, and somewhat implies that you don't belong.   Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions.   Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions.   But of course, when we calmly and positively talk about having sex with a three year old  That you say this means you are completely misunderstanding the entire section. This is a legal discussion, not a code of conduct.   No, these were people and their descendants who were there in 1920-1950, and had been living there for hundreds of years. Does the same principle apply?   The right of return isn't about returning to a country, it's about returning to what is rightfully your home.  If you acquiesce to thousands of Haredi Jews returning under this definition to Hebron and Jerusalem, as well as all the Mizrachi Jews and their descendents to their homes in the Arab world, I might start taking you seriously. Until then...   Oh, I think it's an awful practice that should be stopped, outside of a few people who the community itself should support as well. I probably would have voted for Yair Lapid in the last Israeli election, who advocated and passed a measure to slowly change this.  I think that it is justified in that it is not viewed as stealing; if the state will provide for them to engage in studying, they'll take it. Work is not valued in the intrinsic way that it is in much of Western society, and learning Torah is much more important than contributing (or stealing) from the country.   Actually, from my limited knowledge, this is not a very common practice in America. Many people do study at yeshiva, yes, but not their entire life. The practice is much more widespread and pronounced in Israel.   I've just been recommended Hearthstone by a friend. I'm a previous casual Magic player -- I know the basic rules, mechanics, and strategies, but never bothered building my own deck because it was too much of hassle, so I didn't play very often.   What should I know going into the Hearthstone? What are the similarities and differences to Magic, and what should I be expecting? A basic overview would be nice! Thank you! :)   Once palestine is established, you will have the right of return to Palestine just as Jews have the right to return to Israel.   It depends on where you live.

[Here](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=129431504 postcount=5235) Kew0120 posts the link of where he gets his pictures.  [Direct Link ](http://mastiff.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/famicom/1410409499/10)    Exactly what they got out of it this time. Sequence of events:  * Hamas kidnaps and kills teenagers *  Israel cracks down on Hamas members in the West Bank and starts sweeping manhunt * Hamas uses this as an excuse to start bombarding southern Israeli residents with rockets * Israel responds with limited airstrikes and proposes a few quiet-for-quiet agreements * Hamas rejects these, as well as proposed ceasefires, while saying that it is responding to Israeli aggression; Israel begins official military operation * Palestinians, militants and civilians, die, as well as a few Israeli civilians * Ground invasion commences, after Hamas attacks from tunnels, with the purpose eliminate those tunnels;  * Hamas gets the opportunity to kill and kidnap soldiers, and put many more Palestinian civilians at risk during the fighting * Israeli ground invasion concludes and ground troops withdraw after tunnels destroyed, as Israel declines to commence a full invasion to eliminate Hamas * Hamas continues firing rockets, and Israel continues attacking by air * Hamas accepts a ceasefire once they are close to running out of rockets  The potential and real accomplishments of starting a fight with Israel:  * Increased popularity, both at home and abroad, especially vis a vis Fatah * Increase donations by terror funders (i.e. Qatar) and well meaning countries and individuals * Dead Israeli civilians and soldiers * Captured Israeli civilians and soldiers * Potential for a massacre of Israelis through fighters emerging from tunnels * Dead Palestinian civilians to show to the world * Dead Palestinian militants to show as civilians to the world * Pressure on Israel to ease blockade  * Increase support for the right wing in Israel  I could go on, if you want more. It's theorized this round of fighting started now to weaken the unity government/Fatah as well as get more money, since civil servants weren't being paid due to lack of funds.     Can you go into more detail as to why regular electric watches are allowed?   To clarify, it is a law not to eat animals not slaughtered properly, which has the side effect of also avoiding animals which die by disease.   No.   Nonono, you don't understand, I posted that to make people think I'm a real person instead of a paid shill! And you're my sockpuppet that I made to point it out! Get your act together, man!      Nope, it's actually pretty much the translation above, though of course a lot of nuance is lost.   I'm saying that the translation is wrong. The text is not talking about a spiritual disease which no longer exists, not the medically defined leprosy of today.   It would be. But we're not discussing leprosy.   Oh, you have every right to think that it's ridiculous. Just know what it is that you're criticizing.    Some few kibbutzim are still doing well.    Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.  It's a spiritual disease caused by gossip, and it has a spiritual cure.    the punishment for breaking any of them is execution.  Not true.   http://i.imgur.com/axJmn.gif   It's not goddam leprosy!

 I'm actually all for it. I think prison should be voluntary. And if someone doesn't want serve his sentence, his citizenship is revoked, and he's exiled to some island.    Bob Dylan always had this anti establishment side in him.   Obama on meeting Bob Dylan:   Heres what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as youd expect he would be. He wouldnt come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didnt want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didnt show up to that. He came in and played The Times They Are A-Changin. A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage  Im sitting right in the front row  comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it  then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: Thats how you want Bob Dylan, right? You dont want him to be all cheesin and grinnin with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.    But studios are exactly that! They are *active* VC that specialized in music and also have connections to help the business they invest in. What he means is that he's looking for *passive* investors. But that's gonna be a very risky business to be in.   [Straight](http://i.imgur.com/egkhDYm.jpg).   Have you ever seen art students or amateur artists sitting in a museum im front of a panting, trying to draw it? You are saying they aren't allowed to do that. That I can't draw at home Le Reve and hang it on my wall. That if I can buy parts and build a Mustang, I'm not allowed to do that and put it in my yard.   That I can't take a guitar, play Stairway to Heaven and keep the recording. Because someone owns those sound waves and I can't move the air on the same way without paying him.  I'm not sure I agree with that.   Here's a case for this being a 'right'.  You buy a pencil, you buy paper. You can draw on that paper whatever you want with your pencil. It's your property, it's your right.  You have 5 rooms in your house, you can turn them on and off in any way you like. You can light 2 rooms or 4 rooms. It's your house, your light, your right.  You have a harddrive with billions of bits. You can turn them on and off any way you want. It's your HD, your bits, your pc. BUT if you arrange your bits in a sequence that is similar (not even identical) to a song or a movie or a book, you suddenly break the law and it's not right anymore. Change the first bit, you are golden, change the 10th bit, immoral.  Digital copyright is basically saying someone owns that sequence of bits. Someone owns a number, and you can't copy that number.     Why not switch to digital? Who owns the copyright?   The 6 that believe, join before it's too late.    4.

I would also stop and take another look at my back :)       - Greta, age 3         I simply don't know, and I think it's well within the realm of possibility.     Southpark did a funny episode on that. People watching stream of people commenting on players commenting on games.   Upvoting it was the right thing to do.   Kodak can be the opposite example. And anyway, I'm not saying the company will fail, but they can be merged with another big company (let's say, for the sake of argument, LG or Samsung mobile) and call themselves somthing else.    But Microsoft doesn't need to be replaced. It can be merged, split or rebrand for the name to be forgotten. We are talking 50 years here, that's eternity in tech terms.  The name Microsoft doesn't have much value. It's not even a popular website or a product (vs. Windows, Office and such).   Why is that?   You are counting moves, where most of those calculations are referring to *boards* or *games*. You can move your piece backward and forward, but you still have the same board.   By Awakening, he means amazing.   I think a case can be made for Dr Who. First, it's an old show. Even the new seasons have that old vibe. I'm not saying it's bad in any way (nor do the millions of fans need my opinion). I'm saying that a modern US show will lool and feel very different. Second, the style of Dr is kinda cartoonish, where US television brings more realistic production. I don't know if it will be better, but it will sure be different.    The guy is smooth as teflon!   Everybody wants options, but options are not free.    So you are talking about global warming. Wouldn't it better to try and fix it instead of moving out?   Edit: what I'm asking really is how do you know the process is irreversible? Will GM be an issue 100 years out? Who knows.     the chances are, the human race will kill itself  Citation needed.      I watched the movie with my gf, she fell asleep in the middle. So when it ended I went to bed depressed and sad and I couldn't even talk about it. On the next day she watched the second half of the film, so I joined her because it's just a fantastic movie. I got sad again by the end, somehow I was hoping that maybe I didn't get it right the first time. Damn.    But there isn't 'infinite amount of times'. It's a finite number, we just don't know it. Most importantly, we don't know the ratio between that number and the chance of creating life.      \\\#Mum   He did.   Words to live by... but not for long.

Warning: this can be depressing. Some of them made like half a billion dollar since... well, yesterday.       Yeah, but there's no reasom to hide that, people know the story. It's like in the tv series Hannibal. They don't hide the fact (from the viewer) that he's a serial killer, because most people know that.    Yeah, maybe. I think it depends a lot on the native format in which the book was published. Usually bettet to leave it at that format than convert it.   Also, after you deDRM it, don't convert to pdf, just install calibre on your laptop. PDF is a lousy format for books.   ~[]   Cas as tank, Viv supports, IB damage.    Biggest mistake was not using voice acting and let it play in the background while the player moves on.

Typing: A bit of a 3 way. Thinking: not impressive enough. Adding: Kinda 4 way.   It reminds me of a chart that was published a year ago, about winning actors' average age being much higher than actresses' age. Kind of the same issue. However, im both cases it's a matter of public taste, so if anybody's really bored with their life and want to fill it with some shallow meaning, they should direct it to movies watchers and not the Oscars.   Yeah, people seem to forget it's about 2 guys, going to work everyday and doing their job.   Of course polygamy should be available to any adults who want it. All other technical issues (inheritance, taxes, etc) should be changed to support that. Too bad it's not a popular concept these days. Popular, as in very few people want to form this kind of family, but those who do, suffer greatly from this discrimination.    TIL: when some famous dude found out about some stuff he said some clever shit.  Repeat.    Well, to be fair, $ spent now is usually more than a $ spent over time.

Which is still better for him than the other night, when everybody called him Rapey McRapesalot.   You just made OP hold his head again.   ...yet. Tape measure snakes claim hundreds of victims every year.    Actually, as funny as those are, most of them do happen at one point or another. It just ends with 'shit, well, I should pay more attention next time' and not 'shit, I should buy something now on TV to stop it'.   That's why the first person to try to detach them during fire will get third degree burns in the hands.   If they drove in opposite directions, it means that was a head on collision. This is never a small matter and there's usually enough damage to justify an insurance claim. Exchanging insurance details is not being a dick, it's just getting money from **your insurance** to cover the damages **you need to fix**, that's what you pay them for.  Or, maybe it was bumper collision, no damage, and one of them just remember he forgot something at home and had to turn back.   you cant even   I didn't see even one action tv show that pulls the baby right. It's usually just a prop, appearing and disappearing when it fits the plot.   Like Chris Rock puts it: there's a different between being rich and being wealthy. Shaq is rich. The white dude who writes him his paycheck is wealthy.    Some people don't want to kill the fish. They just really want it to be late somewhere.       -- Mitch   Yes. Also, Hannibal in *the Silence of the Lambs* didn't age very well in my opinion. It looks a bit of a cliche now. Not to his fault. It's more like a [Seinfeld Is Unfunny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny) trope. So starting with the TV series is better.    I would say because it isn't funny, but that never was an issue at /r/funny.   Are we sure it's for consumption? Can the human body digest grass?

You know your West Wing stuff, but you forgot something. If you watch that episode again, right after the credits, you'll see: based on true future story.   Close, but not exactly. Even if you have a valid visa, or a passport from a country with no visa requirements, you still can be flagged and stopped at the border. Again, without providing any explanation to you.

Thanks, I decided to skip it. The show is coming soon anyway, and if history is any guide, it will be over 3 days after.   I totally get it. As an amateur writer, by the time I finish writing a story, even a short one, not only that I don't enjoy reading it, I straight out hate it.    It does. That's for another story though.   "Find this little trick that makes reposters hate him!"         Twist: OP knew it's a movie, but Tumblr just don't like Platoon and think it's an overrated movie and a good excuse to hate America's film industry circa 1985.      Thought creates reality crap. I remember a scene, probably from that movie, about a guy who is %100 POSITIVE that if he thinks about a parking spot, he'll always find one when he needs it.               /r/RedditDayOf  Edit, better link.

As some of you know, PoE keeps chat logs, among other stuff, in a file called client.txt. I wrote a simple script that reads this file (from the end, because it can be very large), and displays them in 4 separate tabs: global, private, group and trade.   Notes:  * Download the pastebin file, save as .ahk and run. You'll need AutoHotKey 1.1 and above. * Default client.txt path is  *C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt* - this can be changed in the script to match your installation settings. * Default number of characters to read (from the end of the file) is 50000.

Usually my strategy so far was to pick and use gear up until A3M (group rushing the major bosses in cruel), and get to City of Sarn underleveled and undergeared. At this point I farm currency, adding up to what I already have and get basic gear to carry me through A3M and low level maps (life/es/res).  Alright, so I hit A3M 2 days ago, and I also hit a wall. For the life of me, I couldn't find any decent gear in the past 2 days farming Docks. My resists were around 0%, and obviously you can't survive much like that.   As much I love this challenge, about an hour ago, I gave up, spent about 8c and got all the gear I need for now.  So after my failed attempt, I really wonder how you do it? how long does it take? did you have any luck so far this league? Do you do it for the challenge or do you just hate trading?        eztv.it was an ideal tv torrent site. Are there any comparable alternatives now that it's down post raid?

However, I did notice that group's allocation tend to change. We played Graveyard is was PA, went into the cave - it was changed to SA. Same with dock runs. Maybe it's because the leader changed, maybe the first person who entered into the instance. I'm no sure, but I do believe it's happening.  Am I wrong here?                                 I noticed the Increase Skill Effect Duration moved a bit, and it's little closer to the Scion now. Do you think other classes can run this build better with emphasis on high speed and max mana regen?                                                                     Gallery mode is when media is displayed 100% width/height of the browser windows (or full screen), other text is gone except title. Back/Forward (or space) jumps to the next media. Other keyboard shortcuts can be used to upvote/downvote/hide (and automatically advance), open comments, etc.  There are some external sites that provide that for Reddit, but none is very good and most don't integrate well with Reddit (voting, saving, hiding, etc.), plus they require credentials which is less secure.   I think it would be a good and useful addition to RES.      If you are unfamiliar with Peaky Blinders, it's a British (BBC2) crime series, about a gang family in Birmingham, England post WWI. The cast includes Cillian Murphy in the leading role (Scarecrow from Nolan's Batman), Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) and is joined by Tom Hardy (Inception, Batman's Bane, Locke) in the second season.   The soundtrack has tracks by:  * Nick Cave (theme song and through out the series) * The White Stripes and Jack White * The Raconteurs * Tom Waits * Dan Auerbach * The Dead Weather * Johnny Cash * PJ Harvey * Arctic Monkeys  [Spotify playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/117598253/playlist/3M6R4bKFM4lW0UMG4l6hiy) for a taste.  Great series, worth watching and listening to.                                                                        If you haven't watched the first series, now is a good chance before second season starts.

The first series is only 5 episodes. And if I'm not mistaken, you can find it on Netflix.               	200
 Well you are getting it. October.    Hodor   There was a comment in one of his recent posts on Livejournal about it.   http://grrm.livejournal.com/406858.html#comments  I hope there will be comics for all parts in that series. They are awesome.   Fucking and drinking.   I hate theories about Jon or Daenerys turning to the dark side.   I mean, I guess it really would fit George's unexpected twists, but I want my heros I've been rooting for, for 5 years now to fulfill their destinies.  Hoping for Stannis turning instead. Now that would be awesome.     (again)   I have a feeling that most people interpret Ice as a ceremonial blade only used for executions which I believe is not the case.  And someone please correct me if you have more facts, but Ice was the sword of the Lord of Winterfell, and has been so for thousands of years (new editions coming along every once in a while).  That means if he was going somewhere where he would bring a weapon. He would bring Ice.    Thank you for that! He was a god.   Hopefully people know this.   Every year from November to Mars, Japanese "fishermen" gather in great numbers trapping hundreds of dolphins in a bay, capturing the beautiful for aquariums and killing the rest for meat. Which are served for example in schools... Watch "The Cove".   You're in for a cry and your hatred for the human raise will multiply by your animal abuse sensitivity.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch  And that's just one'of'em..   So, you will basically be the first one to go? :)   I hope they cut the Ramsay wedding altogether. They can put the extra screentime on the Wall with the straw men.   Nothing important will happen to a viewpoint character off screen. So to speak. That much I am certain of.    He would return to ToJ and get back to wooork!    I think you need to be an actor to understand it. A lot of them need to be able to imagine stuff about their character to get into the role. That can be harder if you know more concrete stuff. I'm not an actor, but I could imagine.    He's probably  the biggest fan of the books in all the cast. If not just the most enthusiastic. Like hearing him rant about it :-)    Some people just don't have the imagination to translate words into pictures in their head. That's it.    It doesn't show on her performance.. She doesn't know Daenerys character at all..    I want a "fetch me a block"    Beat me to it. I go for the Swedish versions. Knatte, Fnatte and Tjatte!    One thing is certain. Greece do not always pay their debts.   The oily black stone the "Seastone Chair" is made of is hinted to be present in Asshai. I take that as people travelled between the two places. Assuming I'm not thick as a castle wall that would make the world round.   Isn't it all but confirmed he is not knighted?  That was how I read the novellas anyway.   Come on. Oathkeeper is more Ice than even Ice was.   Brienne will fight fAegon confirmed.   An armor made of dragonglass. Now, is that something you might be interested in, Jon Snow?   *"In 2011 George R. R. Martin, creator of the bestselling A Song of Ice and Fire  Series, approached artist Richard Hescox with the proposition of creating a huge set of illustrations for the upcoming Subterranean Press edition of his novel A Clash of Kings.  Accepting the challenge and diving into what would become a year and a half project, Hescox was privileged to work closely with Martin who had to approve every image before it could be included in the two volume edition, assuring that every character and detail matched his vision."*   They ruined her whole storyline and per defintion a part of Tyrion's when they decided to make Shae **love** him.   It just doesnt make sense, and this is what comes of tampering with the well thought out story.   They are going to be released three at a time this way, not counting when he submits new ones for anthologies.   Incoming headlines at websites: "George R R Martin releases his new book in October."  And it won't be a lie.   Made me laugh, because I know the feeling.   Oh yes! Would be awesome if Dany were the one to come and actually clarify it to Jon himself!   Dunk   Egg of the Song of Ice and Fire series. Well, it would be epic either way.   But, if Jon is light bringer. This theory stands with Ashara being his mother?    I'm a fan of this. Would love it.    **I have posted it,** and It's based upon Bran's dying wish to be a Knight, his probable highly magical powers and a line from Dunk and Egg 2. Dunk tells the soldier farmers to return to their homes against their Lords will saying: *"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth, not the warrior"*   With the theory of Hodor being an ancestor to Dunk going hand in hand with this since Bran can Warg Hodor.  Also, why begin a short story series along with your main story novels if the events weren't tightly linked and important to the whole plot. Oh, and George love Knights. Check his website.    Seems people travelled over the sunset sea from the east to Westeros.. The Seastone Chair was their eastmost outpost, like Dragonstone was the Valyria's westernmost castle.  **Could there be any connections between them? Or the people who created them?**   He wrote Tywin's speech about legacy so great(it's just not in the show right?), and since he doesn't have kids. ASOIAF is his legacy. I'm pretty sure he's gonna make all he can to finish it. We just have to keep him safe from harm until he has.      *We'll have to wait and see!*   Read the first book in English and you will have enough experience once twow releases.    I started when credits rolled after episode 10 season 1. I just had to know what happened to Arya. the Dragons was cool, but I couldn't wait to find out how she would go forth. And I was not dissappointed!  Reaching aFFC, I could order aDwD which just released in time for me.. **that is now 4 years ago...** Feels like last summer..   Not worth. No battles, desync etc. Shogun 2 was the first playable co-op and was still problematic. Full co-op for empire would have been awesome though. Glad they developed it further.    Reading the books would give you an indication.   Oh and the theory is bollocks.    Something like that. Bit we'll have to wait and see!   And don't forget the bloody lemon trees and the sunny weather..    Regrettably true.       Clickbait article that doesn't say anything about TWOW that hasn't been said by Anne Groell or Jane Johnson about a month ago...   How would everyone feel if Dunk and Egg was turned into a "Sherlock" style mini-series. 1,5 hour episodes, three episodes/season. 3 seasons.   Thankfully, by the time I got to read AFFC, A Dance with Dragons had just been released.. So I had that going for me.   But that's frickin' 4 years ago now.. Shit..   There were a lot more than 7 rubies on Rhaegar's armor. Who do you think he is? Moon Boy?   I don't even have the strength to correct your mistakes. But I will anyway, because I'm a good guy.  **Ned brought Ice to battle** at least once that we know of, which is the Greyjoy rebellion. And it is not THAT heavy to wield. It's Valyrian steel which makes it lighter than a regular greatsword of normal steel.   Tower of Joy from Ned's perspective.   I'm gonna say what I always say. *Next Winter.*   A Storm of Swords is easily the best book when it comes to tempo and content. So many twists and cool stuff happening.   Absolutely crossed my mind. I really do hope that's the case. Means a couple of more years for George.   Lyanna's fits in so nicely being named queen of love and beauty.   But sure it could be Ned. Could be Moon boy for all we know.    Whoopsie indeed. You must fit Jeyne Westerling into this too. This is known.    I think Reed will tell someone that Jon knows, Samuel might find clues about something hidden in Winterfell crypts.    Nah, he probably said "Elia Martell".   *What do you think about my R+LJ impression?* I think I nailed the unwillingness to understand several clever hints scattered amongst 5 books and 20 years of writing awfully well.   I like Rhaenys! Nice and short but yet pureblood Valyrian.  Dragon names are cool! I looked through tWoIaF and Viserion is pretty badass.   Yeah well we havn't found the right ones yet. We want'em vaccinated etc. etc. So no rush :)   Well duh. I don't know what I was thinking about. Best Call of Duty map of all time btw.   I knew it was coming so I have prepared an upvote for ya!   *Only a cat of a different coat* spray water on it's nose everytime I play the song on speakers. Freud + ASOIAF. Soon it will run to hide everytime it hears it.   They all have to be black in that case though. *The seed is strong*   Poison one of them, send one of them off to Spain with strangers and keep one for a pet to do as we please.   Oh my.. My flair really is true.. This would be hilariously disturbing.      R'hollor seems real, in some way. And I guess the Great Other (Hodor) is also real if that is true. Else I don't know. Seems The Old Gods are "only" greenseers, which are a kind of gods in a sense if they are properly trained and integrated in the weirnet :)   You best pay'm back, or they gonna fund your enemies 'til they woop your ass and sack your cities for payment.   That one is really obvious once you know it's gonna happen. I don't think a lot of people got it before aSoS, but a really good foreshadowing!   Well, yeah. It could be Benjen, Brandon, Ser Oswyll Kettleblack or what the hell.. It could be Moonboy for all we know.   But this added with the other 20 foreshadowings we have for R+L=J *I'm gonna take the liberty to place it in that file for now.*   Those approved would be Ned Stark, Lyanna Stark, Rhaegar Targaryen and Howland Reed, right?   I am relistening to Clash of Kings, keeping an ear out for good foreshadowing. Some of them are pretty obvious once you know what's going on.  When Jon is about to chop Ygritte's head off George has planted some real obvious foreshadowing for R+L=J    nbsp;  *"He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his fathers son. Wasnt he? Wasnt he?"*  **Two times?** That's bold of GRRM I would say. It should stand out, but it really don't if you aren't looking for it.   nbsp;  There's also one in A Storm of Swords where Sandor Clegane to Arya riding towards The Twins is also has a witty red wedding foreshadowing that is pretty well known   *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding.*   nbsp;  **Anyone else know a witty and/or really obvious foreshadowing that has or hasn't struck true yet?**   George on the other hand is doing a spectacular job setting it up. Hear that sceptics?  *Spectacular!*   I think we are going to get the novellas and the main series tightly linked together in the future with the help of Bran.   GRRM began writing about Dunk about the same time as Clash of Kings came out. There is probably some reason for him writing two stories in the same universe parallel to each other yet to be revealed.   Was about to say that. Didn't hook me, but it was a good production value.  I'm gonna say go for Rome if you already saw Game of Thrones.   They use Aniston as tBBt use Kayle Cuoco.   I'd like it if he got decent with his left hand. But we all know where our hopes end up..  (insert witty quote here)    I think he was pretty set on Jaime all along.    Tinfoil of the day    Nothing important will happen to a viewpoint character off set.    Yes,  my thought as well when I read it.    I'd say it will all go on North of the neck. Question is where Dany will come from..    *We'll have to wait and see!*  But the north remembers..    For me it's Arya without a doubt.    Absolutely! He doesn't have clue!   IF Bran is controlling Coldhands from the future. I must say my own theory of Bran somehow interfering with **Dunk** becomes stronger rooted. My biggest concern was if it was possible to warg something in the past.  Considering Bran has had a year or two practicing on Dunk's supposed great grandson I am now nearly fully convinced.  If you disagree, read my flair.   Yes, this was a joy to read indeed!   spank you very much. Dotrice made a change in his voice saying that last line that really caught my ear!   Yeah, this is George's way of sneaking in stuff.  Like *"We might even make it to your uncles bloody wedding"*  Were we to interpret characters dialogue as only straight forward we can shut this sub down until tWoW is announced...   That would be *pretty strong* evidence for Aegon being a Blackfyre of some sort. Right?   Are there any good theories about the **whereabouts** of the two swords?   Yeah, saying he was the best is a little far. I'd put Alexander at the top. Napoleon had the ambition to match Littlefinger!   Cookies, cookies, cookies for you.   Lyannas crypt is definitely stone. I am betting that is one arm of the prophecies.   I agree somewhat. Some actors get typecasted and when that is done, there is not coming back from that.   I do not like Sibel in Game of Thrones. May have to do with the character but some lines are just not convincing. Especially season 2-3. I don't think she's that good looking either so the porn is really uninteresting.   Was **Hinds** really Aberforth? It's funny you should mention it because I saw the final movie a week ago, and I paused and thought to myself: *Is that Mance Rayder!?"* I looked it up but found Jim McManus was playing Aberforth. But it sure looks a whole lot like Ciarin Hinds! (Sounds like him too)   If it's something other than A time for wolves I'm gonna be mad.    By season 2 I knew she were gonna be big. I didn't think it would happen so fast though.    Oh god yes. So good. Hinds is great as Caesar!    Oh, and Ramsay Snow is good in Misfits. Those first 3 seasons man. Awesome.    I was going to say Jerome Flynn should be the lead in his own series. Seems like he already is though! Might have to check that out actually.   The Wolf Hall-post got me thinking. Game of Thrones has some of Great Britains most talented actors. Harry Lloyd is one of my favourite Brits, and should have been nominated for supporting role in "The Theory of Everything" if you ask me. I loved him in Doctor Who, a show that has a great many guest actors that stars in A Game of Thrones which I will list below. Tell me if I forgot someone.   nbsp;  Tobias Menzies and Liam Cunningham are russian submariners.  Joe Dempsie - Gendry  Harry Lloyd - Viserys  David Bradley - Walder Frey is in Doctor Who and also plays William Hartnell (#1 Doctor) in the movie "An Adventure of Space and Time".  Iain Glenn - Jorah the Andal)  Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Jojen  Diana Rigg - Queen of Thorns  Julian Glover - Pycelle  Jamie Sives, Ron Donachie and Ian Hanmore was all in the same episode "Tooth and Claw".  Lucian Msamati - Salladhor Saan  Mark Killeen - Mero  Spencer Wilding - A White Walker who has played aliens several times in Doctor Who  Tim Plester - Black Walder Rivers  Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) was in the spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures  Burn Gorman (Karl Tanner) and Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) was in the spin-off Torchwood  Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin) and Julian Glover was in the old Who-series   nbsp;  **Rose Leslie** has a role in the season 1 of Downton Abbey where she is great.  Any other show or film where an actor from "Thrones" is particularly *shiny*?  	105
 Perfect! Thank you for your help!    That's a great idea, thanks! I'm so glad I asked, most of these things I have never heard of!    Oh, perfect - that's a big help! Thank you!   Thank you /u/lilypetal! I love your suggestion about natural sunlight, I will have to rearrange our room but I think I can work it. And I hadn't thought about the spills, either. I imagine that as nice as a wood finish would look it would be horrible for stains.     Hi ladies of /r/makeupaddiction! I need your help.  My fianc's birthday is coming up, and I thought the perfect gift would be to buy or put together a make up battlestation for her. I am willing to spend a lot of time on it, and my budget is not really capped.  In terms of advice, I'm really looking for ideas on what features you'd like in your own make up stations and how to go about sourcing the materials. Mirror styles and types, storage zones (make up and jewelery potentially?), shelving, new make up to buy her to include and the physical design of the entire thing. The area I have available is a space of about 2.5m x 1m.   Pictures of your own dedicated make up areas would be appreciated as well as I really have no idea what I'm up against.

 Exactly.     But going to 11 across the board is ridiculous.     It doesn't mean Racism is over... but at least we can make it so our government doesn't fly racist symbols as their flag.   It makes me sick that everyone else wants to turn this whole thing into a ridiculous joke.      So I'm playing this complete waste of a time money stealing game SimCity BuildIt.   I'm at the level where schools became available and the people are asking for them.  But they are 40,000 and I refuse to pay real money to buy fake currency.  So I earn the money by actually playing the game.     Needless to say, at this level, 40,000 takes a long long time to earn from crafting alone.   If I level up, Police stations will become available and they'll start begging for that AND schools.   But money is tight.    So I finally earn enough to build the damn school.  And just before I'm about to place it I see a complaint bubble that there are no schools.   Resenting the time I just spent earning this damn school I decided to retaliate.   So I placed it in the low value shitty land in the pollution zone near the factories.    After I did it I felt vindicated.  Take that, you selfish bastards.   And then I thought.... OH so this is why this lame shit happens IRL.    Can we PLEASE turn our government inside out these next couple of election cycles?  If not for all you lazy dicks not voting....  Swarm the polls.  Vote out incumbents. (unless they have a verifiable record of not being a corporate hack and/or a dickhead.)  Leave the Bernies in office.  No matter what their party is, if they have a record of staying true to the people, DO NOT VOTE THEM OUT.   Keep them.  Vote out all these other rich knob polishers.        As a previously well practiced BMX rider, I'd welcome these.  I might slow down a tiny bit so you can really see how cool it looks.      This whole thing is RIDICULOUS anyway.  A mockery is being made out of the issue of taking this flag down from our public buildings.     Apple just removed games from their store that had the flag in it.  Nevermind if it might be a game about the civil war...............................  Mockery.... a fucking mockery is being made from the issue.   And that's how the issue gets marginalized.       It's cool.  I just thought the story was a bit out of perspective for the terrible disaster that was Katrina.    I mean... everything was flooded and we had dead bloated bodies everywhere of people that died of dehydration....in a flood.     And then there's this story about someone blowing precious life saving water on some fish.   Don't get me wrong... I love my pet fish.  But people are dying out there, John.       Oh I'm not talking about peaceful protest.  What a joke protesting.  Protesting is like stamping your feet in a toddlers temper tantrum.     I'm talking about peaceful polling.  There isn't a lot they can do about 90% voter turnout.   You turn it inside out.        What's an assault rifle going to do against a tank?  Nothing.  So instead, it gets used in a different manner that harms innocent people.  Which gives cause for the police to continue increasing arms and owning tanks.  Because we have weapons of war on the street; we need weapons of war to combat it.  It's a goddamn arms race.  And a civilian won't win an arms race.      The national guard would just get called in anyway.  National guard is full of mouth breathing morons that would just blindly follow orders just like they did in the 1960s.  And many of them are just itching to play big time tough Active Duty Soldier Boy.   I had the unfortunate experience of working with these guys in Iraq.  Fucking morons, with their big time attitudes, thinking they were heroes; and doing stupid shit that got people hurt.      Any revolution we have needs to be non violent.  Because our stupid little guns won't protect us.  Anyone who thinks guns can protect us from government weaponry is willfully dishonest with themselves about reality.   And people say "oh the military wouldn't do that".   As a vet... fuck yes we would follow orders.   There would be some desertion as there is in ANY war... but ultimately even the military has an US and Them (civilians) attitude.     These weapons don't do shit to protect us from tyranny.  Our revolutions need to be peaceful for them to work.      Time to argue about rusty nails and tetanus... reddit rules.   Front Line Assembly... it was in the late 80s I first heard them.  I was on a road trip to texas.  I was 10 years old.  We stopped at a gas station.  There was a spinning display of cassette tapes in the corner.   I picked up one on the back side that had a cool picture and was dusty.    I get in the car and popped it into my walkman... it was like NOTHING anyone ever played on the radio.  It was so suspenseful the music.   I was on the edge of the seat waiting to hear what would come next.  And the beats made me want to drum on stuff.     I was hooked.   I will enjoy everything they make... even if it's not the same now.  I don't care.  Bill Leeb, in yourself and do whatever the fuck you want.   My whole family didn't have water for two weeks.   My uncle died of a heart attack after the national guard just threw the water out the helicopter and it busted open on the ground.     I'm real glad these fish had water though.     Or ~~get into a clinical trial~~ play Russian Roulette...   Fixed for accuracy.    Wow I should have sent my size in.   @ 11.5 inches.    And this is not bragging.    There is nothing cool about having a massive cock and sex is always terrible because the depth capacity of vagina just isn't great enough.    So, I wish I could, but never will, have the sensation of sinking in "all the way to my balls" that I keep hearing about.  Apparently the feeling is the bee's knees....I wouldn't know.  And blow jobs?   What's that? Blow jobs are so terrible when you are a longer size.    Underwear?    Boxers or gtfo... and the tip still hangs down.   Anything with "brief" in the name is very uncomfortable.     And sports suck because even with a J - strap  it gets in the way.    Most girls are afraid of it, especially when i take it out on the subway.  And when I sit with slacks on, everyone hawks at my massive jiggly bits pant mold.   No... those were the 52 inch kickwears.    The Jnco Jean's were still pretty accessible.      I used to skate vert in those massive kickwears.    I have no clue how I pulled that off but we did it.

Thus, the three part ritual to remove each set of emotions. The original Spock removed fear and happiness but was left with love.  This love motivated him to do a great many illogical acts for the sake of his crew and love of a dear friend.    New Spock, having completed zero parts of the ritual, displays his fear, unhappiness, and love quit often.  And as we know, angry/feeling vulcans are basically just Romulans.        No no... Now you're trying to back peddle.  Can't even take ownership of your own words.  I'm embarrassed for you.    I refuse to engage in this.  Goodbye.     You could drill small holes and put tiny low lvl  UV leds behind it?    I'm sorry, your posts are so contradictory from one to the next that you couldn't possibly be the same person.   You went from saying anyone who claimed the USA kicked ass was naive.  Then you flipped and claim that no one is claiming what you just said.    I have to admit.  I am confused because you can't seem to make up your mind which position to take and refused ownership of your own contribution to the conversation.      Nope.  We're done.  **WE DID IT**   No even came close to suggesting that.  Except the guy I replied to just did.  Did you read????  Or perhaps you haven't yet figured out how to read the conversation chain on reddit.   Just skip to the end and shitpost.     You're lucky that you aren't a slinky. Get well.   [I started thinking about this.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JrM4Cc6)    Well you have to consider that Spock in this timeline has not yet purged all emotion in the Kolinahr.     So he's more violent and disturbed.   He's an angry spock.      Look at the Supreme Court.  The next fucking president is so fucking important because of the possible number of judges he/she will get to appoint.    Everyone better think long and hard who they want with that power.  I'm as serious as a heart attack on sunday evening.    Reaches up gently so not to knock it in.... has a been-playing-hockey-all-day-muscle-twitch and accidentally bumps it in.     Take that hockey gods.       I agree.  it's making a mockery of taking down the flag from our public buildings.     It's a micromachine commercial!!   Look pal, its hot in here... I don't wanna talk. I wanna stand awkwardly or pretend to clean whilst waiting for you to squirt your magic freon juice into those tubes and make this work.    If the silence gets weird, I'll just bother you with more crazy stories; about how it used to could and now it can't.      It always seemd like the more meds I was on the shittier my health got.    Once I refused pills I got better.  I basically had a choice between having the original condition or having a multitude of other conditions and risks.   I hope I don't get pancreatic cancer.  I really fucking hope that and 2 meds I was on came with that risk.     So I'm not really so sure that these "advanced drugs" are really the miracle of capitalism that they are made out to be.   Funny listening to the speed talk side effect speech at the end of drug commercials.  Which happens less and less these days it seems.   But look on the box and HOLY SHIT! Possible side effect "death".  WTF!    I'm gonna have a leaking anus whilst worrying about checking my eyes for yellow every day. Sign me up for monthly subscription to that!    Ummm the title you clicked to get here says it bro!   WEeeee Shitpost rain!      downvote me here.      Oh no worries.  This is a shitpost thread.  It's supposed to be here.    Celebrate by downvoting and upvoting inappropriately!      There is the argument that Germany invaded eastward because it knew the fall of the west was coming. It needed breathing room but ended up being just an extra nail in it's own coffin.    Yes the USA did just kickass and take names.  Germany was powerful adversary.  They were already there, dug in, with defensive structures in place.   You don't chip away at that sort of situation without being a total badass.  Taking fortified territory is one of the hardest things to accomplish in warfare.   You don't do it by being a pussy... or by being unclever.  Which the USA had to be since it's equipment had to come from half a world away.   We couldn't just load up dozen C17 and C5s and airdrop or insert everything in less than 12 hours like we can today.  The logistical challenges the USA faced far exceeded that of the German army.  The tonnage of cargo and personnel movement world record, from WWII, stood until 2007-2008 when the record was broken at Balad/Anaconda in Iraq.   And it took modern cargo aircraft to accomplish that record breaking.  (armored humvees and MRAPS also weigh a good deal more than a shitty jeep)  So to imply that the USA didn't really do shit in WWII is flatly ignorant.      Pretty sure I spent more than a few summers at Camp Failhard.         Peaked in highschool.     Look at that shit eating grin.       Fair point.    Lost Boys just retained a cult following.  His other films, not so much.      can one serial kill oneself?    I mean I'm okay with the Matrix.  Not because of keanu or anything.    I generally avoid his movies.  Except I do like Johnny Mnemonic for no good reason at all. I know it's a really shitty movie but for some reason I like it. Nostalgia maybe idk.     I remember being forced to watch ~~The Notebook~~ edit: I mean the lakehouse or whatever that shit with sandra bullock.  I can't even remember the name lol.  I just remember wondering how many times they were gonna use a turtleneck to cover up his ugly neck.   He is not aging gracefully at all.      He knows... he knows ALL about it.     No shit sherlock.  Thanks for unloading all that know-it-all on us over a figure of speech.      Who you gonna call??    Granted: edited.    Critical thought now: Did he kill people in The Cable Guy?    Let the shitposting roll.  idc.    edit:downvote this post.     Don't worry, buckets can hold tears and brain matter at the same time.  heh heh heheh   but they have no brains...   Oooooooooooo      Edit: He found it. I'm good.     People in the media generally dismiss college campus numbers.     There was "The Client".  I fell asleep to it.  He made that in 1994.  One of those courtcase movies that never fucking end it seems like.     And then Phone Booth.... never heard of it.     No... because some states will reject corporations money and not ratify.  The political climate in the individual states isn't so easily bought if you are asking for something they are fundamentally against.  It doesn't matter how many billions you have.  Ratification process serves us well here.  Whilst I don't think it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy the entire thing... it's not going to happen quietly.  The massive number of individuals that have to be bought here... it won't stay quiet for long.       That is a conspiracy of massive proportions that would take mind control to pull off.       I don't think your assertion of his "character" can be substantiated in his roles.  He's done so many different things and none of that has really stepped on the toes of his other parts.    Man on the Moon for better or worse did not feel like I was watching Ace Ventura or the Mask.     So I think he has the ability to both embrace and transcend his stereotypical image for each of his roles.      Still not horror.   Well let's be honest. Joel Schumacher has never really lived up to The Lost Boys.  Batman and Robin was terrible.  He hasn't really done anything that memorable.  He's not a bad director, just a tad overrated.     The director would have to be someone who wouldn't hold back.  But it looks like Jim Carrey won't go that road anymore.    The story behind 23 seems... weak.   Edit: I would argue to Carrey that dark psychological ~~drama~~"thriller" =/= pure horror film.      That was a comedy.     Yeah but their personalities are way different than each other...   Robin Williams would play a more loathing depressed type of killer that uses the murder to soothe internal pain.    Carrey would be a more antagonstic or playful killer just out for the sick pleasure.  with some amount of loathing to go along with it.      Agree or disagree idc.    He'd be creepy and dark as fuck....    Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy.  I mean make it Horror.     Edit2: Turning off inbox replies.  WTF happened last night?  I barely remember posting this. San Migel Pale Pilson is shit beer.  And I hate Jim Carrey.  I apologize for my behavior in bringing this up.    This is like waking up to discover that last night you were the, so-drunk-it's-awkward-guy, ruining the party.      Looks like I picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue.    I just finished reading through this series for the 3rd time.  But previous two times was back c 2007 and 08.      I got to thinking if this could be made into a movie... I don't know.  It'd be a LONG fucking movie I'd think.      Netflix series??? I'm not sure the intensity of the environment would work over tons of episodes?  If it's TOO campy it won't work I think.     Disclaimer: Ignore the fact that there isn't an actor alive that would not turn Spider into a clown.       I don't know... I've always been resistant to these guys jumping back and forth into each other's storylines.  It takes away some of the uniqueness of the hero within his own world.       No way... that's TOTALLY a weather balloon.  /s    Nice pic.  Set as wallpaper and done.   THNX!    How fucking childish is that shit.  You know... some of the South Korean people still have family trapped inside.   "**YES SUFFER HARDER SO THAT YOUR TEARS HAVE A MORE GENUINE FLAVOR WHILE YOU PITIFULLY BEG FOR MERCY!"**  And the usa is all   "huh hhuh uh here's a stick... poke em with it huh huhuhuh. .  that's cool.  They deserve it. Commies"     Kim Jung-Un will eventually say please.  But in a long drawn out way before he pushes the launch button.   "Puhleeaasseee"  **CLACK!**  (his launch button has a 3 foot diameter probably)  Europe just thinks if you don't look at it then it will go away.    China is like a parent that is embarrassed by it's special needs child.      Russia doesn't give a shit unless it makes the USA look bad then they just play blah blah blah lip service to it....    Japan is aching to be let out of it's cage.   Until then it just gets to bolster it's "defensive force" and play the victim. (we won't talk about how their short lived conquests are what originally caused all this shit to happen.  NEW FLAG; DIDN'T HAPPEN TEEHEE! )    The USA just likes to punch shit; so that didn't really heal any of the wounds that Old Japan left behind.     When shit finally hits the fan with this stupid ass nonsense, everyone is going to wish we had done something different.  Because it's gonna be messy for South Korea and the rest of Asia; as USA and China can't play nice on the water.       Someone get the detroit webmaster to put down the crackpipe and reboot the server!       Quick! Flip him over and check to see if there's hair on the other end!    The first post has the link to the studies bro.     How many times you gotta be told?     Yes... based on the studies... IN GENERAL organics are loaded with parasites when compared to non organics.    For example,  2 buckets of produce.  Organic and Non Organic.   If the organic has as much as 31% more parasites than the non organic then it was taken on a load of parasites.   LOL       I stand by that.    Now please show me where I said 100 percent have parasites?  You can't Because I never said that.  And there are links to the sourced material.... So fuck off.  I'm turning off inbox replies to prevent further feeding of shitposting trolls.       Please quote me where I said 100% of organic produce has parasites....    You can't.  Stop shitposting.  Troll.    Edit:  Yes.... in the first post I link to the comment that has multiple sources already linked.    Did you even fucking read... or check?      This is true.  You should wash everything.    However, the studies were comparing organics to non organics.  Whole Foods is an organic grocery, no?   It is fair to note, that my opening sentence was "Wash your veggies" but then spoke specifically to the type of organic product of Whole Foods and how you should be MORE vigilant.  Perhaps wash those organic veggies extra due to the increased risk.     I mean... feel free to simplify an entire post, to a single, out of context quote....     The Moon is a Harsh Mistress talks a bit about this; the problem was people assigned to work on Luna ended up turning into a life sentence if they stayed too long.     Holy crap someone asked how these magnets work and got a legitimate answer.      Can I borrow your nuclear powered realdoll?      Why not?     The president is a tax paying citizen like the rest of us though.        The president is a tax paying citizen like the rest of us.  That means he owns it.   Yes, it is his house.  It's my house too.     Mi casa su casa.  And we've referred to it as the presidents house for a while.  "The Bush White House"  "The Clinton White House".    Obama isn't bob dole.  He doesn't need to refer to himself in the third person so he could say "My White House".... But yeah... he lives there.    You don't own your apartment no matter if it's free or not.  But you still call it "my apartment".      Are you like a.... mental ninja?  Or shaman?   My heart feels soothed by this.   Fill the middle with thickly mixed acrylic and you have a delicious snack!     "Did you eat paint cannolis as a kid??"     So wash your veggies.  Organic vegetables are loaded with parasites.  And people catch Listeria from unwashed produced because the pickers and handlers can't figure out how to wash their hands after pooping on them and farmers keep irrigating their fields with water washed down from the pig farms....  As /u/gothic_potato so generously sourced actual studies, [in his post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/3aobr2/a_guy_with_food_poisoning_from_sushi_threw_this/cseu1ee)    If you're not washing your veggies YOU ARE AN IDIOT THAT DESERVES TO GET SICK.    ehem.  I'm better now thank you.     Edit:  On a side note you can ask the cashier to verify the weight on their scale.  But meat departments really should start providing scales to double check.   This is true but rabbits also have a hard time drinking liquid water.  They get much of their mosture off the dew covering the grasses they eat.     So grapes aren't a good thing to feed everyday, They are probably perfect for a lost and probably hungry and dehydrated rabbit.   It's just okay for a first feeding to give it some needed sugars and water.  I would suggest taking the skin off the grapes if the rabbit isn't spitting them out.        But after some rest you should give it something better suited to it's daily nutritional needs.      The problem with "buying a law" is that the public is more aware and savvy to these types of events.  And when someone is raking in big money from corporations it's beginning to hurt them more than helping.   Corporations can buy individual votes... but the ratification process is not so simple as each state's political climate is different.     That ratification process is what protects the people.     Yeah I read your link and spoke specifically on it.  It's 3 almost 4 years old and it was using data collected from the global financial collapse and still during the adjustment period of the recent passage.      Volume of trading between the two markets isn't even CLOSE to the same.  Neither is how the trading is done.  The GDP of the two countries isn't even remotely similar and neither are the rest of their economic policies or political systems.        Your USA=Sweden premise is still wrong and unproven.  Try again.    Well, fortunately amendments have to be ratified by the states.  So... it's a lot harder for a corporation to buy an amendment than it is to buy a federal law.      Because it is a false premise from the very damn start of critical analysis.  If USA = Sweden then we would be located in the exact same location with the exact same system of government with the exact same market laws and regulations.  same leaders population  and same name.      But since these are obviously not true then yes it is quite incontrovertible that USA and Sweden are NOT the same.     You said they are contrary to irrefutable fact.  Therefore it is up to You to prove that Sweden and the USA are exactly the same.  And your sources are old as ducks utilizing data from the global recession.....   Just throw sheep at the invaders and they'll eventually tire of it and leave.        No bill of rights??? How do they keep the government from stomping on people's faces?    They did that so that we might more carefully consider the treaties we agree to let have power over us.  Giving up control was suppossed to act as a deterrent against shitty treaties.    That has backfired.  It's time to make amendments to the Constitution to work in today's world.  This isn't 1776 anymore...     Upon confronting the victim, one must convince them to sit completely still so that the victim can present a precise location of an area no larger than 1/4 an inch.  The attacker will carefully line up the attack utilizing only their index and middle fingers to jam swiftly, forcefully, and deeply into an area penetrating the area between the  pyramid and the inferior cerebellar peduncle.     If the victim tenses up and this area cannot be punctured the attacker will then say "Wait" and try again.  If continued flinching persists in disrupting a precise hit the attacker can eventually tell the victim to "hang on 1 sec" whilst they pull out their knife and just access the nerve through the jugular foramen or possibly through the carotid sheath were it lies between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein.    The attacker must be careful not to nick either of these blood transporting structures, as doing so might cause imminent death; thereby interfering with the process of achieving death by disruption of the bundled pair of vagus nerves.      We need an open world WWII game....   And these games should feature characters like these to tell their stories.  It would be wicked cool and educational at the same time.       I thought the standard was: Are the packages they are handling arrive at their destination in a timely manner for a cheap price.    Fuck yes is the answer to that.  USPS transit times comparable to fedex and UPS slowest cheapest way but yet still costs less money.     The fact that no one else is delivering leaf mail has absolutely ZERO to do with how well USPS has been performing their job.  I can mail a letter from one coast to the next for less than a buck.  USPS promises it will arrive in 7 to 10 days... it arrives in 3.     You can't fucking beat that.  So .... shhhh.  you don't know what you're talking about.     I was in a military unit that broke the global world record for tonnage of cargo and personnel moved in 2008.   That record still stands today.    So I know a little something about logistics.... And the USPS is shit hot when it comes to logistics.      Again, did **I** do that to **YOU**??    A native american man was going around raping people.  Do I blame all native americans for that?    How about all the crime that Native Americans commit against other Native Americans.... do you hate all native americans right now?  Or is his crime against his own race still really the fault of whites?    What about the chinese railroad workers that used to murder the native american competition in their sleep?  Do you hate chinese now?   Will you cut one of them if they walk onto a reservation?   What about a mexican?  Mexicans are half white and half native in general.   Would you cut a mexican?  He's half to blame!    Apparently being full of shit applies to ANY race.    And I got news for you, the native americans were waring, brutalizing, enslaving, murdering, raping, scalping, raiding, and eating each other LONG LONG before whites ever got here.  I suppose you think they were really all just sitting around in their teepee's smoking peacepipes and playing flutes huh?   They never ever fought or attacked others. *cough PAWNEE cough*   Oh and the Comanche tribe used to hunt down other tribes, kill their babies over a fire and then eat their cooked flesh.   How about a Comanche?  will you cut him?       You hate all native americans double or triple now?       **HE** gave it to **YOU**?????   This isn't news??   Edit: Holy fuck you'd expect this sort of thing happened hundreds of years ago between peoples that are already dead!  But its happening RIGHT NOW!       I'm sorry, but I don't take blame for the failings of dead people who died hundreds of years before I was born.  My european family line wasn't even in the USA at that time.  (oh and my great grandmother was full cherokee).  Which doesn't mean shit because i'm mostly white.  So much so you can't tell there is any native american genes in my dna.       So does that mean I get like 75% blame and get to claim 25% victim?  (or whatever the percentage is for that generational spread)  Please.  Use your head and apply some critical thought to the embarrassing shit you think before you just barf it out and look like a fool some more.   She has the look of "I just pooped my pants in public."   Well I guess I can officially call myself a 2nd Amendment Socialist.     Thanks.   No no... that's not how this works.  That is not my responsibility.  YOU made the comparison.   It's up to YOU to show how they are the same.  This Sweden=USA is your premise not mine.  Why should I care enough to fix something you broke?  Don't slack off, do your own job, and quit asking me to fling myself willingly into your trap.  I won't be suckered into fruitless debates by dogma and false premises.               Your making the comparison on the false premise that Sweden's and the USA's economies and markets are the same.  They are not.    This....   THIS....     I owe you a life debt.   My whole life.. and then you... here.  THIS!   BOOM.     NO MORE WILL I NOT HAVE MY CHIPS OR MY 75 CENTS!!!!!     It would hurt... at first.  But all growth comes with pains and investment.   But you're a fool if you don't invest for the long term.  It's the END GAME that counts.   And in the end, a better educated society that leads the world will be better for the stock market.    And it really would not hurt that bad.  Do you know how much fucking microtransactions take place in a single second?  This tax would suck for all of 3 months and then it'd just be part of the game.      ...which would benefit from a better educated and more pro$perou$ $ociety.   TIL: I look and sound like Lewis Black when stuck in traffic.      My laughter turned to tears... and not the kind commonly associated with extreme humor.      Still needs to ask a vet about it.  Because the cat may have barfed up most of the medicine and there could be more worms further down the intestinal tract.  Vet can advise when the dose again and how much it do additional testing.   I'm calling bullshit!  That's clearly a tribble.     Explain to me how to walk.      I was white in New Orleans inner city school before moving to Atlanta.    In New Orleans school, there was no separation of students at lunch.  I was a minority and had nicknames like "whitey" "white bread" and "saltine".   I didn't really care because it was in good fun and these were my friends.  Friends that had my back and I had their's.  Which was damn important in New Orleans.  The other whites just sat mixed in with the blacks.  Salt and Pepper.  1 to 5 ratio if I had to guess.    Then, I moved to Atlanta.  My first day at school, I get lunch and I sit down at the nearest open seat.  I had not yet noticed that all the students were divided.  White kids on one side and the black kids on the other.     Anyway.  I sat down at what happened to be the blacks table.   Well the black kids started harassing me, pushing me out of my chair, and told me to get back over to the side of the cafeteria; where "my kind" were to sit.      Now I didn't know what the fuck was going on.   At all.  Goddamn mars this fucking place.  Then I noticed the division.  Having no allies on my first day, naturally I retreat to the white kids' side of the cafeteria; where I had been unanimously told to go, by a large group of very upset students.   And I wasn't accepted there, with the whites, either.  The kids then called me a "wigger" and nicknamed me "white men can't jump" as that movie was popular at the time. White men can't jump was my name for the next 3 years before I moved again.   That was, by far, the dumbest 3 years of my entire existence.  Fuck Atlanta.  Honestly FUCK Atlanta.    I'm not saying anything at all about this story in relation to the struggle of racism in the USA.  I'm not sure what it means, to be honest.  I'm not going to deny that I would not want the challenges a black man continues to face today.  I do my best not to compound the problems, that other races have, by simply treating them how I would want to be treated.  It's their own fault if they are dicks after that.  And being a dick has nothing to do with skin.   I've been all over the world and I'll tell you this: People are people and they are generally the same everywhere you go. And one thing that always seems to stay true, no matter where I am in the world, is that a vocal and powerful shitty few fuck everything up for the silent majority.      I've never really formed an opinion other than this was an unfortunate situation.   And it taught me to have an open mind... but to also have open eyes to go along with that open mind.        I'm impotent.  Have sympathy.      I agree.   It was something that I saw them talking about on the "news" here in Phillipines... Which is just opinion blabbing just like USA news.     They were talking about bringing Netflix to the Philippines and discussing how they could possibly make a subscription service work in a poor cash driven society.   The subject of ads came up.   So I asked here wondering what Americans thought.  I suspected it would be against it but I wanted to see if anyone would bring up the "revenue generation" arguments or "incentivizing production of more shows" that was getting thrown around during the segment.       On a side note: I like how many people are participating and then downvoting the question.   Isn't the vote not supposed to be about agreement or disagreement?   Geeze people, Sorry it's not a *Plumbers of reddit, whats the biggest turd you wrangled at your job* question.  	106
 It's been a while since I read the book, is Jon established as definitely having died? I remember him being mob-stabbed but I can't remember at what point the narrative cuts off.   I expect there to be some more hints about Jon's true parentage!   As long as you have decency and gumption you're a-ok!   I've encountered a lot of scholars of religions in my philosophy seminars and they were bright and interesting people to a man (and woman, of course). Anyone who can wrestle with Thomas Aquinas and come out the other side in one piece deserves a great amount of respect in my mind.   I worked as a bartender and bouncer through my undergrad, not quite the same as a barista, I know, but similar in some ways... just with more drunk people.   Once you have your masters, depending on whether your church offers this opportunity - why not go and travel to the farthest reaches of your faith's influence and work in a congregation there? I knew a young catholic priest once who worked in McMurdo station in Antarctica for a year. I always envied him because of this.     I haven't really felt anything for anyone since we broke up, not even sympathy or emphathy. Just..kind of...a heart of stone.  I've experienced that a couple of times. It sucks. I would tell you that it will pass but I know from experience how unhelpful such comments feel - when you're in a bad spot you don't want your experience to be downplayed as a 'passing phase', no matter whether it's true. What I will say is that, in time, this episode will help you understand things about yourself you didn't previously.   Relationships ending is tough, especially if it's the first serious one but it will help you figure out some stuff. It's a learning experience, as cruel as that may sound right now.  As for the college stuff - don't be so quick to dismiss the skills you've learned with your degree - most of what you've done in the last 4 (I'm guessing) years can be marketed as skills, if you know how. I have a degree in liberal arts and there were times I was freaking out about my future prospects. I run a production company now, it's doing very well. And as ludicrous as it may sound, the skills I learned in getting my degrees in creative writing and comparative lit. are paying huge dividends. Like, six-figure dividends.  Figure out your passions (another throwaway encouragement prompting a lot of eye-rolling) and then figure out how to link them to your degree and then figure out how to make a career out of that. It's easier than you might think.  Good luck with everything, /u/Gordo-Mofo. You'll land on your feet!     Sure thing. I've edited the comment!   What always flummoxes me is how people don't seem to understand that beauty is mostly an arbitrary concept, hugely influenced by societal mechanisms.  Different regions and different times have/had different ideals of beauty, most of which are based on scarcity:  You live in a society where most people have office jobs and don't have time to be outside? A nice tan is attractive. Live in a society where the majority works outside everyday? A pale complexion is attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is scarce? Heavy people are attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is plenty and cheap? Thinness is attractive.   Knowing all this, most of us still seem unable or unwilling to accept that our notions of beauty are just that - notions, moving targets, influenced by what everyone arounds us finds attractive. Not only do we seem unable to accept this, many of us turn the concept up to eleven - proclaiming that beauty (a fleeting attribute at best) is the only thing to be valued in a partner, while the content of someone's character (more enduring and, I'd argue, ultimately the most important thing if you want to be with them) is being relegated to "oh also, they're nice I guess". Crazy, when you think about it.  Thing is, I would never want for someone to have to change what they find attractive, it's everybody's prerogative to like what they like, but these subs are designed to target people those users find unattractive *because they're not attracted to them*! Why would anyone expend the energy to hate something/someone they're not affected by? It's sort of the same thing as with straight people who fight gay rights: "Oh, you're not attracted to members of your own gender? **The don't date them!** Why do you care what they do?  And it's in following that question that the anger I feel over what's happening in those subs mixes with pity. Because the answer to that question is. "You don't care. And if you do there's probably something wrong with you."   Ever so often when a post from fatpeoplehate or ImGoingToHellForThis or some equivalent subreddit hits a top spot in all I go and have a look at the discussion, find a user spewing particularly rabid hate and check out their post history. Know what I find? Lots and lots of self-hatred. I think fatpeoplehate especially is mostly made up of (often shockingly young) kids who either are heavy and browse the sub hoping that the self-hatred it inspires will help them lose weight, or kids who were heavy and can't reconcile that part of their past with their ideology in any other way but by ridiculing others (as avatars of themselves, you see this happen a lot with ex smokers too).   A few times I stumbled upon kids who also posted in thinspo subs (communities that encourage each other in their anorexic disorders). One of those kids confessed in such a sub that she used fatpeoplehate as a way to prolong the time until she finally had to cave and eat something... I'm sure if you pulled more of these threads you'd find even worse stuff... I think we can agree that hating someone for something which doesn't affect you is not really the behaviour of a happy and healthy mind. Sad.   Sorry this turned into a novel, I guess it was just something I had been thinking about for quite some time...       I agree with everything you're saying, these subs make me incredibly sad!  That being said, I find your description of of that thread's OP as having a "tiny flat stick body" problematic as well. I understand the temptation of responding to an insult in kind but thin-shaming is a weak defense against fat-shaming.    If you have a beard your mileage may vary on that one.    Except gay people can have healthy, fulfilling relationships as consenting adults.   Thank you for this comment!  I've been lurking in this sub for the past few days and your comment was the most helpful I've seen so far! Like OP I've wasted weight on unnecessary junk (which prompted the use of more boosters, which led to a spiral of clutter). I just tested a more minimalist design with great success. Thank you!   I wouldn't care if the showrunners had no idea how the books end, but they do.  I heard about that but I wonder whether that means that they will end the show in that way... I guess time will tell.   That's a bit misleading. While there is no 'cure' for pedophilia, there are therapeutic programs that can help people deal with their sexual impulses through cognitive-behavioral training and by counselling them on how to act in high-risk environments.   The suppression of the sexual drive through medication (i.e. chemical castration) is one approach of dealing with the issue but it's far from the only one.  	13

  Pitisik sitten lkriksi ja lakimieheksi opiskelevaa tukea vhemmn kuin muita? Nehn tienaisivat enemmn, joten elintason nousun pitisi kannustaa valmistumaan viel nopeammin!  Miksi pitisi?   Tosiasiahan on ett yliopistoistakin valmistuu paljon ihmisi jotka eivt hirvesti tienaa. Loistavat tulot ovat poikkeus eik snt, ei siis mikn perustelu tlle.  Kukaan ei puhunutkaan loistavista tuloista. Puhuttiin elintason noususta ei miljoonista.   Lhtkohdan pitisi mys olla ett tyttmyys olisi vain lyhyt ajanjakso elmss ja elintaso nousisi tit saadessa, joten miksei pistet nit elmn lainalla?  Se on tavoite. Tyttmysyturva tarkoitus onkin turvata samantasoinen elintaso kuin tiss ollessaan. Ikv kyll kaikki eivt ole tykykyisi tai heille ei ole aina tit tarjolla.   Opiskelija voi mys olla vaikka nelikymppinen joka on ollut tyelmss 25 vuotta. Opiskelija on mys voinut nuoresta asti olla kaikki kest tiss ja iltoja ja viikonloppuja mys. El rupea sanomaan ettei ole tehnyt mitn yhteiskunnan eteen. Mielestni tosin tyntekoa ei pitisi ajatella ainoana asiana tehd jotain yhteiskunnan eteen...  Eikhn nm ole kuitenkin poikkeuksia. Enemmist on kuitenkin nuoria.   Ongelma on mys opiskelija-asuntoloiden alueella. Asumislis ei saa koko asuntoon, joten pit pienest asumistuesta maksaa loput. Rovaniemell opiskelija-asunnoissa olen asunut ja ei hirvesti rahaa jnyt. Kuvittelisin ettei ole Helsingin opiskelija-asuntoloissa kovin raposta.  Miksei asumislis saanut?      Ongelma ei ole niill alueilla joissa opiskelijasuntoloita on. Tai on niiden mielest joiden mielest opiskelijasuminen pitisi olla samalla tasolla kuin vanhemmat ovat tarjonneet. Nin ei mielestni kuulu olla. Mielestni opiskelijan elintason ei kuulu olla samalla tasolla kuin tyttmn. Opiskelija ei ole tehnyt mitn oman yhteiskuntansa eteen. Se ei ole samalla tapaa ansainnut paikkansa yhteiskunnassa kuin tytn. (Tosin erikoistapauksia nisskin tyttmiss on) Mutta lhtkohtana pitisi olla se ett opiskelu on vain lyhyt ajanjakso elmss, ei mikn jatkuva tila mik vaatisi saman elintason kuin tyttmll. Samalla tuleva elintason nousu kannustaisi opiskelijoita valmistumaan ajallaan tai parhaassa tapauksessa aikaisemmin.   Opiskelijoille on mys muita palveluita kuten halpoja asuntoja tarjolla. Esim omassa opiskelijakylssni on tietkseni halpoja asuntoja vapaana mutta ihmiset eivt halua niit. Jotkut haluavat asua paremmin mutta se ei mielestni oikeuta sen parempaan tukeen kuin muutkaan. Se on jlleen niit omia valintoja. Toisaalta tm ei toteudu esim Helsingiss.   Kyll opiskella pit saada pisempn, mutta se ett tapahtuuko se omalla vai valtion kustannuksella on eri asia. Ja jos olisin pttj en maksaisi itselleni yhtn enemp. Se ett joku on tehnyt vrn ptksen tai ei tied mit tekee elmlln ei ole yhteiskunnan vika. Se on yksiln omalla vastuulla. Ja yhteiskunta joka holhoaa yksilit on mielestni huono yheiskunta. Suomalaisten pitisi oppia ottamaan vastuu tekemisistn.   Voisin luetella heti 20 opiskelijaa joilla tm ei toteudu. Itsekkin opiskelen alaa mik kiinnostaa mutta opiskelu ei taas kiinnosta. Toisaalta yhteiskunta vaatii ett jotkin paperit pitisi olla. Moni tuntuu opiskelevan vain senkin takia ett jotain on pakko tehd. Opiskelua ei voi kuitenkaan jtt kesken koska kukaan ei halua tehd "paskaduuneja" ja toisaalta p riitt pidemmlle. Moni tuntuukin elvn viel lukio aikojen "teen tt koska en tied parempaakaan" vaihetta, miss opiskelu on vain helpoin vaihtoehto.   Kyll minkin ruuat teen isoissa eriss ja katson tarjoukset. Oma pakastin on aika kova juttu, samoin ne ylimrset hirven lihat yms. Suunnitelemaan joutuu vhn ylimrst.   No ainakin itse pystyn tekemn ruokaa alle tuon 2,6e jos teen itse. Tosin kytn psntisesti opiskelijaravintolaita koska ruualaitto ei jaksa aina kiinnostaa. Tosin aika harvalla kmppiksellkn on ollu elmntapa taidot hallussa. (ruuuanlaitto, siivous, pyykkys, talous) Joten en yhtn ihmettele jos kaikki eivt prj.   Tuossa on nyt kyll vhn tulkintaa mukana.   "Opiskelijoista 71 % oli tehnyt kokopivtit viimeksi kuluneen vuoden aikana.Viidennes oli tyskennellyt 46 kuukautta ja lhes viidennes yli puoli vuotta, joten osa kokopivisest tyskentelyst tapahtuu lukuvuoden aikana."  Kyll minkin kyn kestiss ett voin taata oman toimeentuloni. Toisaalta tein tit koulun ohellakin koska opiskelu ei jaksanut kiinnostaa.  Parempi selitys on mielestni kiinnostus..  "Opiskeluinto-mittarissa kysyttiin, onko opiskelu vastaajalle hyvin merkityksellist. Samaa mielt vittmst oli 44 % opiskelijoista ja selkesti innostuneisuutta koki 28 %. Neljnnes opiskelijoista inspiroitui opiskelusta, mutta energisyytt opiskelussa koki vain joka kymmenes."   Ne tukikuukaudet loppuu kesken koska jokainen tekee sen 45op kun pitisi tehd 60op vuodessa. Tuo 45op tulee taas siit ett se on minimi sille ett saa tydet tuet.   Toisella asteellahan saa ruokaa ihan koulustakin. Yliopistolla se on 2,6e ateria ja jos ky symss joka piv (mys viikonloput) on se noin 78e/kk. Tuohon omat srsselit ni se vhn plle satanane menee. Ei sill ketsupilla ja makaroonilla tarvi el, itte tekemll sst.   Aika moni ainakin omassa opiskelijapiiriss syyn niit opintokuukausia juuri sen opintotuen takia, eli 5,5op tukikuukautta kohden. Se ett tuki tulisi joka tapauksessa ei ainakaan nopeuttaisi sit.   No se edellyttisi sit ett keskurssien tarjonta kasvaisi ja ett kesll voisi suorittaa mys pakollisia kursseja.  Edit: Se mys edelytt sit ett perustulo on suhteessa suurempi kuin opintotuki ett se kattaa mys muut kulut kuin asumisen ja ruuan.   Ei opiskelijan kuulu el herroiksi. Nykyinen opintotuki kattaa ainakin itsellni ja kaikilla tutuillani asumisen ja ruuan, muuta ei opiskeluun tarvita. Se ett kituttaa sen muutaman vuoden ei ole mielestni kohtuutonta varsinkaan kun saa ilmaisen yllpidon ja koulutuksen.   Kukaan niin vittnytkn. Mutta se ett opiskelut venyvt entisestn perustulon takia ei ole hyv asia.   Tuki 450e, vuokra 300e, 150e josta puhelin (n 10e), ruoka ja liikkuminen (n 50e). Se ett juhliiko tuolla kyll riippuu siit syk nuudeleita vai juoko pussikaljaa. Kaikki muut kulut meneekin sitten sstist. Ja jossei ole sstj tai kesll tit niin kyll aika moni niukoilla on. Jostakin ne vaatteet ja sairaskulutkin on maksettava.   Olisivat oikeutettu siihen samaan perustuloon kuin kaikki muutkin. Ja perustulon pitisi kattaa vain asuminen ja ruoka.   Nyt opiskelijat joutuvat valmistumaan jotenkin jrkevss ajassa koska tukikuukaudet loppuu. Tm perustulo ei pakota valmistumaan koskaan.   Nyt en kyl tied oliko tm sarkasmia vai ei. Itseltni ei kyll pahemmin empatiaa tykyvyttmille liikene, jossei ole rajaavammainen.    cat knows who is the true boss  That comment karma goes up and down like roller coaster. Doge people try to fight back hard, stay strong my fellow cat people!   I only accept swedish king if it is pewdiepie   cat knows who is the true boss   Tulin sanomaan samaa!   Not sure if OP is idiot or just working in Russian propaganda deparment.   Nykyisill menetelmillhn on oikeastaan kaksi vaihtoehtoa. Ensimmisess nestjn "lippu" kryptataan ja tiedetn kenen lippu on kyseess mutta ei tiedet mit nesti. Tai sitten pidetn erillist kirjaa siit kuka nesti ja toista siit ket nestettiin. Kummassakin on kaksi pahaa ongelmaa.   Ensimmisess pit jossain vaiheessa purkaa nestjn kryptaus niin ett tiedetn ket nestettiin. Toisessa vaihtoehdossa ongelma on kuitenkin viel pahemin eli joku voi kokonaan vaihtaa nestys liput jolloin demokratia krsii.   Itse valitsisin ensimmisen vaihtoehdon, mutta muutamalla ehdolla. Jokasella vaalipaikalla olisi oma kryptaus avainpari jolla nestykset kryptattaisiin. Samalla jokaisessa vaalipaikassa tehtisiin nten laskenta valvotusti niin ett kryptatut nestyliput avataan mutta nestjien nimi ei ne. Tmn jlkeen salausavain tuhotaan.   Ei se shkistminen tarkoita sen vaalisalaisuuden hylkmist, mutta sen toteuttaminen on hankalaa. Ymmrtkseni thn on jo jonkinlainen jrkev ratkaisu olemassa kryptologian puolelta. Siin kryptatuilla entitiyill voidaan toteuttaa matemaattisia laskuja niin ett kryptausta ei pureta. Tll menetelmll vaalipiirit voisivat olla yksittisi kryptattuja entityj joilta voidaan kysy ket ne nestivt. Tm teknologia on kuitenkin vasta tulossa.

Suurimmat ongelmat shkisen nestyksen suhteen ovat yksiln vaalisalaisuuden silyttminen ja se vaara siit ett jrjestelmss on aukoja joilla tuloksia voidaan manipuloida.

Enk jaksa uskoa ett suomalaisten koulukirjojen osalta tapahtuu suurta kilpailua. Itse nkisin jrjestelmn jossa opettajat luovat kaiken opetusmateriaalin yhteiseen jrjestelmn. Jrjestelm olisi taas ilmainen kaikille. Lisksi jrjestelmn kautta tulevat sstt voitaisiin ohjata osittain opettajien palkkoihin ja mahdollisesti palkita parhaita opetusmateriaalien tekijit. Mielestni opetusmateriaalin kuuluu olla kaikille ilmaista niinkuin kaiken koulutuksenkin.   Taidat tss ajatella asian lhinn kirjan tekemisen kannalta. Miksi materiaalin pitisi olla yksi ainut materiaali/kirja? Miksei se voisi olla isompi kokonaisuus josta jokainen opettaja voisi kert omaan opetukseen sopivan kokonaisuuden? ja jos mieleist materiaalia ei ole voisi opettaja sen itse tarvittaessa list? jolloin se tulee automaattisesti muiden opettajien kyttn.   Ihan kuin sen pitisi olla jotenkin yksittinen taho joka sen materiaalin tuottaa? Miksei se malli voisi olla esimerkiksi samanlainen kuin avoimenlhdekoodin projekteissa jossa kuka tahansa voi osallistua.    Oikeastaan ehdotuksesi tarkoittaa, ett oppimateriaalien tuotanto siirretn valtion tehtvksi ja kilpailua oppimateriaalien osalta ei olisi.  Kuka sanoi ett se on valtio joka sit materiaalia tekee? Suurinosahan nykyisist kustannuksista menee kustantajien taskuun.    Ei kenties olisi tehokkain, mutta toimiva DDOS hykkyksiss ja tieteellisess tiedonlaskennassa.  Mihin suomen valtio tarvitsee DDOS hykkyksi? Tieteelliseen lasketaan on huomattavasti fiksumpia ratkaisuja kuin peruskone bottiverkot ja jotka ovat huomattavasti tehokkaampia.   Shkst kai lmmksi se suurin osa muuttuu? Ilmaista energiaa joka kotiin, Suomi on kylm suurimman osan vuodesta. Vai?  Shk edelleen maksaa ja se ett aletaan lmmitt tietokoneilla ei ole milln tapaa kustannustehokasta.   No ensinnksin sen ohjelman pitisi olla suosittu ett sill olisi kyttji. Sen pitisi olla sellainen peli miss tllisen datan ksittely olisi loogista ja tuntuisi kuuluvan osaksi peli. Lisksi mik pakottaisi kyttjien tekemn nm asiat oikein? Miksei joku vaan tekisi asiat pin vittua ihan vaan koska voi? Ja yksikin esimerkki sellaisesta kelan toimminasta joka on vaan "tavun ksittely". Jos asiat olisi vain tavun ksittely miksi siihen tarvitaan ihminen? kun sen voi hoitaa tietokoneella.     Olisi yhteinen laite jolla olisi helppo opettaa kaikkea mit haluat. Ohjelmat voisivat seurata mukana.  Kyll niill nykyisill laitteilla voidaan tehd ihan samat asiat.   Shkoiset palvelut ja monet muut asiat (joihin viel ihmist tarvitaan) voitaisiin tuottaa taasen kerran hajottamalla KELAlle (tms.) menev data osiin ja sijoittamalla se peleihin joita pelaamalla voisi kansalainen tienata rahaa.  Ensinnksin kukaan peli kehittj ei lhde tlliseen mukaan ilman taloudellista intressi. Toisekseen tm ei tule koskaan tapahtumaan yksityisyydensuojan takia.    Ja miksi halaumme tehd nin? Koska voimme rakentaa kevyemmn yhteiskunta rakenteen niin byrokratian kuin verotuksen suhteen. Paremmat shkiset palvelut vhentvt tarvetta erillisille konttoroille. Ja jos haluamme pit yll suomalaista elintasoa on meidn satsattava korkeakoulukseen ja teknologiaan koska hikipajoilla emme prj.   Koulutuksen menoja voitaisiin esim karsia niin ett kaikki opetusmateriaali olisi ilmaisesti tarjolla. Sen sijaan ett opiskelijoille jaettaisiin joka vuosi uusia kirjoja saisi opiskelija e-readerit. Lisksi tm parantaisi opetusmateriaalien laatua ja tasapistisi opetusta koska kaikilla olisi sama opetusmateriaali kytss. Opettajille voitaisiin maksaa korvauksia tmn opetusmateriaalin luonnista.   Yksikn valtio ei tule "teknologian suurvallaksi" sill ett jokaiseen kotiin tulee valtion maksama tietokone.   Yleinen ksitys "teknonologia yhteiskunnasta" lienee se ett suurinosa palveluista on saatavilla shkisesti. Sen lisksi voidaan puhua yleisest teknologisesta koulutuksen tasosta ja erilaisten teknologia yrityksen olemassaolosta.   Shkinen asiointi on parantunut huomattavasti, en ole kynyt kelassa kuin ehk kerran tai kaksi elessni. Parannettavaa on kuitenkin. Suurin este tlle kehitykselle lienee kuitenkin niden palveluiden hankinta. Projektit venyy ja rahaa palaa. Miss vika?   Yleinen teknologia koulutuksen taso ja erilaisten teknologia yritysten kasvu ja synty ovat yhteydess toisiinsa. Matematiikkaa ja englannin koulutusta pitisi kasvattaa. Lisksi ohjelmointia pitisi alkaa opettaa jo alakouluissa. Nin saadaan ihmisi jotka voivat kytt ohjelmoinnin perustaitotoja ihan miss tahansa tyss. Ohjelmointi on ongelmien ratkaisua tietokoneella ei pelkkn ohjelmistokehityst. Tm antaisi mys hyvt mahdollisuudet teknologia teollisuudelle menesty suomessa.   Lisksi se ett erilaiset valtiolliset ja kunnalliset tahot jakavat avointadataa on hyv asia. Avoindata mahdollistaa sen ett kuka tahansa voi tehd yhteiskuntaa hydyntvn sovelluksen ja mahdollisesti joka tyllist itsens.   Ei se kyll siit laitteesta ole kiinni.   Lhes jokasessa kodissa on tietokone. Lisksi tietokoneet vanhenee noi 3 vuoden sisll. Supertietokone ratkaisuja on jo olemassa ja pytkoneet ei ole se ratkaisu. Bitcoin mainaus ei mysk ole ilmaista, se vaatii shk.   Meill on jo kaikki tm? Mitkhn tss nyt oikeen haetaan takaa, valtiollista kyttys elint?

Gary is such a sad story. There were 180,000 people in Gary 50 years ago. Now there might be 75,000. About 50% of their kids are graduating from high school. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate.   no argument about that. so I'll just be a good Cubs fan, roll over and cry about how a Sox fan was mean to me again.   True.

I do remember going here on a field trip though. Some girl passed out because it was 95 degrees  in there. My teacher hated Hemingway, and later apologized for the trip being a part of the curriculum. There was a guy who was about 100 giving the tour, and I think his name was Jim Christmas. He was pretty hilarious.  For what it's worth, visit the Hemingway foundation across the street. There are some cool samples of his writing from way back, including a description of a football game that he wrote in 9th Grade at OPRF. Hemingway got an F on it.   Wait, how can people take a tour of "murder castle" if the building was destroyed long ago? I'm almost certain that the post office in Englewood occupies it's space today.      It's clearly a hybrid.

As long as it is structured and serves a purpose. 20 minutes per week of reading current news stories and listening to music is a way I reward students if they meet the expectation. (All assignments attempted, no behavior referrals, no excessive tardies, etc.)   Also hype up your incentives. Once a month, I'll raffle a Chipotle/Subway gift card to a student who has no missing assignments, no behavior referrals, and less than two tardies.    [Hey, man.

I know that I'm not in the right country, but Borat is the only person I can picture behind the wheel.   Please show this gentleman the door.    I think the rivalry should get hyped with the Jets too. You've got 3 ex-hawks (Frolik, Ladd,   Byfuglien) + playing in Toews's hometown. Should be a recipe for some exciting hockey.    	61
 SINCE A COUPLE OF DAYS I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING MY FUCKING BEST IN LIFE. EACH NIGHT WHEN I SLEEP THERE IS A VACUUM INSIDE MY DISSATISFIED HEART SOMEWHERE. IT GIVES ME THE FEELING OF VAGUE REGRET. IT'S A WARNING SIGN THAT SAYS THERE IS SOMETHING FUCKING WRONG WITH HOW I'M INVESTING TIME IN LIFE.  I KNOW I WILL BOUNCE BACK. BUT I DON'T FUCKING LIKE TO KEEP BOUNCING BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD FEELINGS SO GODDAMN FREQUENTLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THE PRICE OF A STOCK ON THE SHAREMARKET.. I WANT TO BE FUCKING CONSISTENT IN MY PLANS AND LIVING.   CONSISTENCY IS FUCKING NECESSARY TO ME FOR WHAT I TOOK UP TO ACHIEVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M FUCKING TIRED OF TRYING TO BOUNCE BACK EVERY TIME I FEEL LIKE THIS.  THIS QUOTE IS APT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME RIGHT NOW:  **"IF YOU'RE TIRED OF STARTING OVER, STOP GIVING UP."**    trending on the front page of Reddit.. that's what you're doing with your life... Pretty awesome if you ask me!   No. Harry is the only survivor on whom the killing curse is *performed*.. so technically Voldemort can't be called as a survivor as he wasn't *performed* the curse upon, and moreover he wasn't a survivor at all... He disappeared at that moment.. and was almost dead... so no he did not survive.. he yielded to its effect.      Oh my god.. such a great advice... thank you so much!   when something cool like this quote comes up, the nonsense and the so called "funny" comments really ruin the fun out of it....    this pic is visually very fascinating..   MEDIOCRITY IS THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING WORD I FACED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE THAT HAS PUT ME WHERE I AM TODAY. BUT I SEE THE SILVER LINING IN ALL OF IT. THANK YOU, MEDIOCRITY. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.         GREETINGS FROM INDIA.. ALL THE VERY DAMN BEST FOR THE GREAT AWESOMENESS AHEAD, BROTHER!   NAMASTE :)   THIS YEAR I TOOK UP THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY LIFE. SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH HIGHER EDUCATION.. A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM AT WHICH I WANT TO DO VERY WELL, LIKE REALLY VERY WELL, LIKE FUCKING AWESOMELY WELL...   I AM TRYING TO STRICTLY WORK TOWARDS IT. TODAY I TRIED TO STRATEGISE MY PREPERATION FOR THIS MONTH. (AND ALSO I HAVE A DAY JOB SO I GOT TO MAKE TIME TO STUDY EVERYDAY AFTER THE WORKING HOURS..) IT'S 2AM IN MY COUNTRY'S TIMEZONE NOW. I'VE BEEN STUDYING ALL ALONG SINCE 10.30PM. AND I'M GOING TO STUDY SOME MORE NOW.. THIS EXAM IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.. (I NEED TO STICK TO THIS TYPE OF HARD WORK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND MORE.. LET'S SEE!)        Thanks for the translated post. It's amazing.. What is the title of the book in English?   YEAH.. HOW WE USE OUR TIME CAN BE A REAL BIG DEAL IN LIFE. BY THE WAY, IF YOU CAN, COME AROUND SOMEDAY AND SHARE SOME OF THE COOL SHIT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE.. WOULD SURELY HELP OTHERS IN GETTING IDEAS!   GOOD LUCK   YES I DID... BUT TIME AND AGAIN COMING BACK HERE TO HELP OTHERS BY TELLING WHAT GOOD STUFF YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE WOULD BE OF A KICK FOR ALL. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WASTE TIME ON THE INTERNET, BUT JUST ASKING TO KEEP THIS MOTIVATING SUB OF OURS ALIVE.. IF YOU THINK THAT IS A TIME WASTE, THEN YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN REAL LIFE WITHOUT WASTING TIME ON THE INTERNET.   NO HARD FEELINGS, BROTHER!  ALL THE GODDAMN BEST FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN YOUR LIFE :)   I did not understand this quote!   AWESOME FEAT BROTHER. LET ME TELL YOU.. YOU DID GREAT, MOTIVATING THE FUCK OUT OF YOURSELF BUT WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THE 4TH DAY. WHEN YOU STEPPED OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD AND STARTED TO BACKFLIP WITHOUT THAT SOFT BED TO BACK YOU, I REMEMBERED THE DIALOGUE FROM *THE DARK KNIGHT RISES* : **"DO IT LIKE THE CHILD DID. WITHOUT THE ROPE"**  AND YOU DID IT, LIKE BATMAN.  CHEERS, BROTHER!   LIKE I FUCKING MENTIONED ALREADY IN THE TITLE THIS SUB IS A REAL GODDAMN NERVE TREMBLING GROUND. THE WORLD OUT THERE THINKS WE ARE LOSERS. WITH ALL THE MIGHT IN OUR MINDS WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT ANY BIT TRUE. BUT THIS SUB SEEMS LIKE IT IS PERFORMING VERY MEDIOCRE. NO POSTS FOR DAYS AT A STRETCH. I FUCKING DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT IS SO.   **ARE WE FUCKING AFRAID TO SHARE WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING IN OUR GODDAMN LIVES?**  **ARE WE FUCKING SHY TO RISE FROM THE AHSES AND BE THE PHOENIXES THAT WE ARE?**  WHAT THE HELL IS STOPPING US FROM COMING AND CONNECTING WITH THE LOVELY BROTHERHOOD AND SHARE SOME FUCKING MOTIVATION?  OK... ENOUGH RANT.. NOW, BORROWING THE WORDS FROM GANDHI, I WOULD RATHER BE THE CHANGE I WANT TO SEE IN THE GODDAMN WORLD AROUND ME. SO I'M GOING TO MAKE POSTS HERE REGULARLY.   I DON'T KNOW IF ANY BUTTHOLE OUT THERE IS LISTENING TO THIS BUT I REALLY WANT US TO BE GODDAMN WINNERS IN OUR CHOSEN ASPECTS OF LIFE, WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY MAY BE. AND I DON'T WANT THIS SUB TO BE A STAGNANT FUCKING POND, RATHER I WANT IT TO BE THE BLOOD IN OUR BODIES, ALWAYS FLOWING AND KEEPING US FUCKING ALIVE.  **ALIVE, MOTHERFUCKERS. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE ON THE INTERNET?**  THEN FUCKING PROVE IT!     SOMETIMES IN LIFE FOR THE FUCK'S SAKE YOU GOT TO DO THE THINGS SOLELY FOR YOURSELF. YOU GOT TO FEED YOUR FUCKING SOUL WITH SOMETHING EXTREMELY DELICIOUS, WITH SOMETHING THAT IT CRAVES FOR SEVERELY. IF YOU EVER GO THROUGH SUCH A TIME, DO REMEMBER TO STOP THE FUCK AND REFLECT ON THAT JEWEL OF A MOMENT, BECAUSE IT HOLDS THE MOTHERFUCKING KEY TO THE MOTHERFUCKING DOOR WHICH OPENS UP TO SOMETHING THAT IS BUILT PURELY FOR YOU ALONE IN THIS ENTIRE UNIVERSE. I MEAN, ASK YOURSELF HOW FUCKING SAD WOULD IT BE TO GODDAMN MISS SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT!   That's a nice idea... but I'm so keenly attached towards the actual last name, *Dumbledore.*  He is an epitome of all the things from the Harry Potter series that defined my life.    YES. A GODDAMN YES FOR THIS POST.  WE ARE ALL GONNA MOTIVATE THE FUCK OUT OF EACHOTHER. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. LET'S JUST FUCKING ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES ONCE AND FOR ALL.   *AIMING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS SEEMINGLY UNATTAINABLE AND YET CONFIDENTLY WORKING TO ACHIEVE IT WITH ALL THE PASSION AND MIGHT HIDDEN INSIDE THE NERVES OF YOUR INSANELY BEAUTIFUL MIND IS WHAT I CALL THE FUCKING PURPOSE OF A GODDAMN HUMAN LIFE.* **SO LET'S DO THIS!**    I'm starting to think that real life is my pseudonym  That sounds like a very well put opening sentence right there, pal :)   Oh.. that's a big bad news for me :-(  Let's say I want to use *Dumbledore* as my surname.. Then what? Should I be asking J.K. Rowling for permission?? (*I wish the answer is 'No'*)   And also let me please ask you one more doubt of mine regarding pennames:   *Is it ok to adopt a part of my favourite fictional character's name into my penname? Or should I be approved by character's creator (author) for doing that?*   Is this a digital image?? Which software was it created it?? I just would like to recommend it to my animator/3D modeler friend.   I logged in to upvote this post.   Ok.. Sounds cool and legit. Thanks :)   Yeah.. That really makes sense. Thanks.    one reason is to restart a career  Thanks for the information.. Didn't knew this before.    The idea of your book is really interesting to me... Especailly the prot realizing that he doesn't know anything.. Greetings for coming up with something like that .. And all the very best for it get good publishers.. and when it happens do plz message me a link where I can buy it.. Amazon probably.. I'm from India. I would like to read your book, pal, assuming that it's not very very long ;-)   Thanks :)   Great idea.. and it's most of the times true in my case as well. Music has myriad times influenced my mood to write.. It moved me so much that I once immediately started to write a poetic piece, which I felt as my best work yet. (It's a heartfelt message to my girlfriend while I was in college.)  Most of the times it is film sound tracks.. Hans Zimmer, especially.. I'm from India, so I would like to more names to it: A.R.Rahman, Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Amit Trivedi etc.. These people's music had influenced my thought process many times and pushed me towards writing something refreshing, which I didn't have in mind moment prior to listening to their music..  However, I don't everytime get influenced by music alone in order to put my thoughts to words. No body should, because it will make you feel dependant on it. That's not how creativity shold work always.   What if I want to write books with another name but tell out that it's actually me? Is that against the accepted norms in the Writing arena?  Just asking.    The same thing happened when I read "The old man and the sea" :/  Greetings, pal. I too felt *The Old Man* by Hemingway to be so boring. Thank God it was very small, so I was able to finish it off, just for the heck of it..      Yeah.. I'm into Part II of the book and got really put off all along....   Thanks for the precaution.. shall never touch it.   Thanks... but I don't like Hunger Games either.... I hated the concept shown in the film...   Let me ask: what kind of an idiot helps a person who he met only days ago, and assists him in killing a person, or rather commit the murder himself?? I mean, there was nothing where he questions Raymond what is the real matter behind all those Arabs following him and why is he carrying a revolver. He always agrees for whatever Raymond asks for, not just about partying out, but also in hurting and killing somebody. What is existentialism? Is it straight ahead killing somebody whom you think is trying to harm you? Why did nobody, neither the protagonist nor Raymond, ever tried to speak it out with the Arabs before using the weapon, guys?? What kind of *ism* is that??   I just realized from comments here that the book is about *nothingness* in particular - and unfortunately I don't like nothingness - the only nothingness I ever liked is the vacuum in the cosmos.    not a bug, a feature.  I like the way you put it :)   I'm 24 and not at all in high school right now.. and also am from India.   Right now I'm thinking to stop reading *The Stranger* by Albert Camus...    I have been trying to read one book per week this year.. so this week i picked up *The Stranger* by Albert Camus, looking at its classic status, and also because it is a small book (I like small books). I've enterted into the Part II of the book just now, and all along Part I the book seemed to be having no soul or story - it just went on and on randomly to here and there - with characters that came up having no good depth.. and also the narration is pretty dull. I guess this is the book in a long time that I read half without finding a single quote to highlight.    never heard of it... will surely check it out.. thank you so much..    I DECIDED TO WORK LIKE HELL FOR THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY LIFE, A CHALLENGE THAT I TOOK UP AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, BUT I HAD BEEN AN ASSHOLE (ALTHOUGH NOT COMPLETELY, BROTHERS) AND DIDN'T PUT GOOD POTENTIAL INTO IT YET. THIS ENRAGED ME.. BUT NEVERTHELESS IN THIS MONTH I LOOKED AT THE PITFALLS IN MY PATH. AND LET ME CONFIDENTALY TELL YOU ALL BUTTHEADS THIS: *I AM NOW BETTER SHEILDED AGAINST THOSE PITFALLS, GODDAMNIT. I WILL FUCKING USE THEM AGAINST THE STORM AND WILL SWIM FORWARD, UPSTREAM. I WILL WORK LIKE FUCK I'VE NEVER SEEN IN MYSELF BEFORE. I WILL FUCKING SURPRISE MYSELF WITH MY POTENTIAL*   AND LET ME ALSO TELL YOU THIS, MOTHERFUCKERS -  I LIKE THIS SUB VERY GODDAMN MUCH - BUT AT TIMES IT IS VERY PUTTING OFF TO COME HERE AND FINDING OUT THAT THE MOST RECENT POST WAS DAYS FUCKING OLD..   **OLD WON'T DO, LET'S ALL BE NEW..**  **EVERY FUCKIN DAY, IN EVERY FUCKIN WAY..**  *[THAT'S FROM THE POET IN ME, WHICH IS WHY THE HELL IT EVEN RHYMED.. ]*   YES. THOSE ARE SOME REALLY GODDAMN GOOD WORDS. THANKS, FRIEND!   I'll just be candid. I'm trying to develop an idea that I felt interested in for writing my first novel. I can say that the idea I'm taking up deals with the existence of parallel universes.. Can somebody please suggest me some good books that will help me know about Parallel Worlds and Universes??   Fiction or Non-Fiction, or even poetry, whatever works you think would be helpful for me, please suggest them.  Thank you all so much :)   This AMA has some really good questions and answers for artists, and people looking towards passions and dreams... That itself made me click the Save button and upvote this post.   Thanks for giving me a new goal in life.... I will collect all those books for myself.. and yeah by the way, I'm gonna share this pic on my Hogwarts group on Facebook. I shall link this URL there in order to credit you. Thank you so much, pal :D   I can not just pass by any *Thoreau* related posts without upvoting/commenting it..    meh..   Yes.. possibly....   did not understand... it sounded gramatically wrong as well...   awesome pal... very motivating one!   Hey, OP, plz tell - is this quote from a book or something??  What's the source??   no doubt..   Oh it is.... especially the last five words    we travel between the eternities.   Source plz... the writer of this quote deserves it...   Yeah.. why not.. Positive thinking/attitude has proven multiple times that it can make great changes in the world.. and in people's lives.. Although telekinesis would directly mean moving things physically, optimistic mindset also appears to do the same with the situations of life - it physically changes the circumstances of a person's life and makes him get what he desired. For example, **placebo effect**- the way people think and perceive a situation literally makes changes in the same.      I will never give out spoilers for anything.. I hate ruining any kind of experiences of people.. That being said, I felt The Giver as just ok because I don't enjoy dystopian novels very much.. They just feel very depressing. I'm not good with the books that give out such feeling.. I even disliked *1984* by George Orwell especially for this reason, while I loved his *Animal Farm*.  Talking particularly about *The Giver* the narration seemed a bit different and most of the times very straight not bothering about exploring the feelings of characters in depth, although it helped in keeping the book short, which I like.   So, you might completely enjoy the book if you're fine with dystopian concepts - it's a good book for those who enjoy such setting.      Very cogently put!    Finished Book #1 yesterday and just finished this book (#2) today.  I always wonder why people here remind me again and again that I read so fuckin' slowly :(==   Steve Jobs book is awesome.... and hey thanks for reminding me to read *Business Adventures*   It felt just ok for me...     i suspect it will consume the next 1-2 weeks of my life atleast,  800 plus pages and you finish it in just a couple of weeks?? amazing!!  TIL again that I read dead slow.. Thanks for reminding me that!   **Zen Mind Beginner's Mind, by Shunryu Suzuki** - an introduciton and a peep into the practices of Zen Buddhism.  Finished reading:  * **Steppenwolf, by Herman Hesse** - an intriguing story of a lone person who comes to experience mulitple facets of his life by meeting a few persons in a new city that he moved into.  * **Carrie, by Stephen King**  - the debut novel of the outstanding author.. nuff said.   Your art work is very very awe-inspiring... You will reach great heights in life :-)  Thank you so much for sharing it here...   Hey really thanks man for those words....!!!   Helpful.. Thanks... The book is really tricky ;-)   This is really awesome.... Thanks :-)    HE KNOW WHO HE IS.  HE FUCKIN KNOWS WHO HE IS - 'KNOWS' - NOT 'KNOW' - USE THE GODDAMN GRAMMAR FUCKIN CORRECTLY YOU GOOD FRIEND OF A BIRTHDAY BOY.    Your response is helpful.. Thanks :-)   Bodh Gaya, India - said to be the place where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment!   I'm reading Shunryu Suzuki's *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.* In Part 2 of the book I encountered this paragraph:  *Practice should be directed from achievement to non-achievement. Usually when you do something, you want to achieve something, you attach to some result. From achievement to non-achievement means to be rid of the unneccesary and bad results of effort. If you do something in the spirit of non-achivement, there is a good quality in it. So just to do something without any particular effort is enough.*  But, let's say I'm preparing for a National level entrance exam that would put me into a great college for higher education. So, I will surely be attached towards a result - to get into the top college in the country. But that paragraph speaks against it.  Am I looking at it the wrong way? What would be the actual interpretation of that paragraph in this scenario?    Thanks a lot, pal, for giving the source....   How enriching...!!   Nailed it.   Nice language usage.. and good point too...   I often wonder how much time people waste by talking shit in Reddit comments.. and how much more by reading them. Would be good if somebody comes up with such an analytical post on r/InternetIsBeautiful or somewhere!!   It's often surprising how, while great minds like Newton, Einstein and etc., that discovered the science of the universe as we know it, are naturally humble to the inexplicable mysteries of the world around them, some of our so called *modern scientists* all boast up as if science can explain anything and everything, as if nothing in this world is a wonder or a miracle, as if everything can be put to scientific explanation.   THIS.IS.SOME.KICK-ASS.STUFF.   What you said is seems true... I just saw a comment here for my post from a person and he really misinterpreted it.    Translation: It doesn't matter which way you go, if you don't have a direction in mind  I'm sorry to put it like this but I'm 100% positive that this is not it.. Your translation speaks of negativity of mind and thought.. But the point in the book where the paragraph came up is not in least bit relevant to what you said. Anyways, thank you for the response.   From Part 1:  *A Zen master once said, "To go eastward one mile is to go westward one mile." This is vital freedom. We should acquire this kind of perfect freedom.*  I didn't understand the metaphor. Can somebody please guide me through it??   But it's 600 pages (short books?? :O ) ah.. I don't normally consider such a pagecount as short by any means. Thanks anyways, pal :) :)   Hey, thank you so much for the suggestion.. I picked up Steppenwolf.. the first book i finished in 2015.. it was very good.. in a way i liked it than Siddhartha.. Thanks a lot :)  Do you know of any other books that have such internal voice that speak of life like Steppenwolf did?? If so, plz tell me..   12th January (i.e, today) is Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary and this day is observed as *National Youth Day* in my country, India. He's one of the greatest souls ever lived on this planet, and his teachings are a vibrant inspiration for many.   I would be interested in the word count of Stephen King.. he sure seems like a writing machine to me... with at least two books quietly coming out each year.... He's *something*!   I logged in so that I can upvote this quote..   Because that's what's on your goddamn mind, pal!   This one sentence is the entirety of **Zen**!   Yeah.. Mr. Twain is that great!   the video is blocked at my work-place... will check it out once i reach my room. Thanks a lot..    If you're going into the places with lot of natural touch, then I recommend the essay [*Nature*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29433/29433-h/29433-h.htm) by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Read it and you will not look at the nature with the same perspective as before.   Yes I'd already read *Nature* by Emerson.. It was splendid, too. I've never before read something so beautiful about Nature. Very heart warming and soul enriching :)     this photograph deserves more... you should serisouly post this on r/pics.. it will explode :)   this is my all-time favourite of Thoreau's quotes.    going it alone can be tough  and can also be blissful.. trust me.. the kind of solitude you will experience while travelling and visiting places alone, in a way, such solitude can not be attained even by meditation. It is such. It can be enlightnening, but for that you need to retrsopect into your life and talk to your conscience.. Take some books with you that talk about nature and world around you, even such poetry would do.. Go, explore the solitary travels. Good Luck :)    In a way, this quote had helped be take up solo travelling in 2014..  *Henry David Thoreau* is my guru in some of the aspects of my life.   Indian here.. I have this doubt from a very long time: *Why is Justin Bieber trolled and hated so much in the internet world??* (I know I'm going to be downvoted just for asking this but I needed to ask.)   Oh yes.. Definitely. Thank you so much :)   Today I was listening to some podcast where the panel members mentioned that in the recent days there are many, many new planets that are being continuously discovered and that most of them are just gas planets. Listening to that I got this doubt:   *Considering the Big Bang theory, wasn't our Earth too a gas planet at its infancy, which later cooled down and developed into a full fledged life-supporting home? So, if those new planets are now designated as gas planets, doesn't that give way to the possibility of them turning into life suppoorting planets later on in the unvierse's eventual timeline, just like Earth did??*   Why in the world am I downvoted for thanking!!!!   Yeah that's a good idea.. In my country (India) a recent best selling book series called: *Shiva Trilogy* by Amish Tripati had a smiliar experience. The first book in the series was rejected by nearly 20 publishers.. and so he made a trailer of the book's concept and released it on Youtube.. and also released the first chapter. People liked and the buzz grew around it.. and eventually publishing companies came to him and published his book. Now, his trilogy is a massively famous book series in India. And I even heard that for his next book, which he hasn't even written, a publishing house already bought the rights in advance with a price of around 5 crore rupees..   So, yes just try putting a part of it infront of the people and see what happens.   I don't understand why publishers/editors reject a book even after thinking it's a good one. How can they decide that a book won't be liked by people when they didn't even publish it? I think they're the most judgemental people on the planet. Really sorry for your situation. But I'm sure something WILL turn up and your book WILL be published.. It's all about the time. Let it take the time it is asking for.. You will surely be rewarded worthily. I will give you an example..   *When I was doing masters, almost 80% of my class got recreuited from campus but among the other 20% was one of my best friends in the class.. he tried like all of us but he couldn't get through all that year. Eventaully when the college was over, he left without a job in hand unlike most of his classmates.. He needed a job desperately. He persevered another year, and on Dec 24th, 2013 he was recruited as a Banker by the biggest private bank in India. (Yeah, this is all from India). And his salary is higher than the average salary of the entire batch. Well, he waited and persevered, and he got better than what most people did.*  I believe in such things.. and now in your case also something makes me feel the same way. You will rise!    you are totally a reading elitist  I don't know if you ever heard of Chetan Bhagat.. He is India's best selling author.. and also the most criticized.. Well, I'm a great fan of him... Now, me being his fan, in my country if I say I'm an elitist, the actual elite people will beat me to hell. Believe me. If you don't, then google the criticism for Chetan Bhagat..   I'm not an elitist. Life is more enjoyable when you have a reading habit.. and having that habit I feel my life is better in terms of interestingness than a non-readers life. That's just my feeling, not an elitist way of looking at the world. If you still feel that way, then I'm sorry, pal. Keep hating me :)    [when Frodo left Middle Earth, never to return](/spoiler)  Hey, spoiler alert bro... People exist here, those who didn't yet read LOTR trilogy.. I'm myself one of them.   Thanks for the recommendation...     so you feel less guilty about being a smug brick  TIL that I'm a smug brick. Thanks :)  Apart from that, I said 'we' because a lot of our comments are misinterpreted. So, I just said that onbehalf of all those people.. But you are misinterpreting that too. How ironic!   Ok.. will pick it up.. Thanks.    I too would like to know what OP meant by "worthy".   By that what I meant is that a person who is reading something that *he* feels is interesting to him has the right to feel the work is worthy of investing his own time and concentration, no matter what other people think about it.. For example, many people criticise Dan Brown and Malcom Gladwell, but both are my favourite Fiction and Non-Fiction authors respectively. I feel their books are worthy of my time and thought.. That is all what I meant..   Happy that you found it interesting.. Thank you :)   I'm really sorry for my post made you feel that way.. the sole purpose of posting this quote here is.. i like quotes and i like books.. so this quote sounded like it really belongs here, just for people like me to read it.. and fortunately, for the first time in my Reddit life it worked and reached to many... That is all..    Roger that, captain.. Thanks for pointing it out.. Will really work on that..    Roger that, captain.. I removed the f-words from my comment. I like decent rules.. Thanks :)    A.J.Ayer would argue that pure religious talk is nonsense  It may be nonsense for him but surely not for the person that enjoys it.. Our enjoyment of knowledge intake should depend solely on our personal choices.. We have a goddamn right to do that irrespective of how A.J.Ayer or Wittgenstein or Hume or Plato or Socrates feel about it... Let's just use that right! (By the way, I like Plato and Socrates very much.. I just used their names as an example)    But that apparently means I'm not a reader.   Why do you infer that? Who the hell told you that, pal? Reading can be of any form. As long as whatever you read gives you more knowledge about someting worthy, you're a *reader*. Let nobody tell you otherwise, more importantly, you don't tell yourself otherwise!   Good work, bro! Let me upvote you now :)   Oh, brother, you just inferred a lot of brilliant but unnecessary shit which the quote doesn't even seem to imply.. I'm sorry that it hurt your feelings.. What you said about those countries and cultures might be true, I don't know.. That quote doesn't even in the least bit tell anything about non-readers.. I just posted this quote solely because it appeals to book readers.. I would do the same even if that quote came from goddamn Bermuda Triangle!    I don't really appreciate when people discriminate or think they are above others based on their hobbies, and that includes people who think less of people for not reading novels...  Yes.. I'm not being serious when I say I look down upon them.. I know so many damn interesting people who don't read but are fucikn interesting at their minds... That being said, I belive guess the quote only refers to those people that have the habit of reading and how they, and only they, feel when they don't read for long time.. It says nothing about those who don't read.. it's just our own inferring.   Deep down, I too feel the same way about those who don't read. Sorry, can't help.. It's so fuckin great feeling.   Well, that nails it!  	122

Thank you!   taking the rebel flag down is a good thing but ultimately ineffective b/c it's not going to fix gun control but it does give ppl a tangible outlet for them to focus their energy into and that's a pretty good distraction.      special treatment? http://i.imgur.com/iIOJ0X7.jpg  this dude shot 16 ppl. not trying to compare bad apples to bad apples but i don't think there is any special treatment going on. just look at all that white privilege.  if they did have have anything in common it's that they were both obnoxious baby-faced racist sociopaths who liked killing.

    I am wondering how he even learned of that.       I'm getting a bag of peanuts for it - nothing like peanuts for the circus, makes the dog and pony show all that more authentic.                     Ahhh, conservatives. Less than 1% of those on welfare are abusing the system - so they want to dismantle it.  Gun owners.Less than 1% use them to shoot others. Suddenly the right is all like "You can't judge all by the few! Most are good, law abiding patriotic Americans."      When I don't want to pay my bills I put them in a bag and leave them in the park as well. Hasn't worked yet, I still owe em all.      "People complain about 'muslim' on non-muslim crime and it gets all over the news, but what about american on american crime? How come that doesn't get talked about? Wonder how soon x/y/z will show up pimping how non-muslims are being discriminated against by muslims?"   Funny how all that sounds when you take what the right says about crimes involving blacks and apply it elsewhere.....               We might spend more on porn that politics, but the antacids we buy are because of politics.                           Do whites treat other whites poorly at times? Do they discriminate against other whites (like Irish, etc)?  Weird how this works. Some just assume all blacks see all other blacks as the same but when it comes to whites they don't expect that.   Does it help to be better represented when it comes to race, class, etc and so on? I would say it does. Does that automatically solve all the problems in the system? I would say it doesn't.  So you can have a legit gripe about being represented on X but that doesn't always lead to Y and Z.   The right only hears one thing when it comes to this issue.   That's cute. The idea is that government employees are abusing power (like the right complains about with Obama, but didn't with bush...weird. Anyway,) and have been doing so and getting away with it.  The justice system favors some over others. A point the people were protesting about. I don't think people were complaining that those who were abusing power were all white, but were all in a position of power.  Now...are blacks sentenced, arrested, charged, pulled over, etc in a disproportionate amount? If so - isn't that something worth looking at? Does it matter who does it?   Weren't white people (jews/pols/gays/etc) killed by other whites in ww2? Are you saying that if they complained they were being targeted that they had no case because they were all white?  Classicism, etc, are all real problems. But leave it to someone to ignorantly yell "There are some black cops, so all is ok! Git r done buddies!"   We need Issa and Gowdy on this, stat. 15 investigations and millions of dollars and we should know right around election time.         When people are used to being abused by cops - either unwarranted stops, searches, etc - they might just have a case for avoiding them quickly.   Waco and Ruby Ridge - why didn't people just obey the cops? Bundy Ranch - why didn't they guy just pay the fine, why did so many show up with guns?  The right seems to have no problem in justifying their distrust of government but when others do it they suddenly get all weird. You watch the protests? When cops were approaching many people ran - why didn't the cops just beat em and shoot em? Maybe because they knew it was wrong...when the cameras were rolling.   So that's how he works. "Well, this sounds like something I can use to bash someone, so I will just read it on air."  Wonder if he will follow up on it?  "Why, I am never wrong, I just read things as though it were factual from people who are wrong." And the right laps it up "We don't need to fact check anything, we believe it! Just like we believe Obama ordered a stand down at Benghazi!"   Maybe because he claims he is never wrong, and conservatives believe him. But then...they think fox is a legit new source.      *He was a victim of a system that is just waiting for an excuse to attack, and he gave the system that reason. If you poke a bear you should not be surprised if you are bitten*  And if you're caught speeding don't be surprised if a government employee beats you. I mean, after all, you gave them a reason to interact with you. Heck, the person pulled over has probably sped many times so they obviously have total disregard for the law.  By the way, what crime was he guilty of that they chased him down?      The blame I see has more than one facet.  The war on (some) drugs. Targeting areas, using tickets/etc as a revenue source, and so on.   As I said before, I can blame individuals and the system. I can't fix individuals, but we can work and fix the system and the people we pay to manage that system.  Not in favor of the riot side, but large protests and stuff do seem to get the message out. Think about the 60's and civil rights and vietnam.   That does not mean I can't try to understand why people do what they do (even if I don't agree with their actions). Simply dismissing things as people being hoods/thugs/etc is easy but ignores underlying causes.  It is like how the right says "Muslims over there in the middle east are bad, do bad things, and hate us fer our freedoms! Git R Done!" and don't stop to think for a minute about the causes behind some of the things - like us overthrowing their leaders, etc.  Simple minded people see simple minded solutions. They usually watch fox and listen to rush who play to that.         He's doing better than that Pizza place in Indiana :)   So many things work well in theory that don't in reality.  Let's look at ole bush. Torture happens, he skates. Cheney shoots some guy in the face, meh.   Big companies screw the country and get bailouts. Companies contribute to deaths, basically steal from people, etc and pay a small fine.  All things people have exposed and the justice system ignores. What was is the conservatives have been saying since 2008? Something about the tree of liberty, etc....  You think the people in Ferguson hadn't been trying to make changes for years? It took the protests to get real reports on the corruption and change to start.  The people in power (and those with money) have to have the will to change things. They get lazy and comfortable until some things wake them up.  Ferguson and Baltimore both got people talking about issues they generally ignore - which is weird because we have so many 24x7 news stations. Politicians can get elected and try to do something, but then party politics take over and legislation and funding go nowhere.         That made no sense.  *So why was this kid, and so many others, happy to give the corrupt police a reason to screw them?*  Your saying that corrupt cops needs chances/reason to act corrupt and then blame the victim for not avoiding them? So...if you go 5 mph over the speed limit and a cop stops you and beats the crap out of you then you are at fault? Hunh. Weird.  Sounds like conservative style thinking about an issue. "Why, if them folks in Iraq had kicked out Saddam like we wanted, we wouldn't have had to bomb em up real good!"   *"Not one of the officers involved in this tragic situation left home in the morning with the anticipation that someone with whom they interacted would not go home that night,"*  Yeah, I am sure just about every criminal can claim the same. Funny how these people don't care about police abuse of power, people getting charged with 'resisting', ticketed for filming cops or being harassed by them, etc.  Now, suddenly, they want people to stop and think about things.  Suck when you get treated how you treat others, don't it.   Conservatives see the people as the problem. Liberals see both the people and the system as having flaws.   You can't fix a problem you don't believe exists.   I am not interested in individuals and their personal problems - from what crimes they have done to anything else.  People in government with power that abuse it, though, is something we should care about and can do something about. We pay them, they work for us.   Cops are to protect/serve. When cops fail at that we should come down on them for failing to do their job. I would think conservatives would be all for that.  When you have a system that is a mess we should be outraged. The justice system screws over people daily. That is part of why the US has more people in prison than other countries. People on the right tend not to pay attention to this (in fact, they see a way to make money from it with private prisons/etc).  Their usual solutions are things like "get a job", "more prayer in schools" and so on. All because those things require no thinking. The deep issues that exist get glossed over and ignored in favor of what people see in a rather twisted light "I haven't been arrested, beaten, screwed over by the system - so you can avoid it to if you act like me!"  And what that is your solution - you haven't seen the real problem at all.   And countries like Norway and Sweden have a lot more social safety nets....so what are you saying?  Disparities in justice system by people abusing their power has nothing to do with the citizens and what benefits they get.                 You keep saying "dem/republican".  There are plenty of people in both parties who lean conservative or liberal on some issues. I am talking about core values - not party.  *I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.*  As a former LEO I can tell you that is, indeed, a problem. That problem gets exacerbated by the the entire justice system - but yes, it starts with the cops IMHO (not always).  When people in a certain area are targeted for enforcement than in other areas you get a lot more 'crime' suddenly. Jay walking, riding a bike with no helmet, 'speeding/distracted driving/rolling stops' etc and so on.  Those people now have to take time from work for court, pay more fines, etc than people in other areas. All the while other people do the same and get ignored - and then those people point to those other areas/people start to get biased and demand more police to bust more people.   No, Mr. Bush, the processed worked this one time out of many. If you spoke about these issues more (social injustice, abuse of power in the justice system) I might take you more seriously.         As expected people totally miss it.   Cons are rushing to push the whole meme "It's a dem city, so we don't expect there would be social issues" which is kind of funny when you think about it....  The two groups look at the issue in a different way. I don't care the politics of the city. People in power in either party can, and do abuse power. So this isn't about party politics but about perception of real issues.  Conservatives blow off those who have regular problems and side with those in government and stand up for them (unless, of course, it's that one guy in Office, Obama). They blame the victims of government power abuse and incompetence.  Liberals tend to see the issue as something that is fundamentally wrong with the system and how it works, while also saying if someone did something wrong they should be held accountable. But many aren't because they aren't poor, minority, etc.   I would think the right would care about unequal justice and abuse of the system against the citizens. But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.  Pretend like it was obama making the arrest and someone dying. Issa/Gowdy would do 15 investigations, fox would carry it 24x7 and demand justice.      Not even really talking about Ferguson. I am talking about issues every day across the US when it comes to cops and the justice system. Ferguson was about that build up, so was Baltimore. There were breaking points. The right is quick, especially now, to dismiss and use Ferguson to say "See, there wasn't any issue at all!" when the point protestors were making is crap happens every damned day.  Sure, some of it is small (being harassed, pulled over a lot, etc by cops). But some is larger. Extra charges tacked on, unequal protection and so on.  Conservatives tend to only care about a few big incidents ignoring the elephant in the room.      And so it begins. From fox to hannity to rw sites across the web.....  People who generally ignore the plight of people who have complained for decades about problems with the justice will suddenly pay attention and find fault it in .  When it's blacks, indians, hispanics, poor people getting screwed over every single day they just shrug and tell em "If you wouldn't have got arrested you wouldn't be in this situation, obey the law, get a job, etc"  Sure as hell though when one of said group are unarmed and die by cop they are out there setting up gofundme's for the cop(s), raging out injustice etc.  We get it conservatives, we really do :)   I can hear conservatives across the country saying that now.  All the while they have ignored this as a real problem in some communities for years and told people to quit whining about it.  Suddenly though, they seem critical of a system.  Funny how that works.         It goes like this. There were several investigations done that found nothing. Then there is another investigation that drags on and you want it to drag on more, so you order those other documents to slow things down.  Imagine if 9/11/2001 were investigated like this, it would still be going on. Some things would be classified, then there would be court battles over a few of them, they get released, then more and and when it's all done there is another investigation just for the hell of it and you slowly ask for all that same documentation as before *and* new docs to explore what people said about those other docs later...  It's like the never ending story. Well...until the election. Then suddenly it will wrap up with what we learned the first time.                                             I dunno, but mine's been 'frozen' for 6 years. Will see if someone from /r/gonewild will taste it and see if it's still good. Only way to be sure.   Told them to be scared of Iraq, now Iran, and fed into their fears. Conservatives are emotional creatures who are afraid of everything and anyone not straight, white, and Christian. Republicans stoke those fears and promise to play daddy for them and keep them safe.  It makes them feel better and not alone in their psychosis. It's not just them as individuals believing the poor people are destroying America by asking for help with food and medical care, they have people in office that whisper to them. Now they aren't alone in the things they imagine.   Might have been if this was Springfield Elementary.  http://imgur.com/r3xJlo5               And if 1+1 doesn't equal 3 they will find a way to blame Obama/Benghazi for why.   Now, now. Don't confuse a conservative with facts. You know they all live off of emotions and beliefs (Hey, the bible said the earth is only 6,000 years old - that is real science!).  I bet the person who posted this will be here any minute now to assure us this is a true and honest depiction of things (because Jesus told them how we must all work to eat and such....)   Wait...what? I read the article. Did you?  *In August, his boss is shutting down Z Pizza and putting him and his 11 co-workers out of work.*  And then.... *So she has to give raises within the next two years.*  So what it seems like to me is that the owner is using this as an excuse. Funny how the right ditches analysis and such in cases like this.  But, hey, conservatives go for emotion because they are always lacking on facts (how did that whole 'Obama ordered a stand down with Benghazi' work out for you?? Ohhh...right.)                                                Riiiight. Oh wait, it's from a conservative, no wonder it is so dumb.  Riot-plagued? LOL. And hey, maybe if cons weren't the ones raising funds for cops who kill unarmed black people they might see where the real problem is.  Carry on conservatives, I needed a laugh and a reason to feel superior to some fundie idiots today :)                     How do you kill someone over the phone, is there an app for that?                     Maybe not, but some think it is worth a shot.                        Why, I thought it was lack of prayer in school. Or does that just cause riots after buckeye games?  I think it is more a breakdown of our social justice system than anything.            If you need help grasping for those straws let us know and someone might get you a hand.      HAHAHAHA OMG the conservatives fell for this???  Go to hillary's twitter account. I'll wait. Ok, you go there? Tell us, do you see the thing that tweets by Hillary are signed "-H"?  Was that in the tweet they are whining about? No? Hunh....guess they blew a dog whistle and people came running without thinking.  A sure sign of a conservative.   He must be correct because conservatives have been promoting what some Iranians have said about nuke negotiations. Obviously they are just telling the truth.   Cons think violence against brown people is normal - whether from cops, prisons, or bombing them in other countries. They applaud the solution - until those same people engage in violence. Then...suddenly...violence is wrong and should be covered, talked about, etc.  They are licking their chops on this right now. They promote every negative story on iran, muslims, blacks, and raise funds for cops that shoot people and spending on wars/weapons. Funny how it all works in their minds.   Peaceful things aren't news to most people, it's what we expect.   But it is worth noting how some say "Violence doesn't accomplish anything." - unless of course it is the military, and then magically violence is the answer to all the problems in the world.  Funny how that works with some people.      I get what it is here in politics. I just wish I could get why crap spewed by Mike Huckabee isn't. I mean, we post political things all the time from writers who aren't even politicians and never have been but Huckabee gets the 'off topic' label. Weird.   Cops kill/shoot/beat blacks and the justice system screws them and the rw shrugs. Black commits a crime and suddenly they care about the race side.  We get it :)                              Here's one story http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2015/04/27/north-thurston-high-school-shooter/26449025/   Source  TV news station in WA (I cropped the image because original shows the phone number, hopefully they will fix that on their website)               My dick.   I thought it was god? Well, I guess to some they are the same thing.   My personal take on it:  Obi Wan was there to look after Luke on Tatooine and set him on his path/protect him. By dying here he was able to better aid Luke now in the long term and continue his mission.   Both he and Luke now progressed and Vader was under the impression that the last of the Jedi's was gone, which upped his arrogance that it was just he, the emperor, and the empire. Yoda was surely too old and probably dead, Obi Wan gone, there was no one left to teach, so his guard on that front would be down.  Again, just my guess :)         Weird, posted the same thing the other day and it was labeled 'off topic'. I kind of think it is on topic....   We have had a bush in the whitehouse for 20 years out of the past 35. I am sure we can find someone else in this large country of ours that can handle the job.            Cool. Thanks for the answer. One more Q? If you were to recommend a service to someone outside your coverage area what would you recommend and barring that what would you personally suggest what sort of things would you tell people to look for/against?  Not in the market myself but eventually might be when I move in a few years. I am just not overly trusting of alarm companies (no rational reason off the top of my head, just one of them things).   Have you installed any system into your house?         Any article that uses 'gaystapo' is written by an uneducated conservative (yeah, I know, redundant).    Fox news. Probably not planes at all. I was shocked though that they didn't mention benghazi in the article. They must be slipping.    GOP: "Stop gays, food stamps, unemployment, make people have ID's for voting and welfare, track their spending and limit it!"  "Can we get a rundown of the security expenses of that guy we elected?"  GOP: "Hell no!"                              I think this is assuming people are 'making' things. It is hard to measure productivity this way, especially when the idea is that every minutes equals 'money'.  But am guessing there will be companies that will run with this.                              Let me guess. You're a conservative. Now, now, don't clap, it wasn't hard to figure out. Take something that someone didn't say, pretend they did, and presto - you have something you can try to use to bolster an argument you know you will lose if you don't (welfare/dependency).   Now, one could note the year of the article, 2011. Which means you are probably just trolling for comments (another sign of a conservative who can't win arguments).  But hey, carry on, fun to see cons squirming and twisting. Makes me all happy :)   In the US it is practiced by drunk people.      "Amid mounting political pressure, the ATF last month put the bullet ban on the back burner, but left the door open for future rule-making."  Um, was there a way to 'close the door'? If not then they didn't leave the door open they just didn't decide at this time to do it.  Against the ban myself. Since most crimes involving the shooting of cops aren't planned and arise out of circumstance I don't think there is much basis to ban these because of cops. If someone is planning on killing a cop, any old bullet would do if you plan it out.   So what? According to conservatives all you have to do is work harder. Sure, you might work 2 or 3 jobs, but if you aren't getting all you want in life from work that is your fault.  And now someone is trying to blame, what, blame immigrants? LOL. Ok.  Remember when republicans voted against an extension for unemployment benefits? They said aid to those unemployed made them lazy and if they cut aid those lazy people would get jobs?  According to them there are tons of jobs out there. And the only reason your income is dropping is you are lazy and you aren't training yourself for new jobs.  And now they are trying to blame immigrants?? Yeah...get your message straight.        	200
                               Seems unbelievable, but the key is the size of the wind farms they modeled. The number of turbines ranged from 78,000 to 540,000. An array that large could slow the winds enough that they wouldn't immediately destroy the turbines themselves.                       	18
 AWD = all wheel drive, which is all the wheels turning at the same time.  They're all driven off the same engine and same  transfer case.  Now that you know that, here is the second part...  Different sized tires on one car, have to spin at different RPM's in order to turn at the same speed.  Add those together and you have a problem for transfer cases.   Ironic that it wasn't eating...  seems like he was playing the long game to get a taste of human.    Doesn't matter, got arm back.    That, actually makes a lot of sense.    It being made by EA.   I don't know how to do a spoiler tag.  But you can't believe everything to hear or read.    You shut your dirty mouth, with that jumped the shark nonsense!    Please explain this guys problem then...   I had an argument with someone on here, and they swore there was noting in meth that harms you or destroys teeth, that it was poor hygiene.   Some people are idiots.      I don't care how much EA sucks, I'm going to give them my money!    I wouldn't go.    The rich hide and move their money to avoid this tax anyways. That's what trust funds and lots of foundations are all about.  Now they don't have to do this.  If this hurts anyone, it's going to hurt all the tax and estate lawyers.   Yeah, I would now encourage my kids to make as much noise as possible, and save that letter to show the police when they show up. I would then ask them to file a harassment charge on said "neighbor".  God save said person if they decided to not call the police and try to confront my kids themselves.  I'll be the first one to give someone a dirty look if their kids are acting up in public when it's not appropriate, but I'll be dead in the grave before someone tells me how to act in my own god dammed yard!    I would go outside and make as much noise as possible, during daylight hours.  Fuck that person.    Then why doesn't it dissolve sugar?    So gas will dissolve Styrofoam, but not sugar?    If you don't mind, I'm just gong to slowly masterbate.    Fall out, i killed everyone.    Third time?  Filthy casual.     I don't start shit, but if you hit me, I'm going to finish it. Period.   How about you just move over to the right?    This cop would of be justified in shooting that uppity bitch.    Las Vegas.  Hover damn will give us easy power.    Better question, why do you walk so slow and in my way?  Make way for the tallest, peasants!    I remember when this was a thing.    No mention of Dag's?    I've always thought that people that get drugged are completely out of it.  As in, she wouldn't of gotten into her vehicle and gotten in the freeway.    Even if she wasn't drunk or on illegal drugs, it is illegal it sleep in the middle of the freeway then refuse a police order to "stop".   I pick a different spot    Photoshop or perspective?    How does he think his "zero emission" vehicles get recharged?  Most of the power in America comes from coal fired plants.    Be more confident, pick up on the signs from the girls, and have sex with them all.    You evil bastard.    Right or wrong, when a person with a gun tells you to "get down", you listen and show them your best dance moves.  Don't be shy, it could cost you your life.    Ok dude...  you're clearly a fucking jackass.  If you think meth isn't dangerous, and all the people dying from that shit is because they don't take care of themselves, then I'm not going to keep arguing.  Like I was told years ago, never argue with an idiot.  And I'll take all the down votes.  Clearly redit is a bunch of loopy liberals who will believe anything.    You smoked for a few years.  Good for you, you got lucky, so far.  I'll bet money that you'll have health problems in the future.   If you would of kept using, you would of developed issues.  I had a good friend who used for years.  He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.  Meth will destroy your internal organs too. Can't blame that on poor hygiene.     Are you an idiot or in denial?  Meth will eat away every part of your body that it touches.  Why do you think peoples teeth fall out? Why do you think doing meth for 10 years ages people 30+ years?  And don't give me any shit about how it's all the bad shit they put in meth to cut it.  There isn't really such a thing as pure meth that anyone on the street is going to find.    It has nothing to do with skin color, it's the culture.    You sure do have a lot of free time on your hands.    That girl looks a little young.    Who?    Three.  Shouldn't it be "an"?    The correct response "I'll fix it for free and give you money!"   Hornets and spiders   Friends come and go, doesn't matter, had sex.     Sorry, but that's not how it works.  Wing man breaks the ice.  If you can't close the deal or the female chooses the wing man, then you're SOL.  Try looking in the mirror before blaming others for your issues.    Any woman can get laid anytime they want. Just find a horny and desperate man.    But can a woman land a guy that's better looking, with her personality, the way men can?  Usually not.   But I've seen plenty of people hooking up at closing time, that would never be with said person in another situation.  Late night and alcohol can do wonders for everyone.    I'm only going to break the ice, if you can't close the deal, you don't need a wingman, you need a hooker.    Bull.  I'm not a pretty man, but I've had plenty of one night stands, where I get the girl with my humor and wit.  Make them laugh and your golden.    If you can't close the deal, why should he have to miss out on some strange? Grow a pair.    Are you God or the police? No.  Then get off your high horse and out of the left lane.    STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE THEN, NOT SORRY.    Ever consider not being in that lane in the first place.  You slow passive drives need to just say in the right lane.   	53
 I agree about microwave popcorn ripping people off, I just went for a little bit of ease here. Also, even microwave popcorn is fairly inexpensive.  	1
 I worked at best buy, and frequently felt morally obligated to tell people to go to newegg or equivalent to find their hdmi cables. Best buy matches prices of stores like walmart anyway, so I'm going to guess that's why their stocks are declining.   I've never played Half Life 2 (I know, I'm waving my own pitchfork at myself). Is it something I shouldn't deny myself?   I understand what you're saying Mr. Reason, but then 90% of Reddit would have to be downvoted if we downvote based on comments which do not add to the conversation. But thank you for answering me.   [This is the worst I've seen](http://imgur.com/T6R1x). And yes, he was taking up the two lanes in front of him as well. Whenever I'd be out with friends, we would always park all of our cars as close to these guys as possible, while still remaining legally parked. Sometimes they couldn't get the car out without risking damaging our (crappy) cars, and literally had to wait for us to leave.    Why is patrick being downvoted? He didn't say it means "fuck that, fuck you," he is pointing out that people thought it was that, like he thought it was fifty/fifty. And he said he knows what it means. I'm literally reiterating his post. He shouldn't be downvoted for this.      Back in the beta, I used to shoot out the lights in the subway train (like the ones in the last picture) just outside of the red-lit, raised service tunnel. I would lay there in the dark, then when the enemy would turn that corner I'd flip my flashlight on, blinding them by the drastic change in light, then annihilate them. Good times were had those days.   Gotcha. It's kind of a catch 22, because you really need to know her sense of humor well in order to put yourself in a position to get to know her better. If you said, "Hey, I wasn't sure if you got my message, but etc," it won't sound as good (funny) as if you said something like, "Hey [girlname], I was busy stalking your page the other day after we met and realized I really wanted to get to know you past what Facebook shows." Throw a smiley in or something. This worked for me, but my girlfriend has a stellar sense of humor, so as long as the girl you're going after would find that funny, go for it. Stay lighthearted and be confident that she'll laugh when you send it.   If you can be funny about it, there isn't a limit, but she may just be busy. Facebook makes stalking easy, since it now shows you if the other person has seen your message. Don't think she is ignoring you, be confident she just didn't get time to reply if anything. I think 48 hours is generally a good rule of thumb.  Btw, 10 hours ago was yesterday for you? Where do you live? 10 hours ago was this morning for me. haha   Awesome, I'm glad I could be of some help! Let us know how it goes!   Hey Bachenalien, ignore the nosey people who want to know about whatever the camp is. I can't imagine why they're so interested, but since you don't want it out there, it's none of their business.  Onto the girl, she likes you already. I have no idea what she is like, but you could try something forwardly cute. It's easy to message people on Facebook, so ask her to a movie. She'll likely be confused, so you then say that you'll both rent the same movie and start it at the same time, and you two will talk on the phone while it's going. **Ask her for her number then** and you can have a sweet, long distance date that way. You have her number, she'll hopefully like the gesture, and you can go from there.    Play either Brotherhood or Revelations. Brotherhood was my favorite. It has the best mechanics out of all the games (though AC2, AC:B, and AC:R are all basically the same). If you're playing one to get up to speed on the game before 3, I would play Revelations, obviously. It's the last in line so far. I suggest you play all of them if you ever get around to it. They're all great games.   **My short background:** I don't know much about cars. I've driven my mother's hand-me-down Mazda MPV since I could drive at 15 (I'm 20). My favorite car used to be the RX-8 but a friend of mine got one and he was kind enough to update the world with every problem he ever had with the car, which was just about daily. Even driving the way I do, easy on the car, that car seems too much of a hassle.  **Current situation:** I'm looking to buy a car in the near future, as the radiator in my van has a life-ending crack in it and is out of commission. We could easily replace that, but it doesn't seem worth it. So my plan is to purchase a new car. I just need to make the decision on appearance or fuel economy.  I am a fan of the newer Camaros, but I'm on the fence about getting one or some really great Hybrid car. I've heard hybrids aren't worth it for numerous reasons, but I want Reddit's opinion. I wouldn't be driving the Camaro like a racecar, I just love the appearance of it. I feel like it would be a better decision to get a car with great MPG. If the hybrids aren't worth it because of their downsides I'll probably stick to the Camaro. If I'm getting a car for MPG then the appearance isn't that big of a deal. Advice?  **TL;DR** Need a new car, are hybrids actually as good as they're hyped to be, or should I stick with something I like to look at, like a Camaro?   I thought guy sensei! And its totally believable, you're right   Haha ok thanks! The only martial arts movie I've seen is ip man. Other than that I'm out of the loop. That's what r/movies is for I guess!   Thanks for the replies! She mentioned Hero but believed that wasn't it. She must have just been mixed up. She couldn't figure it out, and I had also just introduced her to reddit. In order to show her the might of reddit, I said, "watch, reddit will solve this mystery." Thanks for killing two birds you two!   There is a martial arts movie I'm trying to find the name of. A friend of mine is trying to find it again but she can only remember some of it. Apparently every scene has a color scheme, where all the fighters wear the same colors as the background. She says it's extremely vivid and colorful. Like the background will literally be made up of a sea of yellow flowers while the martial artists will be wearing all yellow robes. I know that's not much to go off of, but she said most of the scenes in the movie are like that, which should pretty much give away the movie if anyone has seen it. I have no idea how old the movie is. If anyone can help me figure this out I will forever be grateful. Thanks!   This is not a problem with the world it's a problem with your self-perception.  What do you mean by that? I don't have a problem with my self-perception.   Ladies, I'm in a similar situation as Brrring. I doubt he meant it that way. I met a girl and thought she was literally my age (20) while she is actually 28. I had no idea. It's not a jump from youth to old age, it's more of a jump from college-age girl beauty to young adult beauty. There is a difference, but it's hard to explain, and neither is less beautiful than the other.   Pretty sure it's the other way around. Orangutans use their arms to do pretty much everything, including moving themselves around, so her arms were stronger than her legs. But yeah, flip those two things and you're pretty much right.   I couldn't stand being around someone like that, but I could definitely fight fire with fire. Is this something you can laugh at now? Or is it just something bad you found out about him after a long time? haha   I just learned the other day from one of my BEST friends, that back before he met me, when he was engaged to my other best friend, that when she invited him to one of my band's concerts, he would record us playing, and post the recordings to Youtube under the title, "Worst band in recorded history." Had I known at the time, I would have hated him. Since then I have met him, and obviously become good enough friends that he felt comfortable divulging that piece of hilarious information. I now know that our band was pretty awful back then, so I just laugh now knowing that. Anyone have a similar story, where you laugh at something hurtful in the past?   So I wanted to ask someone why they featured a post on r/srs, but realized after posting it that I can only have downvotes or double downvotes instead of downvotes or upvotes respectively. Am I just sleep deprived or is that actually how the subreddit works?   Agreed, when I saw this I thought, that girl must flirt with the drunk guys for bigger tips, because I was an awfully good server and the most I ever made was $400 over 4 days, and I'm a guy.    You're actually quite wrong. I was a server, and my wage was $2.15 an hour, but if I didn't make at least minimum wage they *did not* make up the difference.  And if you think washing dishes or cooking food is more difficult than being a server you are dead wrong. Serving is one of the hardest jobs. You can't really know how truly awful it is until you've been a server. I would work 12 hour days without enough time for a break or lunch, constantly on my feet moving throughout the restaurant serving six or more tables at any given time. When it gets that busy, people get irate because they don't get served in time. The servers' job is not only to carry plates. You have to keep a lot of people happy, keep their drinks filled, check to make sure they have everything they need at basically any given moment during their meal.  You're absolutely insane if you think servers get paid too much. Please, *try* to be a server for a month and you'll completely change your mind.

Honestly if you're on a nsfw sub for personal reasons you're not gonna downvote are you?   I was gonna put it on but said "Nah I'll get downvoted, probably."   That's how it works? Man are my cheeks red.   My cake day was in April I don't know what I put on reddit lmao   :[]   I know we have context and everything, but if we're in a "What is the most OP weapon in TF2?" thread and someone says Buff Banner then someone replies with "It's countered by the Boston Basher" the moment someone says "BB" the entire thread just stops and needs to ask.      Here's a list of all the 'BB's we have.   Buff Banner   Black Box   Boston Basher   Battalion's Backup   Back Burner   Brass Beast   Bread Bite   Bazaar Bargain   Beggar's Bazooka   Bilbo Bag- Wait a second   We have 9 weapons that are called this, please stop saying BB it always ends badly.   **Edit** Beggar's and Backback/Backup   He doesn't need to, he could take down one bot and feed himself for a few months and pay the power bills.

You have a sweet Gastly hat.   If you are a rich dude you could get a [Polar Pullover] (http://i.imgur.com/3831GRF.png) which is pretty much the way around a hat that can't be unusual.   Disco Beat Down is probably the best effect of all time.   Thanks for linking me to this, but unfortunately I have a Titanium Tyrolean Miami Nights, it's funny though because the thing I want so much is a Vintage Tyrolean with Disco Beat Down.   I don't think anyone calls you cool.   Don't just give in to the haters, when haters give you lemons you know what you do? You take those lemons and squeeze them right into the eyes and scream "I DON'T WANT YOUR DAMN LEMONS! DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE GIVING LEMONS TO? I AM DERPYDOSEGAMEZ, I'M THE MAN WHO'S GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH THE LEMONS! I WILL SQUEEZE LEMON JUICE INTO YOUR BURN WOUNDS!"   This is how you piss of multiple 7 year olds c:   I don't think that's a very good comparison, the issue the guy is having is that if Geel were to bet 3% of every pot he would receive 3% back because there's a 3% cut going to the site. If he puts in nothing he still gains 3% of the pot, if he puts in 3% and wins he gets it all, if he puts in 3% and loses he gets back the same value that he put in.      The problem with your car example is that the salesman would not be gaining extra. I don't see a huge issue with what Geel is doing but I can see why others would.   Excluding keys, kinda.   Mine is a Disco Beat Down Vintage Tyrolean which is around 80 keys and so far I have around 30 keys towards it, I'd say a Miami Nights Titanium Tyrolean is close enough, right?      Anyway, what is your dream unusual? You trying to get it with keys? Maybe on the Steam Community Market? How about PayPal trades, maybe you're doing that for it!   I think "Considering you died...." works just as well. Puts a bit of salt into that piss.   The stickies were placed, even if there were 8 they may have been all scattered. This is a complete reason for it not to go down.   The tf2 wiki agrees that 8 stickies will kill a sentry? Of course it will, but will it destroy them when they aren't directly under it?      **edit** http://gfycat.com/AdmirableSmartAmericanrobin   [Holy balls of all the times for this start playing from my playlist is also the time I see a post about it.] (http://i.imgur.com/etqDtZ6.png)   Yes, because that is the reason for a sentry to not go down to a demo.   Shoot down with the wrangler and they wont do damage because they have been spread, and before you try to weasel your way out of this by saying "Maybe the engineer doesn't know how to do this", he's doing the Sigafoo save, he knows how to right click.

There was a thread a couple days ago about hp being about the classes health size, this post is of a Soldier on a set of scales checking his weight.   "Demo Down"     THAT'S THE WRONG BIND!

For example, /r/truetruetf2 with Stout Shakos or /r/tf2memes with [this] (https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ7mtjxkhEkfJMdUAKHu2diXNJcHU8gMWXO4qCjrarA_MpwWeuRjQ) or [this] (http://41.media.tumblr.com/a8ec701fac8ebd3d42616d6c0acf76ce/tumblr_nndm6hKFUV1re2kqmo1_500.jpg)      I'm not saying we should, but is it breaking the rules considering they are basically /r/tf2?   If you eat their liver with a side of some fava beans and a nice chianti it's peaceful.   What's the deal with the "Use this as a vector" and "Pro Ks Sandman Kit" stuff? What country are you in that uses vectors and baseball bats for sniping?

It's actually a funny story, I told some of my friends that I paypal scammed someone out of a Sulphorus Killer Exclusive because I felt like it would be something cool to discuss for a few days. So I choose some high tier yet slightly believable hats and told them I sold the KE to buy these.   The reason I thought of doing this was because I had a 24 hour ban on backpack.tf for a price suggestion to make the Stout Shako 2 refined. Only one person knew that was the reason I was banned, it was pretty entertaining.      I didn't actually paypal scam anyone and I never will, mostly because I don't have a paypal.   Experienced.

There are like 20 Trade Servers always available, being unable to sell there means you're a bad trader or your hat is bad, if you resort to pubs then you need to quicksell for 75% value.   If they have put enough time into trading to get unusuals they must have played before, if somebody only has the game for the trading, why would they go on a pub to find buyers? Why would they go into the actual game?   Because fuck you guys, New Zealand rules!   Are you saying that after maybe 50 hours someone will have 3 cosmetics for one class? Unless they got them from the store, which I doubt because unless you're very invested in a game you should not be spending $5 on it for basically no reason.      What kind of trader is only in their first pub when they get an unusual? Even if they do want buyers they still have the appearance of a person who has put enough time into obtaining it.   That's the spooky eyes in a cloud effect right? If it is then wow man that is, like, godly for that hat.   Although if I may add my own input here, I personally dislike the confetti effects, they aren't as visible as they should be, unfortunately.

A Gibus just shows that you dominated another Gibus player.   They call me the Training Wheels, because I tend to pocket Gibus players. How can they kill something when they can't fly as demonstration man?   The problem with all stock is that many pro players use stock cosmetics, sometimes they use the Party Hat for some reason.

For what weapons?   helo is me ur brother give me ur item i will hold good trade yes   It isn't really true like this though, Sniper can right click then left click for an instant 150 damage, killing most classes in one hit. Scout's speed is countered by the Engineer, Medic isn't the only class that can heal, you are correct in saying it is the easiest but Engineer and Heavy can do it too. There's also health kits but whatever. Being fast means nothing when you're facing a good Sniper. Healing isn't possible when you've been killed by a good sniper. Even a Heavy isn't safe if the sniper can hold his horses for a minute.   I would practice to do that but I main Medic and Soldier, I guess Crit Ubersaw Stair Stabs will have to do.

 Damn. That's powerful.   As a lot of people previously mentioned: we are - well, most of us - too brainwashed to think otherwise. They think our government is just and righteous, and acts solely in favor of the people. That couldn't be further from the truth.  I'll get behind anyone who wants to take our country back.   So capitalist in your ways of thinking    So the last time I smoked was 4/20. I told myself I had to take a tolerance break if I wanted to get an internship for the summer. So I finally landed one, passed the drug test, and decided to celebrate this weekend after my first week of work. My buddy and I rolled 2 blunts and we packed my vape  (Arizer Solo) a couple times. I was expecting to get stoned since I haven't smoked in so long, but nothing. I barely even got high, and the "high" only lasted half an hour max. We were smoking cherry pie and it was some pretty dank stuff, but for some reason it wasn't working for me.   Any insight would be much appreciated!   Hey I feel your pain. I've noticed the same trends on 9gag. Scrolling through the posts and reading comments which were initially there for my entertainment, became something unseemingly sinister. The people are mean - not just a little mean, but the truest from of the word. They revel in their bad habits of being shut-ins, and unmotivated membera.of society who wish to do nothing more than play their games and bully those who think differently than themselves.  I've decided to kill my time through books and sketching, rather than giving my thumb a workout through the toxicity of that website.   I'm the messy inbox, android, beer over soda, multiple alarms, cash, and "haha"  kind of person.   FallenS(kyrim)ouls   This is one of the few nosleep series I'm actually enjoying. Please update!   Say something like: "the prince of darkness resides here."    215!   I have one that isn't too creepy, but interesting nonetheless.   My father came to the United States roughly 30 years ago, purchased a house, and then my mom had me shortly after. The original owner of the house was an old woman who had the house since its construction in the early 1900s. My father was a handyman and decided to construct a deck in the backyard. While he was digging the foundation for the deck, he noticed a concrete slab about 15 feet from the back of the house. It turned out to be a time-capsule the woman left for previous owners. We dug it up and sorted through the knick-knacks she left for us. Nothing too interesting or out of the ordinary; just pictures of the house from back in the day and newspaper clippings from the second world war and other important events. With the discovery,of the time-capsule came the discovery that the old woman passed away in the house. It is unknown how she passed, but we later found out she passed away in the room I sleep in now. Ever since then I started to notice strange events throughout the house. There have been a couple times where lights have turned off by themsleves, doors have closed, and have even had my clothes moved off my floor into the hamper. One instance that I will not forget was when I was alone in the house with my music playing downstairs (pretty loudly) when all of a sudden I heard a loud "ssshhh!" come from the top of the stairs. I knew it had to be her.  Never once have I felt threatened; I really feel at peace in my home. I feel as if her spirit  (if you want to make those conclusions) is that of a typical old woman. She turns the lights off when we're not in the room, closes the doors so our dogs don't make a mess of our room, picks up my dirty clothes, and even tells me to be quiet when I'm making too much noise.    Hey Jim - if you were to cut open a hot pocket and use it to pleasure yourself, at what temperature would you like the hotpocket to be?   	11
 because Hamilton fanboys are complete morons  they are the ones who comment "It's sabotage" anytime something happens to Hamilton   i wouldn't compare them until they both have a better car so far it's been a piece of shit   considering he imminently blamed grosjean i don't see him growing out of it soon  you only learn from mistakes if you can admit you made one     makes sense   figured i'd post this as it seems not many people have seen it and it's still up on youtube atm      back onboard camera of Grosjean if anyone hasn't seen it yet  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfQT_iZX-NE    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfQT_iZX-NE   Grosjean doesn't need to explain himself Max was at fault even though he doesn't want to admit it   i've been applying for a few jobs lately and found that a lot but not all redirect to their own website and ask you to fill out forms which ask for the same details which are on your resume  why do some places do this? example is they ask for previous employment history and references yet they would be in the resume  edit- forget to add they also ask you to upload a  resume   he may of not said it but he's implying it especially by saying he's got the hallmarks of schumacher/senna    brundle has basically already said it about Verstappen  Verstappen will be a world championship-winning team before he is 20. He is showing all the hallmarks of a Senna, of a Schumacher in my view,    the racing and results so far i just think sainz has a lot more potential but it isn't recongised as much because Verstappen gets more hype due to his age   i think sainz is a great driver who isn't being recognised as much because of the hype surrounding the younger Verstappen  i honestly think he has the better chance of being a future world champion and would be a waste of good talent if he isn't picked up by one of the bigger teams      most Hamilton fans see it as exactly that but there is always idiot fanboys making comments about sabotage etc   anytime something happens to Hamilton his fanboys come out with the sabotage remarks.   before i even opened it i knew there would be a comment about it being a sabotage     still is this is just a massive Mercedes fuck up for hamilton   why did hamilton pit? just gave away the win   for good reason it's a shit track that only exists because it's historic  it's time to retire it and get a better track that allows some actual racing   that's the problem it's a historic track they'll never get rid of it no matter how more boring the races get  if this was not a historic track it would of been abandoned years ago    always is at Monaco worst race of the season by far  if it wasn't a historical track it would of been ditched years ago   it's for people new to the sport you dingleberry  sports don't survive if they don't get new fans     you could say the same about everyone using a smartphone or buying any clothes made in sweatshop countries  pretty sure many have died making the things we all go out and buy on a daily basis and no one seems to care   people are stupid   also any clothes made in china or the other sweatshop countries which is basically everything we buy   just people jumping on the bandwagon give it a few days they won't care anymore   kimi needs to improve or he won't have a seat soon enough   so how many of you actually cared about Qatar before the visa and coke threads?  typical bandwagon jumping that you will all forget about when these threads die down,  you will then continue life as normal using smartphones built in sweat shops and wearing clothes made under worse conditions yet no thread for that     then forget about a day or two later when this drops off the main page  i'd wager money most people commenting didn't give a fuck about Qatar before this    they are settling back into their usual position  last year was a one off   shouldn't be illegal due to the stupidity of the person who didn't secure it   not really a bad thing lots of idiots on the road  they must of bribed the driving instructor to pass them    it won't at least not on something as big as the world cup  even if sponsors pull out someone will front the money and the show will go on and it will be watched by millions/billions  people wanted to boycott Russia during the winter Olympics because of the gay laws they passed yet it had no impact   the world cup will go ahead in Qatar as planned even if coke or whoever else pulls out  hundreds of millions if not billions around the world will still watch it when it's on in 2022  no one will remember this post as people tend to jump on bandwagons and then move on completely forgetting about it    any form of comedy as it seems these days more and more people are "offended" by jokes   this is also why product placement is increasing in all shows if people don't watch commercials they will just get the show to drink their drinks with the labels showing on camera etc   it's impressive for a first time but he has to do in qualifying for it to mean anything   all depends on how he qualifies   nope that's fucking retarded  music is music people are people big fucking difference between them no matter what the history of the music is  i also hate classical and country i guess this means i hate white people as well        yep that's how retarded people are becoming   rap (mostly the new crap these days) is just shit doesn't make someone racist for hating shit music   there is always someone willing to do that they then forget about it a day or two later and wait for the next controversy to pretend to care about   it's likely a translation issue and he didn't meant it the way the rest of us see the word  although there is always people who will pretend to be offended by it cause a stink about it then forget about it a few days later when they move on to the next "controversy" to pretend to care about   kimi is on is his last legs within the next year or two ferrari will replace him   honestly i think Ricciardo gets a little more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came from safety cars and when Mercedes had issues  what i want to see is him get a good car for a few years and see if he can consistently pull off results like 2014 or if it was just a one off  right now the red bull is a turd so you can't count this year to be fair to him   sport games are the worst offenders.. cod and battlefield are bad but at least try to bring something new   this game is becoming the FIFA of the racing games  they need to add more to it (not sure what) but just following the actual sport and making slight adjustments to AI and handling just isn't enough to want to buy it each year     he also ate all but one of the outside chair cushions he now sits on the remaining one every day   he would be thrown into a mental asylum if he came back today  "i'm the son of god"... sure you are buddy right this way to the padded wall room   popular vote runs a risk of people voting against it there is still a lot of people (mostly old but some young) who are against it  many might not even publicly say it either and can vote no without anyone else knowing   this will probably pass but is this type of vote the best way to do it?  there are a lot of people who are against gay marriage but might not ever say it in public.. voting like this allows them to vote no without anyone else knowing   i don't think he has many years left in F1  Ferrari will be looking at other drivers to replace him (probably Bottas or Ricciardo)  he needs more results like bahrain if he wants to keep his seat   	54
 Honestly, one of the most disturbing things I have seen. I can handle gore. But buff children? Nope.   "Can you fuck it??"   *Shoe   It's called a horse show crab   OP, we demand answers. Where is your fucking roommate?   Thanks! I don't hate my ex for breaking up with me though. I just wish our relationship had lasted longer. The breakup was really sudden and unexpected on my end. A couple days before December started he just up and tells me he doesn't love me anymore in that way and it was over. I already had gotten his Christmas present early. He was my first bf too.   You're at an HEB!   I wasn't expecting to spend Valentine's Day alone this year. Now I'm going to be spending it alone.   Cunt   I would so fucking vote for them   Just saying "no" would've been less amusing   Fuckin'   Didn't Hitler have his moustache in that fashion because he enjoyed Chaplin's films? I think that's the reason but I'm not sure. Correct me if I'm wrong.   *shit*      I tried salvia one time and I will never go back. My trip was messed up. I grew a hole in the top of my head and water started coming out it, soaking my entire body. Then it was water out of every oriface. I melted into my chair, and my arms fell off. Then I came back together, turned into a black man and got so scared because my friends turned into the KKK and had a burning cross in front of me, and they were all waiting to lynch me. I'm never doing it again.   This makes me feel good. My brother is a chef and attended Le Cordon Bleu in Austin. He taught me all these tips about knives.   I love PostSecret. I think this one comes from the Secret Lives of Men and Women compilation book.   A lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex food places in my area warn customers that their food may contain small bones and other fiberous tissue that might have not been completely ground up. An artery is nothing. If its cooked and edible, eat it.   No matter if people think that statement sounds racist, it is so true.   His painting looks like its made out of shit. If I had to paint him, that's what I'd use in order to match his personality.   I could troll people at nursing homes   HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THAT?!?   I always preferred Marvel over DC. Fuck me, right?   It's a repost. If you wonder why you might get down voted, just understand.   No it didn't you filthy asshole. This is a repost.   Am I the only one who doesn't get it?   What a bitch. Repost   Turns out, this fox is a liberal democratic communist loving facist. More at 10 after a full hour of Nacy Grace bitching her viewers out.   Mine too   Exactly   ARE YOU AT BLINN IN BRENHAM, TEXAS??   I thought it was semi funny because all the girls look like feet and horses (except the one on the far left). Never mind then...   Rafael Alencar and Johnny Rapid.   Please don't tell me this little alien abortion lives in Texas. I have to leave this state. NOW. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES. AND SOULS!   I've always wondered what his first experience getting sexed up was like. You know. Since he couldn't touch it himself. It was like super brand new probably.   More like THANK YOU for bringing this to a movie theater.   Little ginger complained about being kicked on national Kick a Ginger Day. What a punk. Lets go kick him.   Agreed. The caption was brilliant.   This is cool! I've never seen one begin decomposing in one of those before.   Not wtf but I have to say its sort of clever.   About to catch fire? What am I? A fucking psychic?   Already been suggested somewhere on reddit. Someone posted it back when all those kids at Sandy Hook went down.   You are mighty handsome looking!   When they first had a website, I wanted to go on it, so I asked my mom which key was the backwards G.   I'm so tired of seeing this picture get posted...   I love the picture of Raven at the bottom. "If you can't love yourself, then how the hell are you gonna love somebody else? Can I get a amen up in here?" "AMEN!"   It was all the fault of the police for not securing the scene. Everyone rushed in, contaminated evidence, and the prosecution fucked up in nearly every way during the trial.   Lemme correct myself, they look like they just hatched a several hours ago   This in a month? She's in stage two decomp from what it looks like!   Almost. From the looks of it, they're still eggs.   Good job at getting the joke!   Think about it. It's not scurrying around your place anymore.   They just need to be more obvious with their sexual attractions towards each other. Makeout in public, film themselves fucking, spread the tape and watch all the teenage girls realize they never stood a chance. So much blood would be shed.   Ok, Hinduism. Still wanted to point out that fact it's not the swastika.   I have blue/green eyes and after I've been crying, the color goes bright green. Not lying.   The Nazis didn't. Stop being stupid. The Nazis stole that symbol, turned it another way, and used to symbolize their Ayran pride. It originates in Asia and is common to find on statues of Buhdda and in temples around different countries.  It is a symbol of peace.   *goose   I agree   *duck  (please go in the direction I'm hoping)   Same here   I love Tina. Amy as well.   OH MY GOD. MUST GET TO WALMART.   Quick! Someone slap a brazzers logo on it.   Why is John Lennon kissing that man? Oh wait.   *eagle   Oh god. Now everytime he arouses me I will think of this and get turned off.   When suddenly a black man took a picture in front of the booth? This photo tell us nothing.   Bitch is serving straight up fish. Whether its cross dressing, doing drag, or dressing as woman due to the fact you might be transgendered, he still looks good painted. Whatever his reason, he looks good.   The magic of drag   Holy molestor powers, activate!   Cards against humanity   Bravo   FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET FAGET LEARN TO SPELL IT RIGHT FAGET   Wonder if he ever attended a Wigstock festival back in the day   I wonder if Johnny Rapid knows when he poops...   I never went to see the movie in fear of heavy disappointment. Whatever I've heard from people who have actually seen the series, I am so glad I didn't go see it.   It is supposed to be a wine holder. It's only because you have a dirty mind that you wanted it to be what you think it is.   So envious! It's beautiful!  	79
 Of course, if I was in healthcare. It would be my job, and it's kinda hard to get. It's not like some kind of airborne disease or anything.   Herp, Derp,   Gerp.   Yeah, but you have a good start to getting things going. 401k, emergency savings, etc.    10k won't last long at all without a job. Get an income before you lose what you have.   There are, actually. But they're brewed differently. The bags go in the brewer, not the cup. There's instant coffee for that.   I played morrowind until I was uber. I went and killed the god in the volcano and the one on that southeastern island. Really didn't know what to do after that and just stopped playing.    Thexder. I was stuck on one of the last levels for years. Put the old 286 in a closet, pulled it out 10 years later, game disk still works. Played through all the way to the end. I was stunned it took over a dozen years to beat the damn thing.    I thought they changed it so the spin counted to the ramp up.    1-20 years.   The giant ear hoop things that stretch them out. Seriously, have you ever seen them without the rings in? Just gross.   Nothing on xda for it?    Nova won't do it, but sslauncher is insanely customizable and does gingerbread    I'm still a fan of sslauncher. It takes a while to figure it out, but once you do there isn't much you can't do. Gridless screen to place stuff exactly, can overlap them and move them from front to back, has great options even before using zooper or the like, has a separate header area at the top of the screen that can follow different rules. Plus it will work on much older devices than nova.   Or when I want a customized look without the effort, I'll use buzz launcher and download someone else's customized screen.    Actually, I pay for 15 and get 22-24. Mediacom though, so...    III Come at me with boxing gloves, you're getting airblasted and shot,  fuck you.   XIII All spycrabs must die. Do it where in your base if you don't want to die.   XVI I'm not an idiot, I won't talk like one.   XVIII Yeah,  right.   XXI They deserve to die most at this moment.   XXI.IV Will if I can. If not, still killin him.   XXV Occasionally, but usually if you try it on me, you're just putting a bullseye on your face.    edit: Lol I was wondering how many downvotes I'd get for this one.   edit: Wow, the hate. I'm getting pms asking for my steam id now. Jesus, people, just cause I compete on competitive servers doesn't mean I'm a huge dick. I try to have fun with everyone. And you can find me usually on skial us 2fort. Go ahead, kill the Scur.   Andmade Share, More Shortcuts, URL Copy are the 3 I that have the largest effect on my phone operations. I have a bunch I put on every ROM, but these three are my essentials.   I just started Californication. Very pleasantly surprised. Everyone is crazy.   Me too.   I just double the tax, then adjust for the service.   Yeah, it's definitely uncomfortable to say the least. I asked the mother "You let him do that?" She just said "He can do whatever he wants."   Back in the day I went with a guy I knew to get some weed. We sat around this fatass woman's table and watched her 6 year old son drink beer, smoke cigarettes, and toke on a joint. Yeah, I never went anywhere with him again.   [Root](http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3-sprint/#root), [Recovery](http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3-sprint/#tools), [ROMs](http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3-sprint/#romList).   Huh. TIL Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who.   I don't see why they would ask for a reason. Tons of folks do it, nearly none of them are up to anything shady.   As I go through custum roms, I notice that very few have a 180 option when they have the options in their display settings. That is, not only is there a rotate screen toggle, some roms have toggles for 0,90, 270, while even fewer have a 180 toggle.  I think it's a rom restriction. Right now I'm on CM7 on a Droid X2 so I can be on Straight Talk over the Verizon network, and in my CyanogenMod settings  Accelerometer rotation I have toggles for all four views.  edit: Didn't mention that the rotation works for all apps that work in those mods. So games that only are landscape work on either 90 or 270, when they are toggled in my settings, and something else that rotates, say bacon reader, works on all four sides. I haven't seen an app that was restricted beyond what rotations are toggled.  edit2: I take that back. I seem to remember one game that only worked at 90, wouldn't flip to the other side for some reason. Had to be the app restricting it.   I don't think you know what "literally" actually means...   Yeah, saw a scout running around today. It's cool in the sense that you can majorly change up your scout, but it's pretty ugly.    You can't gift wrap them?    BTW, I just installed JuiceDefender and there is an option in the ultimate app that lets you  control data access for any app individually. It's been so long since I've used it that I've forgotten the option was there.   I have no idea. You might look thru xda, I'm willing to bet if it's not a huge task that someone has or knows how to come up with something.   I'm coming up with a blank. I know there are several options to control when data comes on automatically, that would stop everything except calls and texts and check all your stuff on a regular basis.  JuiceDefender has a crap ton of options, especially the pro version. But I'm seeing very little to control certain apps.   If you're on KitKat go into settings and find the application manager then Whatsapp, turn off the  notification there.   I just got this last week for under $20 with prime and a discount code (which I don't remember and have dumped my email trash since), works awesomely. Can even charge it while it's in use.

Do I win?   Pavarotti found alive and well.   Search the playstore for pricecheck. I'm using on that has been taken off the market some time ago, but there are a few apps  that are fairly close to what you're looking for, though I don't know if any check past prices.   They only kinda worked for me. What really straightened me out for a good while was a switch. I shot all our storm windows with a bb gun. He went to the plum tree, got a branch, had me hold the back of a chair, and gave me 3 licks. Oh dear lord the pain. I was good for months after that.   And can be thrown. Ceiling sentries would confuse the hell out of folks.    I read that as pent-house bears and thought you were a genius. After rereading, I now only find you clever.   Thir, yeth thir!   I've always assumed that the lockscreen was just another app too, and replacements would just disable the stock app and run on boot instead. I never felt it was an overlay or bootstrap or anything like that, but I've never delved into lockscreens, either. I'm fuzzy on that one myself. Gonna see what stuff looks like real quick, got me curious.    I just let it loop in the past. It slowly gains ground with each loop, and eventually will get all the way through the charging icon and let the screen shut off. The screen is the big drain, when it can get through to have it off again it'll charge faster.   That's been my experience, anyway.    The launcher is just an app, it's not like an extension of the OS or anything. It's just an app that holds links to various aspects of the phone you want to get to or run, as well as performing other stuff, like runnig widgets. Even the app drawer is just another part of the launcher, it's not inherent in the OS. It is another layer of Android in the same manner that any other app is.    Keep it plugged in and forgot about it for a while. Your battery is stone dead, and trying to change. The tiny bit it's getting is mostly being spent trying to get into the whole charging-while-off screen. I've been through the same thing numerous times. Give it an hour and see where you are.   I could be wrong, but I think I'm right.    I would think the first and best place to find this info would be xda developers.    So far as I can tell, to use a Verzon phone over the Verizon network on Straight Talk, the phone must be CDMA only, which generally means 3G, no LTE capabilities, and cannot have a sim card slot, except for iPhones. However, I know things are changing these days, and my info may be outdated already.   Myself, I'm using my Droid X2, Cyanogenmod 7.2 (Android 2.3.7) and it seems to me about the best I can do without going iPhone 5.   Oh, I know that by using my 4 year old phone that I'm missing out on more and more, and it's my fault for not keeping up, not a programmer's. I stay away from Verizon (the only good reception around these parts) by using Straight Talk, which means 3G CDMA phones with no LTE capabilities only. But I just got an email from Cricket they have 4G here now, which means better phones, so gonna look into that.   So, yeah, I can ramble on...    "Your device isn't compatible with this version."   Droid X2, CWM 7.2.0, Android 2.3.7  Sigh. I miss out on some good stuff.    Yeah, I just saw another article saying the Android app comes out next week.    They won't have one. You'd have to contact a dealer. Since they cost some $3500 each sale is going to tale some real time with a dealer.    No, but lately I've been recording my dealings with utility companies, thanks to assorted redditor's postings.   Got deep pockets?   http://www.cryptophone.de/en/products/   lol Yeah, even OEM stuff goes bad.    I really only see a couple apps that could help. Of course, if you want to go through them one at a time and put whatever pic you want in there when you have time you can.   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwareham.kiwicontactphotogenerator  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipson.ContactPhotoFinder     Oh, nice idea. Gonna hunt around...    It doesn't even have to be a bad cable to mess up things. An after market cable that charges fine and connects to your computer for data transfer fine can gum up the works when flashing. OEM cables are really the only way to help insure smooth flashing, rooting, etc.    I tried to be the 44% a couple weeks ago. I didn't know I had 2 months left on my contract with Dish when I called to cancel my $60 a month subscription, but told them I wanted to cancel anyway. I told them there wasn't anything they had to offer that I couldn't stream outside of the Weather Channel and the sports I couldn't get over the air. They ended up giving me a much better package plus all the premiums for $25 a month for 3 months without extending my contract and can cancel at any time. So in 2 months I can go ahead and join the 44% while saving a few bucks on the last 2 bills.     Why is iPhone the goto platform for anything anymore?   This is why I have a bag of those silicone packs that assorted items are packed with. They work incredibly well.    I actually poked around for one the other day, didn't see any. Lots of cracked apps, though.    Oh, ssLauncher was neat when I put the time to really edit the screens.   	62
 I'm sure she has a cozy job at MSNBC waiting for her.      The downvotes show that Redditors have no problem with Democrats committing crimes.      Still blaming Obama's failures on Republicans after 7 years?  It must be nice to be oblivious to consequences.      "Leonhart repeatedly explained that a maze of civil service system protections for government workers prevents her from firing federal employees."  No accountability for our masters in Washington, DC.      We should crowd-fund an airdrop to keep the legend alive.   Every time you consider a candidate that wishes to grow the federal government remember that power always corrupts.    We have seen many instances of this and will see more.   Obama and Holder are sending delegations to Iraq to ensure ISIS has not been subjected to civil rights abuses.   Oh, and to make sure our TOW missiles we gave them are still working.   The idea that rights come from a god means that no earthly person, group or government should be allowed to deny your basic rights.  Even if you don't believe in God, it's a nifty proposition that elevates individual rights above any possible usurpation.   Immediate downvotes in less time than the length of the video?  Please provide critique of the content, not just an insta-downvote because it's Ted Cruz and redditors say not to like him.  Very close-minded.         The 1 percent pay about a quarter of all income tax.  They are already taxed to the hilt.     http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/death-panels-sarah-palin-was-right-again   Democrat Motto: Tolerance of those who agree with me.            Finkelstein can go Fuckelstein himself.   It's her fault for not given you space. You are almost a man.   Why do Americans want Iran to have nuclear weapons?   Liberals telling lies and shouting down the other side?  I'm shocked!   But..but...the conservatives!!      Democrats want to get money out of politics, provided that money is for Republicans.   And Obama supplied them with TOW missiles.  Think about that.   Here's another first.  First time in history a sitting US President has negotiated to put nuclear weapons in the hands of a nation that sponsors terrorism.     First time in history a sitting US President has negotiated to put nuclear weapons in the hands of a nation that sponsors terrorism.  Yes we can!      Obama will be inviting him to the White House for a celebratory dinner, where he will say Islam has "built the fabric of America" and we should be ashamed of our Christian past.      To the Democrats, the means justifies the ends.  They will abuse power every chance they get.   Unwad your panties, Johann.   We're okay.  The ones who survived the original acidification were naturally selected to survive the next one.   Sitting in a quiet room by yourself.   After they become stars both groups are rich but I'm pretty sure Loretta Lynn didn't grow up in the cozy life.   Iran now clear to build nuclear weapons.  Russia invading Ukraine and just boldly hacked into our systems yet again.  China will soon make an effort to retake Taiwan militarily.  Islamic extremism is growing unchecked and even condoned in areas of the Middle East.   But who cares?  Obama made sure his bracket it filled out and his talk show appearances and golf are on the schedule. He's a hip, non-white guy and we aren't racist and stuff.  Plus he like promises us free stuff from those evil rich people.  That's all that matters.      If these people were wanted for assault, why not provide a description?   Iran with nuclear weapons?  Who cares?  We have like a cool President bro.         Yes and its up to the company to enforce it,  not the government.   Still waiting for him to admonish Islam as a whole just like he does every other day with Christianity.   Yet more harsh words regarding Christianity from Barack "The Muslim call to prayer is one of the prettiest sounds in the world." Hussein Obama.      Showing the true totalitarian nature of the leftist movement.   Tolerance only for those that agree with me.                  If you think this is the case, please push for the State Trooper to be fired immediately for disobeying the elites.    Liberals think communist China is more important than state sovereignty.   More enrichment of our culture. Celebrate diversity!      Please define "real war".   They're just so JV.   Maybe the account is off by a few days, but I'm sure the historical account would be accurate in regards to the season.   The Democrat Party: The party of control.      Almost all of the people on here will never set foot in Israel and are ignorant to the reality of rocket shells landing in their neighborhood simply because they are not Muslim.  You are mostly sheltered, naive and fed an agenda.   Where is the criticism of his religion by the fascist Reddit atheists?   Look at all the young, naive Redditors celebrating this.   Iran will start World War 3.  But who cares?  We have like a cool President, bro.   Why does Islam get a free pass from the leftist mob?                    Come back in ten years and read this post.  The Middle East and Europe will be in complete flames and you will have some life experience.   Is it going to be as good as Solyndra, where he gave his buddy $500 million and they immediately declared bankruptcy?   This is 1939 all over again.  Iran has expressly stated they will "destroy Israel" and will start a nuclear war.  Millions of innocent people will die, but who cares?  We have a cool President that appears on Jimmy Kimmel.   No condemnation from Obama.  He's too busy "standing with the Muslims".      This is the product of liberal indoctrination in our public school system.  We freed 2/3rd of the world and 70 years later "we weren't much better."  Fuck off.   Two words.   No father.   There he goes again, "standing with the Muslims."   Don't take your God's name in vein.   Importing a Democrat voter base?  Yes we can!      According to liberals on Reddit, you are just "paying your fair share".  Someone has to fund Canada's socialized healthcare system.        Indiana will be fine.  The politically correct mob of thought police need to back off.   Human carbon emissions are obviously causing Jupiter's spot to shrink!  Repeal capitalism and imprison all business owners or the spot will disappear forever!  Forward comrades!         Can someone tell me why we are siding with a theocratic dictatorship over a free democratic state?      	92
 This man had a beard.  Does your grandpa also wear a hat that says 'If you're not wasted, the day is'? If so, I have his business card ;)   Man, life is too short to get bend out of shape over funny old people. Even my (awesome and hilarious) girlfriend thought it was funny.       Ahh, this guy!  I like this guy.   Solid reply.   well, when you have no teeth......    i should have been more clear - he was a patron not a worker.  he's always there - that's how you contact him.  oh, and he writes a check every time.        having spent 5 years in southeast Florida, i was always happy to see a Packers fan.  down there it's Jets, Giants, Patriots, Eagles.    i remember being at a bar when the giants beat GB a few years back in the playoffs.  i was one of 10 packers fans in a bar with 400+ giants fans.  we stuck together.   18 @ swope disc golf + 18 @ swope footgolf = a damn fine day   someone doesn't know how to throw a disc!

 CO is best state!   *9?*   It's working. I've fired a gun once in my life and after spending time on reddit, every picture with a gun makes me look if their finger's on the trigger.   I don't think I'm responsible enough. :P   Someone should make this.   I think that's just because Killswitch is a lot more radio friendly than the average metalcore band. Which could be a way that they're the Nickleback of the genre, I guess.   Good God, man! Restrain yourself!   A longer part would have been hilarious.   Oh, my god. I forgot he was in that movie! You're absolutely right!   Like the big climbing puzzles to get Altair's armor. Those were badass!   Was it really only 60? It felt like it went on for so long!   I think he's always been a Christian. He's just being a lot more open about it now.   I think it's amazing. You should at least give it a try.   I'd think it would be a much more mature Invader Zim, considering that guy wrote IZ.   I know it's not a real accent, but that weird shit from After Earth. Like... It's just bad.   /r/punk can help you out. They have regular posts about bands from certain countries, genres, etc.   It's always been his character. Easy to recognize.   It's true, though. Miatas are good cars, but people won't shut up about them.   I'm learning about it in school right now. Albeit in an optional class...   I feel stupid. I thought "flared" meant angry.   The guy's insane!   The AmA in question: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yo925/hi_im_rob_i_wrote_animal_friends_floating_orange/      A free doughnut?   That's not true. It went April, June, August, October, November. Only that last one actually came in about a month.   Isn't that like a tie-in with Flags of Our Fathers?   The graphics are actually still fairly good looking.  The game's aged really well.  I feel like, with that in mind, and HD remake would look pretty amazing.   Wow, thanks for explaining that. I hope everything gets better, soon.   Thanks for answering. That lighting actually sounds really cool!   I finally get to one of these early enough and I can't think of a question! I'll just settle with saying that the game looks amazing and I'm excited to see where else it goes! Big fan of Obsidion. Good luck!  Edit: OOH! I thought of some. What thing about PoE has you most excited? Also, what would you say is the most unique thing about the game?   Yeah... I'm usually not phased by gore, but... I think I'll just leave this one alone.   I usually do fine with gore, but I'm afraid to click literally every link in this thread.   I'm honestly curious if *this* would make someone cut again or want to stop right then.   Tellmewhatstherebecauseimscared   Post it. Now.   I understand you not liking Thrice's change in style, but personally, I thought they were just as good in the end. Obviously for different reasons, though.   Yeah, I liked then until Johnny left. Then it just wasn't the same.   I would've told my friend to go fuck himself. That's really shitty that he made you leave because he didnt want to be there.   "Sweetie, are you having some stomach problems?" "Jesus, no! I was just beating off."   But all of the content seems to be from the 90s.    Holy shit, that *is* him in Raising Arizona, isn't it?   Nope   It's a famous scream that's heard in a LOT of movies.    This would be awesome if I wasn't TERRIFIED of open water.   I believe AC4 had an in-game answer about a modern AC. Something along the lines of vehicles not fitting the kind of game they want AC to be.   I think he always has the ring, he just doesn't wear it in the real world, where Mal is dead. In the dream world it's back on his finger because Mal is "alive" there. I could be completely wrong, though.   Written by the guy that writes the Walking Dead comics, too.   Those new-ish automatic shifters (like on the Prius) are the fucking devil at my wash. I've worked there over a year and still can't figure out accessory mode.   Only slightly related, but those stupid alarm systems that make the car *HONKHONKHONK* whenever you open or close the doors are ridiculous.   "Bless your heart" is the rudest way of saying that they pity you. And it hurts.   DAMMIT! DOLLARS, MAN, *DOLLARS!*   That whole trilogy is awesome!   Fuck, barely anyone remembers it now! 100 years just sounds silly.   What the fuck? Why? Those are fucking weird.   I was thinking the same about the second. I mean, Jesus...         Oh, I see. Thanks!   Does anyone know what the difference between part 1 and 2 is going to be? I just want to know so I don't end up buying 2 games when it wouldn't be necessary. Sorry if this is a stupid question.  Edit: words   You could always just grab Deadpool Classic. Or I started with Merc With a Mouth, which is an amazing collection.   It *was* short, but I had fun and that's all that matters.   Jack.   Despite them obviously going against the canon, I think this game still looks pretty good. As a fan of both the books and the movies, I'm kind of excited for this.   I always just assumed they were really sturdy clothes lines in AC.   It is. If people don't specify, I just assume its american unless I see a flag or something.   I'm not really sure if I'm using the right words, but I meant like of they're doing it to make fun of themselves or something else.   Not if it's self aware.   It felt like a bag of sand.   FO3 and NV as well.   I've had the memorized for all Bethesda games since Oblivion.   Well, to have a subreddit about the lack of belief in something makes no sense. It's the same as having a subreddit for people who don't like the color blue or don't use Netflix. An anti circle jerk is pretty likely for such a pointless idea. I don't feel superior, I just think that the idea is ridiculous.   I think the worst ones are fucking seasonal achievements that you can only get at one point of the year it was put on and then never again.   Mine, too. It took forever to delete so I went to turn the TV off and let it do its thing, but turned the Playstation off without thinking. The file got corrupted and promptly took 2.5 hours to delete.   *That's* it! You're right. I guess, now, the question is, what does it do to you?   Why does that name sound so nasty?   Uhhhh, Suzuki X-90, brah!   I mean for more games. There just aren't enough on it, at the moment.   Dominic Robilliard, previous experience: creative director of an unreleased game with excessive amounts of hype.   I agree. I wish I'd waited a little for more games to come out. All I've used my PS4 for lately is Bluray, Netflix, and ACIV. Other than that, it's all PS3 and PC.   I organize them by genre (not very well, either), but I like the idea of "not completed," "completed," etc. I might switch to that.   I see a dog.   That's my favorite model of the STI. I think I just like cars that are a bit more square, I don't know.   The SX4 automatic has AWD as well.   I think you're replying to the wrong guy. I was just pointing out that 300 was based on a comic book. Looking back on it, I'm not sure if it really added to the argument or anything because the comic book is based on history, but is extremely fictitious.   The photo description says that it was also simultaneously stinging him.   I just saw you guys with ABR. I'm totally going again.   Yeah. Not everybody has the same taste.   My two favorite indie games, by far.   Yes, but 300 was based on a graphic novel that doesn't claim to be accurate in any way.   I agree. I just can't get into it.   Jesus, deep water terrifies me.  	91

You aren't the only one who is impacted by your choice to eat meat.

Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.  [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):  Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.  On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption.   The [Center For Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom) (the group behind most of the anti-PETA campaign centered on their website petakillsanimals.com) also runs a website, humanewatch.org, dedicated to cricizing HSUS.

Once again trying to mimic us vegans!      [Check out this fish playing sports](http://i.imgur.com/GPUQ1tx.gifv)!   I think this is an issue that needs to be approached from a utilitarian perspective. There certainly are benefits that can come from any sort of research, particularly medical research. On the other hand, experimenting on animals almost certainly causes them a great deal of misery.   We ought to make every effort to minimize the harm caused by any experiment, maximize the expected benefit, and only allow experiments to be conducted if the expected benefit exceeds the expected amount of harm caused.   That said, we presently tend to have a terrible bias of underestimating the harm our actions cause to non-human animals. At the same time there is no reason why this should only apply to non-human animals either. Humans are much better test subjects for studying human diseases. If we would gain far better knowledge by breeding humans to test upon instead of breeding chimpanzees and both groups would suffer much the same from an experiment, then there is no reasonable excuse for not testing on the humans.

 It's going to go places! Right now, I have a book in the works, but this universe is next once I'm done. I like the idea of a Nordic looking species though. And I've got you all to thank because without the input, this universe would be scrapped.    I want the 'modded' not to be human, but an species that looks like them. The serum thats injected just enhances their physique so they can survive on their homeworld that's incredibly dangerous. The serum doesn't have any deadly side effects, and is only injected once into an new born of the species. It enhances the subject's speed and strength to super soldier levels and accelerates the healing processes of the body. Their hands and feet also become larger and prehensile and grow a layer of thick hair.   But if injected into a human, the serum can and will kill them unless it's been altered in someway. If given to an exposed, their powers will suddenly overload and become uncontrollable.       Yeah, I've seen it. The teenage Evolved could be inspired by superheroes of the past and try to use their abilities to help people or cause destruction. They're powers should be low key, like enhanced intelligence or strength.    I like the idea of 'modded' humans or a human-like species. Like if they injected newborns at birth and changed their physiology, similar to the Apex in Starbound. The Evolved I could see becoming major villians with a massive God complex. The exposed could be like metahumans in the new Flash tv show, developing powers, but with downsides.    I'm thinking that a race of plant-like aliens would be naturally canivorus, even when raised around other races, they still have a hankering for meat. Another race of humanoids with wings, are naturally airheaded and while they can focus on tasks, they don't really grasp other aspects of human life because they're born to fly. Some species's nature will always shine though.     A species made out of living sound, interesting. I imagine that they might need a special suit to contain themselves or be able to stay cohesive naturally. Or they could forge special collars made of a hyperconductive metal to keep themselves together.     Well for starters, the story is about identity. Technology has advanced to the point where 3D printing is like microwaving a pizza and energy weapons are old tech. Space travel is similar to Star Wars, easy to use and accesible to everyone. The story is primarily about finding your identity in the midst of a crisis. The backstory is that the six races fought against a ancient race of robots, The Forbearers. During this 50 year war, civilian lives were torn apart as planets were consumed. The main character is a human named Norm who was raised alongside other orphans from the other races. The aliens are similar in terms of systems of logic, but mortality is different; however, since they were raised in a military orphanage, the human system of morality is prevelant. I just needed help in coming up with ideas for various races. Thanks for the questions though!    Hey Redditors,   I need ya'lls help. I've been thinking about a science fiction story and I've been wondering about races. I know humans will be included, but I need help coming up with about six other races, two of which will become the major antagonists.      The Chaotic One- A young mage who killed and drew on the power of a ancient god, ascending to near unstoppable power. The only way the newly formed adventurer's guild stopped him was by locking him in a artificially constructed dimension known as The Patchwork World. They then destroyed the portal and destroyed all records of the incident. The only known key to the Patchwork World was placed in rotative custody.   Mad Jack- A serial killer who appears to have a fake face with a Glasglow grin. It's said that his laughter can kill and that his arms and legs can rotate unnaturally. City Watchmen have seen him multiple times, but can't seem catch him. Has an female accomplice/girlfriend whose name is unknown. Mad Jack's modus operandi seems to be the removal of body parts he doesn't like. The victims all seem to be around the ages of 30-70, men and women, all of which have their genitals, toes and fingers removed, with Orcs having tusks violently ripped out of their jaws. He is still at large.   Cleric D'Trac- A former cleric in a small town, this mass murderer teleported his entire chapel along with every resident in the town, into a mysterious dimension. Over the course of several weeks, corpses of the towns folk began appearing in major cities, covered in scars of varying size and a foul smelling purple liquid. Some of the bodies seemed to be partially eaten. D'Trac was found in the city of Cactus Bluffs in the early morning hours, with missing right eye. His left ear had been replaced with a partially sutured on Elven ear and his arms and left half of his face was covered in a purple sludge. He was rambling on about the end of all days and how 'we are awash in a bath of sin'. When questioned, D'Trac revealed that he had tried to purify his followers but some 'Didn't listen.' Deemed insane, he has been sent to a maximum security asylum for magic users.         A race generator   Congrats!   All of dwarves, both male and female, have facial hair to some degree and possess the ability to transform into stone at will. That aside, they're actually very intelligent and their cities are major centers of commerce, and their mine-shafts are a shining example of their architectural skills.  Their culture will be touched upon in the current book I'm working on, but in a nutshell it falls into two categories. 1.Are you a warrior? and 2. If your a mage, get the hell out of our city. Dwarves dislike mages because their abilities are destructive and dangerous, especially when used in mining. Dwarves are also very conservative people, preferring to stick with what they know than go outside the box. As a culture they enjoy beer and have a yearly festival for the beverage. They worship Tal'ton the god of the Forge and Tal'an, his wife the goddess of the mines. They also seem to love adopting human children.       It's really fun and well written. Do you think my take on dwarves was a little stereotypical?   Cool. I'm taking a more 'Prattchet-eque' approach, wherein I have a new group of characters for each story and have a big crossover to tie them together.    So what's the main plotline of the story?   The Skyweavers are dragons, right?   That's interesting, because every nation has a standing army, but they aren't really racially exclusive. And I haven't really thought about a pantheon, I guess I should do that!   Hey Redditors, Today is a sad day today. I entered my remedial college Math class today and sat down to work on a review. As I read over the problems, I realized to my horror and embarrassment that I couldn't remember what I worked so hard to remember for the entire week. Now, I need you all's help because I've come to the conclusion that these Math courses aren't going to work with my disability. Are there any alternatives or ideas to get around these classes? And how do you guys deal with the anger, frustration and depressiveness that comes with this?   Well, at first I wanted to defy that expectation of 'Dark Elves are always surly and psychopathic.' Then i realized that they could be somewhat like the Canadians of Pantaria; friendly and pleasant to everyone, so I stuck with that.   In-universe the Dark Elves are nice because they're neutral when it comes to warfare. Even though they build a lot of weapons and advanced magical items, they don't use them unless they're adventurers. Over the years, this has made them overall a calm and kind race that has the highest interspecies adoption rate of any other.          Dwarves- Depends on their relation to you. Family members tend to be hugged, but only if their human. Dwarven family members great each other by punches to the gut and face. Dwarves great teammates like anyone else, a friendly word and handshake does it just fine. Dwarven culture is centered around strength. The stronger you are, the more valued you are in the family. Mages are looked down upon due to they're less than stellar physical strength.    Orcs- Orcs snort at each other. The louder the snort, the more fond they are of you. A short snort means they don't like you. Orcs are a race based around teamwork and food. Most Orcs are great a cooking and value chefs of any caliber. As a result, it's not uncommon to hear snorts coming from Orc kitchens or restaurants.     Dark Elves- Dark Elves are the friendlist of races and they greet other races with a wave of their hand and the offering of a drink. No matter where you are, NEVER turn down a dark elf's offering of a drink. Dark Elves are all about sharing knowledge, so if you absolutely can't drink, tell them a story.    Light Elves- High elves insult you due to they're elitist society. If they really like you, the worse the insult. It's not uncommon for a light elf to be found in a pub, swearing at his or her companions.   Zarians- Zarians will assume your form or voice as a sign that they like you. It's not really a sign of respect, more of a assurance that they acknowledge you enough to say, 'I like you, so I'll become you.' Needless to say, most people find this really creepy.   Clawtians- They purr. Thats it, they're cat people, what more do you want?  Gnomes- Gnomes will clink their tools together, symbolizing their societal belief of equality among all trades. When with other races, they do this to bond.        Well, just think about real life, and apply the fantastic. For example, I've created a Community College for wizards. The humor comes from the fact that it's a normal institution but given a fantasy twist.     I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.  Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is usless in a phsyical fight.   Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing. He sucks at hand to hand and relies on trickery and dirty tactics to win.   Daniel- I know he's a young swordsman, but I need ya'lls help for him in terms of personailty and quirks  Kara is a young woman who is raised by dwarves. As a result, she is capable of defending herself in hand to hand combat and is the only party member who is able to hold off multiple opponents single handily. However, while she is a badass, Kara isn't very good in social situations and due to the dwarven tradition of judo throwing people as a way of saying 'hello', this leads to some really awkward situations.       I would suggest playing Dungeons of Dredmore or read the Discworld series. Both are examples of humor in a fantasy story.    "Hey cutie, you awake?" a high pitched male voice asked me. I felt a hand on my shoulder and my eyes fluttered open. I was in what appeared to be a sort of temple, like the Parthenon. Then I screamed when I saw who shook me awake. A guy around my age, with matching features; black crew cut hair, brown skin and green eyes; but wearing what appeared to be a ratty blonde wig, mini-skirt and ill fitting pink t-shirt. His all too familiar eye brows crinkled in confusion.  "Um, you okay hot stuff?" he asked, stepping back. Another guy who looked exactly like him but wearing a stained lab-coat and googles came up behind him and peered at me.  "Christopher of Earth 2607, are you alright?" he asked in a posh British accent. He waved what appeared to be a metal rod with a yellow crystal at the end over me and smiled broadly.  "Oh great, your body and psyche survived the transdimensional transference." he announced.  "Wait, what on Earth is going on?!" I shouted. Then it hit me.  "Y-you're all me!" I shouted, pointing to the scientist and the man in the miniskirt. They both nodded.  "Well, more like alternative versions of you. Each on of us is like you in someway, but we're also different." said scientist me. "For example, Marshmallow here is a version of you who is a crossdresser." he said, gesturing to the man in the skirt. "I on the other hand, grew up in London and graduated Oxford with my doctorate in Theoretical Physics."   "At twenty?" I asked skeptically. Oxford shrugged. "Yes, but on my version of Earth, everyone is a genius, so that's like graduating from preschool." He turned and clapped his hands. A group of around ten different versions of me came out from behind the columns. One version of me was wearing what appeared to be futuristic Roman legionnaire armor and carrying a energy sword. Another was wearing a dark blue hood and body armor, with a bow slung over his back. A few versions weren't even human. One was a lizard-man, wearing jeans and a t-shirt that said 'Go sun yourself'. A raccoon with black fur and green eyes scampered up to me and sniffed at my jeans leg.   "Aw, hey little fella!" I crooned and extended a hand to scratch his ear but his paw batted my hand away.  "No touching the merchandise pal!" he growled in a New York accent. I looked back at Oxford in shock.   "I'm a raccoon in another universe?!" Oxford nodded.  "Yes, I should've told you that sometimes evolution ensures that humans aren't always the dominate species. Resident of former Earth 56 is a-"   "Wait, you said former Earth. Why?" I asked, a bad feeling growing in my stomach. Oxford frowned and began rubbing the back of his neck, the same way that I did when I get nervous.   "Yes, well that's the problem. Our home Earths are being destroyed. I've been able to pull a few of us from other universes to here." He gestured to the building. "A pocket universe. We'd be safe here, but that's not the point. Right now, the entire multiverse is in danger. If too many alternate Earths are destroyed, the multiverse will lose stability."   "And if that happens everything falls apart?" I finished. Oxford nodded. "Yes, I'm afraid that's what will happen unless we do something fast. We'll need to go to each of our home Earths and begin investigating. If we can find the source of what is causing this 'incursion' we should be able to stop it." I frowned. "Why do you need me?" I asked. "I'm just a colledge student." Oxford smiled.  "We need you because your the bravest one out of all of us." He handed me a silver bracelet with a red gemstone. "That is a teleport back to here. If anything goes wrong, press that gem and you'll be warped right back." Roman me steped forward and placed his hand on my shoulder.   "I will take you to my Earth, doppleganger." he said in a voice that was much deeper than mine. I nodded, feeling slightly intimidated. This version of me was six feet tall and build like a linebacker. A glowing 'rip'  appeared in the air before me. I could see a hazy image of some sort of training room, or was it a locker room, it was hard to tell. Oxford cleared his throat.   "When you are on another world, do not mention anything about your own world. Doing so will have devastating consequences." He said. I nodded and Roman me placed and hand on my shoulder.  "Come. We have work to attend to." he said, before we both entered the breach.                           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjnkuoLXBmg   Mines Chwells16!   Lanable Hector.   I would love 3d printed Yogscast figurines    If you want to be an adventurer, you need to be able to fight, either with magic or weapons. Even then, you need to be a subordinate under a more experienced adventurer, basically an intern. You get paid crap, you get thrown into deadly situations and you most likely will wind up with some broken bones or a magical ailment. You still there and not running off in terror? Wow, you must be pretty brave Intern ZakTH. So basically adventures are dolled out in order of importance. Is there a massive creature rising up out of the ocean, attacking the coast? Higher priority than a goblin raid on a small town.The Guild's are typically sponsored by cities in order to have the adventuer's help to defend them if needed. Street crime is off limits though and the City Watch (police officers) will deal with that.    Freelancers will usually take care of low level adventures, like finding lost trinkets or clearing out bandits. They don't get paid much, but people tend to like them more than the big name adventures because they're willing to help.         Well, for starters, Pantaria's magic is like physics. It's a core part of the world. Mages, are people born with the ability to tap into and wield magic. Wizards are born with the ability to control magic, but they can't tap into like mages, so they use objects that are enchanted (charged) with magic to perform feats. Witches are exclusivly women and some gay men who must use potions and ingredients to cast spells. Warlocks are magic users who have an affinity for magic that is taboo, such as being a living voodoo doll, mind flaying or summoning demons at will. Their powers are also bound to them and it's hard for a Warlock to use other types of magic. All magic users must be witty to a degree.  Magic has rules in-universe, as it is a physical law. Some forms of magic like typical firebolts, icebolts and polymorphism are soft scale magic. However, hard magic comes in when things like summoning eldritch beings from other planes are involved.    Adventuring isn't that profitable unless your with The Guild of Adventures, a team of adventurer's who get a reasonable salary based on the fact that they take on big name cases. They're so big that they can afford a headquarters building in the nicer district in FoxCliff; a major city. A freelance adventurer might make enough for a apartment if they undertook around ten missions a day. What really draws young adventurer's in is the prospect of finding a massive amounts of treasure and fame. The entire industry is meant to be similar to being a You-tuber, but with more of a risk of death.    Yo Redditors! I'm working on a new book and figured you guys could help me out by fleshing out the world. Basically, it's set in a middle ages themed  world where magic is like science and adventuring is an industry. The primary characters are adventuring interns. I need to make this quick, but AMA!    Pantaria has tons of magic types, like divisions of science. I have golem crafting, advanced golem crafting, dimension travel, deity magic, standard elemental magic, necromancy, summoning magic, hedge wizardry, Booze wizardry (yeah, it's just what you think. Great at parties), bibilomancy, time travel, dark arts, grey arts, white arts, warlock and witch magic, zoological magic, physics magic and potion brewing/enchanted object creation.  Magic is a primary force in the world, so it's grown over time, much like science. It started with basic elemental manipulation, but some people are born with an affinity towards on type of magic.    	33
 I'm looking for advice on how to improve my current make up or what to buy and how to use it based on my features and skill level which is very beginner...The first two pictures are me with make-up the last is without...I currently use:   foundation: rimmel London stay matte primer, Maybelline dream fresh bb, and an organic brand loose powder.  eye: bonne bell eyeliner in black, cover girl eyeenhancers shadow in sombre relzadora which is white with sparkle, covergirl lashblast fusion.  brows: flamingo brow pencil in light brown...its an off brand Asian company I believe.       Mine have gone back after decent sized stretches, I stretched mine 3 times so far...The first time they shrunk back to 8g in 2 days...the second time they shrunk back to 8g in 3 days...and I'm currently still on the third stretch...Actually I went to a 00g all 3 times...it is possible for certain people...everybody has different skin elasticity and heals differently.    That sounds awesome! Thank you!    Do you think your friend would be willing to consider taking on doing a strangers? lol. I'm having no luck, and I'm not talented enough to do them myself.   Does anyone on this page know how or know someone who does... that is located near or in Halifax, Nova Scotia?   Thank you! :)   I didn't have any help what so ever, it took me 3 hours the first time...But, I've gone back and put in double elastics so I'd say 4-4.5...lol   Hmmm, that is odd. And thank you! :) I definitely will, I've gotten so many compliments since then that I honestly can't even believe it...People I don't even know have stopped me in person just to tell me they look good. I really appreciate your comment, its really nice to receive more positivity than negativity. :)   I doubt theres enough people for it to catch on, and I'm glad you're not...However, I posted them here and received down votes etc. And was basically told I would continue to be down voted just a heads up...ahah. I joined r/FancyFollicles    Thanks! And yes, they are...They're handmade by Heather at Divinity Dreads. She's amazing...And I went with the synth route because I have very short hair at the moment, I have thin, straight hair, and I wasn't sure if they would suit me so I thought a non committed approach would work best for me! And these locs are a million times nicer than anything I could achieve naturally...mine would look like braids   Its okay, these are not dread falls though...They're extensions that braid in and they are natural colors so they blend with my normal hair...They essentially look like dreads.   I'm pretty sure having synth dreads doesn't make me goth...you're either really rude or a frigging trollll. They literally look like real dreads except I'm honest enough to say they're not....   Well, the shampoo seems to be sulfate free...and actually after buying the conditioner I stopped using it almost immediately because the one I bought doesn't say its cone or sulfate free...it only says color and parabens...But thank you for the input! :)       Is this shampoo free from enough chemicals(parabeans, silicone, color, etc) that its good to use on dreads or instead of going shampoo free?      I guess I could've phrased it a lot better...but I posted to a fitness sub reddit because I was hoping I could get better advice that way. If I just wanted to feel better about myself I would've posted something to facebook or somewhere similar.    Actually I was wondering if it is the best way to measure my fat to weight ratio and what range I fall under. It is not about feeling better about myself emptily. I am still exercising and trying to lose the weight and I intend to continue with it. No matter what response I got I intended to keep exercising. I honestly just want to know the best way to calculate this sort of thing so that I can measure my progress...Because there's really no physical difference yet as far as muscle etc.    Thanks! :) I really do want to work on tone and building muscle so I will continue to try but I feel much better about my current weight now.   	20

    Appropriate spanking is needed in this country. There is absolutely nothing wrong with slapping your child across the mouth when he or she back talks, how else will they learn not to???         Because now is the time we prove to the world that our system works, not bend it, twist it, manipulate it and prove precisely why it doesn't. There is a larger picture here. The general publics media-fueled primitive thirst for instant vengeance is not beneficial to this country.  	5
    I'm currently struggling with a similar situation, and I can tell how she feels about me; but I am uncertain as to how I feel about her. It's a horrible feeling to think that you may be leading someone, who actually cares for you, on a fruitless journey, and how you may have to end the relationship sooner so they don't get hurt as much.   Lol I learned that with my very first girlfriend.    That Ace Ventura gif made me lose it XD   That was quite the topic change...  	5
 Thank you, that's a good point, when they're like old and their kids google their parents this is going to come up and require a bit of explaining..   Thank you, that wasn't explained very well. (Or at least i've only had 1 cup of coffee this morning..)   Sorry, does someone mind mind explaining this? - Did they "miss out" due to the injunction lapsing?    That's pretty average!   I agree, but in the same breath sometimes takes competing formats to determine the best winner for the consumer. However the obvious question is can such an 'alien' technology survive the invariable comparison between 2 proprietary formats?   (As someone who sold blank DVD and DVD player/recorders during the DVD -R +R format can tell you, that was bloody confusing enough for consumers!)   Thanks Op! It's worth pointing out the halo around the lights could easily be caused by finger grease on the lens on the m8.    How do you miss this during the editing process??  I haven't come across this *yet.*   Yes! And that's made me think of another: A whole article on "user comments"!   Let's let the users make up the click bait for us!?    I'm so not surprised though. Here's what I've noticed:  Spelling mistakes.  Advertising masquerading as "news articles"    Extremely biased articles.   Very piss poorly researched articles.  (Aka: people who abuse the party X when a quick Google forces to light they're actually lying through their teeth.)  Poorly executed articles.  (Aka: look out for rampant  weed X which should be reported to MAF, but didn't bother to include a photo)  Any more examples anyone can think of?    Yes, that makes sense.   Maybe Samsung are betting upon this?    I hope someone like Anandtech takes the time to run a comparison.   Mint. I fingered one at the local telecom store, very light!    No, most users it will be fine. However this may be a purchasing decision some take into account. However factor in 1 minute of 4k is around 1GB. So if you have some guy showing off to his mates and you're quickly going run out of room :-P    Surprising really. I had a quick Google with A few different keyword variants with no hits. Even this was difficult to find.   Yeah, 9gb is quite a whack of data. In the same breath though 23gb should be adequate for "most" users.   Yes, (I believe so anyway) they release it in [gibibyte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) rather than gigabyte.   Yeah, the original news article stating users could do so was wrong (misinformed perhaps).   I would presume so?    Thanks for the comparison. But the note has an sd slot supporting sdxc so not that much of an issue.    I couldn't find a comparison with 32gb, but here's a link to show 16gb devices (from last year)  [This is the only 1 I could find.

Looks like a very well rounded device, they've addressed quite a few complaints about the S5 - speaker placement, camera quality, build quality, fingerprint scanner, heartrate monitor, TouchWiz GUI.  And just improved upon what makes Samsung devices really nice - Screen quality.  I'm sure they implemented some wizardry with the Exynos and the AMOLED as there was an article in /r/android last night fron Engadget a while ago. They implemented stuff like ignoring refreshing pixels that don't change based upon what's on the screen, which helped up to 10% better battery life on the S5, little doubt this has helped the battery last so long despite the bump in pixels on the S6.

I looked that up, but nothing came up so it must be a different phrase, but it figures there is even a phrase for stuff like that.   That makes sense.  Thanks for the laugh too, I suppose that's actually half the issue - we're almost programmed to find most things to do with toilets amusing, which probably doesn't help.     Indeed.  Perhaps at this stage the majority of the audience doesn't want film/show makers to use them, and that's set the line in the sand.

I see what you did there.. :D   No, your video games comment is fair enough, you don't expect such realism such video games (Can you imagine.. "Press A to take a piss")  But from gritty movies, i thought there would be more of a use to draw people into the realism?   That sounds like a reasonable explanation.    Is it too taboo?   Or is there some sort of regulatory requirement that would make the shows PG+ when a toilet is mentioned, or shown?  Is it considered too low brow to mention anything toilet related in shows or movies?  Or perhaps it's done to simply speed things along?  What do people think? Should we have more realistic toilet behaviours displayed on our televisions and theatres?   That's a pretty shit phone review.  For a start  "As an example, with a day that was full of gaming and picture taking, the battery died just past the 10 hour mark." how completely unscientific can you be? Couldn't they at least posted SOT or battery stats of this?  And then in the "positives" putting "Battery life just above average" that doesn't sound like a positive to me.  And the camera review, what a fucking joke he didn't even clean the camera lens, you can tell by the massive light ghosting in the bar shots there's grease on the lens.  Feels like this phone was handed to someone who's owned a few smart phones, felt like they were a pro in reviewing and went to the bar, had a few beers and wrote this up in an hour or two.  Not impressed.   But why would we feel bad?  They are still the only aluminium and glass high end phone available in most markets, why change what works? The reviews for the latest device aren't anywhere near as scathing as the S5 reviews (Remember everyone's favourite catchup for bagging the S5? -"Evolution over revolution") so while it's not the best move they played it safe.  They may not have Samsung's mega dollars to be able to release an entirely new device within the short life cycle that people are coming to expect from cellphone makers these days, and why would they? The market responded [favourably](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=2498.TW#symbol=2498.TW;range=) to the move, so actually they've done quite well.   Well said.   Hold on there, I'm not talking an escalator- I'm talking a luggage carousel - you know the type that the baggage handlers put the luggage on.   For a start [they can easily trap fingers and hands](http://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/08/12/1079731/naia-worker-gets-hand-stuck-baggage-conveyor) and then they took it through to an OSH and security nightmare, that provides direct access to the tarmac. At every airport I've ever been there are signs saying don't ride the carousel, and don't go through the curtain..   I would expect a 5 year old to do this, not a ***16 and 17 years old***      Makes sense. I guess if you have enough money time doesn't really factor in to things as much as I thought they did.   Doing it when you've been explicitly told not to do anything stupid due to what happened last year- Last year the group burned a shape of a penis in the ground, trashed the joint they were staying, and burnt "SBC" in the ground.  [Source](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9910813/St-Bedes-students-misbehave-at-rowing-regatta)  So to further horse around and they knew the school wasn't going to take it lightly.   Yes, purely based upon previous observation. However, now the reviews have come out, peoples tone has changed significantly.   It wasn't in the beginning. I think it got worse after the rest of the reviews came out....   Thank you. Truly thank you. This really surprises me I would not have thought 1 year even from conception to product would be nearly enough time!  If I could afford to I would guild you for being the only person to back up what you're saying with some background knowledge.  Radically different takes 2 years - so you reckon the S6 edge has been in the works for 2 years? Or were they just eye watering quick at the R D for it?    Why?   How long does it take then?   Do you know for 100% certain it only takes 1 year?  Why are you assuming they can do it quicker?  Edit: Call me delusional but no have no proof backing it up? Proof provided.   That makes sense. I was going off what I know, and what I presumed to me *should* take that long. Why so many people took it upon themselves to hate me for it is so utterly beyond me.   Without anyone able who knows the process we may never know for certain.    Then that was my bad.    Not sure if you're being sarcastic?   ..They are assholes...  They knowingly took it upon themselves to enter an area that was off limits while representing a school they attend.  At the very least they had no thoughts for how this might reflect upon the school, let alone the poor teacher/aide who was suppose to be watching them.  Let's say, worst case scenario from their little trip- they could have shut the whole fucking airport down for 30 minutes inconveniencing hundreds of people.   They are Assholes for being inconsiderate little pricks for the purpose of thirty seconds of personal amusement.    Frustrated that people clearly don't realize how long HTC have been working on this phone, and that compounds my level of disappointment in them for fucking it up.      Thank you. Prepare your Asshole for the downvotes, but you are sooooo right.   This isn't "catastrophic" but it is a joke.  The S6 uses both the CPU and storage speed boost for really nifty things like increasing the camera boot time to allow you to open it very quickly with only a couple taps of the home button.  A slower processor and this would not be possible.  Also the mobile industry falls heavily upon benchmarks, and graphs to show better phone, the majority of people never really play with their flash new device for any more than a few minutes in stores, so rely on the internet to prove why it should buy 1 device over another.  A difference of 23000 *benchmark* points most certainly will pull those with no brand loyalty to the faster device.   There is no other draw card HTC have here. (And don't you dare mention design, if they wanted design they would have already bought the M8 over the S5. You can't panda to the same audience for 3 years running (aluminium and glass) without nearing the saturation point in a lot of markets.   HTC needed a "Wow factor" and this chipset is not it.   I'm loving the denial in this thread:  "It's not going to make a shit phone, it's an awesome phone, it's **just** running a shit processor."  "It's not going to be any slower than a Samsung S6, benchmarks don't mean anything in the real world."  "They didn't throttle the chip, it's just software tweaks."  HTC have had YEARS to play with the 810.. (Seriously, phone development takes at least 2+ years from drawing board to anything close to fruition. Even when you're only tweaking the previous iteration)  And this is the *best* they could come up with!?  Go on, downvote me, you know damn well I'm right.   Yes, a very accurate title there, "Timeless design" as it's same god damn design every time you look at it!   Yeah.. He completely and utterly ignores the fact consumers are clamouring for bigger, brighter, more pixel dense screens, while also screaming for faster, more powerful processors all while browsing Facebook.  Battery technology  Average consumer demands   Yay for a Government which allows this! /S  Edit: Thank you kind Redditor for explaining this.   Maybe these kids are trying to be like their hero Gerry Brownlee maybe.    No, it's an integrated school. Thought that too.  Not sure what the different is..   Thanks, did a search for St Bede's, it didn't come up.   This headline makes me happy.   We need significantly more people who think like him in every major election everywhere around the world.   The US just confiscated a $180 million boat shipment of cocaine from Colombian drug traffickers... To be destroyed by the Customs Authorities. Slowly.. Gram by gram..   Oh I wonder who could  be behind this... /s   Yeah. You've pretty much got it.    *Slow clap*               Perhaps this will succeed for the same reason as custom pc's (alienware, home built etc) still exist in a world of computer/laptop companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP etc.     No, somewhat unbelievably.  I bought a new battery which actually got worse SOT, then realised it was for an i9505, not an i9506, even then I got 3 hours SOT.    I now understand why in Far Cry 4 they ask you like 5 times if you're sure want to fight the Honey Badger..   I would disagree, I reliably got 12 hours standby + 4 hours SOT with my S4.  And by reliably I mean for 6 plus months this was my consistant benchmark.  If I got less than that I knew and hunted down the Application responsible.  When it dropped consistantly to 3 hours SOT plus 12 hours standby I did a factory reset and that took it back up to 4 hours.. So the key to any good measure is reliability, SOT is able to be a reliable benchmark.   As would I, the frustration however arises from when minorities are allowed concessions that the majority does not feel are warranted by their requirements, or religious beliefs.  This potentially stems from a few things:  * Misunderstanding the core religious laws which require consumer law to be changed in order to comply.  * Frustration at the laws passed for religious reasons that allow a religious person a significant concession while still applying the same law heavily upon non-believers.  Surely you can understand the frustration when one must relinquish their tweezers, while a potentially sharp metal object designed to protect oneself is allowed on board without question due to ones religious beliefs.   Thank you, that makes sense, as mentioned above I had 3 lemonade mixed with flavoured vodka, the end of each drink was significantly more bitter/tart tasting than the rest of the drink. So what you're saying makes sense.   Thank you kind redditor for your response, I'lll use a cosy next time to drink the drink cooler to avoid the bitterness!   Thank you very much, I was drinking lemonade with feijoa flavored Vodka, the last gulp of all 3 drinks were quite bitter compared to the remainder of the drink.   I thought it was due to the ethanol sinking to the bottom of the water, but thank you for explaining it's mixed throughout the drink. I think in my particular circumstance /u/MoltenSlag has hit the nail on head in that it's due to the fizzy escaping the drink, coupled with a rise in temperature, makes sense.  Thank you kind redditor for your reply. :)   Yup, you can only park on your side of the road, not against oncoming traffic.   Also this:  https://www.practice.co.nz/pass-planner/intermediate/multi-lane-roads/turning-into-one-way-streets.aspx  Except instead of going into their own lane, everyone will go into the lane furtherest away.       No worries! Really love showing off nz to the world, we have stunning scenery, and if you're a night owl the most picturesque impossibly clear night skies imaginable. Especially in the lower south island.  Oh one more thing, while it's legal for 2 drivers to turn left and right respectively into a multi laned road (each turn into road path nearest to them) most drivers cut wide and turn into the other lane, so best to only go if you're certain they will turn into their lane. Sorry if that doesn't make sense I can draw you something.    Well.. There have been shit battery figures quoted and thermal issues, hopefully fix the thermal issues and battery life may increase?    Does anyone need to be reminded of the bloody Adidas All black jersey debacle? Rebel were selling the All Blacks Jersey for $220 NZD despite the fact it could be bought online for half that, the supplier- Adidas refused to back down on having a ludicrously high cost price and basically told kiwis you will pay what I fucking want to charge you cunts. No shut up and give me your money.  [Adidas New Zealand refuses to reduce its wholesale price of the All Blacks jersey but says the move by retailers to reduce their price is "good for consumers".](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/5411809/Adidas-gets-a-mauling-over-All-Blacks-jersey)  [More sauce.](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/5411809/Adidas-gets-a-mauling-over-All-Blacks-jersey)   Good to hear! :)   Don't know, but I sometimes have to be the asshole that taps their brakes and makes the dude behind them brake hard.  For the record, 99% of the time this results in them realizing they're too close and backing off, so I suspect they're driving on autopilot, and it takes manual control (braking to avoid hitting me) to make them realize they're driving like a douche and back off.   I'll always upvote Bender quotes.   Indeed. All things considered though, actually putting it past parliament is a major hurdle.     Don't think so.........   Haha, good point!      Too true - reminds me of a apt quote worth keeping in mind -  "If something is free, you're the product."   Couldn't agree more to be honest. I drive from Bishopdale to Riccarton and back twice a day and if I had a dollar for every red light runner, every stop sign runner, every speeder or every queue jumper (using the right hand lane to jump 2 cars ahead despite free flowing traffic.) then I would not be typing this, cause I'd be a on a fucking boat in the Bahama's somewhere sipping a mojito.   Haha, if enough people can make "Jedi" the religion on an NZ census I'm sure you can get away with this.   We have deceptive times on Google between major landmarks, allow +1 hour for most journeys on your GPS.  Most of our motorways out of the major arterial routes are unlit, unpoliced and barely maintained so require constant vigilance.   We do sometimes have wandering livestock, but not very often.  And unfortunately you have to contend with the average Kiwi Driver who greatly over estimates their driving abilities.   Basic rules to be mindful of:   * Do NOT expect people to stop at STOP signs. * Do not EVER expect people will see you on the road. * Expect pedestrians to not look before stepping out on the road.  * Expect drivers to not hear your horn (wearing headphones while driving is a common passtime.) * Do not expect to just 'find a park' any where, at any point in time, always give +10 minutes to find a park in most central areas. * Expect drivers to tailgate badly (Seriously, NZ drivers love acting like the human equivalent of hemorrhoids.  * Expect drivers will speed up during passing lanes (120+km/h) * Further to the above expect drivers to be driving slowly on the motorway (80-90km/h) * Do no expect drivers to indicate * Expect drivers to pull out without looking  * When approaching a T intersection expect cars coming around the corner to cut into your lane * Basically expect dangerously * Not obeying Stop signs, Give way signs, or any kind of sign for that matter * Driving dangerous driving at all times.  * Be surprised when Drivers obey the road rules * Etc..  Edit: I'm from Chch and I encounter the above on a daily basis and I only travel about an hour or around 35km a day.   If the people grabbing the keys are indiscriminately grabbing them from extremely bad drivers, why hasn't anyone grabbed the keys from a NZ'er yet?  Edit: I am allowing for the possiblity this does or has occured and no-one's reported it?   Oh I see - he checked the wrong side first? Kinda makes sense - throw in an unknown environment, I think we can both agree it just makes for a recipe for disaster..   Gimmicks? So you're happy with the same technology being used for many years with no enhancement, no refinement, no changes from a 15 year old design?  Yes, they re expensive, so is R D. He could pump out the same old shit as everyone else at the same price as everyone else, but instead he pays vast sums of cash to engineers to do make it better.   While you agree or disagree with him as a man, you have to appreciate someone who looks at an age old design and tells themselves "I can do this better."   Indeed.   I agree with your point, although even your example has a tinge of arrogance - only looking one way when we're all taught to look both ways regardless.  If your assessment is correct, and complacency and drivers revert to a 'comfortable' level of driving on our roads then I can't help but wonder how/if we can even approach this from an education standpoint, I guess the arrows on the road are a good step, but a quick test (as many propose) would quickly become a distant memory when passing the 15th dead possum on the road from Nelson to Twizel, rendering any skills learnt at arrival void as one slips back to their standard routine.  How can you even stop this? I honestly don't think you can. (Except for the billboards advising tired drivers etc to pull over - but if they can't read English or have a tight schedule they won't care?)   Just attempting to curry favour with the Sikh population perhaps?  	131
 Well, call me selfish, but the more it's in the public, the more popular it will get, and the more attention it will receive from authorities. If head shops didn't sell it, it would never even garner any attention from anybody, you know? Sure, responsible people find out about it in head shops and start using it. Kids and people looking for legal highs find out about it too. I would rather just keep it out of the public's eye. I'm sure there's an honest head shop here and there, but it's just not fuckin worth all the publicity it causes kratom to receive, whether it's from honest head shops or elsewhere. Hell, even bath salts and spice would still be legal if it wasn't for head shops (not that they should be, but that's beside the point). Funny thing is, a lot of junkies are too myopic to order stuff from the internet, whether it's from a darknet market or from a website. Doesn't matter if it's cheaper, doesn't matter if it's safer, they can't wait a few days for it to show up. I showed all my friends how to use Silk Road, you know how many used it besides me? One. Just one, and he wasn't opioid dependent, which may have played a role. All the rest just didn't want to wait. Nobody ever wants to wait. Also, most of the junkies I know don't have a debit card, they couldn't order any bath salts from the internet if they wanted to, because they don't have the ambition to actually get a fuckin debit card, and that alone would always stop them. If bath salts and spice never hit head shops, they would both still be legal. They'd just be another couple of obscure research chemicals. TL;DR All head shops aren't bad, but they're all bad news for the fight to keep kratom legal.   Yeah man me too. I used to love the darknet. Now I go on every once in a while just cuz I'm curious, but I have to get off it before too long. I start getting ideas in my head. lol.   I imagine they don't buy hard drugs cuz they can't get them. I definitely want head shops to stop selling it. I've never even seen it in a head shop (I haven't been to one in years) but from what I gather, they mostly sell extracts, right? Just goes to show that they're trying to peddle a legal high, and not an herbal remedy... like most of us here see it as. "Bath salts" or "spice" are all the assholes and feds think when they see the shit in head shops. It's a fucked up situation man, and the shit causes me a great deal of anxiety. I don't know what I'll do if it ever gets banned. I hate to think of going on a darknet market for the shit. Next thing I know, I'll have grams of ice and H showing up at my doorstep. But, we all know that for each stupid mother fucker that abuses it and buys it in head shops, there's 10 people that buy it on the internet and use it to improve their lives in a responsible manner. It undoubtedly does more good than harm, I just hope the lawmakers can see that if the unfortunate situation arises.   Go and get yourself a prepaid debit card gift card deally and get it online. Fuck head shops.    http://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/2r0ehk/i_dropped_a_5_gram_kratom_parachute_in_my_asshole/   Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, my nigger.   Been up a while? Whatter ya? One of them damn blue collar tweakers?   I just called Thailand and told them they've got a kratom smuggler comin in hot in about 3 hours. You might wanna start sticking fingers up your bunghole now so it doesn't hurt so bad when they get their hands on ya. Maybe you can pay another passenger some kratom to help you out with it. I heard wieners work best for that sort of thing.   WHEN YOU WANT TO GO DO IT   Don't do it.   Dude. You need to get your shit together and either eat the rest of it or flush it down the toilet. I can't even imagine what life in a Thailand prison is like. The prisons over here are bad enough, and this is mother fucking America baby.   Nope. Not safe. You'll die.   It was in the bible. Jesus said "And he who hath understanding of the kratom plant shall be king shit, and I will taketh thine ballsack into my mouth and gargle it ever so gently, to the window, and to the wall, and until the sweat drippeth down thine ballsack."   Quit lyin. That's gravel you got out the parking lot bro.   Ohhhhh nvm. The way you said it, I thought she lowered your Vikes and gave you nothing else because you asked for Opanas. Ha.   Seriously?   50 mg of morphine? 1500 mg of morphine? Who knows, right? I assume since you use a shirt as a filter, you probably don't possess the equipment or the know-how to find out. Get the fuck outta here with that shit.   This guy gets it.   Every dose got me feelin like Jesus is gargling my ballsack.   Boy, that SWIM shit is beyond retarded. As if it's the whole reason G men aren't swinging in through your windows.   I dose 3 times a day, about 5 grams each time. I never take any sort of tolerance break. Sometimes I feel extra sassy, and dose a fourth time. If I do that two days in a row, my tolerance goes up a little... I feel it less the next day, but as long as I only take it 3 times that day, it'll be back to normal the day after. I think it's all about finding the perfect dose. I also mix greens with red.   I throw 2 grams under my tounge, then take a sip of water and swish it around, making sure none stays under my tongue..... and then I just kick my head back like a dog and swallow.   If you really absolutely need to know, somebody on this page can tell you: http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/contact_us.html  You'll never guess how I found that page (It starts with a G). So do I refer to you as "mastuh" from here on out or what?   I almost just fell for it again, you sneaky asshole   I was just about to search Google to find out, then I realized that would make me your bitch.   Not exactly a great range to work with, especially on something as subtle as kratom can already be.   I've read that the effects are anywhere from minimal to non-existent.   I have to combine a green (Bali) with my reds in order to get what I'm looking for. Was the Vietnam enhanced?   DO YOU GET IT   I got a pretty lose asshole. Mom used to make me sit on the bed post as a punishment when I was a little boy.    H and go. Best combo on Earth (Not on the same shot though).   I think I found him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xA0ZHEwU2Q   Yep. Will be 2 years in June. I don't know, I don't even understand what his angle is. He thinks kratom is the devil and we're all going to graduate to heroin one day because we do kratom now.    I'd be more impressed by his ability to recognize me in the obituaries when he doesn't know what my name is.   Just got this one shortly after ----- http://imgur.com/qloNVN3 ------- I've seemed to acquire an admirer on Valentine's Eve. I am truly one lucky fellow.      Sprinkle it on a hotdog    I chew. All day long. I love it. Haven't smoked a bogie in quite some time. I have asthma, so I don't give a fuck what people say, chew is way healthier for me. I love chewin on kratom but I dose at like 6:30 am, and I don't get a dip in until about 7:45 when I get to work. I can't say it really affects the kratom either way for me, although I am pretty much fiending for it by the time I get to work. I just find it makes me want the chaw more. However, thanks to the chaw, I drink about a gallon of water a day... it just makes me so thirsty. I know hydration is especially important when taking kratom, so it works out, as far as I'm concerned.   You're a dentist? You must not be a very good one, cuz my dentist always tells me to open my mouth... not shut it.   Oh ok. Makes sense.   Oh shit. I'm not. What are they?   Monstrous first dose, unless you're opioid tolerant.   I'm not pissed. I just like being vulgar sometimes.   Kratom keeps me off the heroin, you filthy fuckin asshole   Your username is wonderful.   It's been 21 months for me. I'm gonna get wrecked when I retire. lol   Could be quality issues. Or you just may not respond well to Bali. Only way to find out for sure is to try another strain (from a recommended vendor, if you aren't already using one).   WHY YOU HATIN BRO QUIT HATIN   You should definitely be worried. The cops called me the other day and said they're about to come arrest you for putting too many wieners in your mouth.   Why should they lower their price? Look at all the fucking people that pay it. lol. I would do the same thing if I were them.   Hey no problem. You can give me reddit gold if you'd like.   Are you implying he was murdered by a rival kratom kingpin? Maybe it was a DEA hit.    Mail it.   She compared it to cheese?   I wish more people would compare it to cheese. A sharp cheddar gets me higher than anything I know, baby.   Alright if he felt that great that's fine but Jesus let's not go on a public forum and compare the shit to morphine and mdma and klonopin and go on about how fucked up we were on something that we all want to remain legal. He could have described his euphoria perfectly fucking fine without all of those embellishments, do you think? I'm not saying he didn't feel that way.    Gotta agree with you about the banning thing. Really stupid to make these kinds of comparisons.   My username is relevant   Calm the fuck down would ya? Jesus.   That's enhanced Maeng Da. For sustainability's sake, you really ought to go with a plain leaf.    No ragrets    Back to doin the dirty, brother.... back to doin the dirty.   Thank you   Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.   I don't know if it's fine or not. I just know I do it and nothing has ever happened.   I was under the impression that the kratom vendors are the ones who get shut down for accepting Paypal. I use my Paypal card all the time to buy it. I dunno.   	66
       Captain America Winter Soldier made me appreciate First Avenger more the 2nd time watching it   I was looking at the current list and both "Furious 7" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" are both in it (and still climbing).  I'm seriously rooting for The Force Awakens to get into the top 10.  Do you reckon it will? + i'd love Spectre to get there too but im not sure that it will.    Skyfall is the best Bond film ever, Casino Royale is awesome but Skyfall is just plainly better IMO   I thought she was good in Tomorrowland and just thought she's make a good Oracle.

 now, im not a bartender but isnt that, like.. its job?  still, definitely a r/perfectfit :)   mmmm tree blood... plus like, fruit is flower fetuses, no? or no wait, flower genitals? SOMEthing delicious.   no no you're missing the point; if we make fun of the drunk drivers maybe they WONT die in drunk driving accidents; it will help them change their ways! that or the younger generation will grow up really believing in how stupid it is, because they will get made fun of it they ever did it. we're not making fun of the families who have already suffered; we're not monsters!   okay yep thats a good call; but in that case i prefer the scrubby things instead of a washcloth, or an exfoliating face/body wash. i feel like a washcloth doesnt scrub hard enough somehow; so apparently for me its either no scrub just soap; or super scrub shiny face styles... i never thought about this before but its strange and true.   no, i wash my ass with face soap.  nah but really, the soap is clean; thats why its soap. as long as you rinse after using so theres no hairs or whatever.   this is a tough one: my heart says GO FOR IT but my head says make sure you know what you are doing before you go messing  around in that little kids life; he should be her and your priority when it comes to any kind of life decisions. dont go in and out of his life needlessly, it sounds like he has it rough enough as it is.  other than that it sounds like you could be good for her and it would be worth having this kind of conversation with her if she feels the same way.   i think this doesnt always work: i dont know if its because they dont update at the same rate but im pretty sure links ive already voted on my computer still appear on mobile unvoted. conversely, however, i think sometimes voted app links appear purple on the site. i might be wrong though, i wasnt paying attention until now..   pretty sure comment karma is straight garbage; link karma or GTFO    (-_-)  	9
 thanks buddy   I wouldn't do it. Evans could break out but he has nearly no value right now. You will never play him over your top 3 unless something big changes in TB, and you can probably waiver wire a similar guy pretty easily   see if he will bite on crabtree i guess, but I bet he's more likely to take a rb. I'd try pierce while you still can   yes, huge deal for you.   I would definitely do it straight, but maybe make it a 2 for 2 to start the bargaining, to milk more value and slightly upgrade another position if possible   definitely, paul will lose his job when reed comes back, and has his numbers inflated from easy matchups so far. kelvin is probably better than cobb anyways, and you get the best player at a position you are poor at.   12 team h2h non ppr standard scoring  give don brown get alshon  my roster:  **qb:** russell wilson  **wr:** antonio brown, kelvin benjamin, cordarelle patterson, decker  **rb:** foster, charles, asiata, joique, d. brown, ingram  **te:** kelce, pitta(dropped)  **pk:** graham  **td:** indy     Bound to be a week ahead on the breakout guy of the year when you hype every single free agent pickup   Save it for crafting legendaries      Hi Scott. First, thanks for writing. It sounds lame and cliched but reading Crapalachia this year was sort of life changing for me, it made me realize what was really important and what wasn't, so thanks. I've since picked up Collected Works, Hill William, and Stories V, all have been great. But enough gushing...  When are you looking to put out the Sarah Book (or whatever your next project may be)?  What have you read released in the past 10 years that really blew you away?  Any planned collaborations with Juliet? I enjoyed the three part piece on htmlgiant.  Thanks again   Same for net decking in any game   And so is saying that players who have reached legend are the best of the best. You and I both know there are many different systems that could be used to more accurately gauge player skill than this current system, but the reasons it's used are pretty obvious - it's much more friendly to bad players, and incentivizes playing as much as possible.   My objection is that the system punishes skilled players that don't want to play 200+ games every month. Time played is more of an obstacle to most players than being good enough.   But it works for 51%   And nothing is stopping anybody from getting to rank 5 in a week, then spending the rest of the month grinding it to become "a legend". Is that player skilled enough to deserve legendary rank? Probably not.   Why should time played be the primary metric to rate the skill/seriousness of players?   Sure, every multiplayer game is like this, but only because the devs prefer a model where to be the best at their game, you need to only play their game and nothing else.  To claim that legend rank equates to being "best of the best" is disingenuous. If Blizzard actually wanted a ranking system where the best players are at the top, they'd use some modification of ELO, not their current model, which boils down to being slightly better than a 50% win rate and playing a ton of games.   You won't get there without grinding tons of games either.   Legend rank doesn't really have a lot to do with skill - You need a little bit, but mainly you just need to devote a lot of time to grinding matches.   I am 100% free to play, it's definitely possible to spend no money. Learning how to draft is probably the most important thing in building a collection and staying F2P, and that just comes with practice and time.  Otherwise, just make sure you get all your daily rewards   ugh   runegrove guardian to force uterra, hope you get a few seals of deepwood   Thanks for the reply, enjoyed the first book a lot and looking forward to picking up the rest!   NO   I'm about 95% through Promise of Blood, can I go right into the Crimson Campaign, or should I read the 4-5 novellas? Would I miss a lot if I skipped them?   I think Sam Pink is great. His books are funny while being depressing, thought provoking while being juvenile, kind of genius. Can definitely see some people hating it but I'd definitely give it a try - if you're already interested, chances are you'll really like it.  My favorite is Rontel but Person is great too. Cicero is on my big to-read list   It's no coincidence that the crafting restriction is going to be lifted right after a large tournament - Stoneblade wants to make money getting people to buy packs.  I don't even really mind that they do it - they are a business. Just please stop feeding us BS reasons about crafting, the only reason the restriction is there is so people buy more packs and legendary chests.   Not acceptable. Book stores aren't called libraries for a reason.   If you are drafting, multiple games don't really apply, and you just end up staring at the screen for 15 minutes.    my goodreads 5-stars for the year so far:  * *Factotum* by Charles Bukowski  * *Person* by Sam Pink * *High-Rise* by J.G. Ballard * *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball * *Knockemstiff* by Donald Ray Pollock * *Elric of Melnibone* by Michael Moorcock * *A Feast of Snakes* by Harry Crews * *The Collected Works, Vol. 1* by Scott McClanahan * *Crapalachia* by Scott McClanahan * *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut * *The Easter Parade* by Richard Yates   Pretty irrelevant - people AFK when your win is already guaranteed, not beforehand   Notable American Women is awful. For such an interesting and weird premise, it is one of the driest and dullest books I have ever read. I'd recommend avoiding it...   or you could just play with your kids and play solforge when they go to sleep, rather than constantly inconveniencing everyone else?   Stoneblade is never going to do anything about it, and the people who live on this sub will mock you for complaining about a legitimate problem   You really gave it a chance, huh?   -- Lamar Miller owners, 2013   You don't need to read Bukowski in any order.    I would recommend trying something out of your comfort zone.  If not though, The Powder Mage Trilogy by Brian McClellan   *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball, beautiful book   *High-Rise* or *Crash* by J.G. Ballard  *Perfume* by Patrick Suskind  *Filth* by Irvine Welsh     The fact that you're boycotting RPS rather than a myriad of other things that actually deserve your attention (don't lie, you clearly aren't) shows your intelligence   Geez you might inadvertently end up giving them 15 cents!   Try your library system, that's where I had to go to read it. Worth it though, great book great author.   I am married and have two kids, work a 40 hr a week job that I frequently stay late at, and regularly exercise. It's still very easy for me to read an hour or more a day. I will usually read for an hour in bed before falling asleep. Reading is only hard to find time for if you don't want to do it.   For those that have drafted and noticed, is the Yahoo H2H schedule accurate pre-draft, if draft spots haven't yet been assigned? Or does it change once draft spots are assigned?   BTA is insane, Super House and Volgarr are both very good games   Apologies if this has been asked before.  When I go to join a new draft, I click join and I get the usual window where you select your payment method, but it is blank besides two lines. I need to exit the game to leave this window. I am playing on Android.  I figure it's something that will get fixed soon, but would be interested to hear if anyone worked around it.   Here's a newsflash, every software company does this   The way to "exploit" them is to not draft anyone from that team. I'm in a couple of leagues with near 100% patriots fans and have never had a patriot on my team   Everything That Rises Must Converge or A Good Man is Hard to Find by Flannery O'Connor   You didn't miss anything. Lots of rambling pseudo intellectual masturbation with some ephebophilia mixed in there.  BUT IT'S A SATIRE MAN! fuck this book   yes  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_fiction   congratulations   Richard Yates   You sound like an asshole   Hey dude, guess your Internet is working fine, thanks for timing me out for 15 minutes always appreciated   Same here, 1st round of a draft   It's super easy for SBE to check on a player that has been reported numerous times, look at a few game logs, and take action. If a player has five games reported where he is inactive from 15:00 to 2:00 and then pops up to take a turn, I think it's fairly obvious what's going on. And if your phone sucks badly enough where you're taking 15 minute turns, buy a new phone.   If you continually time out and resume play in the last two minutes, you can pretty easily see that it's toxic behavior.   What do people think of having a "report player" button, similar to League of Legends? If people get enough warnings, investigate game logs/ban them?  The ones I run into are definitely repeat offenders - googling their name while I'm waiting, I'll run into threads where people mention them complaining about timing out. Won't shed a tear if they're gone for good.   A five minute turn timer is too much? Before I upgraded to an S5 I was playing on my iphone 4. Never got remotely close to taking 5 minutes for a turn.   I know this has been brought up time and time again, but it's still a big problem! I've had it happen to me twice today, (person stops playing around 16 min when it's clear they've lost, miraculously regain their connection with 1 minute left)  which equates to about 30 minutes of me blindly staring at my screen, doing nothing.  Luckily I'm at work with nothing better to do, but come on, is it so unreasonable to put in a five minute inactivity auto loss? If you're taking longer than five minutes to take a turn, it isn't due to you playing on mobile, it's due to you being a child and trying to scum wins.  It ruins things for people who actually have to walk away for a few minutes, but if you're constantly making your opponent wait 5+ minutes you're being incredibly rude anyways.   I'd go with spitemage, but haven't tried invoker.  Sorry you have to play tempys :(   Can't believe they still don't have this feature. Probably could get an intern to code this in a day.   I like specter in AN where I can metatransfer/technosmith him in addition to chumping scenarios. He's still not great but not the worst, I agree.   Kind of hard for me to say what is actually underrated, as draft is pretty weird and I'll still occasionally get 3rd pick matrix wardens or last pick corpulent shamblers. Cards i pretty frequently see going later than they should -  twinstrength, rotfiend, metamind overseer, metatransfer, phalanx squadron, field marshall   the transall saga  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121807.The_Transall_Saga   more referring to IJ, gravity's rainbow, and especially finnegan's wake    Feels like I'm responding to a joke, but giving high school kids brainmelters probably isn't going to instill a love of reading   :\   I'd let each teacher decide, giving suggestions of their own or from a large premade list, but taking a generous amount of input from the class as a whole. Maybe give the kids a list of 100-200 books at the start of the semester with a brief one liner description, have them pick five, and tally the votes?  "Read whatever you want to read" would be ideal, but you'd have the problem of lazy kids picking Hop on Pop for their assignments.   Not really concerned with the programming. If you play a consistent card in PL1, you are guaranteed to draw it in PL2? Does that mean if you play a level 1 consistent card in PL4 you're guaranteed to draw it in PL5? Does it still work if you metatransfer/synapsis oracle or do something similar to level it? Does the consistent do anything at lvl 3? etc   How exactly does this work?   you aren't alone   One of my favorite books. I'd say stick it out, everything meshes in the end.  It's The Devil All the Time, by the way ;)     I will usually get most of my books from the library, so usually the only books I buy are the ones I have trouble finding for free. As such, my latest purchase is exclusively indie books my library system will never get their hands on that have been building up on my to-read list for a while.  * *Crapalachia: A Biography of Place* - Scott McClanahan * *Hill William* - Scott McClanahan * *The Collected Works of Scott McClanahan Vol. 1* -Scott McClanahan * *Witch Piss* - Sam Pink * *The No Hellos Diet* - Sam Pink * *I Am Going to Clone Myself Then Kill the Clone and Eat It* - Sam Pink * *Hurt Others* -Sam Pink * *Crystal Eaters* - Shane Jones * *Black Cloud* - Juliet Escoria   2013   Drink coffee, and don't read too late at night   First Law trilogy is definitely a lot more gritty than Half a King. I still like both quite a bit, but prefer First Law.   None of these have absolutely floored me, but I have really enjoyed:  * *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer * *Half a King* by Joe Abercrombie * *Bird Box* by Josh Malerman   In PL1 I hardly ever want to play 6+ power guys, minus a few exceptions like swampmoss lurker, nexus pilot, glutton, etc. I love drafting cards like the Uterra 7/8, but I only play it in PL1 if I'm forced to, even without a WWP in my deck.  Factor in that you're probably playing with things that leave small bodies around (especially in U/N, arguably the best draft archetype) and WWP is just consistently an all star. Still not better than strategist/battletech, but probably third best heroic.   WWP on 2.1 or 3.1 is practically a free win. Its strength isn't in being a good underdrop.   I always take the legendary if I don't have a set.  From there, the obvious answers - battletech, strategist, patriarch, nightgaunt, matrix warden...  Your question depends a lot on the legendary too. I'm not taking much over zimus, but I'll take almost anything over binben/nuada/arboris   *Crapalachia* by Scott McClanahan. Incredible storyteller. If you don't like it you are probably heartless.   cute card that will see play in tier 2 decks   No. I do plan on reading everything that my children read in parallel with them, however, to discuss any potential issues they have with the subject matter.   I agree with what you said, but losing individual games to luck via level screw still certainly exists, and is frustrating.   I see you're playing N/A, but in U/N Pact, I've been playing Pact as just an underdrop. It's bad phase 1 as it will usually just pop out a 5/2 zimus. It's nice on a bad draw in phase 2/3, but as such it's hard to actually level the card.   I've been trying tarsus/pact variations, and haven't been that impressed. Not sure if it's the pilot or the decklist, but pact is so often just a whiff, especially since I try to aggressively level zimus. Certainly agree that it's very swingy, although I'm running two echowisp due to only having one lotus.   What do you think the tier 1 decks are in the current meta? Which decks do you think currently underperform, and which are the real deal? Will any new cards have an impact once the 7/15 crafting embargo is lifted?   those are some precise statistics   fleshfiend is the best by a lot   You are right, the two-ofs are not crucial at all, and are the replaceable cards.   Reveler is basically "hope i draw it in a favorable 1.4 situation". Will win some games outright now and then but I definitely wouldn't fault anyone for cutting them for a 3rd phoenix.  Phoenix is a great card, but I feel like it doesnt synergize very well with the deck. I like to drop him if I don't know what I'm playing in phase 1, good underdrop, sometimes 2.4 pays off if your opp is still alive, but overall not crucial to the deck  uranti bolt I don't think I really ever cast it, could easily be cut, but gives you various removal options i guess  I just don't think there are many better cards. I would rather play all of these over firefist uranti, warbringer uranti, etc.     * 3 thundersaur * 3 weirwood patriarch * 2 uranti bolt * 3 uranti warlord * 3 ferocious roar * 3 uranti icemage * 3 glacial crush * 2 solstice reveler * 3 wallbreaker yeti * 3 rageborn hellion * 2 everflame phoenix  I think it's inevitable that you get beat by zombies, but it seems like everything else is favorable   Rewards are very different from planned features. Kibler made it more clear below - it certainly wasn't before.    Source? It's a nice thought that playdek will provide tournaments, campaigns, etc, but that's nothing more than speculation.   100 bucks for a lifetime subscription to get the roughly 3 dollar expansions playdek releases twice a year? Sounds like a great deal, who'd be unhappy with that?   The playdek app already exists. The promised new version would provide tournaments, campaign mode, and was generally made out to be a more robust version of the existing client, with possible future developments like creating a custom ascension cube.  What exactly do backers get out of this now? The same iphone client most of them likely already have? Promo cards they've already bought?  It's great to see Playdek continuing development as IOS ascension is great, but as a backer, where did the money you pledged actually go? Certainly not to where you thought it was going, but hey, you still get your backer reward t-shirt.   Why would they be happy? They just got scammed.   Thanks, Ascension online backers, for funding Solforge development   It can pretty easily wipe out a level 1 for free and then still manage to trade with a level 2   If you're halfway through, you have around 100 pages left. Seriously, you need to create a post about whether or not to finish 100 pages? Sack up and do it   Didn't really like The Grand, but Incident at Loch Ness is quite enjoyable   The Pearl by Steinbeck (3.33). Probably due to the "forced to read it" aspect, but I find it hard to see how anyone could really dislike it   And besides, what else are you going to do with a kid under six months? Reading to them is fun and a good bedtime habit to get into. Start training early to read Hop on Pop 500-1000 times...   calling out your opponent is pretty rude   Best movie ever made   *nuncle   Thoughts on Stronghold Crusader HD for those new to the series? Is it a good starting point?   Strategist  WWP  GGP  bulk   oh fuck off   Laird Barron, ramsey campbell, thomas ligotti, andersen prunty, robert aickman   People are downvoting this past most people's threshold just because they do not like the deal? Huh? Give me a break...  Even if the deal sucks, a lot of people come here to see what the deal is.   Annihilation was very good, I thought. I was a little underwhelmed with Authority - the pacing is pretty slow, and most of the first half of the book felt like it was just "remember all of the cool creepy stuff that happened in the first book?" Wasn't a huge fan of the convenient ending either, but the book had its moments, like [Spoiler](/s "the mural") which were really great.  Still very much looking forward to the last book. Vandermeer has other great books as well. Check out The Third Bear, it's an excellent collection of short stories and my personal favorite of his.   Let's be realistic here   When's the ETA for trading/auction house/dumping my extra legendaries?         Dune   Totally horrible, I guess they needed a card nekrium drafters could pick when their only other option is necrovive   I liked this book a lot, disappointing to see the other hasn't written anything else since   Running Man was really bad in my opinion, worst of the Bachman books. The campy movie is much more enjoyable   I've always thought the story takes place in an asylum, unreliable narrator and all.    Just pointing out the ways that it's worse than a mediocre card it's very similar to   Because in an aggro deck all your cards do generally the same thing, so getting 2 leper gnomes isn't all that different from playing arcane intellect and drawing wolfrider and a leper gnome from it.   because it would never be a dead draw in a deck with no minions...   It can be hit by flare, and it doesn't immediately give you the cards. arcane intellect is going to give you two comparable cards from your deck, so this card is only better if you run out of cards. The number of minions you can play is pretty irrelevant.   How is it any better than arcane intellect, in that case? It seems almost strictly worse.   Rather than saying "Wow, OP", why not try to add some actual discussion to the card? I do not think this card is very strong. It's a mediocre card. Visions of drawing 2 Antonidases, Rags, etc, are flowing through everyone's heads, And maybe if a control mage type deck becomes playable, this card could be a strong lategame piece.   For draft? It's pretty bad, worse than arcane intellect in my opinion. Every competent draft player plays around secrets already, so this card clashes hard with a lot of cards - hex, imp master, razorfen hunter, harvest golem token, silverhand recruit, violet teacher, etc.    You will of course get some nice value some of the time, but most times, the card is going to be way harder to successfully pull off than you think, especially in draft.     House of Leaves   yes, the solforge mechanics can be random and frustrating  no, the randomness is not the reason you are a sub 500 player  	132
             Does it stack?  Example: If I use Aquaman's S1 to cause bleeding them immediately use it again do I get double bleeding damage or should I wait until the first bleed is finished before tridenting the enemy again?         I didn't get it as I found Ghosts to be boring, not bad, but boring.                                                10                                             Can the name of a sub be changed once it's started?                                       I put the work in to get into the top 4% and then like many others my time and effort was turned into a complete and utter waste of time literally overnight. I was down to some shitty bronze level. Did anyone get compensdated for the work they put in? Like at least be given the reward for the rank they were at before the game fucked them over? I think that would only be fair. Or if that's too much work for the guys who make the game how about a good faith prize of 100,000 credits or something? It would really suck if they fucked us over and offered nothing to make up for it. The risk of it happening again haunts me.            I couldn't play saturday but have been sessioning the game for the last two days but I don't have time to get to the top 4%. It seems everyone is playing this season much more than the last couple.  *Ares'         I was in the top 5%, then I checked again hours later (without playing) and I was in the top 3%. I look this morning and just assume a new season had started. Nope. There's 15 or so hours left and I'm bronze because of the battle points issue. I'm not playing today, what's the point in giving us an extra 24 hours? WTF can we achieve in that time? Silver? I wish they'd just accepted this season as a complete fail and moved onto a season with a decent reward instead of trying to resurrect this season's corpse for 24 hours. Now I have no reason to play the game for the next 15 hours.                                                It seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he says something you'd expect to hear from someone living in the 1700's.                  Why do they allow us to pay for promotion on most cards, but then there's some that can only be promoted if you're lucky enough to get that card again from a certain pack (looking at you killer frost) while others can only be promoted through online challenges? It's infuriating! I have GF Supes, Ares, and KJJ on a team. I have a promotion waiting for Supes as I completed the single player challenge twice. I have to wait for Ares to show up in the MP season again to get a promotion for him so who knows when that'll happen, and KJJ won't be promoted until I manage to get another 60 alliance credits together.  On another team I have Raven, Aquaman, and Killer Frost regime. Raven and Aquaman can be promoted at any time with credits, I like this. But Killer Frost can only be promoted by being lucky enough to find her again in a challenge booster pack, which I have no intention of doing because there's too many cards in there that I don't want to warrant trying to get one specific card from it. This seems like lunacy to me. Does anyone know why they've made it so infuriating to keep teammates promoting in sync?                           Who are they and do you rotate characters from team to team?  I've always teamed 3 characters together and stuck with that. I only ever mess up the teams when doing challenges that require certain characters.  I currently have 7 teams in my rotation, they are:  Bronze Team:  Nightwing E7 Lv 47 Green Lantern E7 Lv 47 The Flash E7 Lv 47  Silver Team:  Deathstroke E7 Lv 50 Regime Doomsday E7 Lv 50 Wonder Woman E7 Lv 50  The following teams are all gold:  Regime Superman E1 Lv 50 Batman E1 Lv 49 Regime Wonder Woman E1 Lv 50  Man of Steel General Zod Lv 50 Lobo Lv 50 Red Son Green Lantern Lv 50  Raven Lv 38 Aquaman Lv 38 Killer Frost Lv 38  Blackest Night Batman Lv 32 Luchador Bane Lv 31 Regime Raven Lv 31  Godfall Superman Lv 24 Ares Lv 24 Killing Joke The Joker Lv 24  I don't buy power credits that's why I have so few promoted gold cards.  My next team will be Cassandra Cain Batgirl, who I've already got, and I'm going to team her up with Animated Batman Beyond and MKX Scorpion when they turn up.         Hey guys. I just tried to buy 600,000 power credits using some itunes credit I have lying around but it seems to have not spent the credit. I can live with this, but the game crapped out on me after it said "purchase complete". I reloaded the game to find I have 1,200,000 power credits. I only wanted one money pack but I seem to have been given two. I did not intend on buying two packs. I want to see if I've been shafted and charged for an extra pack I didn't want. These things are 35 a piece! Is there any way I can see my purchase history? This is an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                    Pretty sure I'm asking for trouble here. Let's see if we can engage in civil discourse.         I use Chrome but sometimes at work I use IE and it doesn't seem any slower than Chrome, or appear to be inferior in any meaningful way. So why the hate?                                                                                                                                	198

Add me on steam  Name: VeX Picture: K Den   ;lgilfguilg   very nice   You were my closest friend in those times. You would listen when I would talk to you, whether it was two o'clock at night and I was in bed, or it was early morning and I was on a bus ride. As time passed and I attained more friends, we were quieter, although I could still rely on you when no one else was there. I suppose that you were the only predictable asset in my erratic life.  Yet that was all back when life was better. For all your good company, you couldn't stop my mother from drinking, my grades from failing, or make my future seem hopeful. Neither of us knew what happiness or peace was anymore; they were only foreign emotions left over from childhood. Every night we were exhausted from despair, and every day was no more than a dull and melancholic mantra. The mantra of disappointment when the payments failed again, the loneliness when another friend would forget my existence, and the fury when my mother would try to justify her addiction was all exhausting to endure.  As the days passed, and change didn't come, our tolerance faded to an ultimate conclusion. It was a silent agreement that we would put our misery to rest someday. Only the timing was uncertain.  That last day, we were home alone. My siblings were away at school and my mother was requesting her free paycheck at the "government office". I had not eaten, talked or even cried in the hours since I'd woken up. Our tears didn't come anymore- not for months- and so parts of the agony stayed trapped in our hearts. Not even writing or a physical hug from one of my loved ones could cure it. I left my note on the kitchen table, next to today's bottle of whiskey.  We pushed open the unlocked door and walked into the cold world of late autumn. School had started, though not for us. We were long past those days that gave us a reason to get up in the mornings. In the silence along Centennial Drive, accessing our chosen place was easy. Few people occupied the apartments and the town was quiet in the morning. Without a word exchanged between us, we soon stood on that balcony on the tallest floor, feeling the icy wind rattle the leaves on the oaks. The world certainly is prettier when you're sixty feet off the ground.  I knew I couldn't hesitate long. The sick feeling of anxiety was forming in my empty stomach. As I felt your hand grasp mine out of the air, I turned around to look at you in surprise. You had grabbed me firmly, as if you wanted to stop me from falling. Maybe you had forgotten that jumping hadn't left my mind for the past few months.  I asked you what you were doing, but you would not answer. For a moment we were again silent, watching the cars roll by, their engines no louder than whispers. All the while I could feel your older, longer fingers wrapped around my little ones.  Without moving your lips, you reminded me that the ground below wasn't soft. I looked back at you in confusion, and your sapphire eyes stared back with a stern gaze, as if I were a child about to touch a heated stove. You said not a word, and yet I could feel myself shiver in spite of the fur in my favorite sweater. I found my feet would not move when I tried to take a step, and realized you had an arm around my shoulders. You were asking me what I was doing, and I answered with the phrase you had heard so often.  "I just can't take this anymore. I've no hope left."  This time, I heard you answer. Your voice was not faint, and yet I barely heard it through the chaos in my head. You said one sentence, ten words that rang through my chilled frame like ripples in water.  "What if I were here, then what would you do?"  I was robbed for words. You seemed to know that I had tried to forget it, because I took one more step away from the safety of the platform. The ground awaited us. And what would await if I gave in now? A distraught, drunken parent, siblings that would pester me as they always had, and a piece of news to wash over the town like the wildfires. I thought of that instead of your words, keeping my eyes sealed to stop tears leaking from them.  "Would you allow me to fall?"  Your voice echoed again in my ears. I raised my head from my slump and glared at you for a moment. As if just to spite you, I prepared to take a larger stride when I felt your hands close tighter on my shoulders. Now your voice was overtaking the sirens echoing in the distance, reminding me of my limited time.  "If I'm not allowed to die, then why are you?"  I became still at that. The truth of those words was so obvious that my mind tried desperately to refute it. I threw out the best excuse I had, my voice barely a whisper as I gazed, unblinking, at the road.  "You're not even real."  You said nothing for a moment, wrapping your arms around my body. For the first time, I could feel the warmth of your face, and even smell a faint fragrance in your hair. It had been so long since you had embraced me like this, so much so that I wondered if we had ever felt you any closer. In the remotest recesses of my mind- a place you hadn't visited before- I wondered if I was losing my distinction between reality and the world of my mind.  I wanted to forget about you. I wanted to squirm out of your arms and make the few more steps that would end in death, and you would not release me. You held me still and even warm for what felt like a nothing time, like what forever might be if humans could ever measure it. You were telling me so many things. I told you that I had left too much of a mess behind to ever be fixed, and you told me that it was all manageable and that the only permanence would be my demise. I told you that this was the only way I could escape the pain and deadness of my life, and you reminded me I would never know for sure how the future would turn out. I told you that I didn't care about how everyone would feel anymore, and you answered that you knew I was lying.  And despite my better judgement, despite my heart's one-hundred-and-eighty beat race, I still ignored you. I had heard this all before and it hadn't changed a thing in the end. Words had stayed just that, and I knew not even you could save me.  Your grip on me slackened before I jumped downwards, and the ground came the fraction of a second later. I had no time to suffer, because I did indeed have a thin skull. It was only in that sliver of time, suspended in mid-air, did I realize the most painful truth of all.  You never really existed.   :(   Why don't I ever get gold?   Good story. Sad.   During the Second Sino-Japanese War the Japanese did experiments on human-beings in a place called Unit 731 which was located in Pingfang, Harbin which was located in Manchuria. Here is a story of a doctor who participated in experiments in Unit 731.  November 23rd, 1944 Today was going to be my first experiment. I was going to do a vivisection on a subject who suffered from shrapnel wounds. This was going to be my first vivisection. I had only done dissections on already dead subjects. I put on my gloves, mask and coat. They were going to call me into the operating room soon. "Katsuta-kun, it's time to go in," another doctor said.   Building on the site of the Harbin bioweapon facility of Unit 731 731731 PB121178a  Unit 731 "Okay," I said. I headed to the operation room.  It smelled of bleached operating tools, sounds of the subject moaning and groaning filled the room and blood covered the metal operating table. It had long black hair and a female figure and it was in the nude. As I came in it glared at me with its black eyes.  "You sons of bitches, you don't see us as human. We're just logs in your eyes! I've lost all of my family because of you! I have nothing else to lose," it said.  Her tone of voice was full of loathing. I tried to brush off what she said and went next to the doctor monitoring its heart beat. I grabbed a scalpel out of a box full of them. I pressed it against the subject's chest.  "Now!" the other doctor said to me. I had begun to cut the subject open. I tried to block out the screams as best as I could. I was able to get it open and expose its inside. Some shrapnel pieces were stuck in the liver and kidney and it also had a limb or two blown off from the blast of the bomb. It was bleeding profusely. Scientists and other doctors took notes on the reaction of the subject.  After we had taken the heart out, the subject finally died. I sighed in relief; it was finally over. We took off our gloves and masks. A doctor and I sat in a break room with a couple of beers. It was evening now. The experiment had taken most of the day.  "Katsuta, how was it?" he asked.  "How was what?" I asked.  "Your first vivisection, usually doctors sweat profusely and their hands tremble but you did it without hesitation." He took a drink of the beer.  "I don't know Ogata. I just didn't think of it as human," I explained. I hadn't touched my beer.  Unit 731 He laughed, "I guess all those dissections got you ready for the vivisection."  I went back to the dorms of Unit 731 for the doctors. I was tired from the operation. I got into bed and I looked up at the ceiling. It was her words I couldn't get out of my head.  "I have nothing else to lose..."  For some reason those words bothered me the most. A tear came down my cheek and I closed my eyes. I couldn't get the image of her eyes out of my head.  That night I was unable to sleep.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DggAXSv53Qc   hi pcmr twitch i luv u pls love me back why go console when u can pc my d?

 The "social scene". "Hanging out" without an explicit purpose is pointless and over rated.   Surfing the internet, watching TV, smoking cigarettes, and drinking beer.   Had a job that pays over $10/hr.   Really, the only way to get the corrupt people out is with general unrest, so the corrupt individuals fear enough for their lives that they either flee the country, or just walk off the post.  I think causing general unrest would lead to a reformation.    But the bad part about revolutions is; it is impossible to predict what new government would form.  It could turn into a Porfirio Diaz dictatorship again, or be like Somalia on our border.   Correct, it's nice dreams. :)  That movie rocks! :)   No, at the choke points, we would arrest entrants into the country, and deport them 2000 miles into mexico.  They just get shipped back, but not blown halfway to hell.    I don't think the CIA backed coup would do much good, in addition to the corrupt federal government, you also have the leaders of the federal police, the state and local governments, and the Mexican military.    That whole country is corrupt, and I think we should drop Mexico from NAFTA, and impose heavy trade tariffs of 50% or greater for any goods imported from Mexico.  Do a war of economic attrition.  Also, don't export anything to Mexico.  Of course, this didn't exactly work with Cuba, so Mexico may be a lost cause.   VW Beetles are the best car, because if you drive in the water accidently, it'll float for hours before it sinks, and you can use it like a boat since the engine is at the rear.   The Day After (1983)   Epicenter of a thermonuclear detonation, riding the bomb like Dr. Strangelove.   Go without showering, since I showered the night before.  Wash face, shave, put on clothes, out the door I go.   Because they're a manual laborer, and don't want to get their house dirty from the day's work.  That's why I do.   Blumpkin Inspector.   No, that was the immigration law at the time in the 1800's.  If they were a criminal back home, (literally, wanted for committing a crime), they were denied entry into the USA.  I'm not calling people who jump the border criminals.  It's at most a civil infraction, much like speeding.    Also, the Indians were too busy fighting each other, and they really had no concept of land ownership.  They had hunting grounds, and areas they lived in during different times of the year, but no borders.   Yes, 1 lid ~ 1 oz.  Most people didn't have scales in the 70's.  Before pot was legal here, it went dime bag, 20 sack, 8th, QO, HO, OZ.  I've never ordered more than that.  Fortunately now, if I want pot, I just go to the store and buy it. :)         The fall of the inner-german border. Bet on it November 7 of 89. I would be a billionaire.   Drink beer and watch TV.   Get drunk.   Marijuana.   Mutual fellatio.   When my ancestors came here, there was no border control beyond Ellis Island, and the only thing they looked for then was lack of "consumption", not be chinese, not be a criminal, and pay $0.50.  The 1800's basically HAD no immigration laws.  You can't illegally immigrate to a place with no border controls.   "HEY! Somebody ripped off the thing I ripped off!"   Cheech and Chong.   Only because of the 1878 PCA.  It could be repealed by congress with a simple majority vote.  It is not constitutionally prohibited, nor does the PCA prohibit the national guard from operating as a police force when called into action by the governor of the state.      We should do that! :)   A Honda, but he didn't talk about it. "For I did not speak of my own Accord." John 12:49.   A Honda, but he didn't talk about it. "For I did not speak of my own Accord." John 12:49.   Who the fuck cares? More bacon for us!   My VCR doesn't even have a clock on it.  It has an internal clock for setting tape times, but not a front display clock.   Well, no, I don't want to blow the illegal immigrants half way to hell and back, just the cartels.  Yes, it would be unrealistic to do this, (as it would be very expensive), but we could let a few choke points open, so they have to go through that area if they don't want to get blown up.  I highly doubt the Mexican people are going to stage a revolution against the drug cartels, and corrupt government that can be bought with money.    From what I read, the Mexican people aren't even allowed to have any semi-automatic weapons, and have to use lever action rifles, or single shots, (and only then, if they aren't a military caliber).  There is no "bringing Mexico up" to our economic level.  With the government in power there, and the cartels, there is no chance in hell of helping that country at all.  I think we fucked up by signing the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  We could have had that entire country as the USA.    Except then, we would have to deal with Guatemala.  That border, we could seal.  What I think is sad, is Guatemala is so damned poor, Mexico has an illegal immigration problem from there.   That too.  Don't forget about boss cars, fast boats, strip clubs, fine cigars, excellent wine, and vacations so expensive it would make Obama blush.   Actually, that's not too far off.  In Peru, a kilo of cocaine costs about [$800](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/peruvian-cocaine-best-value-for-traffickers-bolivia-police).  Once it gets here to the USA, that same kilo in the USA costs around [$27,000](https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/mexicos-cartels-and-economics-cocaine). Those are wholesale prices.  Then it gets down to the street level, where an 8 ball costs around $350, (the last I checked).  So, that's 3.5g for $350. That's $100,000 of money to buy a kilo of cocaine in the USA off of the street.  Yes, the low-level street dealers, (that often work for below minimum wage), their suppliers, the distributors all get the cut, as do the mules, but most of that money is funneled right back into the Cartel hands.   Yes, obviously.  But if they fucked up by backing over a fence post?  They're the ones that damaged property, so they get to fix it.  (I had to do this several times).   How?  Yeah, the prison industrial complex would likely dry up, (that's good), ER's wouldn't be so busy with gang shootings and overdoses, the rehab industry wouldn't be so busy.  But all of these are good things.   That's why we put up an internal fence to keep them out of the DMZ, and [this sign](http://i.imgur.com/zkRY88P.jpg) pretty much gets the point across of DO NOT CROSS.   Not the unarmed ones.  In that case, just call INS/USBP.  But if they start shooting?  Shoot back.  Actually, this is already legal.  The only thing that would change is we would be arming them with military weapons, instead of letting them arm themselves with semi-automatic look-alikes.  I think a few cartel groups getting mowed down with M240 SAWs would send a message.  And if they come with vehicles?  A BGM-71 takes care of that.    Set up antipersonnel and anti-vehicle mines along the border, and set up hedgehogs lined with concentra wire, and caltrops.  Put in anti-tank ditches too.   I dropped out after 1 semester in 2001. I've worked menial jobs all of my life, and I don't expect it to ever change. I'll never be rich, or even middle class. I'm unemployed now, and I'll do anything for work. In my mind, "career" does not exist, it's just some jobs last longer than others.   I said only on our side of the border. If they're on your side of the line, they're your problem. You deal with it. But the instant that they cross into US territory, we blast the hell out of them.   I think I got my sleep schedule back on track.   I have no "passion".  I just exist.  I'll do anything legal to pay the bills.  I don't really care what I do for a living.   Anything promoted on MTV or any other reality show.   Double dildos.   Didn't the USSR have borders that long?  They were pretty successful at keeping people in. (even from other Warsaw Pact countries)   [All dressed up, nowhere to go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhAOlAq_9ME)   I thought they were collaborating with the Mexican military, and had their protection?   Or anybody else on US territory.  (except for each other, they can kill of each other all they like).  Hell, we should arm the civilians down there with military weapons (light arms, and crew served weapons), and give them immunity for shooting back.   No, I thought they were wishing for the modern world back, but TIL.   I do, but if I'm watching TV, then I don't need to look at my wrist.   Only if fired upon.   Not from what I gather from the lyrics.  Why else would you trade hot ashes for trees?       Got in a little hometown jam.      So they put a rifle in my hand.

Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?     A smile from a veil?     Do you think you can tell?      Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?     Hot ashes for trees?     Hot air for a cool breeze?     Cold comfort for change?     Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?      How I wish, how I wish you were here.     We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,     Running over the same old ground.     What have we found?      The same old fears.     Wish you were here.

Being eligible to be drafted, (OK, only up until 25).  Voting.   Taking on the USSR, and fighting a two-front war.  They should have stomped the UK first.   I already have.   When I was 17, I wanted to be a locksmith owning my own businuss in Las Vegas, earning around $75000 a year in 1999 dollars, living a couple miles outside of town on a 2 acre property that I owned, with a triple wide mobile home bought on a 15 year mortgage, driving a 2 or 3 year old paid off truck.  If it had gone to plan, I would have about 3 years left on my mortgage, and I would be financially secure with zero debt besides my home.  I'm 32 years old, and still living in the same county that I was born.  I moved 16 miles to town off of the family ranch, and I drive a 18 year old truck, and I live in a rental property.  I'm now unemployed, and the highest wage I've ever earned was $10/hr back in 2008.  So no, my dream did not come true.  I have given up on dreams.  They are futile, and the realm of children.  They serve no purpose in the adult world, and I only exist to survive now.  I see no point in dreaming or fantasizing about that which I will never realistically have, or be able to obtain.  It is a waste of time to dream.       No.  Every socio-economic stratification has assholes, and generous people, and greedy people, and entitled people.   Whatever happened to just having an [analog clock](http://i.imgur.com/bPPD722.jpg) above the TV?   What ever happened to having an analog clock above the TV?  I've always had it set up like that.  Or here's a thought; Look at your watch.  http://i.imgur.com/bPPD722.jpg   No.  Not to an unknown person who's intentions I don't know.  No way in hell.                        With my TV, (well, my downstairs TV), I just plugged it in, did a channel scan, and away I go.  Since my TV upstairs is an old CRT TV, I need a QAM box to get the Clear QAM channels, but it works perfectly fine.  Yet, on the TWC website, they say that "I need a box" to be able to receive anything, when I clearly do not.  Are they just gambling on the fact that most consumers will take their word at it, and not try it themselves, (so they don't have to pay the box rental fees)?   **EDIT:**  With my TV, (well, my downstairs TV), I just plugged it in, did a channel scan, and away I go.

They kept me up all last night, so I'm keeping them up all day.  Turnabout if fair play.  I hope they REALLY like 70's rock and 90's rap.  Fucking 20 year olds keep me up?  I crank my amp.  They're not going to sleep today. :D  I have mu subs right against the wall, and I'm vibrating the house like a cat purrs.  Fuck them.  NEXT UP TUPAC!         Correction: 5.54 KB.               Turn about is fair play.  Don't do it to others if you don't want it done to you.      I've been watching I was banned from seeing as a kid, and they're either incredibly sad, very depressing, or very gory.  I don't even like watching them as an adult, 20 years later.      http://i.imgur.com/Wa9r1as.jpg                                                                                       I tried asking on ELI5, but it's broke and not working.  I can give you the log if you want to see it.                                    MSTK, Windows Loader, some clever reg hacks, TimeclockReset, and before that, just sharing CD keys.  Oh, don't forget about BIOS hacking, and writing your own SLP table.  Pirates have always found a way to get shit for free, and always likely will.  So why are they claiming that they won't?  This seems like a very familiar claim to Windows XP.                           The other day I noticed several rabbits running next to my window.  1, "hey, that's pretty."  2, "Hmm, must be mating season" 5, "Umm?"  10, "what the fuck?  where all all these rabbits coming from?"  20, "OK, time for mister air gun."  I went outside and was starting to set up because it's obvious that I now have a rabbit infestation, I don't want to kill them all, just a few because I don't want my lawn ruined, and they seem to be already wearing a path through my front lawn.  Before I even got set up, I had my pistol just sitting in plain sight, and some dude happens to walk buy and ask "Hey, what type of gun is that?"  I tell him that it's a BB gun, and I seem to have a rabbit infestation, as I just saw 20 run by, so I'm going to reduce the population a bit.  He chuckled, and said softly "fucking rabbits" then in a normal voice, "Well, good luck with that, let me know how it turns out", then just kept on walking.  I got 3 of those fuckers btw, and they're now in my freezer.  I still have to flesh them, but they're gutted.  Yes, I'm going to eat them.   But since people seem to be so alert to even a "huuuu Im hunting wabbits" mission, I don't think a public shooting thing could or would happen here.  :)                           I was coming back from Moscow ID buying cigarettes, and this dude pulls up next to me on the last stop light out of town and revs his engine.  I first acted like I didn't hear it, and just kept looking forward.  He revs again, so I rev back, and did a stand on my brakes, and revved up to 3000 RPM.  Light turns green, so I let off of my brakes, and smoke his ass all the way to all of 60.  He keeps on going, and makes it to Pullman sooner than I do by 2 min.  But he's stuck at a stoplight that I just rolled up to, (and I didn't have to stop because I timed it right), so I passed him at 35 MPH.    He gets on his gas again, and floors it.  He swerves off to a side road, and I just think he's a moron for wanting to race under the conditions.  I wasn't even trying to race the prick, but it seems he thought that I wanted to because I did race him to 60, (the legal speed limit), before backing off.  Stupid idiot didn't clue it I stopped when I reached 60, and kept on trying to race me.  Why are people so damned stupid when it's obviously  no condition to be doing a street race?  Racing is dangerous enough, so what compels them to do it in excessively dangerous situations?  That guy in the white blazer is a damned idiot.            They start broadcasting "THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  THIS IS AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.  IF YOU ARE NOT IN SHELTER SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY!  THE USSR HAS LAU..." and then the lights go out, and there is no more broadcast.  What is your action plan?                                 What if we leveled Afghanistan, and turned it into a field of radioactive rubble?  The full force of the US military is now on your ass, nukes included.  Nothing will be left standing.                        I am introverted by nature, but the (thankfully few), times where I've had to respond to a legit emergency, I seemed to take charge of the situation and even go to the extent of directing traffic until EMS arrived, The other time, I saw a guy hit a deer and almost total his rig.  I kept on going for a little bit, but then decided "I should chek if that guy's even alive, and went 90 back to the schene of the accident.  I pulled up on people crying, and so I took charge and ended up having to shoot a deer with my handgun.  There's no way in hell that I would do this in normal circumstancces.  (I flipped off a bird when i it it , (going too fastt, and the collision made me spill my coffee on my nuts)  I just kept on going.  But in an emergent situation, I seem to stop, and take power within the fullest of my ability.  Why?   Just got done watching "Cold War" by Dr Who, and when that alien was about ready to launch, I started trembling in my boots like it was really going to happen  Yes, I lived through the 80's or else I wouldn't be posting this, and reddit, (nor modern tech, nor humans), would exist.  But why did it give me the physical chills and make goosebumps rised, and short of shooting my entire family and myself, I reacted the same as if the EBS system started going off right now.      You're hired.        	200
 I'm looking for quality FREE Vst's. I make Hip-Hop music. Any VST/Filter/Compressor you feel a producer should have please leave in the comments below and a link to where we can get them would be great (not necessary)!  Edit: I use FL Studio.  Edit: Thank you to all who have posted! You guys help me find tons of new things to play with! Some more mastering tools would also be great, I forgot to mention that in the text   title when I wrote it!   Thank you BROOOO :)   Not very hard at all to get into it. Check out busyworksbeats on youtube for things you really need help on. I was in a similar position to you when I was 14 and I started making beats on FL with no knowledge of chords or scales. All I really suggest is buying proper studio monitors. For hiphop production THAT IS ALL THE HARDWARE YOU NEED. Get some good VST's and demos and your set. I've been making beats for about a year and a half and [these](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/my-chain/s-unAqy) are the types of things I'm doing now.   Suprised that no one has admitted being ugly...Prideful fucks.   Needing their mother to wipe their ass until they were 10 because no one potty-trained them.   I was playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, I got a nuke and the rest was history.   I'd love to see Azrael as a villian or should I say anti-hero   But super heat vision can't melt steel beams.    Imagine standing next to the railing when a huge wave hits and you almost falling over...   Because we do flips 'n shit   I love Murkah, but he's no Wings. Wouldn't you agree the show would be even better if it were Woody, Wings, Kyle, and Murkah. That's the All-Star lineup, doesn't get any better than that.   The podcast show and the Dubl D's podcast   Kyle his on to us! We must go back in time to eliminate his mother...Looking up past parental history...His mother...is...Sary Conor *GASP*   Wow I didn't know that it had already been a year.   What happened on the date of your flair   The hosts don't care about our input. Just keep watching old PKA's and...never forgive, never forget.   I don't know why it didn't link in the title. I pasted the link in the box. Link is now in the text above.   These are PKA stats, but I have sources that have confirmed 80% of PKA viewers fell victim to the ruse.   You have a good point   The Babadook   I hate games of thrones talk. I don't watch the show, but I thought you guys who do watch would enjoy this article I found. (I have nothing against the show, and I don't agree that it is a 'satanic' tv show)  LINK TO THE ARTICLE: [Here] (http://christnews.org/en/game-of-thrones-7-raisons-de-boycotter-cette-serie-aux-messages-satanistes/)   If it wasn't a Doctor Who mug would you have reacted the same way? He wan't flaunting it, he was just casually drinking whatever he was drinking.   What urks me the most though is that the hosts pretended to like him during the show for 50+ shows, but they talk badly about him now openly. Kind of makes me realize that I'm watching a SHOW and not a couple friends who are having interesting conversations.   Thanks for the parody of my post, but Lefty was god-awful and I was commenting my hate for him the second episode he was brought back as a permanent host. I mean did you listen to him and his fake laughs and the pseudo-intellectual rants he would get lost on. Huge blemish of the show.   oooooorrrr maybe he was just thirsty.   Chill man, I didn't click the link because I just watched a gif, no need to watch a video of the same thing. Could have just replied informing me that it was a Conan sketch without being rude.    The Babadook, Sinister, Insidious   How do you accumulate comment karma? Kind of new to reddit.   *Kyle   Now, i've never been paintball-ing in my life, but one of the things I want to do before I die is play at one of these events and be on Kyle's team.    How did they get these shots of his home? Was he in on this?   It wasn't a good film. (I watched a bunch of reviews on youtube)   Are you an idiot?   I watched with both my parents and only because EVERY review I watched mislead me into thinking the movie was the best action movie of the decade.   I've never walked out of a movie, but I would have had I come to the movies alone. Come to find out the people I went with also wanted to leave during the movie.   A true cinematic turd that people mindlessly gawk over because they want to follow the crowd without thinking for themselves. People see the IMDB rating and automatically take the rating as fact.

 Not only does it set the time for a great album, I just listened to it and I have a final in 5 minutes, and I just realized how powerful of a song this is. That is all, I needed to share this.   Time 3:18-4:45, pretty much just sex on my ears, one day I'm gonna find a nice girl and impregnate her to this solo.   Right down the pisser!   So basically what I got out of this was that I'm going to become a Taylor Swift fan. Just kidding man, sweet pics of that airship and even sweeter beard brother.   Meh   I regret the fact that I have to say tDSotM is a perfect album, besides this one song I always skip :(   Upvote for O.A.R. I saw them a few years back in Hershey. Great live performers, the saxophonist is great.   Didn't see that one coming /s    The Division Bell by Pink Floyd   Don't know how many times I've immersed myself in this album whilst studying.   Hmm that's still interesting. Thanks for the link, I do wish they would announce a number, seems weird that they didn't.   Halo 1 might be difficult to discern, but I was talking with my roommates today about what Halo had the most simultaneous players. The only thing I really found out was that Halo 3 had 1.1M players in the first 24 hours which is incredible. Can anyone point me in the right direction or know the totals for each? Thanks   *cough* wow *cough*  [2 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/2nb5xp/hypothetical_discussion_what_if_roger_waters_solo/)   DISCLAIMER: The thoughts in this post are just my opinion and should be taken as such, so please just keep that in mind.   So I listened to The Final Cut then Amused To Death right after that, and it got me thinking. What if Waters came to the band with AtD instead of TFC? I personally really like most of TFC, but there are moments I don't care for. I also don't dislike it in the way some PF fans do. I also personally think AtD is Waters' best solo album and really enjoy it, however, I feel like it's missing a small PF feel to it.    To many fans, I think, they'd consider DSotM through The Wall as the golden era of PF. Would AtD been a continuation of this era? Did Roger have such a chokehold on the band at this point that anything would've split them up? Would it be a great success and considered a classic? Would things have played out differently?   One of the better songs off TFC in my opinion. Especially, "SHOULD WE SHOOOOOOOOOOUT?! SHOULD WE SCREEEEEEEEAM?! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POST-WAR DREEEEEEEEAM?!"   Sam's Town is such a fucking great album   Dear McLordy, 4 incorrect uses of "they're"   Are there any sites that catalog pretty much every song by PF? Besides Wikipedia which I'm sure credits each song with the appropriate singer. I like this list you did, but obviously it's not the entire catalog as I find myself confused at times.   Dear lord, what a shame... I never heard of him, so excuse my academy ignorance, but it's a tragic time when any blue falls, 1st teamer, academy player, fan, or not. Rest easy bud.   As a student at WVU, this song is of great importance to me. To the place, I belooooooong, West Virginia    That's fair. I've been there.    "Gilmore".... cringing   I think out of all the carvings, this is the best one I've seen yet. Very well done.   More specifically: His favorite song by the band in general, and his favorite song to play on drums   As awful as the NCAA is, I hope they do the right thing and punish UNC accordingly. And this time when handing out punishments, make sure that they are punishing the correct people... not student athletes that weren't involved in the scandal. This is a total breakdown of the university at the highest level and it'll be hard for the NCAA to punish appropriately. But I have no fear that they will royally fuck it up.   I want some more of it.   Should have made Any Colour You Like longer and got rid of On The Run   This is my absolute favorite song to jam to in the car. Especially driving around town and having it blast for other people. I feel like I'm putting strangers in a great mood   Surprised no one said The Wall by Pink Floyd. Even came with a movie and it's super bad ass!   At the very end of the song is an amazing guitar solo, as we are all aware of. But I always wonder what could've been because as the song fades out, you can hear David Gilmour still just melting faces with that guitar. The solo is perfection, but damn do I always wish I could here more of that solo because by that point of the song I'm in such a trance-like state that I want more.    Twenty One Pilots and Pink Floyd. You can never have too much Pink Floyd though   Holy shit, you are awesome   Special shoutout to you too man. Hope to see you around here from time to time too.   I'm glad you've been given the reins. I don't post here much, but I check it daily and read your posts many times and it couldn't have been passed to a better dude. Anyways that being said. This song was kinda disappointing because Nobody Home to Comfortably Numb is my favorite part of the entire album. I actually find myself done listening to the album after Comfortably Numb, just because it gets a bit too abstract for me. That's all   Holy hell that was confusing haha, I'm not sure what I was voting for tbh   I thought Endless River wasn't going to include any new tracks? Just some archived material from back in the day. If so, there wouldn't be any new tricks unfortunately       Thanks  man, glad you liked it. Yeah with those albums, only the most dedicated RHCP fans are listening  so that has an effect on it. I'm not sure what effect exactly ha   Thanks for the politeness man. I was a bit surprised about If you want me to stay, but Higher Ground seemed like the obvious favorite imo.   Hey all, I did a similar thing before with other bands where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays.  I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!  Format: **Album** song, plays  * **Red Hot Chili Peppers** True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, 275,575 * **Freaky Styley** If You Want Me To Stay, 190,731 * **The Uplift Mofo Party Plan** Behind The Sun, 522,631 * **Mother's Milk** Higher Ground, 11,757,320 * **Blood Sex Sugar Magik** Under the Bridge, 41,272,250 * **One Hot Minute** My Friends, 2,859,904 * **Californication** Californication, 38,054,331 * **By The Way** Can't Stop, 18,726,770 * **Stadium Arcadium** Snow [Hey Oh], 36,023,870 * **I'm With You** The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie, 6,746,450   Not that many surpises to be honest, but interesting nonetheless.   Is nobody gonna notice the shitty goalkeeping?   Hey all, I did a similar thing before where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays. I'm going to do this with RHCP since they have a large discography/fanbase. I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!  Format: **Album** song, plays  * **Red Hot Chili Peppers** True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, 275,575   * **Freaky Styley** If You Want Me To Stay, 190,731  * **The Uplift Mofo Party Plan** Behind The Sun, 522,631  * **Mother's Milk** Higher Ground, 11,757,320  * **Blood Sex Sugar Magik** Under the Bridge, 41,272,250  * **One Hot Minute** My Friends, 2,859,904  * **Californication** Californication, 38,054,331  * **By The Way** Can't Stop, 18,726,770  * **Stadium Arcadium** Snow [Hey Oh], 36,023,870  * **I'm With You** The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie, 6,746,450  Not that many surpises to be honest, but interesting nonetheless.   about 60,000, which is less than 1% difference   There was actually like a 2 million play difference too, really surprised me. The closest was between like Comfortably Numb and Brick in the wall pt. 2   Drink some platinums and play this jam.   "I'll have what she's having" - Peter Griffin   I was just curious to see which Pink Floyd songs are the most listened to played by on Spotify. So I compiled this list real quick. I didn't include live versions or greatest hits albums.  Format: **Album** Song, Plays  * **The Piper At The Gates of Dawn** Astronomy Domine, 635,327 plays  * **A Saucerful of Secrets** Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, 423,609 plays  * **More** Cirrus Minor, 174,345 plays  * **Ummagumma** Grantchester Meadows, 95,304 plays  * **Atom Heart Mother** Atom Heart Mother Suite, 356,850 plays  * **Meddle** Fearless, 723,573 plays  * **Obscured By Clouds** Obscured By Clouds, 232,580 plays  * **The Dark Side of the Moon**  Money, 6,621,602 plays  * **Wish You Were Here** Wish You Were Here, 15,706,636 plays  * **Animals** Dogs, 969,588 plays  * **The Wall** Another Brick in the Wall, Pt.2, 8,811,474 plays  * **The Final Cut** The Fletcher Memorial Home, 1,269,928 plays  * **A Momentary Lapse of Reason** Learning To Fly, 2,456,662 plays  * **The Division Bell** High Hopes, 888,566 plays  I would try to see if I could guess the most popular song off each album before I checked. Was surprised by a few, and others were sometimes obvious. Interesting stuff, hope you guys enjoy.   Well, I didn't intend on coming into r/pics to shit myself   Am I the only one when in the air, imagine that I'm looking at an ocean with the clouds being icebergs? Or nah?   I think the shoes are awesome and incredibly well done. I won't buy em because its just not my style of shoe. Thats not in any way an insult to you. Just not my thing. Only lower the price if the market demands for it to be lowered.   I didn't like Final Cut at first because I thought it was too polarizing. But the more I listen to it, the better it gets because I listen to it from Roger's point of view.   Making a nice buck off these?    Astronautalis  Billy Joel  Coldplay  Daft Punk  Eyedea   Abilities  Foo Fighters  Guns N' Roses  Heart? (Don't really know many h's -.-)  Imagine Dragons  John Frusciante  The Killers  Lupe Fiasco  Muse  Nirvana  O.A.R.  Pearl Jam/Pink Floyd (don't make me choose)  Queen  Red Hot Chili Peppers  Sage Francis  Twenty One Pilots  U2 (hardly any bands with a U)  Van Halen  The Who  XV   Yes  The Zombies  50 Cent      Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers. This songs guitar solo was playing as I turned 21 and it's still my favorite shit ever   If he's fit, that's more than great. But with remy, my anxiety that has lingered for the past couple of years could be relieved. Not to hail remy too early before he's done anything. But there's no denying a complete mentality shift with regards to our strike force this season. They have awesome confidence that we've needed badly.   Big Brother is always watching   This was posted about a month or so ago and went straight to the top... I see you guy.   Rhymesayers   Badass intro I love it   Ahhh good suggestions. Too much hip-hop gets slept on in here.   So /u/LackOfForesight (gotta give him credit) did a thing where he asked /r/music for 52 albums to listen to over a year in an attempt to expand his musical palette. I suggested on his thread, that we listen to the albums as a community and discuss them on a weekly basis. It didn't get really popular but it seemed that there was still a contingent in the community that would like to do this.  * So I was wondering if that's something the community would actually be interested in doing. If this gains enough traction I will definitely be happy to facilitate the postings.  * There's a couple things that need to be cleared up first. Would you guys want use the list of 52 albums that he already compiled, or create a brand new list of "52 must listen to albums"  If you want to suggest a new album please put it in a format like this:  * Artist * Album * Genre  You can suggest as many as albums as you'd like, I'll keep track of it all, but keep it reasonable to albums that you think everyone should hear. This doesn't need to be an obscure list either. Suggesting famous albums is perfectly valid too.  I hope to get a decent enough response from you guys, Thanks!  EDIT: Good start, it looks like we'll be making a new list. So this needs to preferably hit the front of music's page to make sure we get enough suggestions.   I NEED THIS   Perfect, thanks man.   There has been a lot of variety and changes within the game since the start of the spring split. Champs have come and gone.I was wondering if there was any documentation of all the champs that have been used in this Summer split or Spring Split or both splits combined. And if that list was further broken down by region. It could be like an infographic that shows which region uses the most variety of champions. I'm sure this exists somewhere, so if someone wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!   Let me guess, you read the thread title but not the thread?   Dude... We should just make this a community thing. Where everyone listens to the same album and discusses it. :)   It's because he's just matured so much since his past recordings, I think. He's an older more thoughtful dude, I expect this to be his new sound   Camera Thief is definitely my favorite song from this album, but this song is still pretty good   I think this is a phenomenal signing, hell I would've taken him as a number 1 striker if we didn't ever get Costa.   The perfect sunday morning tune   Wish you were here -- pink floyd   The music video for hero of war is so appropriately good    I remember AIM ;)   This sub-reddit has a thing called their music hall of fame. It's not a list of the greatest bands ever. It focuses more on the bands that have the most links posted of their songs. So to reduce the amount of songs that get posted over and over by the popular bands, reddit made a hall of fame for these bands. Where, basically posting threads of their song links isn't allowed. All bands in the hall of fame have their own sub reddits. You can find this hall of fame on the front page of this sub reddit, on the right side.   I'm goin to see them Sept 6th in Pitt, I'm so excited   As a Chelsea fan, this parallel hurts my heart   Twenty One Pilots live at Newport Music Hall   You just can't post music links of RHCP songs as new threads, if that's what you're referring to      This Torres story better not end up in /r/yesyesyesno   Dear lord, this has become one of my favorite Sage Francis songs. So personal... So human   Hey everyone I appreciate the honest feedback! I will definitely be listening to the suggestions. Thanks again.   I've always been into rock from the 60's-80's era, even though I wasn't alive in those eras. But it wasn't until this past summer where I really started to listening to a bunch of Pink Floyd material and I have been bumping a few of their albums (Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall) a lot. I first listened to WYWH because I always loved the song even though I never heard the album. So I listened to the album and then from there on I kept listening to more and more. I have also listened to The Final Cut, Meddle, Division Bell, and Animals. I know thats not all of their material, but I was just curious as to what other bands have a similar sound or were heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. I think PF's sound is amazing, I love the amazing guitar-work, the lyricism, the ambiance about the tunes too.   **TL;DR I recently have been listening to more and more Pink Floyd. Now I'm curious as to what other bands sound like them, or were heavily influenced by them. It can be from any era.**  Thanks!   The Q is backwards! Veigar doesn't play by the rules of mainstream alphabetical conventions.   I like the extended metaphor you used with comparing to reddit, interesting and valid observation. I'm more alarmed, not surprised, but definitely alarmed that the masses like this song by this artist that has 1 song on spotify. Not that spotify is the god of determining musical catalogues, but they usually have a great selection. So I'm just assuming that she is just a pretty face with a voice and will have Disney write her songs.   So yesterday was my 21st birthday, and 2 nights ago (night of Aug. 22 going into the 23rd) I was having a birthday party and had the gnarliest moment ever. I then thought it would be awesome at 11:55 to queue up Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers so at midnight as I turned 21, John Frusciante's guitar solo was absolutely kicking my ass and it was amazing. Beautiful, gnarly, awesome, it was just the way it had to be done.[Wet Sand, solo around 4:22ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWNDW5KtiKk)  Much love everyone, have a good day   O.A.R. -- Crazy Game Of Poker    I've been thinking about the recent players who have left our club like Mata, de Bruyne, Lukaku and Luiz, etc. But one thing I've noticed, that when players leave the club, there doesn't seem to be any bitterness to the player from the fans. Hell, Juan was a club favorite and got pushed out by Mou, but he went to Man U of all clubs and Chelsea fans still love him (including me) and Luiz didn't really have a place in Mou's squad, but he was a fan favorite. I think there's a lot that can be said about Chelsea's fanbase as well as the quality of human beings that we bring in. Players with high character and commitment to the club. Arsenal burns players jerseys when they leave, which have been all their best ones, tbh.  **TL;DR Chelsea fans are great and don't hate players after they leave like Arsenal fans do**   RHCP babyyyyyyy   Shine on you crazy diamond by Pink Floyd   You sir, this what it's all about. This is the mission. Great Wallpapers, keep it up.   Fernando is that you?  	91
 There's a Breyer horse in it's box in there!  I see it!  I collect those man.  I wonder which one it is?   upvotes for forearm love!   I love draft mules!  How is Sunny to ride?  I've thought about getting a mule as a for fun/trail mount someday.   Me too!  I lust after him whenever I watch Party Down.   Ohhhhhhh my you are a lucky lady!  If you ever get tired of him, I call dibs!  :)      SO cute.  What a tolerant little guy!  My horse would give me a withering look to end all withering looks if I did that to him.   Oh he is lovely, and so talented.  I love that this picture is so high res that I can zoom in and examine his sexy stubble!      I think Mythbusters should try to reenact this one...   The gloves I have are amazing, and are currently on sale for $15!  They are engineered for people with arthritis (they support your joints and reduce hand fatigue), but myself and many of my friends use them because they really DO reduce hand fatigue while riding and they are an all around great glove.  Plus, they are machine washable!  Nice enough that I wear mine in the show ring.  http://www.bionicgloves.com/shop/?cat=31 id=43   Your taco is indeed beefy!  I approve.  Too bad it would be weird to share...or clone him.     Since it sounds like the saddle will be used on lots of different horses, you may want to wait on buying saddle and instead get some other accessories for her.  The first thing I got when I was a kid were a set of my own stirrups (so I didn't always have to adjust when I rode), and then when I got my first horse I got a saddle.  Boots, riding pants, a new helmet, a grooming kit, etc. may be better ideas for now.   Ohhhhh my.  To have the money to build something like that!  And those Friesians!        Your horse has such great ears!  Cute and tippy.   I wish I had seen this thread earlier!  Here are mine:  Tudor Oak's The Real Deal aka "Rillo" http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg and his mom, Baby Ruth MHF aka "Baby" http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg   Please don't shut this down!  I haven't even noticed the trolls you are talking about.  Let one of us (perhaps me) mod it.  Like Nymera says, there are trolls everywhere, and in every subreddit.     My trainer always likes to say that your toes should be behind the girth, no matter what gait you are performing, though the ear/hip/heel rule is a bit different for Saddleseat, since it is acceptable to have your lower leg farther forward.  This is especially true when riding a Saddlebred at the slowgait or rack, since it is often helpful to push your feet forward a bit (though it depends on the horse).   Some of the best info I can give you are photos.  Here are pictures of this year's Senior Saddleseat Equitation World Champion.  The first picture is her "down" in her post, the rest are her "up" in her post.  Now, this is an equitation rider, so she is being judged solely on her position and control of the horse.  When I ride, my equitation isn't bad, but my legs aren't so far under me.  Sorry for the long urls.  http://howardschatzberg.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1195 show=2011%20Grand%20National%20and%20World%20Championship\OCT%2015%2C%20SATURDAY\Performance%20Arena\Afternoon\394%20-%20WC%20Saddle%20Seat%20Senior%20Equitation image=394-071-11GN.JPG  http://howardschatzberg.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1195 show=2011%20Grand%20National%20and%20World%20Championship\OCT%2015%2C%20SATURDAY\Performance%20Arena\Afternoon\394%20-%20WC%20Saddle%20Seat%20Senior%20Equitation image=394-078-11GN.JPG  http://howardschatzberg.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1195 show=2011%20Grand%20National%20and%20World%20Championship\OCT%2015%2C%20SATURDAY\Performance%20Arena\Afternoon\394%20-%20WC%20Saddle%20Seat%20Senior%20Equitation image=394-023-11GN.JPG  http://howardschatzberg.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1195 show=2011%20Grand%20National%20and%20World%20Championship\OCT%2015%2C%20SATURDAY\Performance%20Arena\Afternoon\394%20-%20WC%20Saddle%20Seat%20Senior%20Equitation image=394-035-11GN.JPG  Here is a picture of my "equitation" (these are old pictures from when I was a teenager).  Down in my post (my heels could be more down) http://i.imgur.com/P3nbi.jpg  Up in my post http://i.imgur.com/3p2Gu.jpg (again, more weight should be in my heels)  Hope this helps a bit!  Above all, don't ride like this!!!  http://www.uphaonline.com/images/2010%20awards/lamborghini-in-black.jpg (phenomenal horse, but terrible leg position!)    I can't help you out with a date, but I would like to commend you for also using the word "pineapple" in your username!   I will always, ALWAYS upvote this, mostly because my boyfriend is a spitting image.  Grrrrowwwlllllllll.   Can you post a picture of his entire body so we can see his socks?  It would give him a better shot at being ID'd.  I have people I can send his photo and info to, but I know they'll want to see all his markings.   I haven't encountered another mix like this in person, but some people are beginning to intentionally breed them.  They call them "Spangold Retrievers" (which is an *incredibly* stupid name), but you can get one on the internet!  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/s/spangoldretriever.htm   Best ever!  Whenever I got to Europe, I stock up :)   I am by no means a "professional", but I have a nice camera, and have done things like equine photography and senior photos for people.  I think I could make it work.   Bart is darling!  And yes, where the heck to you ride?  Magical Acres???  It's beautiful!  Also, non-jumper person question: What exactly are the ear nets used for?  I see them on jumpers all the time, but we don't use them in my discipline.     oh yeah, rub that dirt right in to all the WHITE spots.  :)   Apollo is a Springer Spaniel/Golden Retriever cross.  We got him from the pound when he was a pup.   She is so cute!  I'm guessing she doesn't have the spaniel in her though, because her ears are way smaller and without curly hair.  I think black lab/golden is spot on.  Mutts are the best!   This is my dog!  He is from the pound also, and is a springer spaniel/golden retriever cross.  How big is your dog?  Apollo here is about 65 lbs.         Is this the one where we have to be from Canada?  I'll gladly participate, but I am in the U.S.   I don't know who this is, but I want one.   Wow, beautiful!  And I love your coat. :)   I came here because I KNEW he would be on the frontpage.  A ladyboner for sure!   This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  We love a good beard over there.   This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  Hellooooooooooooo OP.   This is a cute picture, but does not accurately convey his hotness.  Let's try this one!  http://28.media.tumblr.com/6imY2Ibivosygedu4nGXPYRxo1_500.jpg  Also this one is more recent: http://www.baltimoresun.com/media/photo/2011-01/58991602.jpg      Well whoever told you to post this here was correct!  Hot hotness!  And I concur with Januarys_Own -- may we see more?   He is super sexy, and when he rolls up his sleeves and kneads fondant...oooooooooo...  Have you seen the video of him playing guitar and singing?  Extra hot.      I just meant that I don't know who this is, or who the other out of focus people are.  I'm not a pop-culture queen, so this could totally be a famous person and I would have no idea.  Regardless, he's very easy on the eyes. :)   I don't really know what I'm looking at, but I like it!   Oh my.   ...wanna rip that moustache right off him.  Rawr.   Sweet jeebus, did you see this photo?  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SPKGl9Ae9N0/TkKkb3sZf6I/AAAAAAAAAxo/dbFhc8uBHxw/s1600/mateus+verdelho4.jpg   Thanks!  And yes, that is indeed me in the saddle.  :)   Oh my.  Yes!   This is a hunter pleasure class (the way Morgans do it).  This particular division was the Ladies Amateur Hunter Pleasure World Championship.  And yes, here are some pictures of him "au natural".  He loves to play in the snow. :)  1) http://i.imgur.com/bbXAq.jpg  2) http://i.imgur.com/zQ7nj.jpg  3) http://i.imgur.com/V5TBh.png  He goes home today and will begin the first day of his winter vacation tomorrow.  No shoes, no haircuts, and lots of time outside to run and play and roll in everything!  He loves to go to shows and loves to work, but I think he's ready for a break!!!     Muppet dog!   As the owner of a different dog named Apollo, I approve!  He looks snuggly!   Why does Iceland have to be so far away from where I live?      My GOD.  You are beautiful!  And wearing plaid!  And I'll be you have nice forearms too.  That's the test_subject773 trifecta right there.  	56
          god i love that they do that.   the Gaystapo is real  (and rather fabulous)   it WAS peer reviewed, and they present a conclusion   what would your conclusion be?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YARnr5jA_lw   [i'm your huckleberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OWNspU_yE)   Whoa, wait, really? Like what happens if you hover over the word "study?" Does it show the link indicator? or does it come up as just a word? Cuz that's really strange.

You vill not be laffing vhen ze Gaystapo comes to visit YOU   right, because everybody who enlists is deployed   We have lost too many, far too soon. If any of you are feeling down, please, please PLEASE know that no matter how far down that rabbit hole you go, no matter how hopeless it feels, PLEASE know that it will pass. so many of us have been exactly where Jess was, and we all somehow managed to come out on the other side. Please come talk to us, or with a friend, or call a hotline.    HUG   rest in peace and power, jess. i'm sorry we didnt have more time together.   because being trans isnt a mental illness  duh   yeeeeeeeeeeeeup   Congrats! welcome to planet girl!   jeez, how many trans people are there in singapore? i thought i knew of them all.   didnt see it, my bad!   yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup   ok, shot them a pm, i'll let you know as soon as they get back to me. if you dont hear from me, shoot me a PM and i'll folow up, k?   even tho i left singapore 20 years ago, i know 3 other trans people there, i can get the info of their docs if you'd like. and i think the age limit for T is 18, but i could be wrong.   i often wonder how my life would have turned out if i had come out at 18, would it have been easier or harder? i LOVE how attitudes towards trans people have changed so that it's more conducive for us to come out younger and younger.   now as to what you can do.... any plans for college? trade school? student loans can be very helpful in getting your life started. (if you do it right)  any family member who's understanding enough that they'll give you a place to crash while you get yourself on your feet? or a friend's place?   that is the most amazing fucking story i've heard in a long time. congrats dude! your fam fam sounds friggin AWESOME   sad but true.   i dunno, maybe an ounce of human kindness..   you're at the inbetweeny stage right now, and that's one of the worst parts of transitioning. EVERYTHING was hard for me and i found myself questioning my sanity on a daily basis. but even then, i knew there was no going back for me. i tried being the boy everybody told me i was. but deep down inside, i knew i was a girl. and deep down inside, i think you know it too, i think a LOT of us know that. hang on, this will pass.  and one thing i know is that you are NOT alone, we're all here for you.   Well, seeing a therapist is always a good first step, that's the one thing we always stress in all the trans subs. we tend to have a certain bias toward that kind of question, one that almost invariably leads to a positive answer.   that being said, certain aspects of your story are extremely similar to mine. growing up, i always used to sneak into my sister's room and try on her clothes. they just felt soooooooo good to try on, and it made me very happy.  of course that led to a looooooooooooong period of buying and purging women's clothes. even in the army, i always had an  item or two stashed away.  it was always JUST enough, to wear the clothes whenever i got those "urges". but eventually, the need to be a girl became too great. i had to face the fact that i wasnt, in fact, a crossdresser, that i was, in fact, just a girl.  that was kind of a hard fact to reconcile with myself, especially with me being 42. but, as with all things in life, facts have a funny way of being true, regardless of how you, or anyone else, feels about them.   and the fact of the matter, was that i AM a girl. Nothing on god's green earth can change that.  go see your therapist, if nothing else, telling someone else and sharing that secret you've had for so long is extremely liberating. you'll feel a weight lift off, sounds hokey, i know, but when i told my therapist, it was SUCH a feeling of relief. a secret like that weighs you down, and it just gets heavier and heavier, but it does so gradually, so you dont really notice til it's lifted.   see your therapist, i hope you find your answer there. and please, always feel free to come here to share. you might also want to post in /r/asktransgender, or go read thru the posts there. you'll find lots of stories similar to yours. you're not alone, there are plenty of us who share the same stories.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk   Have you accepted the Bright One as your Lord and Savior?   you should also sub to /r/genderqueer, plenty of people with creative gender presentations there.   ohhhhh, my bad   i didnt post it in awwducational   grooooooooooooooan   correct   the normies are a simple people, they actually think gender is binary and static. can you imagine such a thing?   SHAME   well, the first thing i'd say is for you to bring this up with a therapist.   now that the disclaimer is out of the way...  that button test we all go on about, you know, the one where we press it and hey change-o presto, you get to wake up the next day and be a girl? guess what, you can press it at any time. just in your case, you wake up in a girl's body that's 6'3" and 273 pounds. and in so doing, you get to join the party of trans girls, and girls in general, bemoaning the fact that we dont look like supermodels. congratulations! here's a cookie.  look, it's not easy for us, but we transition because we're trans, and we're NOT the gender we were assigned at birth. we dont transition to fit into society's assumption of some arbitrary standard of what constitutes a female.   that fear of what other people will think holds so many of us back, and that fear is often what drives so many of us to attempt suicide, some of us, multiple times.  go make an appointment with a gender therapist, it'll help more than you think. and dont forget, we'll always be here for you.  oh, and welcome to planet girl, buckle up, it's a hell of a ride   please be civil   please be civil    Your yard is becoming Relentlessly Gay!   alrighty then   i know, right? no matter who loses, we all win   looking good!   actually, it's a YMMV kinda thing. i know plenty of trans guys who sound cis   jes a wee li'l bit. teeny, tiny, li'l bit   congrats!! you look amazing!   i left 20 years ago. shit hasnt changed   *sigh* one day maybe i'll go back. not any time soon tho   it's not blocked out for me.

Trans women are women. Period. End of story. Were not women who used to be men. Were not men who identify as women. Were not males who identify as women. Were not men who became women. WE ARE WOMEN. Stop putting qualifiers on our womanhood. Its offensive, hurtful and cruel to insinuate otherwise. Our past, present, and futures are ours to define and no one elses. Even if we didnt figure out that we were trans until well into our adult lives, it absolutely does not mean that we were ever boys or men. Many trans women feel that theyve always been girls, or at the very least, that theyve never been boys. You dont have any right to tell me, or any other trans person, that they were ever a particular gender, just as I have no right to tell you what gender you are. A trans woman who was obligated to present as male for most of her young life is was no more born a man than a lesbian who was obligated to date men for most of her young life used to be straight.   lololol   like i said, trans women are women. not a very hard concept to grasp.    send the message to the admins, and explain to them what happened.   it's ok to admit when you're wrong  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-if-sky-is-green-run-for-cover-tornado-is-coming/   that's like saying you agree that the world is round, but you think it's ok that other people think it's flat. sure, they're entitled to their opinion, but they'd still be wrong. the FACT is that the world IS round. (well, roundish) and the FACT is that trans women are simply women.    i'm not the one arguing against gravity.  also, green sky http://kinooze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/green-sky-northen-lights.jpg     it's not a very hard concept to grasp, so i'm sure you wont mind til i repeat it until everybody gets it. trans women are women, plain and simple. left handed women are women, right handed women are women, indian women are women, australian women are women, asian women are women, caucasian women are women.  now repeat after me.  trans women arent men, they're women.  thank you for your time.   sorry, nope again. trans women are women. 'nuff sed.   trans women are women, not men.   thank you, thank you, i'll be here all week   i have no idea, mayhap we should ask the beekeepers?   Carlson graduated from Stanford University in 1990 with a degree in sociology    WITNESS ME   who said religion was logical?   http://comicsalliance.com/fivethirtyeight-superhero-demographic/  as i said, the demographics that skew heavily male....   yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!   yeah, they're looking at the market, they see the demographics that skew heavily male. it's news when there's a strong female character or plotline because of how rare it is. marvel is extremely risk adverse   and we find religious fanatics pushing back just as hard. and they use religion as the specific excuse why gay rights need to be opposed.   who cares what drove them to start getting interested in comics? as long as they ARE interested in comics   the majority of people on this planet are with you   ok, if Jennering becomes a phrase..... god help us all   it's fine to be a republican for the fiscal conservatism, it's the social conservatives that i have an issue with.   back in my day, we invented fire, and stone tools   nope, she split from Kris   nah, she's a lesbian, altho he IS pretty femme   missed it by THAT much   you have to do it one step at a time, break up the journey into chunks. you're looking at the totality of it all and that's why it looks like a mountain. but if you aim for the tree just ahead, then the valley after that, then the group of rocks after that, it becomes manageable.  so you make the appointment with the therapist, or you plan to move out and get your own place, or you start saving up for laser or electro, or you start practicing your voice, or you ask for help.  even baby steps eventually get you there.   yeah, but bernie means it   nope, by all means, jump on in   i'll take it   just being realistic here   slim to none   because bernie wants a healthy middle class again, so those young people dont feel that joining the military as their only viable option. bernie doesnt have a shot at winning the nomination, but he can certainly move the party left. right now, the democrats are basically moderate republicans   it's kinda interesting to me that only men make those kinda jokes   the polls show that a majority of the rank and file republicans are fine with same-sex marriage and lgbt culture in general. it's the leaders and the vocal minority of social conservatives that drive the narrative. that's why the talking heads can rant about it, but most serious politicians(i.e. the ones that want to win) wont touch it with a ten foot pole.    growing up in south east asia, i know there are temples covered in swastikas, and those went up waaaaaaaaaay before hitler appropriated it and twisted it into a symbol of universal hate, loathing,  and revulsion   hey, nobody dies under obamacare   hmmm, good point.    soooooo, none, gotcha   and what side effects would those be?   When child abuse specialists, teachers, lawyers, and child care and school administrators convened at a symposium in 1995 to collectively decide what distinguishes developmentally expected sexual behaviors from those that suggest dysfunctional development and could be harmful, they decided that masturbation, inspecting the bodies of other children, and kissingthe three things Dunham writes about doingall belonged in the first category.   As opposed to  the criminal-justice definition of sibling sexual abuse, which is forcible rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault with an object, and forcible fondling. which Josh Duggar clearly engaged in, according to his own admission.     hell, i sometimes misgender myself....   i mean, what the hell happened? i thought brownback was toxic? how in the hell did he manage to win re-election??    I do not believe what she did was right  even tho that goes against the opinions of all the psychologists in that article that what she did WASNT abuse. so you're saying that your opinion trumps theirs? what are your qualifications that you can override them?    let's review, shall we?  child psychologists have deemed what josh duggar did WAS abuse.  child psychologists have deemed what lena dunham did was NOT abuse.  there's no liberal/conservative opinion talking points here. one was abuse, one was not. end of story. but please, dont let facts get in the way of your attempt to link the two.   true that   *sigh* that has GOT to suck   Urgh, sorry about that   "This is clearly not a case of abuse," developmental psychologist Ritch Savin-Williams, director of the Sex and Gender Lab at Cornell University, [told Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/04/lena_dunham_sibling_sexual_abuse_allegations_ridiculous_and_dangerous.html). "Children have been doing this stuff forever and ever and ever and ever, and they will do it forever and ever and ever."   "This is clearly not a case of abuse," developmental psychologist Ritch Savin-Williams, director of the Sex and Gender Lab at Cornell University, [told Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/04/lena_dunham_sibling_sexual_abuse_allegations_ridiculous_and_dangerous.html). "Children have been doing this stuff forever and ever and ever and ever, and they will do it forever and ever and ever."

"Children have been doing this stuff forever and ever and ever and ever, and they will do it forever and ever and ever."   there are no apologists, child psychologists have reviewed what Lena Dunham did and all of them have concluded that what she did was not abuse or molestation,  and appears innocent.   yeeeeeeeeeeup   i do know what you're talking about, i have a little transphobia myself, to the girls who i clock as "male." It's usually the girls (never the guys) who have just come out, the ones at the inbetweeny stage. it's something i am ashamed to admit. which is different again from the girls who have been transitioning for awhile who have so called "male" features that i find VERY attractive. it's kinda strange.   i know things can get heated in discussions, but please be civil and refrain from attacking the other person   i think Kansas trumps North Carolina in stupidity   Psychiatrist and WPATH Board Member, Dr. Dan Karasic, responded quickly to the WSJ, and his letter was one of a few selected for publication. We are including the full text of Dr. Karasics response below, though it is important to note that the WSJ editors chose to omit his clarification of Dr. Dhejnes research. WPATH members should be aware of the facts concerning these debates.  Dr. Paul McHugh ("Transgender surgery isnt the solution) writes about the study at Johns Hopkins in the 1970s showing poor outcomes from transgender surgeries, leading to McHugh shutting down Johns Hopkins transgender program in 1979, and the US Department of Health and Human Services declaring transgender surgery experimental, and therefore not covered. Two weeks ago, HHS reversed its 1981 decision, and removed transgender health exclusions from Medicare. McHugh seems unaware of the work in transgender health in these last 30 years that led to this reversal by HHS.   McHugh does cite one study from 2011, by Cecilia Dhejne, MD and colleagues at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. However, he misunderstands Dr. Dhejnes work. In the paper, Dr. Dhejne states that the study was not designed to draw conclusions on the efficacy of transgender surgeries, yet McHugh does exactly that. A closer reading of the paper shows that the increased mortality is in those who had surgery before 1989, and that mortality in trans people after 1989 is not statistically different from the general population. A recently published paper by Dr. Dhejne and colleagues shows that the regret rate for those having surgery from 2001-2010 is only 0.3%. Dr. Dhejnes work shows that outcomes for transgender surgery have improved tremendously in the past 30 years, which supports the HHS decision to remove trans exclusions.   McHugh also mischaracterizes the treatment of gender nonconforming children. As McHugh states, most gender nonconforming children do not identify as transgender in adulthood.  However, those who receive puberty blocking drugs do not do so until puberty, when trans identity is likely to persist. These drugs allow adolescents and their parents to work with doctors to achieve the best outcome. This approach was demonstrated to be successful in research in the Netherlands before being adopted widely in the U.S.   The American Psychiatric Association and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health no longer view transgender identity as inherently pathological. Dr. McHughs views are stuck in the past.   Dan Karasic, MD   Health Sciences Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, UCSF   Member, American Psychiatric Association Workgroup on Gender Dysphoria   Member, Board of Directors, World Professional Association for Transgender Health    holy bejesus yes. girl orgasms  boy orgasms   no misgendering   lmao, love you too!   please dont use the "R" word   i know you're upset, but please keep it civil   dont misgender people   as another high femme, keep on keeping on.   i'm trans too, and i havent seen any difference in the way people talk to me when it comes to IT stuff..... prolly because i'm asian. lol, so many stereotypes. valets used to look at me funny when i had to park my car, now they just open the door automatically and park it for me. stereotypes abound.   o.O   not one of the authors, no. but i mod over at /r/asktransgender now, so i'm always on the hunt for trans related studies to add to the resources page.  here are a few i've found  http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943   http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm  http://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-suggests-taking-paracetamol-while-pregnant-affects-male-babies  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661470/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3977439/   http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/243636-osha-issues-guidance-on-bathroom-access-for-transgender-employees  and the Feds disagree with you too.   literal Jess is literal. it's in the title, silly   yeeeeeeeeeeeup    Because I'm not being transphobic. I'm considering everyone's comfort.. Not just the selfish transgender (wo)man i'm talking too  no, you're not, you're basically saying that YOU arent comfortable with trans people. that's it. you do not speak for anybody else.   Simply put, I do not care one bit if you want to go so crazy as to slap on a pair of leggings, a tutu and a bright orange neon thong, prance around and sing I'm a barbie girl followed up with whatever the hell girls do.  and sexist too, nice.   I however do not think you need to be in a restroom where many people expect a certain level of privacy from members of the opposite sex. You are not physically built like a woman. This can cause discomfort to people who are.  again, transphobic. even after i posted the study of all the schools, comprising 600k students where transgender polices are in effect showing that there have been ZERO incidents.  The best response you have to this is to keep saying it doesn't because "there are no recorded incidents" Is a totally dishonest way to debate seeing as there are pretty much no studies out there taking into consideration how the physically male and female students feel about it. At least none that are easily accessible. I can find a grand total of 3 quotes from students forced to share the restroom.  if there have been no reported incidents, then there is no reason to restrict access. like i sed, you have a solution in search of a problem.  I'm misgendering you because you're not even reading a damn word I say and overall being very disingenuous in how you are conducting this discussion... If you can call it that. I don't respect you enough to give a shit what you think you are at this point.  so basically you made up a reason for misgendering me. gotcha  like i said, there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege or transphobia. just like the fundies.   LET'S GET READY TO RUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMBLE   they got away with it for 7 years, that's a nice chunk of change   you cant see how transphobic you're being, which means you're as stubborn as the fundies, where you are right and every trans person is wrong. i've shown you again and again, thru studies, thru surveys , thru articles. the only thing you've done is consistently misgender me and say that trans people shouldnt use the bathrooms of their choice because you find it icky.    again, none so blind as those who cannot see. nice to find out that the fundies arent the only ones afflicted by it.   right, like i said, as long as we established that you were in fact transphobic. it's ok to admit that you're wrong, we all make mistakes.   even tho there have been zero incidents at the school districts that have instituted a transgender policy where trans people can in fact have the use of the restroom of their gender. yet you insist on saying that it would make people uncomfortable. again, you advocate a solution where no problem exists.   there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege, or their own bigotry.   absent religion people, like you, will automatically default to the "ick" argument. EWWWW, that's grossssssss. i don wanna see it, make it go awaaaaaaaaaaaay.   which, is a pretty juvenile argument, and i'm glad that i could point it out. it's not MY problem that you cant get over your own prejudice.     	189

 What is the opinion of historians on the House Select Committee report that concluded that a conspiracy was more likely than not? If the lone gunman theory is so well supported, how did the House Committee go so far off the rails?   Not that I necessarily believe this "shipwrecked Indians" story, but is a canoe traversal from Greenland to Iceland, thence onwards to the Faroes or Orkneys and Scotland or Norway essentially impossible? Let's assume a well-stocked Inuit canoe that had just finished a large seal or walrus hunt was blown into the open ocean by a storm. They reach Iceland and then decide this was an intervention by "the gods" or something and decide to press on. Could they conceivably have survived and reached Europe?      The dudes who believed God was five feet tall and went around beating up Quakers? I love those guys!   There are a lot of accounts of meetings with human-like "Nordic" aliens in UFOs, who might be humans *pretending* to be aliens, but beware this will take you down the Esoteric Hitlerism/Nazi survival rabbithole, aka people who think "Iron Sky" is real.      The drug is pretty much a key plot element throughout the series though, so I wouldn't call it a deus ex machina. The "machina" at the end of Dune was of a more literal kind!      They also have a very singular rare books library.   Ancient and rare mystical manuscripts housed in the NSA library? Now there's a good beginning to a pulp thriller novel.       Yes, it's impossible. The hypotenuse must be the longest side of a right triangle.   Triangle problems can be confusing when the labeling is unclear. Can you upload a picture of the problem?  Also, in the pythag. theorem, it's a^2 + b^2 = c^2. You seem to have b^2 as the isolated term, which might be your problem.   Me too, I just wake up. I've never experienced this void state.   Nothing bizarre happened, but there were some people roaming around very much alive who are very much dead in reality (relatives, etc.) The realism was pitch-perfect and even though I knew (correctly) that it was a dream, after a while I was convinced that I had somehow entered a parallel universe.  Anyone else ever done a reverse RC and convinced themselves that they were awake when they were really dreaming?   Wouldn't surprise me. I think the "changing text" RC is one of the least reliable. There's all kinds of pseudoscience about how the higher reasoning functions in your brain are deactivated during dreaming so you can't read coherently or form complex thoughts. I think there's *some* truth to this (my thinking is always muddy in dreams, even in Lucid Dreams), but the reading stuff is not supported by the first-hand experiences of people on this board and others.   Sooo... I was a female librarian in Siberia, in the year 450 AD   The theory is, you can read in lucid dreams, but when you check back the same text again, it's totally different. You're supposed to be able to do the same thing with clocks. I've never been able to test this, in my lucid dreams no text or clocks ever show up.   While we're at it... I don't think Sacha Baron Cohen is funny at all, and a Jewish guy making such vicious fun of Muslim/Arab cultures is more than a little icky in my book.   I would more say 1910-1997      Don't know then. I would see a doctor to make sure you don't have any heart defects and if you don't, then I wouldn't worry about it. The heart rate charts you see at the gym are only population averages, as others have pointed out, each individual is different.   although some stories even suggest it was a home for earlier Prophets, too.  That is interesting. What prophets were believed to have come before Abraham?   The dominant Labour Party was an offshoot of the early leftist Zionism, but (much like Britain's Labour Party) they quickly veered to slightly left of center.  You have a very long view of history if you think this was a "quick" process in either case!       Are you just using the heart-rate monitor on the cardio machine? Those are not very accurate. They'll pick up stray vibrations from the motion of the machine and interpret them as heartbeats.            Louie is great, but it's a lot more serious and introspective than Seinfeld. The standup cut-outs are about the only thing the two shows have in common.   Curb is I know by the same creator, but it just seems fundamentally different to me somehow. It's a creature of the reality-show age - Seinfeld, despite its postmodernism, wasn't.                  I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off.   However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death.   A lot of info is from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Un-pharaon-republicain-Enquetes-Edition/dp/2733906143) (only in French, sorry). I don't know much about the reputation of the author as a historian, but some these sites described in the book do actually exist.   Several sources ranging from academic to downright dubious claim he though he had a literally divine mission to rule France, that he was outwardly a Socialist, but secretly part of a Fascist cult known as "The Hood," that he built an obelisk covered in Masonic symbols and would meditate beneath it at night, etc. etc.  It all sounds pretty crazy but unlike most other conspiracy theories this one seems to have some evidence behind it. What do you guys think?     Tuition only covers part of the cost. Taxpayers pay the rest.   That's basically what I want to know - can these families be traced back to Roman forebears, are they barbarian families that were "Italianized" over time, or some combination of the two?  Or is their origin genuinely unknown due to the lack of historical records in that time period?   For the most part, we have government doing important stuff.   Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented.   The breathing exercises, the sitting postures and some of the simpler standing postures can be verified back 1000+ years, though not back to the time of the Vedas.  The more gymnastic stuff is a modern concoction, as was recently shown in the NY Times (link is in the top comment.) Yoga shorn of its doctrinal, religious element is also a modern phenomenon, but you probably already knew that.   I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.  Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing.   TIL. I never had any idea such places existed. I figured Tom Hanks had to go to get his license renewed just like the rest of us. Any more info on these departments? I am curious.   Government is not 40% of GDP in the US. Maybe in some European countries. But your wider argument is valid.   Government work is about being compliant with rules, fair to all stake holders, and risk minimizing.   I see no problem with parts of the economy being run on those lines. If it is the whole economy of course, that is a recipe for stagnation. But I also think that running the whole economy on the profit principle is a recipe for destruction. Call me a mushy moderate but I think a proper balance is necessary.   Unfortunately the Supreme Court doesn't see it that way. In my state, taxpayers already fund all the expenses of religious schools (mainly Catholic) except teacher salaries and *religious* textbooks. Everything else: Physical maintenance, other textbooks, transportation, even heating and air conditioning costs, are borne by the public.   Almost all folks in the government are sincere and trying to do a good job. And they do accomplish big, complex things. But when we bid on government work, we routinely doubled the time required.  Might that not be because of the very complexity of what government does, as opposed to, say, Starbucks?   Maybe so, but I've lived in a number of different areas (rural, suburban, urban), and not particularly wealthy areas either - and one or two were definitely downscale, and I've never had a bad experience at either place.  Contrast that with the hundreds of frustrations that I've had with private corporations' customer service makes me look askance at people who say government is always less efficient.      I haven't noticed much difference between any of the three on the receiving end. When choosing shipping I just use whatever's cheaper. When shipping things I always use the post office. They are a lot more knowledgeable and helpful in my experience (and cheaper too.)   Debt levels really aren't that extreme in Europe, the problem is there is now a disconnect between the people making fiscal policy (nations) and the people making monetary policy (the EU).   I've been to the DMV.  Me too, and I've never had any problems. In fact I'm impressed with how well they handle the volume and the complexity of what they do. Same with the post office.      All true, I've just never thought about it in terms of energy output per unit of volume before.          It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.  An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists.   Technically, the rule in Buddhist doctrine is "every *conditioned object* is impermanent." Nirvana is considered the "undying element" since it is not conditioned.   Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.  Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.  It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.)   here was the Holy Roman Empire, which kings were eventually elected, which seems counterintuitive considering how the system is generally known.  Yes, but only by a handful of noble "electors," not by the general population.   Awesome, I didn't realize I was a government!   They are products of the modern media culture where everything has to be over-the-top and confrontational. Bertrand Russell they are not. However, I am not too worked up over this. The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.  However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with.   I agree with you about Krauss, he really comes across as a charlatan. People who buy his book expecting a real answer to the Big Question are going to come away very disappointed.   Sure, I know some old white guys like that - blacks are "fine in their own way" but their culture is too different from ours and it would be better if we just split up into separate countries. They even say they like Malcolm X and guys like that because they also have the same beliefs (blacks and whites should be separate.)  They are just trying to make their racism seem more politically correct in my mind. But if you actually take them at their word, how would this ever be done? Can you imagine the chaos? It would be like the India-Pakistan partition times a thousand. And there are too many mixed-race people now for it to ever be practical.  Also I can guess which "country" would end up with all the economic and military resources. It wouldn't be the new "Negrostan."   I liked how the guy who said "you can tell I'm not Jewish just by looking at me" kinda looks like Adam Sandler.   Hey God, stop squeaking your chair!   The girls in the film have grown up now and have publicly renounced racism.    It makes a little more sense now, thanks. Relating it to something I know more about, it seems similar to using the Poisson distribution (where there are technically an infinite number of draws) to model a process that, while technically finite, is so large as to be practically infinite.   That last little bit of fat is good for you. Your body and especially brain need some fat reserves. I wouldn't freak about it as long as you feel good.         From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it.   Yes, the brain processes complex stimuli. Where I think consciousness differs from this processing activity is in the *presentation* of the stimuli as an immediate whole.  I would say that "the awareness that one exists" as a "self" is subjectivity, or at least the beginnings of it, not consciousness. I would say consciousness precedes self-awareness.    I think that better defines subjectivity rather than consciousness. Consciousness seems to be immediate apprehension of a complex set of stimuli, not a process.          That's not a glitch, that's a peek at the assembly code.   You are defining consciousness as a disconnect between two elements, one of which is already consciousness.   He might have, but it is far less likely. Choice of venue is important. Attacking an institution where one studied or was employed instead of random civilians is psychologically significant.    consciousness is merely a disconnect between the automatic operations and the conscious operations of the brain.  Not trying to pick on you, but that contradictory sentence right at the beginning of your post shows just how hard it is to get at any coherent idea of consciousness.   My friend once had a dream where she was given a phone number *and address* by the "reincarnation" of a friend of hers who had died (yikes...)   To my eternal frustration, she never called and soon forgot the number!!   The immigration part is what's illegal. And $250/month would be well under minimum wage. Still doesn't stop a lot of people from trying.   The link, again, does not lead to a workplace or school shooting. Also:  as of April 2008 he was unemployed and had to face severe financial difficulties.  which sort of goes with what I have been saying.    The higher incidence being at least partly related to guns was part of my original point (and the author's). Smith was not a school/workplace shooter.  If Goh had stayed in Korea he probably would have committed suicide without harming others, as that is how social antagonism often plays out in that country.   They have been shown to have a much higher incidence in the US than in other countries, and for different motivations, that is, they are almost never *overtly* political like the recent killings in Norway and France were.  Of course Goh was a sociopath, but you can't ignore the culture either. His most likely inborn mental illness was exacerbated by his cultural context, whereas other contexts would have been more likely to ameliorate it.    Night-vision goggles have infrared light emitters that aren't supposed to be seen with normal vision. Given the amount of drug trafficking and associated military/police activity in Texas, I don't think this was an alien. It's not clear to me from the video what the figure's distance is and if it was downhill or not.   Also, Brad Steiger is not an "image expert," he is an author and a journalist.    There was a clear motive of self-interest - revenge and regaining lost honor. Perhaps the oldest motivation for violence and killing that exists. Focusing on the "irrational" aspects of this case denies the strong forces of cultural determination that the author of the article pointed out. The workplace/school shooting is as much a product of modern culture as the duel was of the 18th Century and the lynching in the 19th.   True, but what you said was such mass violence isn't influenced by poverty. I think that's incorrect and the African bush wars are a very good example.   That's a US Army soldier wearing night-vision goggles. I don't see where it appears "gigantic" at all.    I disagree, especially when the "war" is more of a chaotic mass looting and killing for no reason. The media interprets events in Africa through the lens of "Genocide," one tribe trying to wipe out another. What goes unreported is how often these forces *attack their own side*.   Actually in places like Africa, spree killings are so common, they're almost an institution. Ever hear of a brush war?         I don't think it was a protest - at least a conscious one - but I do think it was an economic decision. People with low economic status have "less to lose" by such acts and thus do not have as strong a motivation to repress violent urges as others.   250 million guns aren't connected to our political culture? As for poverty, that is definitely both a cause and an effect of political culture. I don't see how population really has much to do with it. If you wanted a similar unit of comparison you could use the European Union which has 300 million plus population as well.   Would you deny that there is a link in general between the very high levels of violence in America as opposed to other industrialized countries and the political culture in the US? Because if you admit that link I think you would have to admit the link between mass killings and the culture as a special case thereof.   You should have read that link a little more carefully:  Not included are school massacres, workplace killings, hate crimes or familicides, which form their own categories.  Each culture has its own version of the "rampage" or the "beserker" which says something about the stresses of that particular culture. In America the workplace and school shootings are more common - in Europe and Africa, overtly political rampages are more common. Again, don't discount that book before you read it.   You should read the author's book "Going Postal." This is by no means an isolated incident. It is part of a repeated and widespread sociological pattern. That Goh had problems beyond what society can be blamed for is not the point. The point is instead of ameliorating or controlling those problems, Goh's social context exacerbated them until he exploded. He is the latest in a long list of workplace and school shooters.   Every society has its psychopaths, but how that psychosis manifests does say something about the society. The 9/11 attackers did *say something* about Muslim society - even though of course they didn't represent the views of most Muslims. Anders Brevik's killing spree did *say something* about the tradition of White Nationalism and Nazi sympathy in the Nordic countries, even though most Norwegians abhor his views, etc.  Likewise, Goh's shootings do *say something* about the pervasive culture of economic scams and hypocritical religion in the US, even though there is of course much more to the US than scams and fundamentalist hucksters.            [Here's an interview with Shostak](http://www.astrobio.net/debate/3036/technology-worlds) where he goes more in-depth and mentions Seyfert galaxies.   The two top candidates for these kinds of structure are Hoag's Object (a strange galaxy where stars have been separated by type - no one knows how), and Seyfert Galaxies - badly disturbed galaxies that some have speculated are "industrial accidents" left behind by Type III civilizations.  The artificial nature of these structures is by no means proven, but some reputable astronomers have speculated in that direction.   There is a very long taboo in a lot of Buddhist groups about claiming attainments, because it would start endless arguments about who was really Enlightened, etc. This kind of attitude was learned through hard experience. On the other hand, being super-mysterious about it has its disadvantages as well.   Sounds like you have Sleep Paralysis. Sufferers often report experiencing an evil presence in the room with them, often slowly coming towards them. It's something to do with the brain's self/other perception going haywire.  If you don't mind me asking, what's so terrifying about this "ghost"? It can't be appearance, since you describe it as a cartoonish "bed-sheet ghost."   No, but sometimes a dog is following me and I think I've dropped my keys   Imagining exercise might cue the body to think that exercising is immanent, cuing increased heart rate, etc., just like imagining food can cause salivation. But yeah, I'd like to see a source too. It seems like that would be too weak of an effect to result in any noticeable weight loss. I could see where an ill-controlled study that didn't monitor subjects' eating habits might see that effect - if you imagine exercise every night you might become more health-conscious and change your eating habits.   Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.  Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing.   Depends when you date the beginning of the Civil War.   The U.S. and Canada got away with it.  And the British Empire. Read the book "The Victorian Holocaust." They killed more people in India alone than Hitler did in all the places he conquered. Of course, they had a lot longer to get the killing done. Mainly they used deliberate starvation like Stalin, but they weren't above gassing people either (Churchill suggested that the Kurds should be eliminated by gassing their villages- Saddam wasn't the one to think of that first.)   Quite eye-opening. The dialectic of White Nationalism eventually leads the thoughtful racist to sympathize with the Indians (!), and equate his own ancestors with today's globalists.   Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.    They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:  Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.  Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)  In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.  Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.  By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres.   However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...  take it from there!     I haven't read that but I did read "Young Stalin" by the same author. It actually prompted my question as it had a number of incidents of Stalin acting in a very reckless manner that could be suggestive of psychosis or clinical paranoia.   Yes, I think that's where I heard it too. Great show.   I've heard this story too. Apparently this happened back in Georgia. He was with some fellow Bolsheviks and he wanted to prove his toughness and mercilessness so he killed the animal (in the version I heard, he strangled it.) I'm not sure how much validity this story has or where I heard it.   Yes, I know he did a lot of that early on in his rule. I'm more thinking of later on, the Great Terror and later, all the people who died shouting "long live Stalin!" and actually meant it. Did Stalin think those people had secretly betrayed him (clinical paranoia), or was he killing people he knew to be loyal for some other reason?   Don't forget the "Blues," the supporters of the Provisional Government!   Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.  Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.  Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.  In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness.            According to something I saw on TV, you can do this in Baltimore just by asking people to say the name of the city! Not sure how accurate or scientific this is however.   I've heard it called a "gloss" although that term has a more technical meaning as well.

The ability to exchange dollars for gold ended for US citizens in 1933.    Because of the Equatorial bulge, Mt. Chimborazo is the point on the Earth's surface furthest from the center, see [here](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/16/chimborazo-vs-everest/)   Numbers like 24, 60 and 360 are useful because they have lots of factors. That is, there are lots of ways to subdivide them without remainder. That is one reason these numbers show up a lot in calculating everyday things like time and angle.   They will just replace the actor and no one will know the de-diddily-ifference. Seriously, the Simpsons has attained a kind of undead immortality. It's in the same category now as those unfunny comic strips that have been running since the 1950's.   Search for the Most Amazing Thing? I think... I have very vague memories of that game which was old even when I was a little kid.   Someone did note on here a few days ago that the number-played frequency has two discontinuous drops, after 12 and 31, because people play their birthday numbers. The winning sequence contained several numbers over 31.   Yes, there is a theory that the Big Bang is the result of a vacuum fluctuation in the "quantum foam" which exists because of the uncertainty principle. Now, what all that means, that's beyond me.

The original Bad Lieutenant is good as well - if not better.   Saddest movie ever. Every corner in your house has one of those little fires in it for weeks.   I watched Enter the Void and was bored stiff, gave it two stars on Netflix (for the interesting idea only, it got a star.)  Only of course to spend all night thinking/dreaming about the movie.

It was apparently a flame war over whether or not you needed to boil your water while hiking.       That would be my suggestion. I'm on the other side of the fence and topology has always baffled me!   If you are considering math grad school, you will probably see plenty more of both. Are you more of an algebra/stats person or a geometry/physics person?            I had this practice described to me though I haven't tried it myself. Basically, your read alternating chapters of works from opposing points of view (materialism vs. dualism, right-wing vs. left-wing politics, etc.).   This supposedly avoids the effect of reading the books in sequence (first one and then the other) and being convinced either by the first or the last one you read, depending on your disposition.  Also you are supposed to see hidden connections, points of agreement or common flaws that the two arguments share.      Not for Central Banks, there it's the opposite.       I am more thinking, long-term, the team worst off in this new system is the one that shares a division with the Yankees.      Until very recently it was a good move as the pay is often a lot better. There is a "special needs" teacher at our district who is assigned to just a single student. The teacher's sole job is to follow this student around all day, and slap her hand back when she tries to touch things/people. Oh, and a bit of paperwork every 6 months. She makes more than twice the salary of a regular teacher.  However, if our state follows NY and some bureaucrat decides that this student needs to take the state standardized tests, this teacher is out of a job.    I go out of the way to use examples that involve pop culture, drugs, booze, speak the same way as my students  Advice from someone who's been on the job a bit longer than you have, perhaps: There is nothing more uncool than the "cool teacher." This does not earn you respect from the students.      I don't really care one way or the other, but I know the Red Sox can't be too happy with it.                  Well, as long as you're happy with it, more power to you!   Casios are terrible. If you can, just get a TI. You will keep having this problem with everything shown in class.      They also knew (and in Hawaii, still know), how the behavior of waves changes over seamounts (elevated sections of the seafloor that don't break the surface.) Islands are more likely to be found near seamounts.      So this article is just about these guys sitting at home and being depressed? I was expecting that the "impenetrable silence" hid some massive underground super-banking conspiracy. Oh well...   Often in science-fiction there are plot points revolving around mining the moon, Mars, asteroids, etc. What mineral resources, if any, are actually known to exist on these bodies?       A friend of mine had a dream like this: She dreamed that a friend of hers - who had actually died in real life at 16 - appeared and told her she had been reborn as a baby in Italy, and gave the name of the town and the street address and everything.  Now I don't believe in reincarnation or anything, but I would have at least looked up that address when I woke up! My friend however, just wrote it off as a "weird dream" and never looked up the address. She said she remembered it for some time, but by the time she told me about the dream, she had forgotten everything about it except that it was somewhere in Italy.   Isn't this illegal in the US? I remember a similar site being shut down last year because "peer-to-peer" lending violated American banking regulations. Have they found a way around this?            Very good explanation. Thanks!   Interesting, I am not really familiar with model theory. I am confused as to how if you only have the symbols 0,1,+,x,, how you can get anything other than whole numbers anyway.   Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.)   Thanks for the reply. I understood the first paragraph but kind of lost you in the second. I've been through Analysis but it's been a while. Maybe time to dust off the old notes...           	186

It also REQUIRES a "30-day" trial (i.e., there is no free service with commercials).  I'm not giving you my credit card number to get a 30-day trial.  Screw you.   Whether the jump was "illegal" or not, I'm glad the umpire called him safe for one reason:  Someone tossed the loose ball back to the catcher instead of making him scramble for it.  The runner probably would've been safe otherwise.      "Omlette du formage."   I totally had some of those toys! They were awesome.    I didn't... maybe you just suck at Pac-Man...?

 I'd rather she have the power to direct justice, treasury, the sec and other regulatory organizations.  I don't trust Hillary to get those appointments right or set priorities --- *at all*.   At one point, tax rates as low as we have were unthinkable.  Things change.   Your jokes are funny.  Please tell more.   And the biggest socialist giveaway of all: free protection for property "rights".  Let's give all those socialist-trough feeders, like judges and the police, the boot.   The verbatim title from HuffPo front page.   As it should be.               She's been [advocating these things](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/9/elizabeth-warren-demands-jail-time-wall-st-bankers/ ), but ultimately the call is in the hands of the DoJ and the SEC.  Obama's picks in those posts have dropped the ball.  Warren has brought legislation and publicly shamed the regulators.  What else can she do in her position?   It would be much better if everyone were quiet and let both parties do the bidding of Wall Street in peace, right?   Good thinking!   She didn't say things because they're popular - she's been on these issues way before anyone else.  [She warned about the collapse of the middle class in 2008. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A)  [She spearheaded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau back in 2011.]( http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/11/elizabeth-warren-201111 )  So much misinformed comment here in this thread.    What is she specifically proposing that you think isn't enough?  My sense is that she wanted meaningful penalties for banks and banking criminals - like jail time, hefty fines and stricter oversight.  What do you think is missing?   Something that no one uses?   This Reagan/GHWB advisor is a delusional leftist too.  http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2011/08/05/Obama-The-Covert-Conservative-Liberals-Have-to-Love      Did you read the article?      I thought he was largely right.  * http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-is-right-2013-4 * http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/130485/claim-krugman-is-top-prognosticator-cal-thomas-is-the-worst/   Are you saying that monopsonies are ok?  It's uncontroversial (i.e., it's taught in first year economics) that monopsonies don't allocate resources efficiently.  Here's a [primer](http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd c=dsp k=monopsony,+efficiency ).     He addresses that, doesn't he?   Which brings us back to the key question. Dont tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is.            [Krugman talks about that here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html):   Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.   Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.   **So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economys persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices.** And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economys weakness.     Warren is arguably one of them.  Not sure how much progress she can make by herself.  The conversation needs to change.  I think that's what she's trying to force the Ds to do.  (Focus on core economic issues, not distract people with social ones, like the Clintons/Obama).   Which would include almost all Republicans and Democrats, and certainly our soon-to-be Queen Hillary.   Because Republicans don't want to talk about [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2jrpsa/this_year_an_analysis_by_the_new_york_times_shows/ ).   The [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ) has much better data (see Figures 10   11).  This chart the WaPo concocted is meaningless and poorly interpreted.      Yeh, it's pretty clear that both parties are doing it.  The Democrats have been taken over by carpet bagging globalists like the Clintons who get the votes of the rank-and-file by pushing left wing social issues.  The Republicans have always catered to the rich and sell their message using (now discredited) trickle down economics and right wing social issues.  So it could be argued that Warren is incorrect and just banging the partisan drums.  However, an alternative view  is that she's repositioning and rebranding the Democratic party - away from the ideas of Clinton/Obama and towards *economic* left wing issues.  Speeches like this make it harder for Clinton to maneuver.  If Democrats are supposed to be unrigging the system, it'll make it uncomfortable for Clinton to say things like ["lobbyists are people too"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA).    The question is - could Warren just be honest and start attacking half the Democratic party as out of touch and beholden to Wall Street interests?  That would be the truth.  Why did Obama keep the roster of Rubinites and banker-apologists in power at Justice, the SEC and Treasury?   We already know that Warren dislikes them - she's been directly opposed to many of the policies they've instituted.    There are essentially two choices: call out conservative Democrats and split the party in two, or attract a following and side line them.  Warren is clearly choosing the latter, and I think it's the right choice.  Nader, as much as I agree with him, took the first road, and look where that got him.            The mishmash graphic that WaPo created and what they're trying to assert is in fact wrong, as you point out... which makes the title (sorry, verbatim copy) wrong as well.  However, take a look at the [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf), and a couple of the key charts:  * [High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)  * [College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png)     [Original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf).  [High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)  [College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png)      You know what, I think you are reading the graphic correctly and I was reading it incorrectly.  So, it's true that poor college grads end up in the top two quintiles 40% of the time, whereas rich drop outs end up in the top two quintiles 19% of the time.    Why the hell did they include the left axis?  That is so damn confusing.  But as I said, this is a terrible comparison anyway.  The actual published charts tell the story much more clearly.  It's hard to argue with Figures [10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png) and [11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png).    Poor drop outs are 3.4 times more likely to end up in the bottom quintile (Figure 10).  Meanwhile, poor college grads are just over half as likely to end up in the top quintile compared to rich college grads.  That doesn't sound like a meritocracy, does it?     **EDIT** Realized I'm *totally* wrong about this.  See [my comment later in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2josjx/poor_kids_who_do_everything_right_dont_do_better/cldtuef ).  - - - - - - That commenter has simply misread the graphic. Specifically 19% of rich high school dropouts are not in the top **40%** (as claimed), rather *they are in the top* **20%**.    On top of this, only 20% of poor college grads make it to the top 20%.    I.e., *a rich high school dropout has as much of a chance of getting to the top 20% as a poor guy who slogged through college.*  Now, I'll grant that this is a pretty crappy chart, but it seems to have been cobbled together by WaPo.  For a more informative view of the data, take a look at [figures 10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png ) and [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png ) in [the original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ).  Pretty clearly, being a rich goof is better than being a diligent poor.       Have you ever been to a startup conference?   Almost every single person there is from the upper middle class.  Horatio Alger anecdotes don't stand against the wealth of actual data that shows what happens en masse.  Pointing at these exceptions is akin to noticing that there are some fast moving water molecules in pots of cold water, and then wondering why cold pots don't boil.            In what sense?   It's not about their service sucking - it's about the labor conditions for their distribution center employees.    They ought to pay a living wage.    You seem like a real charmer.  Nice knowing you.   http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-why-voter-id-laws-are-evil-20141013-column.html#page=1         Well put.   That's a pretty low bar, but I agree that is true.  Yet, we also need to factor in the Jar Jar Binks-level annoying scientists in Pacific Rim.  I think that puts them pretty much neck and neck.   Why is Pacific Rim loved but Transformers hated?  I cannot tell the difference.   **Submission Statement**  This is an interview with the author of a new book on the food industry: "The Spam Factory's Dirty Secret".  Although this doesn't go into depth on the origins of the disease the factory workers experience, it made me wonder --- could this be a porcine-form of Creutzfeld-Jakob/bovine spongiform encephelopathy aka mad cow disease?  It's horrifying that this might be transmitted through the misty of brain particles the workers are exposed to on a daily basis.      Au contraire - in fact, the author is quite liberal, and once wrote a column which appeared in WaPo during the Bush years called "White House Watch".  It so pissed off the Neocon editorial staff there that [the WaPo ombudsman was forced to address the controversy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000938.html ):   Political reporters at The Post don't like WPNI columnist Dan Froomkin's "White House Briefing," which is highly opinionated and liberal. They're afraid that some readers think that Froomkin is a Post White House reporter.           I think issues like this and [similar](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/11/01/reddit_politics_r_politics_mods_ban_mother_jones_others_for_bad_journalism.html ) [problems](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/11/censorship-costs-reddit-thousands-of-readers.html ) [in /r/politics](http://www.salon.com/2014/02/28/why_reddit_moderators_are_censoring_glenn_greenwalds_latest_bombshell_partner/ ) ought to be raised directly to [Reddit's CEO](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=yishan).   u/kn0thing has been outspoken in defense of internet freedom - could we get him to weigh in?   On the contrary, it's precisely a lack of imagination that causes people to think that Turing machines are capable of consciousness.  It's akin to saying that nuclear power exists when we simulate a nuclear power plant in a computer.         I don't, but the idea that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI ) could have subjective state doesn't pass the giggle test.   Describe the subjective sensations you are experiencing right now.    If it's a traditional (Turing-complete) computer, the honest answer has to be "I don't have any subjective sensations."    A quick perusal of that first paragraph tells us that Richard Cohen does not  seem to know who Bill O'Reilly is.      The question is - what did she accomplish with respect to her peers?  The House of Reps is the most gridlocked, do-nothing Congress in history.  Without them agreeing, no one is going to get anything passed.  So, I think you are unduly negative about her.  Without her, all we'd have is wall-to-wall blathering about how we need austerity and more neoliberal policies.  Fuck that shit.

PS; DR.   The title says "separate system", but my actual proposal is only for a special prosecutor.   That's a well-accepted way of dealing with conflict-of-interest situations in our judicial system.   You should read beyond the title.   Point taken.  See my edit in the self post.   **EDIT** [madronedorf](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/2ijqtx/there_needs_to_be_a_separate_system_of_justice/cl2vauy ) points out I did a pretty crappy job with the title.  I should have written **"There needs to be a special prosecutor for police misconduct"**.  --- The outcome many expected - [no charges for anyone in the SWAT team that blew a hole in a baby with a flash bang](http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/no-charges-for-officers-in-botched-drug-raid-that-/nhc2N/?__federated=1 ) - has come to pass.  I know many people are angry seeing cops commit horrific crimes and get away with no charges again and again.  Yet, though this issue is  finally starting to get coverage in the wider media, few speak about one of the most obvious causes of the problem.  Our current system requires that police are prosecuted by people who are essentially their colleagues.  Prosecutors rely on the testimony and cooperation of the police, so they have a strong motivation, if they want success and good relations with them in the future, to find reasons not to prosecute what are obviously crimes.  This   conflict of interest, has resulted in a lack of accountability which has allowed police culture to evolve in an increasingly violent direction.  Police brutality is a symptom of a structural problem.  Getting angry and demanding an end to bad police behavior, or demanding that police be prosecuted for one or another particularly horrendous beating, torture or murder won't solve the problem in the future.  We can't demand that the special relationship between prosecutors and police just magically go away.  It can't if they are to be effective at doing their jobs.    The only solution, it seems, is to delegate independent prosecutors who are tasked solely with prosecuting police.  What do you think of this? Is there enough work for each state to have their own police prosecutor, or are there reasons for this function to be kept at the Federal level.  Who would this office report to to avoid political pressure being used to neuter the office?           I still don't get it.    I am totally confused by your comment, then.   I think it was meant to be a reply to [truise_com](http://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2idzh0/if_someone_tells_you_their_cause_is_so_important/cl1gtwn ).   Reading this was depressing, because true.   That sounds bad.  What are the consequences of whistleblowing?               Investors.com is [well known rightwing agitprop](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Investor's_Business_Daily ).               The Stasi are just doing their job, so be nice to them.     I'm confused - what is misleading?      The sign in the background says it all.   So two mutually contradictory motivations in the design of this coin, right?  a) grow the network (good self-interest) b) prevent others from competing with you (bad self-interest)  Every other coin has (a) going for it.  The problem with this coin is that because of (b), in the long run, it's not going to do as well as others.  IMO, it's a basic design flaw.   Less competition.   One problem with this approach is that miners have an incentivize to downvote new applicants.     Douchebag says what?   Can't see too much of a difference between her and Mitt.     Time for my medicine.   The DOJ run by "[The People's Lawyer](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/us-attorney-general-eric-holder-to-resign )".   Such are the stories globalists tell to soothe their base and keep their funders.                     Signing statements are but one aspect of executive power.  But still, I am wrong and you are right.  Obama has used executive *orders* less than Bush.    Yet, EOs have been declining steadily since at least Jimmy Carter (contrary to what all of us  in this thread probably suspected):  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/10/how-obama-has-used-executive-powers-compared-to-his-predecessors/     hey say "oh, the last person did it, so our guy can do it!" that's not how justice works.  I could not agree more.  I've totally lost respect for Ds who went silent on Obama after criticizing Bush on the exact same issues.     I agree, but i honestly think it's both sides  On issues of secrecy, surveillance and executive power, both sides are equally bad.  Obama is arguably worse on all of these issues, having expanded the Cheney doctrine (which the Neocons have gleefully complimented him on).  However, if we're talking about economic issues, the Democrats are very slightly better.    If we're talking about social issues, the Democrats win hands down.  If we're talking about the base, the Democrats have a feeble bunch of half-hearted partisans who are largely rational and have most of the very tiny number of rational unbiased voters, whereas the Republicans have a bunch of super passionate batshit-crazy partisans.       Actually, I agree, he's pretty bad, even worse than Bush on some issues (executive power, surveillance, at al).  But boy are conservative complainers a bunch of hypocrites.      A quick guide to the Obama scandals: http://i.imgur.com/aWqDFPZ.jpg   OMG that video was excellent.  Now I understand.   Honestly cannot tell whether sarcasm or actual wingnut rant.    Terrific analysis.  I hadn't heard that before.   I know some like that too, and don't have a ton of sympathy for them.  But I think it's important to look at the big picture.  At the macro level  the middle class is working harder, longer hours, being more productive, and getting paid less.  George Bush said it well when [he complimented a woman on having 3 jobs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ).  "That is uniquely American, isn't it?"  Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.  Owning capital means you get rewarded with profit on work someone else did.  And our society is increasingly becoming one where it pays better to own than work.     Thank you so much for that.  This was driving me bananas.   Thank you for that response. Could you elaborate on Krugman saying individuals ought not to own capital? I've never heard that from him... honestly, that would surprise me a bit.  I read the Murphy piece, but I'm a bit skeptical.  He seems to be driving at his conclusions because he's upset at Piketty's conclusions, not because of analysis.  Giles, on the other hand, certainly seemed to have an analysis.  I thought his conclusions were pretty damning when they came out, but they have since been pretty thoroughly and humiliatingly debunked (even by the very authors he quoted).  The other main criticism is that Piketty got depreciation rates wrong, but Delong deals with that issue [here](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/06/over-at-equitable-growth-depreciation-rates-on-wealth-in-thomas-pikettys-database-monday-focus-june-9-2014.html ).   While I agree with you on the micro-scale, at the macro scale we're facing  an economy of increasing automation, which is obviating the need for jobs.  CPG Grey made a good video that explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU.  The only people that stand to win in such an economy are the ones who own the robots, so to speak.  We're seeing the beginnings of this transition today.    As labor becomes unnecessary, the bargaining power of workers falls.  People aren't lazier than they were before -- they're more productive, work longer hours, have poorer health, and less free time -- but they get paid less.  The richest family in America can pay workers so little they have to rely on government assistance to get by, at the same time their company makes vast profits.  Such is the benefit of inherited wealth.  In the world we're moving into, those  who own the means of production and distribution have increasingly greater bargaining power and extract more value from labor contracts.  Workers work harder, produce goods more efficiently, and because of their efficiency put themselves out of jobs, and because of their weaker bargaining power,  share in less and less of the wealth.    This mirrors the finding of Piketty et al., who I'm sure you've heard of if you are hanging out on Reddit frequently.  His work conclusively demonstrates that in aggregate, and increasingly so, you become wealthier simply by owning capital, whereas on average you become poorer if your income derives primarily from doing work.    Once we stop giving free protection to property owners.      Good point.         It's funny.  I've asked this question several times in this thread of people criticizing Warren, and all I get is silence and downvotes.      ### Submission Statement  Biological dark matter is uncategorized genetic material found in humans and throughout Earth that does not fall under the three existing domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.  This is a talk by Nathan Wolfe, one of the prominent proponents of this idea.      Cherry picking, halo effect, political capital.  Everything you've said doesn't amount to more than flinging poo, honestly.  Again, what are some specifics you disagree with her about?           "Crush the socialists"... hmmm, where have I heard that before?   But what is your specific critique?   Good. We can stop the socialist handouts to the judicial system which enforces contracts and gives free service to property owners.   This seems like such feeble gesture.  Charity props up the system.  It doesn't challenge it.       Yup, bad title.  Sorry.  I thought that was his last.   (continuing my comment) Now look at this piece in WaPo http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/09/14/bernie-sanders-would-run-for-president-against-wall-street-not-hillary-clinton/  The media is telling the story without him having to beat up on Hillary himself.  It's much better for his story to get told this way.    Good find.  Technically, this is a different show, since this is after Letterman moved to a new network.      The tissue box that keeps on giving when you have cat allergies.   I don't think it's just a matter of moving the debate to the left.  Hillary will tell people what they want to hear (like Obama did), and then govern like the carpetbagging globalist she is.  We someone who is going to represent the issues of regular people like Sanders or Warren.  Anything else is a failure.   What he's doing is establishing the grounds for debate: here are the important issues, this is what the American people care about.  He needs to make that message ring clear, then he can go in and dismantle her during the debates and the main campaign.  If he attacks her too soon, he's tacitly acknowledging her leadership status in the race (even though she hasn't announced), which gives her some free credibility.  And if he attacks now without establishing the grounds for debate, he'll do so from a weaker position, and will run the risk of inoculating her from those arguments later in the campaign.            See my reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2fwktm/senator_elizabeth_warren_delivered_a_speech_on/ckdoy3a ).   Yet, SCOTUS ruled that the government also has an interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  The Constitution has conflicting goals which need to be balanced with one another.  The purpose of these amendments is to preserve a government by and of the people.   Yet, as we know from the recent Princeton study, the US is now effectively an oligarchy.   So some balance is needed.  It won't come from the Supreme Court, which is the most corporate-friendly in history, which has overturned precedent and rejected the laws which our *elected representatives* have passed.  Their actions have made a new amendment necessary.       First amendment?       "While money is used to finance speech, [money is not speech](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/former-justice-stevens-campaign-money-isnt-speech/ ) . Speech is only one of the activities that are financed by campaign contributions and expenditures. Those financial activities should not receive precisely the same constitutional protections as speech itself,. After all, campaign funds were used to finance the Watergate burglary, actions that clearly were not protected by the First Amendment."   Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens   And then it will be [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA ).   Hillary Clinton should be made to take a stand on this.     That code was a joke, but, having worked on several different reasoning systems, I don't see how any of them could ever be considered conscious.      No not at all, considering we are a few pounds of soft grey spongy material.   But it's not clear what kind of physics is going on in there.  (And no, I don't believe in Hameroff's microtubule nonsense).    What is clear, however, is that any of the most sophisticated AI reasoners that you could run on the fastest digital computer around today could also run on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI (Please watch) - where the physics is clear, and obviously doesn't invoke consciousness.  To say that thing is conscious just doesn't pass the giggle test.    Have you read Chalmer's essay on the  [Hard and Easy problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html )?    Still, this is kind of how research works, people have experimented on animals capable of pain, even giving rats cancer to find ways of treating cancer, in the long run that benefits humanity.  But computers aren't conscious.   Here's an AI that's begging you to stop experimenting on it:      def do_experiment():         print("Please stop experimenting on me.")       do_experiment()     Please stop experimenting on me.   The question revolves around whether it is possible to hurt an AI and whether AIs have any subjective sensation.  I think we can agree that in the above case it doesn't.  So the real question is, when does an AI experience anything?    The things that we call computers today are Turing equivalent.  That is, any one device could simulate any other Turing-equivalent device.  That means that [a machine like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI) could, given enough time (and tape), run any fancy AI program we dream up.  I think it strains credibility to think such a machine could ever be conscious, or that we should ever care about its suffering.  Don't you agree?      Who leaves a laptop on top of a stove?   This is such a Darwin Award candidate.  Did they survive?   TIL it's insular to point out that Obama is to the right of Nixon on  every major issue.   My enthusiasm for Warren has been tempered.  And I sadly up vote this.    To be fair there is a cure for gaza citizens and it only costs as much as a plane ticket  Just you then, it seems.  (Not a great Hasbara effort, but don't worry, your scholarship is secured.)   "If only they would comply with the ethnic cleansing program."   So satisfying.  Thanks.  Funnily enough, I just posted yesterday about [UCLA's mechanical calculator](http://vimeo.com/70589461 ).         The machine's states are governed by the positions of the white flaps that are attached to a bar at the top of the machine.  Call this the "state bar".  Balls collected from the front are dropped onto the state bar.  If the bar drops onto a state flap, it rotates the bar, effectively changing the state.  Notice that the ball is picked up from one of 5 positions in front of the machine.  Each of these positions represents a Symbol; call them B1...B5.  When a ball is picked up from position ***i***, it is dropped onto the state flap in position ***i***.  Depending on the position of the state bar, the flap at position ***i*** may be in the way.  If the bar has 2 rotational positions, then the machine has 2 states, which we'll call S1 and S2.   Thus, the rules are encoded by positioning flaps at positions 1,2,3,4,5 (corresponding to symbols B1...B5).  E.g.,  | states/positions | 1 | 2  |  3 |  4 |  5 | | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | |  S1  | 0 | 1  |  0 |  1 |  0 | |  S2  | 1 | 0  |  1 |  0 |  1 |  In this rule system, B2 and B4 cause S1-S2 transition whereas B1,B3 and B5 cause S2-S1.  This is just an example of how to write  rules.   (I'm not making any claims about whether this is Turing complete.)      Watch the whole video.      Here's an actual mechanical Turing machine (bonus points: no electricity required!).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13         It looks like a continuous mechanical calculator, doesn't it?      There is no agency. A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:    * electronic (the kind you're using now)   * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )   * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )    When arranged in the right way, such parts can "compute" when a motor is run.  In the case of electronic computers, the motor is an electronic clock which causes the computer to advance from one step of a computation to another.  For a mechanical computer, a real motor does the job.    In fact, it doesn't matter what the parts are -- computers are said to be "equivalent" to each other --- i.e., any program you can describe in the most sophisticated modern electronic computer could be run (albeit slowly) on a mechanical or water-valve-based computer.    Think of a computer as a player piano which interprets a line of the piano roll differently depending on what keys are currently pressed, and which is capable of modifying the roll (adding or deleting holes) and moving it back and forth.  The only thing that is required is an external source of energy to drive it through its paces.  As I said above, in a modern computer, an electronic clock plays this role of stepping transistors through their paces, but the principle is the same.  The mathematician Alan Turing described the first general purpose computer, and that machine was capable of doing all of the computations of any modern day computer. Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 ) in the "mechanical" link above.  Just pause and soak that in for a moment - that primitive device (given enough tape) is capable of doing any computation your fancy 2014 laptop is.  For that reason we call general purpose computers "Turing-complete".  They are all equivalent to each other in terms of the computations they can do. The only difference is that modern ones are smaller and faster, and have better input-output capabilities.  But  from a mathematical perspective, Turing's original "a-machine" was just as powerful.  In fact, the Turing machine in the video is capable of *simulating* the CPU in your laptop.  Pretty mind-blowing, huh?  Turing's machine was based on a pretty simple mechanism which had 6 states and wrote 2 symbols.  Yet, [even simpler mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine ) have been described.  So Turing completeness is pretty easy to create.  People have even created Turing-complete computers inside virtual worlds [like Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X21HQphy6I ).   Given enough memory and time, they're just as capable as the most powerful super computer available today.  So how to computers appear to think and have agency?  All the magic happens in programs. Programs cause computing machines  to move from state to state and read and write symbols as it does so.  We interpret the output as the results of the computation.    I highly recommend Martin Davis's  excellent book on the origins of computing called ["The Universal Computer"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universal-Computer-Leibniz-Turing/dp/0393047857 ) for a great explanation of how questions about the foundations of mathematics gave rise to modern computing.

    Sorry everyone that the article is behind a paywall...  But hey, new garlic!      That's one of the most attractive answers you could give. You could also test the success of face vs. smile with a number of independent potential partners and model it with a Poisson distribution.  Though there are better ways to spend your time.   Wrong! It was cool.   I saw that Dr. Who.   I have my alarm set! 2:45AM and clear skies!   This looks like you are washing out the chlorophyll. If you boil leaves in ethanol the chlorophyll is removed but reds and yellows (anthocyanin and xanthophylls, respectively) remain.      I have a slightly shady site too. Peas burn out before they do much. Tomatoes just get leggy and by the time I had any last year they were cheap at the farmers' market. Kale and spinach do much better.  If you want to play it lazy, you could wait for the Farmers' Market to start up. There are transplants there the first several weeks. They are growing those plants for this climate and you could ask about lighting conditions. I usually get a few there to fill out my space.  Good luck!   Pick something that's not fro a plant. Even animal products are made from plants. Steel is smelted with coal made from plants. Half of pharmacedicals are plant derived inlcuding morphine, quinine, and the hormones in birth control (from a yam (not a sweet potato), FYI). Many pesticides are also derived from plants. I'm wearing trichomes (cotton) and just ate breakfast, all of which were plants.  How about [bioremediation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioremediation)?  Or [Nitrogen fixation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation) that accounts for half of the nitrogen in your body.  Or how about mythology? How many poems reference the beauty of a flower? There are people whose whole job is to grow plants, not for food, that make areas more asthetically pleasing.  Or soil erosion control, peat smoked scotch, [plastics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid), biodesil, [solvents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turpentine), perfumes, coffee, [pigments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo), and [poison.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates)  All of the above ignores wood products...  I like plants.    You know, you could probably do better than chance by just knowing age.      It's a Dracaena. Maybe Dracaena fragrans? It looks a little low on light. Try cutting the stalk so it braches down where the light shines through the window.  Also, if the tap water is hard in your area, then it might be in need of a repotting. Hard water will build up salt deposits in the soil of house plants and choke them out. If you see white material on the soil surface, this is likely your problem. Repot and water with demineralized water (distilled, bottled drinking water) at least occasionally.   Only do one of the above at once.   I mean, that's a weird pasttime, even for Austrian scientists.   Plants like this are why herbicides were invented. Or you learn to love it.   You are aware this has nothing to do with religion, right? It fits your world view, but let's be honest, this is a story about untreated mental illness. No, I don't mean religion.  Look, I think religion is as dumb as the next dude. Most religious people believe in rediculous crap and still don't do this.   This is my favorite news item in a while.

"Given what we know both about western media portrayals of Islam and Muslims on the one hand, and media effects and theory on the other hand, it would be foolish to dismiss western media representations as potential causal factors in anti-Muslim sentiment and crime.

Edit: Added words in the structure of a sentence.   A few more things, because I have enjoyed this discussion so much:  Read this: http://www.businessinsider.com/importance-of-swiss-bank-document-leak-2015-2  ...you will notice that this was "news" in 2010, oh, and pay extra special attention to the last paragraph in the **So why does this matter?** section. It states, "the French are taking 72 individuals to court over what is in the documents, and "most of the French taxpayers whose identity was revealed in the Falciani lists have since regularized their tax affairs."... That is called a slap on the wrist.

I would just like to say that I am glad we are able to have this discussion and I appreciate your willingness (as well as mine) to remain civil through the duration. With that being said...  Yes, again, my point remains the same... 30,000 leaked documents telling us what we already know is not news, from a "Wow! Really? That is actually going on?" standpoint. 30,000 rich assholes being prosecuted because of what we already know is news. All the time, information like this is released - about how all the rich people are cheating the system, rigging the game, fixing the score, etc, etc, etc. - and nothing ever happens because of it. The richest 1% will soon own half of the world's wealth... and there is not a single thing the 99% can do about it at this point. Money has been the single source of corruption for as long as money has existed.  Take Edward Snowden for example... Does anyone really believe he STOPPED the US govt. (or any other) from spying on their citizens? Please... They probably amped it up further, faster.  I understand what you are saying to me, however, I still stand beside the reason for my initial comment.      Again, it will be news when someone is actually prosecuted... and serves a real sentence.      Yeah, I'm not even gonna try to be smooth about this one... I totally missed it.

Once again, my intention was not to point to the girl and say, "She should not be born." My intention was to poke fun at her parents, who should not be raising children in the way they do. They have turned her childhood into a reckless circus coordinated for all of the world to see. That is insensitive. That is irresponsible. But who am I? I'm just a person on the internet engaging in a discussion on what is apparently "right" and "wrong"... One thing is for sure though, the last thing I am ever going to do, is be all sensitive about things I see on the internet. I appreciate your opinion, I feel you have a valid argument...

Which means that I am not feeding my children excessive amounts of food, dressing them up like inanimate dolls, and exploiting them on television for profit.

While having a bite to eat, they talked about their moonshine operation.   Suddenly, a woman at a nearby table who is eating a sandwich, began to cough. After a minute or so, it became apparent that she was in real distress.   One of the hillbillies looked at her and said, "Kin ya swallar?"  The woman shook her head no.      Then he asked, "Kin ya breathe?"   The woman began to turn blue and shook her head no.   The hillbilly walked over to the woman, lifted up her dress, yanked down her drawers, and quickly gave her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.   The woman was so shocked that she had a violent spasm, and the obstruction flew out of her mouth.  As she began to breathe again, the Hillbilly walked slowly back to his table.   His buddy said, "Ya know, I'd heerd of that there 'Hind Lick Maneuver' but I ain't niver seed nobody do it!"  	113

Southern Comfort bombed in sprite  Think a jager bomb, in how to make it.    you guys still gave up 41 points  Might wanna look at the play-by-play, before making a general statement like that.    Their first TD came from a trick play. They did a Wide receiver pass to get the points. That occurred with 9:51 left in the FIRST  http://www.tarheeltimes.com/article59839.aspx  Second TD came on a 4th down   5 trick play.  Their punter threw a pass for a TD.  That was 14:47 in the Second.   They got two more TDs in the 4th quarter.  But it was already 56-27 at the start.  So they got 14pts off of trick plays and 14pts in garbage 4Q time.  Yes they count as much as legit TDs, but the defense only gave up 13 other points.     Yup, on Android.          Hope so! Or A LOT of kids are missing around me.    Currently, the match list is sorted by your most recent matches/messages.  It would be good to have the option to resort by distance.    If I go to City B for a weekend, then come back to City A, I don't want City B matches clogging up my match list.  On the flip side, when I travel back to City B, it would be nice to see who I previously matched with.     The new Tinder match sound reminds me of an "Emergency Alert" I receive for Amber alerts and what not.  My heart always skips a beat when that thing screeches.     One idea is reverted back to the previous **Notification** settings.  Now, you can either have notifications or not.  In previous versions, you could choose between an icon, sound or both.  I don't want to broadcast my Tindering to my friends, so I have to keep my phone on silent.   Could we have a thread on realistic improvements to the Tinder app?  I say realistic, because asking for an "undo swipe" button won't fly.  But there has to be ways to make this app better.    Hopefully someone on their development team is subscribed to this subreddit.    YAY FOR SOMALIA!!!

TSLA more so than TWTR.  the short float (% of float sold short) for TWTR is now just 5%, TSLA's is 48%.  Short squeezes have seemed to factor a bunch lately in these mini-stock bubbles.  It's great if you can take the plunge early and get in, but you have to be quick on the trigger for exiting.  Getting in at the peak and having no safety net in the form of stop loss orders is a recipe for a personal shame spiral.  	5
 Actually they usually say valid at McDonald's only.   Also an awful drinking game.   I was once told to reinstall the game. I wasn't sure how that would help.   Scrubs: A show about the men TLC rejected.   Don't hate on Mad Dog. It was one of the higher ranked choices for my "how drunk can I get for $5?" game. First place was far and away 2 cans of either Four Loko or Snoop Dogg Blast, the Colt .45 answer to Four Loko. A beautiful product.   Get the cans that just say beer.   Accountant?   Man we're talking about practice. Not a game, not a game. Practice.   That's why he's too busy to study for accounting.   My mall still has 2 Gamestops thanks to the EB Gamestop merger.   In all likelihood it's due to the new ACC contract where we have to play 5 teams a year from the ACC. Michigan was probably the least expensive game to cut, and most people here think it'll be added again once Purdue or MSU run out their contract.   The administration also refuses to build a basketball practice facility.   I went and finally did all the Heisman Challenges I'd never gotten around to last week.   Tons.   Make them support only. For wards, healing, stuns, etc.   Don't forget probably the most unbeatable NBA record. Sheed's 41 technicals in a season. Still technically possible, you just have to get one in almost every game you play.   One of my friends got a letter from them telling him he'd been in the top 10 in bandwidth used in the area for 3 or 4 straight months and to please stop or they'll look into what he's doing more closely or something to that effect. He was pretty proud.   It's really not. Having a few of each type that you can play is part of the strategy.   Honestly as long as you can play a few it doesn't really matter. If you can play 2 champs of each type you're pretty much set. And a pro would need a max of 5 champions that he can play, since their roles are set, and that's assuming the other team was so worried about him that they used all their bans on his champs and the person in the same role on their team also picked one that he played.   Honestly you're probably going to be worse off. If you've only unlocked champions you like you've probably played those ones more, meaning you're better with them. If you have too many you're not going to be good with any of them. And even if you did get more, if you're only good with a few it doesn't matter about the others.  Also if you play ARAM (All Random, All Middle) having more champions is a big disadvantage.    I had a friend get yelled at for ap yi in aram once.   Maybe she was in the middle of king's cup and was question master.   A friend of mine from high school is dating a girl like this. Fortunately it's been 5 years and he hasn't noticed.   So would a lot of moms.   I had a friend who thought that you couldn't have sex during the day. That's why we had visiting hours between 9am and midnight for our dorms. What confused me most is that on weekends visiting hours didn't end until 2. Apparently she switched schools a few times in high school and managed to miss sex ed entirely.   I've always wanted to fight a dragon.   Class dismissed.   Yeah she's avoided it on multiple musical episodes between this and Buffy now.   You say no to ratchet pussy, JuicyJ can't!   Use Your Allusion.   Man Alyson Hannigan really hates singing.   Wow awesome, that fixed it.   Yeah that's when it started.   Oh cool, I thought that was just me. It also does this when I try to save item sets.   I kind of agree with you. My opinion is Buffy would have better individual episodes. I think there are a lot of Buffy episodes that are better than pretty much any Angel episode on an episode by episode basis. But Angel had way better overall storyline and plot arcs. I felt like Angel was actually building somewhere, especially since it had a consistent enemy throughout the show. Plus obviously the redemption story for everyone in the show was great. I feel like Angel just got much deeper.   I had a Catholic brother as the rector of my dorm in college. He had been in rehab the semester before I got there for alcoholism. He was absolutely oustanding, for the record, the entire time I was there. I imagine the loneliness is part of it. I think for him at least, a big part of it was the temptation was there all the time. It's got to be a lot harder to stay sober when you see college kids getting drunk on a tuesday. That said, it also made his talks about the dangers of alcohol and alcoholism a lot more powerful.   Read that as Uncle Phil and was confused. Though I'd watch Uncle Phil teach a kid to be street smart.   And yet Trevor Mbakwe was allowed to come back for a 6th year when he lost a year because he had legal issues.   We'd had problems for a while, and had always had fights over really dumb stuff. She was clingy and had a distinct lack of trust. She'd accuse me of cheating even though I was spending all my free time with her (apparently those group project I had were made up so I could go hook up with other girls). These were all exacerbated by distance when she graduated and I had a year left.  The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was a game of League of Legends. We would play together a fair amount. She was a pretty inconsistent player, though, so she'd have some pretty bad games. League's community being what it is, she'd get yelled at sometimes in game. Finally, after being told to stop feeding and eventually to uninstall, she quit in the middle of the game and within a week it was basically over. And that is how League of Legends ended my relationship.   Who doesn't love a nice beersicle though?   Harvard basically gets the racial percentages in america for each class. Exactly as diverse as the county as a whole.   Ours were like 50 people crammed into a dorm room with probably at least 10 cases.   We had a challenge in our library where you had to drink a beer on every floor. 14 floors. No using the elevator.   I paid less to go to an expensive private school than I would have to go to a state school. Yay for starting college right after the market tanked.   Just don't forget about it.   Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.   Named after "Far Quad" at Notre Dame.   Holy shit I'd completely forgotten about eon8.   Possibly in relation to the remake of the original they'll be coming out with soon, as well as the possibility of an announcement about fable 4.   For Love of the Game.   He's also incredibly self centered. Just watch his interaction with George Michael.   I've used organizing Humans vs. Zombies on campus as an example in a ton of interviews.   And if we do decide to do change the helmet, at least make it even. Let's not have another 2/3 of one color and 1/3 of the other anytime soon.   My guess is Michigan comes back eventually in place of MSU and/or Purdue, once those buyouts are more manageable.   In all honesty this may have killed any notion of us ever joining the B1G. It wasn't that likely anyway, but it was definitely going to be up for a lot of consideration if it ever became necessary to join a conference for football.  However, given the history of feelings such as this, going all the way back to Yost and his telling us we couldn't join because we were Catholic, it just seems unlikely.    What bothered me wasn't even the Catholic comments as much, it was the fact that he singled out Fr. Joyce. Don't speak ill of the dead, especially one of your contemporaries. It felt like a completely unnecessary potshot.   And this is why straddling is often a bad decision.   I worked there 5 years ago. Their goal is to straddle the 2. They showed us some video about how Walmart is the cheap store and Target is the trendy store. They wanted to be the smart store.   Yeah to me half the point of college is the experience. You don't get that going to CC or even a commuter college.   Community College isn't always cheaper long term. Yes, tuition is lower, but you also can miss out on a lot of scholarships the only make available to freshmen, making your long term tuition higher.   Tie between two people. One would be Chris Stevens. Grew up in foster homes. Ends up being good enough at basketball to get a scholarship to Notre Dame. Plays on the team that stops UCLA's 88 game win streak. After school goes to play in Europe for a year before working for Proctor and Gamble and then running a Budweiser distributor. Finally gets tired of that and helps to found Keurig. After having done that for a while he's retired now and just funds interesting projects and is now teaching at Notre Dame.  The other would be Alasdair MacIntyre.  He's one of the most highly regarded philosophers in the world and incredibly interesting to listen to.   I believe he's more of a Jimmy John's and Krispy Kreme fan.   All the accents in that were really impressive.   Which is almost sad considering she won a Tony.   On the other hand if Hitler hadn't risen to power, someone similar might have. And that person might have been more strategically sound than Hitler.

I'm pretty sure ESPN was ready to proclaim him the next combination of Montana Elway and Marino combined.   (`)   People actually have this issue? Now if the questions could somehow decrease time, that'd be helpful.      Nate Montana is probably the worst quarterback I've ever had the misfortune of watching. This includes high school games. He came in against Michigan a few years ago and wasn't throwing picks like Tommy Rees was because he didn't have enough accuracy or arm strength to get it near anyone. Absolutely awful.   Golic was easily the weakest part of our O-Line this year. And the year before he filled in for Cave at center when he got hurt. He must have been telegraphing terribly because suddenly every D-Line we played jumped right at the snap. I'd be shocked if he's on the roster when games start.   I very much doubt it happens, but Troy Niklas is a guy who at least has first round potential. It'd take a pretty big year, but the dude is a beast.   And become some combination of bigger and faster.   Whoosh   They're just happy anyone's going to the game instead of tailgating through it.   Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders.   In fairness, who wants to be the guy that tackles one of your best defensive players and accidentally takes him out for the year?   Boom/Mordor/Smack a Hoe  Everyone stands around a table. There's a bunch of cups with about as much beer as you'd used for pong or flip cup, and one that's all the way full for the last person. 2 people are playing at once. It usually starts with people on opposite sides of the table. The goal is to bounce a ping pong ball into your cup. If you do that, you pass to your left. If you make it on your first try, you can pass it anywhere. If the person to your right manages to make one before you do, they slap your cup of the way, pass their cup to the person on your left, and you have to drink a new one. It goes until the last cup gets finished, and that person is the loser.   I almost drunkenly bought this last week.   And then those lucky one or two people get thunderfucked and have to drink through an entire verse.   A kid I went to high school with's sister did Girls Gone Wild. She apparently made it into the commercial for that one, too. So he, his sister, and his parents are watching something like Comedy Central late at night and the commercial comes on. He sees his sister, looks over at his family, and walks out and goes to bed. He never asked about anything after that.   It's a one hot album every 10 year average.   That's where they're from.   Yeah I understood the point which was they did better in low scoring games, but it came across that way.   I loved during the NCAA tournament one year they were talking about how Wisconsin did really well when they held their opponents under 50 or some really low number. It just seemed so monotonous and obvious that they did well when they held the other team to a low number of points.    It's like Pavlov.   I also bought a ds with mario kart.

 Lots of fun things coming out soon.   Lots of money I don't have.     I blasted a ten hour compilation of arab rap music until they shut up. Now I'm just listening to some podcasts and chilling   It really made me think differently about dreaming and how the mind works. I stayed in bed for like, a half an hour and thought about it.   Or a large gaming channel and going into airsoft with no knowledge of airsoft   Lol "hey guys I sucked Bob from ASGI's dick for this free gun please buy it"   Little sister is having a sleep over in the room next to me and being too loud so I'm blasting [this] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yLDUmyx3XXU) through speakers. Shit's hilarious since my room is foggy due to the vaperino.  Edit: Now I'm using arab rap music   This is my most vivid lucid dream I've ever had, and it's a bit long but I hope you stick along for the ride. I usually induce lucid dreaming by meditating before I sleep or sleeping with my arms at my sides repeating mantras and shit. This was by far my most successful lucid dream ever. Usually I just fall into sleep paralysis, which I'm also cool with, but this was way different. The dream felt like it spanned a year, but there were random patches in it and time skipped a lot. Well here goes.  I woke up in a cabin of sorts, like a mini hotel room. When I looked out of the window I saw stars. A lot of stars. I got up and walked over to the mirror. What I saw was a older version of myself. It looked like me, but aged ten years (right now I'm 17).   Then, I heard a knocking on the door. I was startled to say the least. A raspy voice addressed me with "Mr." and my last name, very formally. When I opened the door I was greeted by one oft he cantina aliens from Star Wars (the cute ones that play the catchy song). He told me the train would arrive in the seventh dimension in three days after making a few stops. He said that I would have a business conference to attend. It was then I realized I was dressed fairly corporate casually with a dress shirt and khakis. I was really confused but I obliged and said okay.  When he left I exited the cabin and went down the hall until I found another door. When I opened it I was greeted by a large congregation area. There were a bunch of people talking, more cantina aliens, and other confusing aliens. Shuffling through the crowd I bumped into somebody. After apologizing profusely I realized it was a girl I knocked down. She smiled and said it was okay. She was absolutely beautiful and I was awe struck in all honesty. She had black hair and eyes like mine, almost hazel but brownish. She was dressed in casual clothes and had a sun hat on. I noticed a large camera in her hands.  I asked if she was alright and instead of answering the question she said, "No, I'm Alice, what's your name?" I told her my name and she said we should have coffee later.   I don't remember having coffee, but I remember sitting on one of the benches in the area we were before. She told me she was taking a college art course and that her assignment was to take pictures of other dimensions. It was the I looked at the surroundings that were around the train.   White. It was **vibrant** white, and there were trees of all different colors all around us. Blue, red, yellow. Every color of the rainbow. I remember this so clearly in my mind still. It was so fucking beautiful. She stood up and started taking pictures. Then, she smiled and asked me if I thought it was beautiful.  I was awe struck and said of course. She then asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was on my way to a business meeting in the seventh dimension. She frowned, and said that was boring. Then, she asked if I wanted to tag along with her. I remember thinking, "Screw it, it's my dream." and said yes.  Things got hazy after that, and I remember going to Mars, where it looked similar to Cowboy Bebop Mars. Then I only remember going to a strange cave dimension, because when we were there she got a call about something. Her cheery expression turned to a worried expression and she quickly hung up after agreeing with whoever was on the phone.   After that, she said she had to go and said sorry. I asked her why and what was wrong. She told me that she was sorry and didn't get back on the train. I was very sad and confused after that, afterall I was in love. Or at least it felt like I was, and that was scary for me.   Things got hazy again and I remember it was like a few years passed. I was at my grandpa's farm again, where I lived before my current house, but there were more futuristic cars. I was running an estate sale (when people go through a dead person's house and buy stuff) for the family.   Then I saw her again. She walked up to the deck, wearing the same sun hat as before. I walked outside and walked up to her. She almost jumped and hugged me. I asked her how she was doing and if she wanted to catch up. She obliged and the next day we met up at my house. Or at least where my house is now, but it was an apartment complex.   When she showed up I asked her how her art was doing and her expression faded. Then she told me something about how she had to be a prostitute for money and that all of those years ago she got a call about prostitute stuff. I don't remember the details but I remember asking her if she wanted to run away or stay with me. She looked up at me and smiled, but started to tear up a bit.   She said she had to go and couldn't be with me. This was crushing and I felt terrible. I asked if she wanted to spend the night for one last night.   After that all I remember was holding her in a dark apartment before waking up to my alarm, crying. It was so scary to me. I've never had a dream so real. It was the most real dream I've ever had.   Watched everything that's out so far. Needless to say, I need to watch shows and not not watch them if they have a weird title. It's like SAO but with less plot armor and more in depth shit. I mean there's still harem bullshit, but whatever.    Oh yeah I got 100 GB free now   There was at least 26~ GB of really obscure and really really hardcore BDSM stuff   So my current computer used to be my grandpa's, and to free up some hard drive space I decided to delete his user. Well I decided to dig through his old user and found some weird porn. Next time I see him it's gonna be hard to look him in the eyes.    I personally think this gun is fucking adorable   Your beard is very woodsman-y   You need a kit list of some sort   Weird lol   Yeah I typed it but it didn't show up lol    \_()_/   Oh I know I'm not getting anything out of it. If you think taking that argument really does anything, it doesn't.    Haha wow I'm cameron and I can't make a come back comment that makes sense or has proper capitlization or punctuation.   Oh yeah I prefer tactical pants more than BDU's   Ha ha wow I'm Cameron, I'm gonna add random compliments on every post I see for upvotes and not provide any help to anybody.   Those pants look like the ones you get at Kohls or Walmart that imitate real camo but aren't true BDU's.    Revision Wolfspider deluxe goggles. Never fog.    Holy fuck dude I read that comment and laughed out loud in class. I didn't even realize it was you lol   It's been done, and people would probably be more interested if you were more professional with this post   All of your problems, that is   Nobody cares about your problems cameron   You'd do this to everybody because nobody likes you    CRAAAAAWWWWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN   I run off two pots of coffee and a bowl of ramen a day baby   I don't eat lunch lol   Nah I told them. They just said, "Nah whatever inside mang"   They thought I did it for the joy of killing them. I just wanted to see if there was something in the nest.   Yeah, that's the funny part   I knocked down a bird nest full of eggs. [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/61wjzN3.gif)   On the Cowboy Bebop Wiki it does explain that Spike's fighting style was supposed to emulate Bruce Lee's exact fighting style. What is it, Jeet Kune Do, something like that. So it looks a lot like a Bruce Lee fight scene, but it doesn't copy one in any way.   This is a question that can be answered on /r/airsoft. We are just a subsidiary chat sub.   Oh yeah, that's even funnier   Whoa look out guys cameron is so cool and edgy and goes on 4chan. Pay attention to him.   Lol this happened to your MP9 right?   That would be awesome. I'm considering one, but there are barely any decent reviews of it.    Now I'm sad   Well I guess you'd be the right guy to ask, how do TM PSG-1's preform stock?   Did you, uh, misspell a_irsoft there champ?   Lol   Is that wrapping paper tied to your barrel?   Also you need a description.    Jui jitsu, karate, blah blah blah   Needs a description   Or fencing or kendo. Combat.   Ew   Airsoft is combat. Just because people don't die, doesn't mean it's not combat.    Yeah, just look above at the other guy arguing that and being wrong   Close enough   I have an unorthodox handguard lol   Bodgeups is Buzzfeed. Breaking news.   Technically it's still combat though    I just thought the title was more obvious   I mean, prolly   Ew hunter camo   *did the amputee   It's really cool that retailers are leaning towards making more unique guns, and people are making unique loadouts   Lol this is around when Joan Rivers died    It's probably my favorite gun in Battlefield 4 and having an airsoft counterpart in my collection would be really neat.    Oh that's nice. Now you just have to get the ASG CZ 805 right?   Yeah at this point I was just stretching it out and thinking "Fuck it man at least I was kind of right" lol   Yeah they're really cool and I've been really really tempted to get one lately.   Ah there it is. Watched that video awhile back when I was considering the EL AK-74. That was a good video.    What?   Nah isn't ringing a bell. Weird.   Do you have an airsoft channel on YouTube? I've seen your face before somewhere and I can't put my finger on ot   Whoa, this is pretty awesome   Fuck I knew that, I'm out of it and in school lol. I do have to disagree on the naming thing though. Not really codsoftery at all   Well I never realized it was Mk18 like how the SCAR-L is the Mk.17   I sound out the acronym like "em-kay-18" yeah. If you say it as "Mark" then it would make sense, but I'd assume a lot of people say it like that lol   \Decorative pullback thing   [\mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/QwWVIf9.gif)   He's dissolved into full creepy furry and gave up on airsoft for awhile I think   It's in the description lol   I'm more bugged about how he said "A MK18" instead of "An MK18."   In this instance "M" isn't a vowel of course, but is sounded out like a vowel so that needs to be "An" instead of "A."   Reading the title in my head hurt a bit    I'm probably not even going to get this or consider it, but this is still really awesome   PMC's don't wear camo. This is more like random gear put on and trying to do a PMC loadout.    I have XM8. I love XM8. I'm not Jarek.   B-29 best girl   *Oh you*   k bb   :(   How's the PSG?   Yui best blart   Makes sense, he's a fire demon         What are periods?   Ew, was that "xD" genuine?   Yeah, it'd be one thing if he had a valid argument, or at least knew how to express it. He's just stupid.   Did the thought *penetrate* your mind?   I'm all about cyberpunk and cool future stuff, but you're acting autistic   Jew   And also Utauyo Miracle by Houkago Tea Time lol   lol   It's really called Another? wat?   Sauce?   Sometimes I take the tobacco out of cigarettes and fill it with whatever I want to smoke   The animation quality is cool and stuff, but I remember watching it before I knew what hentai was and going, "Wait where the fuck is this going?"   Oh fuck this music video man   Alright. Cool cool.    I understand everything you're saying and agree for the most part. I think it's just fucked up to blow it in kids faces or around kids. Also it's douchey   Exactly what I said. I don't know how to go much simpler    People don't know the effects of it or what's in it exactly either, so why risk anything?   I'm pretty sure plenty of studies have been done about the negative effects of secondhand smoke. Also most of those studies are true.   Nice. I've heard great things about the WE    WE or the crappy AIM one?   ye   Nothing major besides my charging handle doesn't go all the way back because it's broken a little   If's a good feeling rifle   Don't really know how to explain, but it shoots far enough for me to play effectively   Meh, getting a G36k next   It's bretty good   TSD is the same as SRC   Top to bottom,   JG G3   SRC XM8   Galaxy MP5k          I did, but now I don't lol   D A N K  B U I L D S   I run into so many things with my car. I'm surprised I haven't wrecked it.    Wait, what's Imgur?   Yeah same here. I check all major airsoft retailers so much that I know exactly when they add new products, check /r/airsoft every fifteen minutes, and window shop like a mad man.   Only fields closest to me is a sketchy CQB place an hour up north and an outdoor field an hour and a half away in Illinois, so I'm also at a loss there   No, I've been really interested with cyberpunk stuff lately and watched all of Psycho Pass this weekend. I'm finishing Shingatsu wa Kimi no Uso this week   After checking out a post on /r/airsoft, something about what you do when you aren't chairsofting or airsofting I realized I do nothing but browse dank memes and watch anime.   Well. Shit.    Watch anime. Browse dank memes. Get high.   Edit: I accept these downvotes with open arms   Oh oops I forgot, this is /r/creepyhallsandcrawlspaces    Here's the whole album, http://imgur.com/a/exlH6   The original poster on the airsoft sub said something about owning or it's converted into an airsoft field   I mean, if there's a subreddit there's a way?   *Nice.*  I hate the uber tactical too many rails "A3" receiver, but on [my AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/KRMijZ7.jpg) I just have the flat top rail.    Little late here and I was just browsing some old posts, but there's nothing wrong with the outer barrel. The handguard was wobbly and loose and I wanted to ditch it.   [The outer barrel is completely intact underneath the shemagh actually.] (http://i.imgur.com/bBm7WBx.jpg)   Haha good idea. Have you considered picking up a railed receiver and just putting the marui barrel in it?    I'm really digging the AUG. The way you have it set up is pretty great.    Without his stickies it would be the same. I wasn't saying without his posts it would be the same, because it definitely wouldn't be.  	138
 OMG EPIC    any steven seagal movie    I used to love those    o good choices you went old school    what did u end up watching???    Yes he definitely should have found out.    Yeah the one thing I like to think that Abel will one day seek out the Club and try to join them just like his father did.    Ive always thought she was an angel.    This    Jack Nicholson wish he had done The Judge.    He is still in movies but I agree he needs a major comeback something that makes him an ALister again.    Yeah shes the grim reaper or something.    Yes I would love to know what happens to the club afterwords, what kind of leader chibs will be.    RIP Jax    Yes it was cool!!!!    HAHAH I LOVE Honest Trailers!!!!!!    cool    Edward Norton he is a good actor and I love his movies but he is just a big control freak it seems.    LOL Yeah I rewmember laughing so hard when I first saw that.    Nice    Woody Allen    Thats what im thinking.    Saw, Fight Club, Usual Suspects, and of course Oldboy 2003    Yes finally this is going to happen!!!!!    Its because he loves it so much as it is the only connection he has to earth and his mom.    What in the flying fuck!!!!!!    God I have seen it so much it is scarred into my brain.    Yeah thats what I hate they both went out the way they wanted to they didnt suffer well juice did I guess but thats it. Jax should have killed Gemma the same way she killed Tara.    Yeah true and they were all killed by/because of Jax it is so fitting.    That would be awesome!!!!!!    Now that is a cast!!!!!!    Only the ones I see in theaters yes, it is a word document I use a different one every year.    Die Hard no other    good also I have heard that a movie called martyrs directed by paca laugher is pretty scary too I havent seen it yet but I want to.    The first VHS was pretty good you can try the second one too but dont bother with the crappy third one.    Duncan Jones would have been cool.    Man I wish I can rease all knowledge of Star Wars and rewatch them in release order just so I can be shocked at that part.    The Lovely Bones I have only seen it 6 times because I like to preserve the feeling I get when watching it.    ^^^^^^THIS    Looks pretty funny.    His last few movies have been crap but I sure hope Exodus and The Martian bring him back.    It looks pretty good I wish I had a time machine so I can watch it now!!!!!    wow you seem just like me    Cuba Gooding Jr by Far    O okay yeah I keep my ticket stubs too I have been 62 times this year.    To me that is the only one.    What is today Steve Zissou day??    yeah true I am a student too and I know how that feels but lots of times I will go to the movies anyways even if I will burn all of my money.    WOW u keep track to awesome!!!! Whats the most u have had in one month???    Every god dam day!!!! But Hellboy 3 will likely never happen.    wow I didnt know intermissions still happened. Also is your name Jack Sparrow LOL    U r my hero    Hes still alive?? cool Wish he would direct again.    How often does everyone go to the movies?? And whats your opinion on them. For me I try to go every weekend sometimes once a week if I am lucky cause for me seeing a movie in the theater is the best experience ever.    Why have I never thought of that before. Good one    OMG YES!!!!!    your a cop arent u   HMM i will look into that thank u.    well its true    because every time i have ever talked to one including last night they were all jerks to me. I asked one for directions once and he said "im not a map" and walked away from me.    They have computers there??    UGH my bike got stolen last night I am so pissed!!!!! I wish I could find the person who did that and give them a piece of my mind if ya know wat I mean. Stupid city. Also another thing I hate cops they r all assholes.    LOL    That is cool!!!!!!!!!    just do a google search and find a site that has them.    I loved that part!!!!! Shes a good singer.    I would have made it one 3 hour movie and little if any lotr connections, noone but the characters that were in the book. I would probably keep ian holm as bilbo but only bookend and narrarate it.    here here.   Hangover sequels and son of mask, also ace ventura jr and big mommas sequels.    I listened to that for 3 days straight LOL its not that much of a challenge.    God I hate that just release the trailer dont make us count down to it.    She will never do a comic book movie, she has had many chances to in the past.    Yes!!!!!!!!! and yes!!!!!!!!    no    Jessica Chastain I dont like her because I think she is overrated and her face is ugly.    I liked it too slow at some parts but still good. I liked that jump scare at the end.    I like the middle part of the theater it gives u the best spot so u dont have to crane your neck. Occasionally I will sit at the bottom for the leg room.    It used to be cool when it first started but now its just repetitive I guess.    Yes    thanks!!!!!    She wont be missed or maybe.    I asked he does.    ALright yeah I just decided if I just get a new screen then thats just 200 right there which I can fund with one paycheck then send it to my friend who fixes computers for a living im sure he can help with that.    My bad it is a macbook 2010 model and the repair would cost 400 altogether I am not rich at all. I could get a new windows for less than that. I just dont know which way to go.    So my Macbook broke the other day well it didnt break break just the display doesnt work anymore and so I am forced with a decision I could fix the mac and keep using it or I could just buy a new one a windows laptop. I do not want to lose the mac forever but at the same time the concept of having a new one is intriguing. What should I do???    Okay yeah im gonna try that as soon as i get home tonight    Okay hmm I wonder if i plug it into a tv through HDMI it will still show up and I can work on it like that.    It wasnt on the keyboard thank god it was on the back at the bottom and where the thing folds that black part in the back.    Okay so I was at school today and my water bottle accidently seeped onto my mac a little bit then when I started using it the screen started flickering and then the display turned off now it wont turn back on and the computer is still black. I made an appointment at the genius bar but first I need some opinions and help.    Shes still alive???    Josh Brolin in GOTG    WOW cool I had no idea.    I like to think that he didnt exist until IB.    God I hate when they announce the trailer dates for movies just freakin release it.    Hello Natalie I am a big fan of yours I was wondering, what is your favorite role you have played like ever???    Awesome movie saw it awhile ago.    Doesnt look that good    I just noticed that every phone number has them now, why do we do that?? And when did it start???    Man my old roomates gf is obsessed with movies like this, caused a lot of heartbreak because she only liked "happy" movies.    Thats what I like about her tho.    Looks cool    Hes such a joke.    Theres another IMAX movie coming in a few weeks I believe. The Hobbit The Battle of Five Armies    OMG YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Memento    God I just love that shot she looks so hot!!!!!    Wes Anderson is AWESOME so is Stop Motion!!!!!    LOL Yeah.    That seems about right    Chucky      	111

    All I see it two pepole bumping uglys, I don't see how this has anything to do with Liam    Just not an engraved one, their useless out here in the jungle, they provide no camouflage! Fuck dude I need to beat MGS3 (I'm stuck on volgin)   I love the bioshock idea It would be awesome to see a sprite of one of the ziabatzu in red and white sailor stripes   Nope! Just read the description of you want to know more :)    Hey dude I feel you, but it's already kind of spoiled because if you look at the thumb nail for future episodes you can see him in the thumbnails    [only the best](http://the-switcher.deviantart.com/art/Still-in-a-dream-Snake-Eater-37133975)   Matt I know you've been busy lately but if you ever find some time post more drawings!!! I love your stuff man      Hmmm /u/nin_ninja is onto something. How about instead for Liam it should be something vocaloid related like the twins heads as slippers or something   EDIT!!!: their names are Len   Rin   Oh man, oh jeez, oh fuck, oh shit.... [The face when Matt comments on my thread](http://www.listal.com/viewimage/1403774h)   Holy shit that dager launcher tho   Hmmm so I'm not the only one   Dude.... Next time put a side warning!! My sides feel like that chick from saw 3, seriously though good find, also to the creator of the video having life is good play over the whole thing was just...... Perfect    If only guy could do a cameo  EDIT: the ziabatzu should go the the lake side hotel at some point and pat should get stuck between the hotel beds    Phew that got graphic... *cough* *cough* *cough* I think I need to go take a shower   I still need to buy those albums when I have 30 dollars    It's because he spits acid and is FUCKING INVISIBLE! Reptile is the ultimate waifu    ^^^^^yes   Pat was too gud    Mine was the duke nukem video, here's my thought process from that day. "Dum de dum I'm just going to watch some more videos on video games.... Wait duke nukem forever came out?! Oh man I got to watch that video! hmmm the two best friends? Never heard of them (After video) man that game looked bad, 15 years of hype all for that good thing I've never played duke 3D also those guys were hilarious I'm going to see if they have any more videos    You: Pssst.... joe, Joe, JOE!! Joe: "What!" You: Say it... Joe: "Sigh... [Good Grief]"   digging the art style! Very TF2      That mothefucker......   Noob question! Why is September first such an important date?   The part where jack puts on the hat is so platinum    I'll do that! Thanks :)   I know that is says "jumped" in the title but I'm suspicious because a quick Google search of "jumped, jumped jumpstyle and jumped artist" reveals nothing nothing :(, also I know this is a jumpstyle/tekstyle track but this is the most active hard dance sub I know of      Matt oh suck it.wav   Every time you move them you should get a John cena quote. (Inserts rubber fist) "you can't see me!"      Neo Kanada sounds like the hypest shit!! I wounder if they have glowing neon blue maple syrup?   I'll come as the punisher, I'll hold their arms if you punch them in the stomach    I was stroking my nostalgia boner the other day remembering all the dumb/awesome ones, so tell me what's your favorite?      I understand, Speedcore isn't for everyone :P   My sides feel as if the boss practied her CQC on them   mystery box 1 ! Matt said something about how french animation is really bad   now I know what your probably thinking "this sounds like shit and its really quiet" well your right but don't worry I WILL finish and master this properly (with the help of friends if necessary) I really want to make it...... Perfect      but will it be released? that is the question (I hope it dose I liked mirrors edge)   I think he did actually, way back during the hideous remix compition if you messaged BOS with a proof of purchase they would send you a sample pack   Nope, it's a subground kick ;) check out QULT if you want to hear more music like this    Mabey try a diffrent genre in the same vein like subground or hands up      The torrent for Caligo isn't working for me :/ is anyone else having problems?   Oh god damn it Liam got into kill la kill   RULES OF NATURE!!!!   I think I see what he means   Kind of a odd question to ask here, but I know that a lot of Hardstyle producers use it   Gabber - [Ophidian - Butterfly (VIP)](http://youtu.be/KddV9Hq9P8Q)   Gabber 4 life!   Is their any place I can still get camelphat? Or is it gone for good :(   That's awesome! I found a [video](http://thecrystalmethod.com/slam-academy/) of the crystal method event for anyone interested    What do you play now?   Have you ever met one of you favorite artists at a festival or in public? I haven't but man do I have a story for you. I went on a trip to Austria last summer (very nice place by the way) once I landed and left my gate I had some time to kill so I decided to look at the people coming through the gate. I notice a guy wearing a destroid hat but I don't think much about it, 5 minuets later I realize that guy was Excision (I kicked my self a bit but I got over it) later I'm browsing Facebook and I see a post that ken from the crystal method is coming to the twin cities to talk about production at a FREE class. Needles to say I was upset   What's the opinion of hard dance on this sub? I'm having a hard time gauging it      FL user! I love all kinds of hard dance (hard trance, Frenchcore, hardcore, hardstyle .ect) so HMU if your interested and I'll give you my Skype, the best way to contact me is through PM because I never use Skype unless I know someone's going to call, so PM me on here before you message/call me on skype I'm still new to the production world but I know afew things, also I do have harmor if that matters   SC: https://m.soundcloud.com/infernal-imp   thats pretty much all their is too it :)   My man!!! All right this should be easier to explain. Let's say you have your melody, pads and bass routed to channels 1, 2   3 respectively. You'll find a send knob/button at the bottom of each mixer channel, click on it and then click on the send of the channel you want to route too let's say 4 in this case (it should say for example route 1 to 4 in the top left corner if your doing it right) after you've routed all your channels you now have what is called a bus, you can now EQ, distort, compress and side chain everything that is routed to mixer 4 just automate the channel volume slider and bam their you have it :) all of your melodic elements are now side chained! The best part is that if you need to change something you only need to change the one automation. Busses are also great for blending percusive elements like kicks and snares, hope this helps!   Yes, also what daw are you using (depending on which one you are using I might have to explain it a little differently)   I actually do have afew connections, I have a friend who has done remixes for and knows the crystal method. I have a friend who MIGHT know Eric prydz and also has a friend at rotten. (He has afew more connections but I forget who/what they are). As for artists, I'm a massive fan of hard dance so pepole like angerfist, ophidian, da tweekaz, DJ thera. Etc. P.S. Thanks :)      Sure thing :), I have been producing for about a year so I am still a beginner but I have been playing bass since 4th grade (I'm a high school junior now). I use FL studio because I love the piano roll and interface. As for the mentor someone who can teach me synth programming or give me ideas like "this noise would sound good for the fill" also someone to bounce ideas off of. As for the remix it is "voices in my head (redo)" by round wave crusher   As the title says I'm looking for a mentor. Someone who knows a good deal about electronic music, currently I am doing a remix for one of my favorite artists and I really want it to be special. Left to my own devises I don't think it will turn out very well. Let me know if you're interested :)   I'll get it from him today :)   [Heres a link to mine](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/j-core-set-for-tallent-show)      thanks for the patch bassed harmor bass god of bass........... bass   Thanks but this isn't exactly what I'm looking for :/ im trying to make a kick like [this](http://youtu.be/xThLTxVVfhw) start at 1:03   Can someone explain the process/show me any good tutorials? I'm really interested in making hard trance    If you do get fl splurge a little bit and get harmor   this ezo shall pierce the heavens    I read that as woolie the pie stealing moe at first.....      I like the way this guy thinks   someone spilt their vocaloid in my Jojo and I'm ok with that   Post your stupid crossovers and/or ideas here! Mine is "what if the crucible had stands?" Seriously think about how cool that would be "goody nurse did you send out your stand in the middle of the night to terrorize these girls? I did no such thing your honor, my stand only heals and calms. We shall see about that! Adoadoadoadoadoaodaodadoado!!!!!"    You can get some really good sounds with this thing and the best part is that it's 100% free! They have more emulators but sadly they are reason exclusive :/         Utopia    Did you see hear the track he released a little while back?   http://touhourecords.blogspot.com/?m=1 For what you can't find on doujinstyle look here      I think hard trance would also fit well   Surprisingly well actually    Last Friday me and my friend did DJ sets for our school talent show   [Here's my friends set](https://soundcloud.com/noah-zins/d-days-live-set) it's a deep/electro house set  [Here's my set](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/j-core-set-for-tallent-show) it's a j-core/hard dance set   What!?! He didn't shave down the grip!   Man we need some gabber artists on monstercat          Ahhhh!!! This album is so good I'm so happy that 1/2 of 16bit is still making music!!!   Mainly dancing and singing acts (some better then others)   People went crazy! Especially during bad apple   clock control   Ya Shingo really loves touhou, he did the same thing in his [remix of native faith](http://youtu.be/8giKbzcxA-E)   Ya dude! I was hyped when I got the greenlight   thanks, I had to do pretty lazy transitions because it had to be under 10 minuets :)   it's a DJ mix, the whole thing was suppose to show my talent as DJ :)   I don't really have a say in it because none of the music is mine but I'm fine with it    well I say talent show... really it was an all school thing that you didn't even have to audition for (their were some pretty bad acts). also for anyone willing to make an OSU! map, knock yourself out      Ya man the gabberbox covers have that classic 90's horror feel to them plus their really good old school compilations!   I know this really isn't the place to be asking this kind of question but I could really use some help. I've been interested In making old school hardcore and the one thing that is troubling me is the kick, I just cant get that old school sound, Distorting is no problem its just getting the old school character. Any help is appreciated :)  [How I want it to sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EypIMWFGnWU feature=youtu.be) [What I get (909 sample)](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/old-school-kick-demo-sample-pack) [What I get (Synthesized 909)](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/old-school-kick-demo-synth)   EDIT: [Found this video](http://youtu.be/FrFLz7LVGp0)       I've been doing that and I'm still not getting the sound [I want](http://youtu.be/EypIMWFGnWU)   I'm having a hard time getting the right sound can someone help me/know of any tutorials?   As long as it's in key with the music and not to high pitched then I can [dig it.](http://youtu.be/qn9AeUK-jG4) [Nightcore](http://youtu.be/JThz8-nYYHs) on the other hand....      Also check out the organ donors FB they released a zip file with all their 2014 tracks for free   Not all hard trance is like this but most of the stuff I listen to is, some recommendations I have are Lisa lashes, Kidd Kaos, Alex Kidd, dark by design, ASYS, geck-o and the organ donors. P.S. Listen to [this](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) it's what got me into hard trance :)      The lead is amazing c:   We finally get another Excision   Space laces collab!    You dose it again!      Ohhhhhhh!!! *airhorns* *memes* *euphoria*   You have broken into your favorite artists studio, you find their computer and begin transferring files to your hard drive when you hear a commotion afew rooms away. They must have heard you! In the small amount of time you have you figure that you can only take one patch, what patch do you take? Personally I would take the screech patch from firestorm by digital punk (soo raw!) p.s. I do not condone the breaking into/theft of any producers homes and or studios :)   fuckin Kevin man...   nooooooo...... at least let me take off my pants!!!   [...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYT66ALUUss)      Us shitlords over at /r/twobestfriendsplay are also sending out our love, while the ziabatzu didn't talk about him a lot (they mentioned him a few times on the podcast) a lot of fans (including myself) found out about Monty's hospitalization and death through the TBFP sub and we are all saddened your guys loss. EDIT: Currently 22 other subs have posted the article from the RT site!    I never picked up on that part (the being useless part that is)   Okuu + Schranz = 3      His whole "GnB" Album is fantastic! Download it for free NAO!

You to dude   It's cool :) Frenchcore is a kind of hardcore, the main difference is the kick [heres a good example of one](http://youtu.be/j7UVCxcW46Y)   thanks man! This is a little off topic but do you know of any good 909 sample packs? (Free or paid it doesn't matter :) )   Try out some different daws, get afew sample packs (free or paid) and most importantly HAVE FUN (if your not having fun then theirs no point)      It's cool that you don't know genres :) from the sound of this I'd say that it's some kind of house      trying it out now EDIT: a lot better    Bleave it or not view distance was the only thing I didn't turn down...   Fingers crossed, friend   Same thing happens to me    Other then the fact that I'm running everything on low and my frame rate still manages to take a massive shit at points, dying light feels smart, tense and fun     And on the ground next to him are the 4 games the vita has   EDIT: Yoooo!

 VPN needed?   I'm using the v3 crack by Team 3DM. The game only crashes when there's something that involves a menu or a loading screen, like traveling, selecting seems to move to your lot, etc. Just save the game often and you should be fine.    *cough* Sniper Elite 3 *cough*   No surprise. These days, the only thing a game needs to sell is a good marketing campaign to get the hype out there. And if you add a recognized series name to it, bam, you're rich.   Alright then. I don't see the day people will buy a long awaited game, try to play it and surprise surprise... "Server is down. Pls wait a few hours. Maybe days" / "Seems like your internet dropped. Game stopped. Sucks for you, usually playing games is what you do in these situations lol".   You're comparing Origin to an always online DRM. Origin is NOT an always online DRM. You need an Internet connection to activate a game, and that's it. Maybe people will change their opinion on Origin as it might bring those sales you're talking about. But that won't happen for always online DRM, because it causes the problems I mentioned in the other post. I have absolutely no idea why you say Steam can bring any optimization to a game. Dude, SteamCEG is known for actually decreasing the performance (most DRMs do this to some point, but they certainly never improve it).   Yes, I like the way you think, Mr. EA's CEO. Take a sh!t on paying costumers by making a singleplayer game dependent on a stable server connection. And yeah, the online DRM totally worked with Simcity. Everyone could play the game when it was released, and EA got so much love for it. Just like Ubisoft did with their always online DRM a few years ago. Last, but not least, a new study showed that games with aggressive DRM usually sell more. Take a look at Sims 3, for example, it had an uncrackable DRM (CD checks, lol) and thanks to that it sold 10 million units.   The crash problem is better now, but still present. It seems to occur in loading screens, not the game per se. It crashed to desktop like 5 times before I could get a Sim to move into my house. SKIDROW didn't release any crack btw. The crack was done by team 3DM.   Battlefield 4   im a broy btw ;)   Sounds like a keeper   I go to the bathroom and there's a green rag on the floor of my shower. I get increasingly scared, until everything gets dark and I wake up.   Yeah, it was much more likely hacking. The lesson to learn here is that not even a 'secure' cloud service from a reliable company like Apple is safe. Don't take noods. Or if you do, encrypt them in RSA 2048 :)   Ignore all these trolls, they're just jealous of your PC. Most of these guys still have a Pentium III and a 6600GT. You can easily play this game on High @1080p, but that CPU would be kind of a bottleneck. For Ultra, you should get a Pentium IV. 512MB of RAM is enough for today's gaming, but keep an eye out for BF5, as it might require 1GB.   Hardline is far from an alternative to BF4. It's not too late at all to get Premium, but if you really don't want it, buy Dragon Teeth. Great balance between infantry and vehicles.   It's not impressive at all. The guy who killed you just needs to lock at the vehicle, shoot it a little bit to the left/right and after 2/3 shots you're dead. I've done this a lot from the Skyscraper in Siege of Shangai to snipers in other buildings and it's so easy.   Optimize my game's graphical options. GeforceExperience my ass.   It's not THAT bad, if you're know where to buy. Like, Premium in the US is being sold for 39.99$, and 39.99 in Europe. HOWEVER, if you buy them in a trustworthy cdkey store like G2A, it's actually ~40$ that get converted to ~30. That's how I got my Premium, and so far, haven't had any problems.   I payed 60 for a retail copy at launch and barely played it back then. Oh well :p   I'm glad you agreed to never be creative again before you ran out of time :)   I avoid using the color green.   "Big lips for a white guy"  - I'm white.   I have: -Brown eyes (prefer blue) -Tanned skin (prefer fair) -No facial hair, except on my chin -Big lips for a white guy -Big nose   I call bullshit.   Swedish. OK, maybe it's because of the blue-eyed blondes.   I agree with OP. I get killed much faster when playing in a server with 50ms ping than one with 140ms, it's ridiculous. It's almost impossible to lose a front-to-front when you have a high ping.    Ah, thanks. I haven't played much in that map yet.   What map is that?   Yeah, but which program did you use?   How did you extract the texture?   Talk about online video games all the time, specially League of Legends.   Girls with pale skin and blue eyes.   Electronic Arts. Just because they sell unfinished games for full price, split them into several paid DLCs and include micro-transactions doesn't mean that they suck.  Just kidding. they suck.   I get nervous (sometimes blush), as she's attractive and I'm most certainly not.   Video doesn't exist?   Same! I'm waiting for Duolingo's Swedish course. Sweden is a beautiful country (and the Swedish chicks too :P ) and I would love to know the language.   Juliet Burke from Lost  	37
 Can anyone make this into a T-Shirt?   Nice try, DEA.   3004 actually.   Dude, he's from England, he must know English the best.    Because nothing lasts forever. It's that simple, not even the universe will last forever.    Tooth brush, not even twice.    How can I send ice cream from Europe without it melting?   You wouldn't just automatically be immune to it but the blood transfusion will give you an insanely better chance at surviving.    You are a teenager, you are meant to be rebellious, not sit on reddit complaining that your PEERS are breaking the fucking school rules.    What type of Internship (like what job)?  Edit: Just saw that you said accounting as her job/internship, accountants earn quite a bit don't they? Maybe she's jealous.   Seems legit.    Alcohol never really even made me happy when I drank it, drugs like opiates, weed etc actually make me happier with my life, I'm starting to think the government literally just don't want any substance that makes you happier, legal.    Cannot be unseen.   You do realize that it was normal when I started and it FLUCTUATED to 161-65.   Okay, so I bet you've never had ping fluctuations in your life?    What? I didn't leave, I didn't even want to leave but my ping went past 160. Did you even read what I said?   I was playing cevo about 30 mins ago, I was playing alright and my team wasn't horrible and we got a lot of rounds on T side Nuke, so I had no incentive to leave but because my ping randomly kept fluctuating past 160 for some reason I got "kicked" and couldn't join back because my ping was staying way to high (most likely internet problems or something). So I waited it out and it was back to normal, joined a game until it started and then I got kicked because I was on a cool down because I apparently left the game? But I didn't, I got kicked because my ping kept fluctuating to quite literally 161-65... Just a minor complaint but I think it shouldn't be like that because sometimes you can't really control what your shitty internet does.  Was only banned for 30 mins so it's not too bad... [screenshot](http://gyazo.com/dc48505e62cd889e7e6e6b74255d010c)   Now I wanna play CS on acid.   Good job btw, and as /u/saippuas said, make this into a sticka.   That name kinda de humanizes the victim in a way.    Maybe they would just fight until the other gets a BSOD.    It'll be like Terminator and there will be 3 people alive until all the robots get a bsod.    If two AI reach the state of constant victory in boxing, who would win?   I used the Sensei MLG (because I'm so MLG) for a few years but now I've upgraded to the zowie FK1, it's a lot lighter imo but the sensor is about 20x better.    Maybe people don't wanna say tit because it's extremely offensive and might trigger someone.    You said Dick, that's so sexist man. I'm soooo triggered, god.     Are you an archaeologist because I need a big bone examining, Ms. Pretty Lady... (   )   They should've had the author as God, then everyone would still believe it.    Shut up, Jesus.    I have D so I'm not sure about C but the only thing that helps me is basically mild/moderate opiates, if I don't have them then I'm fucked mainly because if I don't I'll either be out at school and have to run home while trying not to shit myself, which is harder than it seems.   I actually like being constipated (that's what opiates do to your GI tract) but it's probably A LOT different than the constipation from IBS-C.  I also get extreme stomach pains from time to time (they don't happen that often) that will literally floor me and make me scream in pain, even if I'm out in public.    Fuck you sky news. I'm from Scotland and I think we should have it all over the fucking news and every where else.    They still need improvements, some of the meds will literally knock you out for what feels like forever and make you gain a lot of weight that you previously wouldn't have put on. They can also make you feel like an emotionless zombie (but that CAN be due to the schizophrenia, but the meds also do that to you). So they do need to work them out a bit, and I've read recently that schizophrenia is most likely 8 different genetically distinct diseases, so maybe if that's true that'll open the gate for better medication.    I was at a psychiatric appointment earlier in the week (Tuesday) and I was basically describing OCD-like "symptoms" if you will, it's basically having to check things constantly until I know it's the way it is and ask someone certain things (not gonna go into detail about it) until I believe them, it's kinda like paranoia but more anxiety driven. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, pretty much every day actually. I used to go for a shower about 6-7 times a day as a kid, but that died down a lot as I got older, and now it's completely opposite. Has anyone here ever noticed anything like this before? In the past or maybe right now or whatever?   It would be really nice if they came out with better meds in my life time. The meds right now kinda suck.    And child onset schizophrenia is soooo much more rarer than normal onset schizophrenia.    120-180mg to start. Not everyone can feel codeine because some people don't have the enzyme that processes it into morphine.    TOO SOON...   Is this minecraft?   Why not meth and crack?   Try crack.    I would've said... "Woah, you don't know me that well... yet ;)".   I usually get moderately depressed (sometimes just mildly) during the winter times, even though I love winter.   Can you share some of that cake?   Because that would so not be overpowering. /s  Also, RIP headphone users.   Isn't var not meant to go above 1 or 2?   You're always practising... Pugs, MM, Scrims, are all practice matches.    "I am currently MG2 now I can bash on MG1's"   Seasonal Depression is thought to be related to human hibernation that possibly happened WAAAAY back.    Usually when I use codeine it doesn't last longer than 2 hours. So I wait a couple of half life's to redose, seems to work.    If you make a habit out of codeine you can certainly have withdrawals...   Or you could just wait 3-6 hours before redosing.    Codeine varies between person to person because it's a pro drug. Some people lack a certain enzyme and don't get anything out of it, not even pain relief because their bodies can't properly process it into morphine (or not at all). Anyway, I would dose about 120-180mg (I would really start with around 120-128 though.   DPH would help with nausea and it will also make the effects stronger (I personally used to like promethazine though, if you can get that).   Have fun and don't make a habit out of it.    Tar is some dirty shit for sure.    Why would she cry over LSD? I've never understood that.    I can't full on tickle myself, but I can KINDA tickle myself.    Amsterdam has always been progressive when it comes to drugs. The rest of the world just needs to speed it up.    I personally think all drugs that have been highly researched (most opiates, most stimulants, weed, definitely MOST psychedelics etc) should be fully legal but of course regulated, kinda like alcohol. Except with drugs like opiates and stimulants you can only buy a certain amount every 2 days.   Alcohol killed people and made them blind when it was illegal back in the 1900s, alcohol STILL kills people but not to the same extent. The reason heroin and the like kill people is because its prohibited. Imagine if heroin was legal, you would know the correct purity at all times, you would have clean needles (so the infection rate of HIV will plummet), there will be MUCH less crime because there will be no need for a black market for these drugs, there will be much less people in prison and there will be a lot more and better rehab/treatment facilities  around. The "war on drugs" is a massive joke and shouldn't still be around, god damn its been about 50 years. COME ON.    It has an animal reservoir. Disease with an animal reservoir cannot be fully eradicated. Unless of course you go about trying to immunise all of the animals that are suspected to be holders of ebola, but that would just be simply impossible.       You can't eradicate Ebola.    "Good morning little pussy!"   I grew up with a severely alcoholic dad, and a mildly alcoholic mother... You're a good man for divorcing her, alcoholism really hurts a kid.    Mustard works for heartburn?    I live in the UK and when I tell people that we use diamorphine in the hospitals (and I explain that it's pure heroin) they're shocked and don't believe me until they see it. People here are wakening up a little bit, but there are still a lot of people here that call heroin addicts things like, stupid, useless, smack heads etc.   HOLY SHIT, YOUR KID'S A PIRATE!   I love how Oxy was in there. I guess some people just don't know it's in the same category of drugs.    This guy just doesn't give a fuck any more.       That's true but it just seems so funny man, like you've got a bank of drugs in your house.    That is extremely overkill, lol.    You drunk bro?    I've never actually been to Aberdeen and I've lived near Glasgow all my life.    This is yet another plot from the Scottish to kill the English.    BUT SCOTLAND ISN'T THIRD WORLD, ARGHHHH. *stabbed*.   Damn, that's some dedication.    God dammit. Reddit comments need to be straight for this. YO REDDIT, THIS IS GAME BREAKING.    Trainspotting. Isn't about psychedelics and shit but it portrays the effects (kinda) of heroin and definitely nails the life style opiates bring.    Wait... I was supposed to sleep?   That's just called bad awareness, some people naturally have good/bad awareness.    This has to be just silver 1's, no nova with half a brain is like this.  Also, nice smurfing, I totally respect that. /s   Usually m4a1 but I changed when they made the price equal to try the m4a4 out again, but I keep forgetting to change it back to the a1.     It's not like MDMA...    I would rather go to someone that actually loves what they do rather than just some company that wants as much money as they can eat. You're welcome/Thank you.    This guy is basically just an independent store that builds gaming PC's for a living, and if it has problems they usually fix it for you (but it usually doesn't).    Rather them smoking mid than smoking meth.    We're all addicted here, muahahahah...   I give a list of components to some computer IT guys that I've known for a while (but not like a regular, just go there when I want a new PC built) and they build it for me (it's a small indie store).    Do they know what those 8 different disorders are? Asking out of interest.    *Stronk.   What rank are they? ESEA Invite? lol.   Why not both?   Yeah, it usually does. But for me it's as if it's there, but not really, if you get me? That's why I said it's a mix of outside voices and inner voices, it's a weird thing. I've also had inner monologue being corrupted by some jackasses, dunno what that's about though.   I don't know. Only tried Abilify (Sucks for me, made me worse), Amisulpride and now Seroquel, seroquel seems to be fine I guess.    What about weight gain on it?   No one knows what causes mental illness. No one seems to really care either. Where is our charity for schizophrenia research? If there is one, I hardly even hear of it.    Well, voices can come from both inside and outside I believe, but it's mainly a weird combo of both IME.    Who knows? No one seems to really know. Ask your doctor why your meds "work" or don't work, they have no clue... Why is psychiatry so behind when psychiatric illnesses can literally disable you as badly as not being able to walk?  Edit: Oh and happy christmas :)   It's pretty awesome, done it before. I think it's for the purpose of when you're at lan so you can identify your mouse or something.    Yeah, I do kinda feel my rank ups coming now since I've been ranking up somewhat fast lately, every 2-3 wins usually. The anticipation is great.   They really should make an official statement on how it exactly works, would help me understand why I rank up fast sometimes but slow other times, even though I either do better, or the same.   Thank you, my friend.   Basically, I don't fully understand how the ranking system works exactly. I thought it was based completely on the Elo system but then the guy from Valve said it's more "complex than that"... How does it exactly work? Is it based on wins/losses, performance or both?   Fucking, Supreme's...   I like it when the eating noises scrape against my inner ear and make them bleed... Feels good.    'MURRRICAAA  	103
 You want to know what is wrong with the tea cup ride?! That fact that it isn't a ride that has a height requirement. I want to enjoy the rides that my kids CAN'T go on!  Totally forgot about the restaurant in Pirates. I will have to go there, too! Childless. Yes!    Fun fact: My husband and I are going to Disneyland next Friday for our anniversary...

Someone try a laser pointer!   Up... Fucking... Vote    I fucking love that someone actually took the time to make a video of how to fix that.  ***thinking***   "HMMM... What should I do today? Oh, know just the thing!"   Nope. I honestly made it because I am extremely over all of the posts. None of them were funny in the first place.  	8

I'm not really a roulette player. It was an example that came up in a conversation I had.   haha -- I wish I was still in school. No, it came up in a conversation and I was just wondering how to solve it since thinking about it was just getting me confused.   If I were to play roulette and bet either black or red, how would I figure out the odds of winning 30 times in a row?   It has a [lot of issues even if it does get made](http://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2013/11/15/1018853_coin-credit-card-device.html) that doesn't make it so appealing including a limit of 7 cards and the battery dies after a couple years with no way to replace it but to buy another Coin device. Also, the [credit card companies haven't approved it](http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/17/technology/innovation/coin-startup-credit-card/index.html) and it doesn't work if your phone battery dies.      In the scheme of things it could have been [far, far worse](http://www.hellokittyhell.com)            Most people know that quarters and dimes before 1965 are made of silver and those made in 1965 and after have no silver content. Many people assume it's true for half dollars as well, but it's not. While half dollars made from 1965 - 1970 have less silver (40%) than those made 1964 and earlier (90%), their silver content still makes them worth much more than 50 cents. Check with your bank if anyone has recently cashed in half dollars in rolls, and if they have, buy them. There will often be half dollars from 1965 - 1970 in them.   I learned this from a friend who is a well know fashion stylist. The very best way to save money on clothes is to find your ideal weight and keep it. If you weight is constantly changing, you will spend a fortune on clothes as they won't fit before they wear out.      	100

Pro ISIS Asawitiri media's 104th Twitter account was just suspended. Shutting them down doesn't do much except make a few armchair twitter anti-jihadists feel good about themselves for mass reporting.   I don't know how they got the number 46,000. I'd think it's impossible to give a conclusive number of how many 'real' supporters they have on twitter because many twitter accounts are actually run by terrorism analysts and government agency's for analysis, to gain access to their online forums and for other reasons.               Agree.   Al Jazeera's Jane Arraf tweeted that they used a bulldozer to level the winged bull statue. I think that statue might be an imitation.

The [agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm) cites,   NATO vows to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, i.e. not to invade it, and it's member states will "consult together" if the country is threatened.  It would be a non issue 'if' American troops were involved in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty. While Russia must abide to the NATO vows and not attack Ukraine's sovereignty. This is why on 1 April 2014, NATO decided to suspend practical co-operation with Russia.   Why would a Palestinian work for the  92,000 Palestinians disagree with you. They worked in Israels private sector until now and were happy with it. The decision to stop security cooperation's with Israel is PLO politics.    Israeli government   Most if not all work in the private sector  whom withholds $100,000,000 in tax revenue  Although I disagree with Israels practice, Hamas has 209.7 million dollars of electricity payments taken from Palestinians that rightfully belong to Israel's electricity company  thus punishing millions of people.  It's mostly Hamas who is punishing the people  Seems that the 92k workers are fed up of the gangster liar Israeli government  You are wrong 92,000 times.

It wasn't until December 1944 that the sinking of the Musashi was confirmed through prisoner interrogation.   [From World War II War Diaries](http://imgur.com/uYgFaDq) (last paragraph)  Reports of prisoners of war interrogation on the South-west Pacific indicated that the MUSASHI, new Japanese battleship, had been definitely sunk in the Sibuyan Sea by THIRD Fleet carrier attck on 24 October. The reports also confirmed previous sinking claimed by the Commander THIRD Fleet and confirmed extensive damage to the remain-ing Japanse battleships which were now either in navy yards under repair or operating at reduced efficiency.    **Description:**   **Musashi**  * Country Japan  * Ship Class Yamato-class Battleship  * Builder Mitsubishi Nagasaki Shipyard  * Laid Down 29 Mar 1938  * Launched 1 Nov 1940  * Commissioned 5 Aug 1942  * Sunk 24 Oct 1944  * Displacement 65000 tons standard; 72800 tons full  * Length 862 feet  * Beam 121 feet Draft 32 feet  * Machinery 12 Kanpon oil-fired boilers, geared steam turbines, 4 screws  * Power Output 150000 SHP  * Speed 27 knots  * Range 7,200nm at 16 knots  * Crew 2399  * Armament 9x460mm guns, 6x155mm guns, 12x127mm  guns, 35x3x25mm and 25x1x25mm anti-aircraft guns, 4x13mm guns  * Armor 650mm front of turrets, 410mm side, 200mm deck  * Aircraft 7  * Catapult 2  **Musashi Operational Timeline**  **5 Aug 1942**  Battleship Musashi was commissioned into service at Nagasaki, Japan; she was assigned to Combined Fleet Battleship Division 1.  **11 Feb 1943**  Admiral Yamamoto broke his flag aboard Musashi at Truk, Caroline Islands.  **25 Feb 1944**  Battleship Musashi was reassigned to the Second Fleet.  **14 May 1944**  Musashi arrived at Tawi Tawi, where she would remain for gunnery drills at range of nearly 22 miles with sister ship Yamato through Jun 1944.  **18 Oct 1944**  Musashi's deck was painted black with soot for the intended night operation in the San Bernardino Strait before departing Lingga for Brunei Bay, Boreno in the Dutch East Indies.  **20 Oct 1944**  Musashi refueled in Brunei Bay.  **24 Oct 1944**  Japanese battleship Musashi was lost in the Battle of Sibuyan Sea to overwhelming American air power.

 I can't see    The camel in the back of my house died facing the USA sign meaning we will win every World Cup for now on    I thought he meant he didn't like him personally not professionally, two different things.   Sure just gimmie an hour and I can   I need some papers to be translated from Arabic to English anyone willing to help me?   I'm ahead of the game since I've been pirating it my whole life    #ibelieve   Funny things is my brother was sent over seas for a situation I don't remember. Not saying we aren't justified but if your youth doesn't remember why we're fighting isn't time to give it.    You haven't bought anything sense Monday?   How do you delete a post?         Idk I just installed it and it worked    Working on my 5c   I'm thinking around $20 and not a counterfeit. I'm broke as shit and would like to support my team but the jerseys are expensive as hell.   What if we take what our body produces and enhances it?         What do they say?   Even then the pace of the European game is much faster then the American basketball       Sims and fifa   Time won't be wasted tho since they have extra balls that they throw in regardless.   Not really trying to steal one just let the stadium allowing to take one   A good ball once in a whole never hurts   And how much do they pay for those balls I doubt it's 200 dollars and if so is it not about the fans. The whole point of the game is let the fans enjoy themselves and have an attachment to the game and the players. What's not better then a free ball from their favorite footballer to keep that fan hood?   I say about 3 -4 balls go into stands every game to the billions of dollars fifa gets yearly.    Usually fans throw the ball back on the pitch and then there's two balls on the field which makes a delay either way time will be wasted. I believe we should be allowed to keep a ball for memory of the game like other sports do it's kinda unfair that we have to return and only have a cup with a team name to show for it.   Wasting time? There's ball boys that have extra balls.   That's what I was thinking    To hell with rules if a famous footballer kicks a 200 dollar ball to my face hell ya imma keep it          If it's approved when will it finish?   I will be excited when I piss in their toilet so I know it's real            I tried it earlier says I need for register and I prefer not too    God damn comcast and 2 recording limit, I can't watch the damn game   	40
 A layman-friendly explanation to something (which I think is) complicated or technical is exactly what this post is about.      Leftover pulled pork with pancakes.  Something about maple syrup, pulled pork and light fluffy pancakes that is just magical.   I own stocks in several large American banks and insurance corporations.  Should I be pulling my money out?  Recently these stocks have been doing well and have been projected to continue to do well.    I invest through a large investment firm and they're telling me to stay put, but they also don't make anything when I'm not investing.   If you read the whole series you'll notice that venoms features become more and more distorted. By the end he looks very much like OP's version.   Hodor.      Worth it for the last one.    Is ya a screecher?   I really hope that no harm comes to this woman as a result of this. It's not terribly uncommon for women that contradict social norms in a position like this to have acid thrown at them or to be burned.   	10
    I've seen a lot of Rails attachment-handling plugins, but this is the first one I've really liked.           I meant to write MySQL but actually should have just dropped the My as the principles apply to other SQL DBs.      I've use NB a fair bit and find it to be pretty good; I haven't noticed any speed issues that slow me down. When it comes to debugging, while the breakpoints and variable inspect features are nice, what I really want is a full IRB session at a breakpoint (as you would get using ruby-debug from the command line). It's much faster to not only inspect variables using IRB, but you can then run commands on the data and see what's happening. It's on the feature list for NB, but not sure when the team will get to it. On the overall, kudos to the team (and it's free).       Very well put. I'm grateful for the time ruby-core puts into maintaining the language, but I hope they read this article and take some notes.     There are a lot of tips and tricks on the web as to how to do things better/faster/cooler with Ruby/Rails. But there's not enough talk about how to make sure your site is secure with Ruby/Rails.        another, perhaps easier way, is to run "gem server --daemon" which gives you access to all of your gem docs at localhost:8808 (or another port of your choice).          Start with: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/     Why do you need squeak to teach them variables or OO programming? In teaching my daughter Ruby I just used real-world examples such as a Ball is an "object". It has "properties" such as the size and the color. There are certain things you can do with it, "methods", such as throw it or squish it. Variables are pigeonholes where you can put something you might need later. Some you can access only while in the same room (local), the same house (class), or from anywhere in the world (global). Etc.   It works :-)   Hackety Hack is a great idea, and I've tried it. But it's only about halfway there and the author (brillant as he is) has lost interest and moved on to other tools (like the more brillant Shoes; now that's something you could use for child programming).    I agree. I've look and tried the various "child-oriented" programming options (Logo, KTurtle, Squeak, Scratch), and while it's true that it might get them interested in programming, it's better to introduce them to a language that they can build on to create more and better programs. (On the other hand, something like Scratch might be great for a 5 year old.) I think that it's best children learn the underlying tools rather than an automated tool that becomes a crutch (think Frontpage) that later limits you. I taught my 9-year-old daughter HTML and CSS and she hand-coded her own site from scratch. We then moved to Ruby on the console, and now she's 10 and we're porting the console-based Ruby program she wrote to a Web app with Rails, combining what she learned from HTML, CSS and Ruby. She has a perfect understanding of OO programming (Ruby is great for that), and is learning tools with which she can create "real" programs (or pick up another language like Python).  	18
 This may come off as pretty random but, as an argentinian, me da mucha vergenza los comentarios que algunos de mis compatriotas hacen frente a lo que pas, alegrndose del caos.  Espero que entiendan que no todos los argentinos somos tan estpidos como para pensar que que les pasen cosas malas a nuestros vecinos de Chile es motivo de festejo. De todo corazn deseo que puedan recuperarse pronto y siento mucho las perdidas que han sufrido.  Edit: sorry, a bit of context. Some argentinians hate chileans and visceversa, which is of course a pretty idiotic thing to do, and they are glad each time something like this happens in Chile. I'm just saying to the guy that as an argentinian myself I hope he doesn't think we are all like that and that I'm very sorry about what happened and hoping that they recover from their losses soon. Sorry to hijack the comment thread but I didn't come cross a chilean these days and seeing what my fellow countryman are saying, just wanted to put it out there.   /r/whatcouldgowrong   Have you ever heard about that theory that says in the future a super intelligent AI will take control of the planet and it's robot minions will torture you basically for eternity unless you've contributed to their creation? And also they have a method in which they can tell exactly how many times you thought about this without doing anything, and each time only makes it worse and they torture you even harder for it?   I read it on Reddit, of course. It's like The Game but super hardcore mode.  EDIT: got a link, apparently it's called "Roko's Basilisk" http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk   Te recomiendo usar InstaSize para eso!

Upvoted for kidnapping. That would be fucking awesome, maybe even calling for a ransom!   Getting them off your back isn't hard, but what's really shitty is how when you're in the middle of fucking nowhere and shot a guy with noone around with a silenced pistol, cops come looking for you almost instantly.

Demasiado heavy esta noticia.      That's a great saying. This is actually a known process, which of course I can't recall the name now (maybe someone else does) in which the person uses every bit of information, even the ones that contradict them, to build their belief stronger. For example, a pseudoscience study comes along saying that vaccinations and autism are severely related = this must be true, their belief grows stronger. Then a scientific study properly made comes along and says vaccinations and autism aren't related = this must be false, their belief grows stronger. It's very irritating.

I have two pieces myself but I love the ritual that comes with smoking a joint, from the rolling to the credits roll   I'm sorry, I posted the wrong link before when I intended to post this one.      Dawkings talks abouts theories that are backed up with science, and doesn't say (nor denies) that atoms are sentient, because he (scientifical community as a whole actually) doesn't have the slightlest evidence that would point towards that. Chopra could be right, but he's talking out of his ass, he has absolutely NO evidence to support what he's saying, and he says it smiling and ridiculising science. It's very upseting.   Dogdamnit   /r/atheism was a default? Lol, what the fuck? I'm an atheist myself but that entire place is a giant circlejerk of idiots who jack off at their own posts. And even if this wasn't the case, why make a religious based subreddit a default? Seems weird.   Hey, I know life can get pretty though sometimes. Hell, I've known lives that were though since they existed. But trust me when I say to you, it can get better. It's in the power of our inmense will and effort, but it sure can. I advice you seek professional help if you haven't yet, and in the meantime, check /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression.

I first grind the bud, then carefully cut the filters and proceed with the rolling. I take my time so that every joint is perfect and nice in size and thick. I enjoy so much this process.    Then, I save them in a metal Camel box I have that's only meant for saving joints.     It's beautiful. It's good. It brings me joy.   I haven't smoked in a couple of months. Now I've got my job back, money coming, and as I write this I'm waiting to go pick up the bud I love so much. Smiling is inevitable right now.  Just wanted to share it :)   What would happen with matter in that case? I'm sorry if this is a nonsensical question.  Edit: thanks so much for all the great answers!   Haha   It's been around for 11 months but I feel like I'm noticing it just these past days, it's awesome.   *smoke signal*   It was, and I mean, I get the whole "don't comment that, just upvote" thing, but hey, the guy was just expressing his joy, no need to massively downvote him like that (siting at -50 now)   Yeah pls NSFW tag...   Yeah, it's preferable to go easy, at least for me. Getting to this state very quickly can lead me to a bad trip, don't want that.   Yeap that's enough reddit for today   One day, brother, one day...   This made me cry. Thank you for such beautiful words.   Nos watch it again and say that one more time but backwards   So yes scooters?   Hm, yes, you are correct; I did misinterpret the vignette here. But, although the photographer (or editor) didn't use a vignette technique, I stand saying there's an over saturation of the colors and lighting of the face in comparison to the rest of the picture. That, and the natural framing of the background (that tends to darken to the edges) produce a very much vignette alike effect on the eye.    So, while technically the use of vignette isn't here (we can notice that if we look at the evenly lightened grass), the effect achieved is the same, by other techniques. For my taste, the lion's face "stands out too much", as in an excess for seeking attention to it.  Let us all please remember that photography is a form of art, and as in all forms of art you can bend and break rules (to a point I believe), and althought I wouldn't have processed this picture as it is because I dislike the end result, I believe it's what the photographer wanted and I respect that. Of course constructive criticism helps, and it should be fomented, not bashed in saying "redditors say it's over processed always".    Not in DSLRs. I also believe some C41s film rolls came with midstep  ASA/ISO, but I may be wrong there.   I too am a professional photographer, and what /u/drakeg4 is saying is essentially correct. Use of vigneting should be subtle in most cases (of course there are no unbreakable rules in these fields), and generally an excess of it produces a weird effect. It's mostly used to emulate natural frames and help the composition of the photo by drawing the eye to the desired point, but here I too believe it's overused.    I also see an over saturation of the face colors in comparison with the rest of the photo. Again, to each it's own and I believe the photographer achieved what he wanted, that this is the final result he had in mind. But I also don't like it and I think the argument that the user you replied to have is far from invalid.   No, of course I didn- YEAH I DID SO WHAT   Bu- I SAID GET OVER IT   Must be a filthy peasant   He ran out of batteries   /u/avo_cado said basically what /u/mankstar said.    there are more molecules of water in a teaspoon of water than there are teaspoons of water in the ocean  Dude... Oh my fucking god...       Hi!  Well, I read here somewhere that tachyons aren't possible because they represent a violation in causality. So far so good. But, the explanation to why this happens doesn't quite get in my head. A redditor kindly wrote an example about two spaceships that are in a duel. The two of them travel away from each other at great velocity until they count 10 seconds, and then spaceship A fires their tachyon cannons to spaceship B. But, because of time dilation, 5 seconds have passed for spaceship B when they get hit, so they respond immediatly by firing, sending the blast before spaceship A fired the initial shot.  Now, I get why that violates causality (obviously), but the thing I don't get is; why does time dilation makes the time happen differently for both spaceships if they're traveling away from each other at the same speed? Wouldn't their 10 seconds be the same 10 seconds for both of them since they're at same speed?   Woah... The Universe is pretty fucking huge   Thanks for your answer, I was under the missconception of thinking there was galaxies and stars formed of antimatter.

 Better yet, according to a tweet from the animation studio, that was a single unrehearsed take.   Sorry that it took me so long to respond.  Here are the three figures that I have:  * [Sengoku Nadeko](https://i.imgur.com/fOzb9qi.jpg) from Monogataru Second Season (This is the one I won from the crane game)  * [Saber](https://i.imgur.com/axrrMeF.jpg?1) from Fate/Stay Night  * [Saber Lilly Nendoroid](http://i.imgur.com/jSKdPsz.jpg) (Nendoroids are basically a small figure with an accented head size. They are also modular.)   I, personally, have no idea. I know what if you want the $4.99 pricing you have to sign up on their education page, but I do not know if it works with this three month deal. The best bet would be to contact Spotify and ask.   Dang it, the suspense is killing me!   I feel the same way about this. I, basically, do not talk about anime/manga at all unless someone else references or brings it up in a conversation. If they do and it is in a public situation where others can hear, I act as though I know nothing.  I had the opportunity to go to Japan this year as part of a class trip and I did pick up a few things while I was there. I was extremely hesitant to buy any sort of figure but I won one from a crane game at a Taito Game Station.   My Mom thinks they are cool and I have no idea what my Dad thinks of them... :/   Nope. I worded it wrong. When I said "this deal" I was thinking of the linked one. I guess you could try and do the $0.99 for three months, cancel and try for the student pricing but YMMV.   If you are a college student in the US and have access to a .edu email address you can get Spotify Premium for $4.99 a month.   This deal gives you premium at $0.99 a month for three months then $9.99 from there on out.   People will say it belongs on /r/aww rather than here.   Sail the high seas.   Is it really yuri? We, the viewer, know that TailRed is a guy but Dark Grasper doesn't...   With After Story keep on watching the rest of the episodes.   This should be interesting...   Also, as a heads up one of the later pages is NSFW.   As a heads up, Reddit doesn't like self-promotion. The general rule of thumb is that your self-promotional posts to a subreddit should be less than 10% of the contributions to the same subreddit.   I've seen people banned for not doing as such.   Someone ought to recreate Spice and Wolf as one of those children's books along the line of "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie..." but as "If You Give a Wolf an Apple..."   I think there are some people over on /r/anime that are doing a Haruhi Suzumiya rewatch.   The fan translated ones were taken down when the novels were licensed in English.  So far, in the official releases, I haven't come across any weird grammatical errors but there is going to be a debate on whether it is Horo or Holo for her name.   You ought to read the books. Season 1 covers volumes 1 and 2. Season 2 covers volumes 3 and 5.  There are 12 volumes out right now in English.   I know this is digressing, but oh well. Black Rock Shooter is, originally, a Hatsune Miku song by Supercell. I do not remember the name/username of the person, but someone made a music video having the character, which is heavily influenced by the character design of Hatsune Miku, go through the story in the lyrics through the video. That music video and story got really popular which prompted a novel, manga, OVA, anime, merchandise, etc into what you know today.   Sorry about that, I used to be into vocaloid stuff a few years ago and I remember when this was all happening. I haven't, other than knowing f and f2 are out and Mirai on the 3DS soon, been following the scene for awhile.    For the past few weeks, I have been reading a number of light novels, but I am trying to find ones that are mainly romance/comedy oriented.  The only real requirement that I have is for the novels to:  1. Not have ecchi 2. An MC that isn't a blatant self-insert. (What I mean by that is a setting where the MC goes from some recluse to having a harem overnight because he is nice to them. These are, mainly, the fantasies of the author and as such they do not have a lot of depth) 3. Not a lot of vocabulary that is unique to the story. I get it that they have to describe certain mechanics, but there are better ways to ago about world building without is being a bunch of random terms together.  Some examples of what I am looking for:  * Hikaru ga Chikyuu ni Itakoro...... * Toradora * Hyouka  While it may seem that I am only asking for realistic romance stories, that isn't the case but they are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head. (Heck, Index could work here.)   Try loading the map in Hammer. There isn't a ledge to stand on as it is boxed off all the way up to the sky.   I hope they will animate that.   Some people are working on a translation patch for the game right now. They have up through what the trial version of the game offers and you can get the patch here: http://libraryshepherd.tumblr.com/post/103642341617/remember-when-i-said-ill-update-weekly  I hope it doesn't turn out like all of the other August VN TL efforts where the group drops/stops working on it or even worse, goes dark. This happened for Yoake Mae, Fortune Arterial and Aiyoku no Eustia so far... :(   It is fun, once you get the radio working, to just load up and tool around in every so often. It isn't demanding and it is a nice change of pace compared to most games out there.   It reminded me of this [gif.](https://i.imgur.com/i3eLl.gif)   I don't feel like reposting my comments again, but I had a conversation about this back on the article (also on /r/games) where I discussed the potential impact of the game being in the anime.   [Here is the comment chain.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2jvx0z/terraria_console_sales_top_300000_in_japan/clfmq6l?context=3)   Well, there is Saber Lily but that is a "different" Saber.   This reads like an ad for some guys book which people will get for free which will then push said book higher up the charts which results in people buying it when it goes back to its original price.  Heck, OP copy and pasted the same chunk of the text twice.   You need to include a link to the site and other information.   Anything is better than nothing. Also, I believe that YouTube only contacts those who meet certain qualifications for monetization.   No one know how much they are going to make for sure since the CPM differs on the demographics that the videos bring in as advertisers are going to target their demographic.  I can say, however, that if you are going to do it be aware that, unless you join a network, you will only get paid when you reach $100 in your pending amount on AdSense. (This is public information and it is not a statement of how much I, personally, have made through YouTube.)   Who wouldn't? People who do not want to be charged with a felony for it is considered fraud.   A woman is live streaming them driving around Ferguson right now, a number of fires and cops. http://www.ustream.tv/channel/heatherdemian   This would be great!   [Here](https://vndb.org/r?q= fil=lang-en.plat-psp) is a list of VN's that are available on the PSP.  There is a blog that compiles VNs that can run through homebrew on the PSP.  EDIT: Removed link due to the site giving you download links for the games. Just search "visual novels on PSP" and you should find it.   Nope, it is part of the contract. Even if it wasn't it is poor form to ask someone for their salary.   Depenidng on how the adblock works, it will do one of two things:  * Block the ads from loading = No impression  * Load but hide the ads (This is how it works on Chrome) = Same as loading but not clicking the ad. (I'm not sure about how video ads work when blocked)   It is a combination of the video ads, the ads on the side and the ones that pop up during the video on the bottom. Someone who is monetized can set which of these ads are shown or all of them.  It is and isn't on views. You are insunating that it is determined by someone watching the video, but even going on the page and having it up will cause an "impression". (aka ad view)  Google has been in the advertising business for years so it is near impossible to exploit and if you do your account will be frozen and you will no longer be monetized. (Youtube uses Google's AdSense platform for ads)    Huh, that must be new as I remember reading a few interviews of large youtubers and they claimed that they were unable to disclose how much they earn.    No one who makes money from YouTube is allowed to disclose their earnings. My, personal, channel is monetized and that is something that YT drills into you when you join.   For those of you who have also played/watched Little Busters, imagine Rin saying those lines. (Same VA)   I found Yuuki: --- ,   Recently, I have been running out of good romance/comedy anime to watch so I'm turning to visual novels.  I played the demo/trial for NekoPara today and it is basically what I am looking for but the cat ears are not necessary. I've been playing a bit of Hoshizora no Memoria and I have heard that it is a moege, butI haven't gotten that far into it.    Gate 7, which is CLAMP's newest work due to the terminology and required knowledge of Japanese mythology.  I liked Tsubasa up until *that* point but I am not too sure about this new one.   You'll have to search around online. A good place to start would be the VNDB listing which should have a link to the patch for the game.  You'll need a copy of the game that you ripped or from sites that cannot be linked.   Nope, the site is safe. Most people put a warning on TVTropes links because if you aren't careful you could lose a lot of time thumbing through various pages of tropes and series.   What is even better is the description:   Charles Barkley was a child prodigy at basketball. Anybody with him on their team would automatically win. He was just that good. After his mother, who was also his coach, died, he had a mental breakdown and refused to join a team ever again.    Two years later, Barkley still hasn't come to terms with his mother's loss. Every time he tries to make a shot, he can no longer see where the basket is. He's resigned himself from ever playing basketball again, and enjoys his life spending time with Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning, as they enjoy their favorite sports.    That is, until Michael Jordan comes along. Jordan's a free-spirited basketball player, and he sparks Barkley into trying to learn how to play again. He teaches him that basketball isn't just about making the shot: it's about enjoying the thrill of the game.   Check [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality) under "Anime/Manga".  WARNING: TVtropes link!   It depends.   It is a site called Mechanical Turk which is owned and operated by Amazon. They allow requesters, who are mainly either researchers or companies, who need people to tasks that computers cannot do such as surveys or even classifying images and such.   You have to be a US Citizen and have a SSN which you will have to provide Amazon for the I-9 form for taxes. If you make more than $600 a year Amazon has to send you the form to fill out for income tax purposes.   There is always work to do and there are opportunities for higher pay once you do a number of hits. (Typically 1000 and 5000) The minimum rate you want to shoot for is $0.10 a minute. ($6 an hour) but it pays a lot better than swagbucks and what not.   My guess it is because shows that normally don't have much of a plot like this one have stepped things into high gear this week.   Lagoon sends any computer into a frenzy.    If you are in the US you ought to sign up for Mturk. It is run by Amazon and it is the only site where I have been able to make any sort of substantial income on the side. (I've made ~$900+ over about two years of off and on work on the site. With going to college, I'll end up stopping for 3-4 months at a time or more too.)   Good luck trying to avoid the alt-fire of the triple threat. It can go pretty far.   I'm not /u/BitterRamen, but I think they might have done that because it keeps on bouncing between Easy Going Scans and HorribleSubs.   Better yet, that was a single take without a rehearsal.  EDIT: Fixed up my grammar as it was a mess.    It is the post that is kept "Stickied" on the top of the subreddit.    It is stickied to the top of the subreddit.   Try posting this in the daily purchase suggestion thread. It also says in big letters over the submission box that requests are to go in that thread.   It is right near a Gundam Cafe too.   Gekkan Shoujo went down due to the first volume having an event ticket. (Which always boosts sales by quite a bit)   One nice thing about paypal is that if there is any issues you can file a claim and get a refund.   It could be someone just trying to make a fast sale, but it does seem really cheap.   Thing is, you can do "define: terrorism" and it will give you a definition.   While it isn't a reviewer, I always find XboxAhoy's videos to be entertaining and pretty educational.   Technically, "Saber is my blood" works better as mana is found in blood and it is by Shirou's mana, thereby his blood, that Saber is able to exist.   As a heads up, you have to get your tickets well in advance as there is normally a three or more month wait list. Why is there such a long wait list for it? They only admit 200 people per day.  Also, it is really hard to get tickets outside of Japan since you have to get them at a Lawson (A chain of convenience stores in Japan) or through a [designated travel agency.](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/) (The link is to the Ghibli Museum's page about how to get tickets outside of Japan)   Old comment, but there are the ones in the same "universe":  * [Please Teacher](http://myanimelist.net/anime/195/Onegai%E2%98%86Teacher) - A certain character looks a lot like Remon. * [Please Twins](http://myanimelist.net/anime/196/Onegai_Twins)   If you are in college and have an edu email and access to your class schedule you can bring down the price of Premium to $5 a month if you are in the US.   It is kind of hidden too. There is the shop outside, but unbeknownst to a number of people the actual Tokyo Anime Center is inside.   When I went in May they had stuff for Mahouka and Black Bullet.   Took less than 24 hours!   Oh okay, when I was in Japan for two weeks I went into a manga cafe and saw that they had volume 32. I didn't have enough time to look for more volumes as the group I was with was being too loud and we got shoo'ed out but that is another story.   It is by the same mangaka as Pastel, which is a similar but much longer series. (Some say it drags on, but I think that is in part to the lack of people translating it. I know, for a fact since I saw it myself, that the series is at least up to volume 32 in Japan but the translations are around volume 28.)   Well, they have announced that they are going to put up a kickstarter to license three of the Grisaia games which were made by Frontwing. (The first one has already been translated and it is regarded as one of the best translations yet.) They are going to edit and fix up the first game and then, if they get enough as they are stretch goals, translate the next two games and they might even license the Magical Girl Chiruchiru spin off.   It is already around 107k, it will be funded.   **WARNING: The scene above has MASSIVE spoilers.**   My thought on the stretch goals is that they could try and get the PS3 art assets.  Other than that, I'd love for Sekai to put that money towards another of Key's VNs such as Little Busters, Rewrite or even Angel Beats.   What about the PS3 assets?    My guess would be that they would try and get the PS3's art assets which were greatly improved over the original artwork along with being a higher resolution.   **NOTE:** I am ***NOT*** affiliated with Sekai Project or Key/Visual Arts.   Same thing is hitting Iris Zero... :'(   I watched the wheat field scene on YouTube and it threw me into a spiral of depression for a few months. It has that sort of impact.   I wasn't able to get it today as when I go to my usual dining location on campus, there weren't that many people around so they weren't saving tables. I should be able to do it tomorrow.   The anime, which is based upon the visual novel, is extremely popular in both the Japanese and Western communities. While I haven't played the visual novel, the anime is one of the few that have made me cry and the only one that has made any serious impact upon my life. (You may think I am crazy, but Clannad made me look at family and what it all entails in a new way.)  The visual novel is also known for its extreme length. I remember reading, according to a walkthrough, that even knowing where the branch points are and where to save, to read all of the routes takes anywhere from 90-120 hours. Otherwise it is closer to 200-300 hours of reading.  The VN and anime is renowned for its soundtrack and the usage of these tracks to emphasize certain scenes. If you want to listen to it, the OST is on iTunes in most countries.  **EDIT:** To give you an idea, the amount of hype around this coming to the English markets in the visual novel fanbase is along the lines of Valve announcing Half-Life 3. People thought it would never happen and yet, here it is.   If the HPA4 has USB input you don't need the optical input as the PS4 can do it without it.   They leave their phones and even wallets to save their table/seat. If you want, I can even get a picture tomorrow to prove it.   Nah, he has you beet^^^^hoven.   There is. All you have to do is call the intern and tell him to write the script.   I didn't use proxies, but my account was under review last December. It took about a week or two for the investigation to be over and they didn't find anything and turned the account back over to me.  So, yes, people have had their account under review and not been banned before.   It isn't that different than the historical building designation in the US and I imagine other countries have something similar.   They are in Japan.   I go to college in the US and it is like that where people leave their stuff on tables and just walk away to go get food. I think it is due to the school being entirely fenced in and all of the entrances/exits are manned. They check for a student ID when people try and enter.   Oh, my thought is that she purposefully didn't show up so that he had the opportunity to perform for people without the stress of a competition looming over him.   Try /r/learnjapanese   Doki wasn't the original translation group. They were working through Clannad and, supposedly, retranslating it before Sekai picked it up. Sekai, initially, announced a partnership with Doki but since then Sekai has announced that they are going to hire a professional translator to do the game. (People are wondering if they are going to hire Doki's translator or not)   There is the possibility that it will be fan translated.   "Bugger off" and "wanker" could be considered to be inappropriate. I have no idea where you are from, but Reddit is a culmination of different cultures and ideas and some idea which are appropriate one place may not be elsewhere.   Sure, lets have people by a speaker that has seven microphones that are always listening and can even pick up what you say over other noises!   This isn't an invasion of privacy or anything! ^^^^Suckers...   His books are available online for free from his website. I remember reading that if you like his books to buy a copy and donate it to a school or public library.   That sort of language is inappropriate for the subreddit. Consider this to be your warning.   [Outbreak Company](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company)  [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - One of my favorites, but note that each episode is double length. (~45 minutes per episode)   You can click "Change Layout" on the right which allows you to browse the images differently. (I picked the middle one as I didn't have to see a lot of images at once and I could just click next to go through them)   The way things looks, it reminds me of Yodabashi Camera in Akihabara which (at least for the one I know about) is a HUGE electronics and hobby store that even has its own food court.   If you want the OST right now it is $15.99 on the US iTunes store. [Here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/clannad-original-soundtrack/id823583025) is a link that will launch iTunes and bring up the album for you to look at.   There will also be a physical version if it reaches the $140,000 stretch goal.   The entire OP is pretty good and it is EIGHT minutes long. The song is spread into parts that talk about the chapters in the manga that the season covers.   If you ever go to Engladn, never call it a fanny pack. Fanny means something else over there and it is not appropriate...   To me in 2009: "Invest in Bitcoin and wait for it to hit $1000 a coin before cashing out."   They are localized, if you want it on the PC.   **WARNING: Major spoilers in the bottom on the article!**   It is delayed on Crunchyroll too. [Here is the link to the episode](http://www.crunchyroll.com/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace/episode-5-661603) and it says ~2 days.    - What is your screenname (or initial)?     Messem10  - Age?      20  - Gender?      Male  - Location (Maybe better if it was state   country)?      USA, North Carolina  - What do you love most about anime?      Varied stories compared to western media.  - What kind of anime do you like?      Romance / Comedy  - How do you view anime?      On my computer  - Subbed or dubbed? Why?      Subbed, higher quality acting.  - Do you buy anime goods? If so, where?      Not many, but I got some while I was in Japan for two weeks.  - What parts of anime are you dissatisfied with?      Most settings are in a high school.  - When do you watch anime?      At night.  - Have you ever cosplayed? Where?      No.  - If there was a free Japanese anime-viewing site, would you use it? If not, why?      Yeah, but most people use Crunchyroll or Funimation's website.   If you want brawling at a supermarket go watch "Ben-To".   It could be one of the two OVAs that were recently announced for all we know.   It also seems as though the student council president has an inkling that Souji is TailRed, but dismissed the thought. Odds are it will be brought up next episode with her joining the team as TailYellow.   A pair of good headphones. I used to use Bose, then I switched to the Audio Technica ATH-M50's then after a few years I got the Sennheiser HD650 and I can never go back to my old headphones.    Probably people who create a new account to spam their sites in order to garner views.   Last time it happened, the admins quickly shadowbanned them.    Reddit has helped me earn ~$1200 over three or so years.  It was mainly through /r/beermoney introducing me to Amazon's Mechanical Turk. It has allowed me to earn some money in my spare time which has allowed me to buy things without paying anything out of pocket.   Pretty much any parody anime comes to mind.  * Seitokai no Ichizon * Hayate no Gotoku * Lucky Star    No need for the "Life Note". In the original one-shot for Death Note, if you erased the name before the body was destroyed they would come back to life.   Then erase the names so they get back to work.    You may want to provide a list of sorts such that people don't recommend things you have already seen.   Heck, there were Pulp Fiction characters in the fourth episode of KLK.   The anime, which uses the same pencil-esque artstyle of the game, is really good. [Here](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5507/Senjou_no_Valkyria:_Gallian_Chronicles) is the myanimelist listing about it.   * Sakurasou - Eh... * Toradora - Not until later in the season * Kokoro Connect - This fits. * Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - She is. He has no idea. * Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - Doesn't fit what OP is looking for * Kaichou wa Maid-sama - The lead MC is too tsundere and doesn't fit what OP is looking for.    Try [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2)! Do not watch White Album for it is a different series and it is really bad. WA2 is an excellent romance anime that definitely goes places.   This content is not suited for /r/animesuggest or Reddit in general.

 I have no idea how this would work, but I wish we had pedo detectors that would alarm sayings such as "Stranger danger" or "Beat it, I'm ten ya man cougar!" (In rare cases super cougar.)     Jeez, that is really creepy. Working around drunk people who pass by all the time gives me the impression you have enough story ammunition for a 12 hour party (get together, etc.) . But I'm glad your safe and that it all seemed to work out in the end... Just hope he doesn't come back.    Don't worry, I believe that you will believe for I believe in you.    This made me cry. I love you humanity... And those big bottomed girls make the world go round, Right Freddie?    It's like Facebook is that awkward guy at a party trying to make everyone laugh with jokes that go too far. No one is laughing.

       No, it was a big group of people walking, with those walking poles and everything.      i've just recently started to listen to Alt-J, they're amazing!  	5
 I think I'm actually as religious as I am due in part Evangelion. I was pretty passively religious when I started, being a teenage child of a Christian family. I watched the first four episodes and my only thoughts on the religious imagery were "Oh, it's kind of like if Gundam let Jesus into its heart. I bet we're in for some edgy but ultimately meaningless symbolism." I came out of it still kind of believing that, but it was mostly silenced by something along the lines of **"WHAT IN THE EVERLOVING CRUCIFUCK DID I JUST WATCH"**. Then after the required analyses of the show and its symbols, I started to gain a deep appreciation for not just the religious aspects of Eva, but of Christian lore.    Isn't it because you're Warlizard from the warlizard gaming forum?   Row, row, rape the power!   How to punish as Falcon:  1: Press B  2: Win the game   I was seven when it first came out. I started watching at like 12 and then again last year.    Gamera wasn't Toho, though they did make the '90s movies.   Anyway, I think after Rodan, Toho started to focus more on Godzilla again. Once King Kong vs Godzilla came out, there wasn't much time for a new Rodan movie because he was in the one after that. The only reason Mothra got her own trilogy is because she was so immensely popular, particularly among women, to the point that Toho decided to appeal to that demographic in particular.    Considering she's like a goddess and I'm pretty sure immortal, I don't think she'd need a reproductive system.    Is your main anyone other than Zelda, Rosalina, Samus, Lucina, or FemRobin? Because then it might be a bigger pr born of you have menstrual jabs.   Really though, a diagonal input will do N-attacks.    I want to get off me bone's wild ride   Sword Art Online probably.       It's half social commentary and half just him being a dickling.    rosalina's booty is out of this world   What happened to Slowbro?   no restrictions? Arceus, of course! Only the one true God can deliver me from such evil.   Restrictions? Probably a grass-type with photosynthesis. Or something that doesn't need to eat at all so I can save on resources. So probably a Porygon-Z, so I can break into stuff.    "THIS is some good shit, Michelle. Get out of here with that trash-tier anime."   [for those of you who actually want to read this](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qQLHNVBCQkM/U8c2S1DFV_I/AAAAAAAACJo/yxCNdGuJU4I/w1022-h452/Serena%2Bnow%2Band%2Bthen.jpg), the largest google images has to offer   Considering it's America, it's absolutely free.    /r/whowouldwin  Anyway, Evangelions god stomp. Literally. Sachiel is the weakest creature in the series and even *he* could probably beat most Transformers without so much as a scratch.    I think they would be *able* to be bruised, but it would have to be an incredibly powerful impact.    Probably Showa, just for the amount of good films (even if the good/bad ratio isn't exactly ideal)   I think Greninja is the only Pokemon to have its shiny as an alt in smash.    Ten outta ten. Hundred outta hundred. Best video, best video.    What's Betty white doing with my mixtape?   The Pick of Destiny, even.    Shia the freakin BEAN. Get it right or pay the price!

The kitty cat hat was the best thing to come out of Rebuild.    Ami's "I'm the shit one, I'm alone, wow is me" antics in this episode kind of reminded me of Evangelion. Specifically when Asuka was being mind-raped by Arael and kept opening the doors until she found her mother.       I deserve... So much more than this.    This Wolf O'Donnel bitch organized a Super Smash Bros tournament in my town the other day. He had the standard tournament rules- set stages, double elimination, no items, etc. He would only make an exception for games he was in. He only plays Diddy Kong, so when no one was looking before his match he would set the banana item spawn to as low as it goes. His idea was that since Diddy Kong's Down+B summons a banana anyway, no one would notice the subtle extra banana that would spawn. It didn't even affect his games, he just gets off to the knowledge that he did what he did.    Same name, test_subject8582 on Challonge   I'm just imagining Ringo Starr saying "My God, Thomas is eating the angel! This made Gendo and Mr. Fuyutsuki very glad."   Your Lance is the Lance which will pierce the instrumentality!   This should be the omega version of Final Destination.    Mew is the ancestor of all *biological* Pokemon. All pokemon who were not created directly through unnatural means (i.e. most legendaries and the Porygon series) descended from Mew.    Not at all, brother!    An APALLING lack of freedom 0/1776 would not amend   I made a post to /r/fantheories a while back about how she's Kyoko Zeppelin-Soryu from NGE, after returning from the sea of LCL.    I shit on them quite often, but the Rebuilds are quite the spectacle. They're definitely worth checking out.    Just look at the fanbase for Mari.   Or the Rebuilds in general.    *taupe   I said you, Jake Hurwitz! You're a freakin anti semite!   that F-tilt ping pong combo counts as a wombo combo for all intents and purposes, right?   signed up for wii U. Am I too late?   If you don't think magic school bus is the tightest shit then get out of my face.    Anything other than an Evangelion is going to have a bitch of a time trying to tear down even the weakest of A.T. Fields. Maybe if the Angels were 3 Tabris-es and three of the pilots were teenage boys...   1: which has more abilities?  2: Which is the better one for defense?  3: For offense?  4: Both are put to the test: Post-S2 Engine Evangelion Unit-01 (with Shinji) vs Gurren Lagann (With Simon and Kamina). Both are scaled to 80m.    I can't tell if I'm more appalled by the content or the shit taste in anime.   WATCH GURREN LAGANN OR SOMETHING YOU FUCKING WEEBS.    Sick day pt 3, to be sure      It's happened across several albums, but the worst offender is the Pokemon Diamond and Pearl soundtrack I bought on iTunes. Every song appears twice in the album listing, so whenever I listen to it or search for the included songs I get each one twice. What's going on and how do I make it stop?  I'm using ios7 on an iphone 5   maybe they literally meant the first 20-ish months of the millenium.    "Satire" is moving closer and closer to becoming a synonym for "prophecy"   *Togepi used Metronome!*  *Togepi used Draco Meteor*  "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"   Best response: ["Muslims are just terrorists who haven't terrored yet"](http://foroneandall.tumblr.com/post/111545316621/men-are-just-rapists-who-havent-raped-yet)   Can gay people get off to themselves?   "I know you're not all racist, lol jk Of course you are"   Gonna go out on a limb and say this is definitely a joke.    I must use the the evil Satanbox to inform the masses!   [Low blow? Hell no!](http://www.reddit.com/r/jakeandamir/comments/2w231c/this_vesteating_bitch_made_an_appearance_on_snl_40/conh7bm?context=3)   I don't remember if they said the line in the anime but I know in the manga that Ritsuko (and subsequently NERV as a whole) only expects Shinji to get in the fucking robot, nothing more. I think Unit-01 going berserk was part of the plan from the beginning.    *GODZILLADAMMIT IT   Technically it's not illegal. That's the worst part.    Anyone who can successfully seduce someone as broken as Shinji Ikari is pretty far from autism.    Excuse...   \\[T]/ PRAISE THE SUNBUTT      *hums Stuck in the Middle With You*  "That song is the highest achievement of the Lilim culture, don't you think so Shinji Hurwitz?"  "Who are you?"  "My name is Cow... Roo."   Don't lose faith, for our good sub may rise from the dead if enough of us believe!   I'd like to point out the frequency with which Mothra kicks Godzilla's ass.    Anta Dipshit?!   The End of Evangelion.    Maybe Sachiel, Gaghiel, or Israfel, but I can't see any other angels that a Kaiju short of magical holy moths defeating. No one is laying a finger on Ramiel for certain.    Easily Pokemon. I'm imagining Godzilla and Groudon  throwing down in Saffron City. Scale up some of the bigger pokemon ("Groudon is 13 feet" my ass) and have Kaiju smack down with them. Beautiful.    The problem is that most Kaiju are weaker than most of the Angels because of how much fuckery the AT fields create. There's no real way to fit in any Kaiju short of the Mothras or Iris into the story.    Please tell me there's more.    can you pm me everything?   Apparently it was also because Square thought Westerners were too stupid for JRPGs.    I think this is player-made.       I think Nintendo still believes Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was necessary.    Holy Guac this is exactly how I expected the show to end.    It doesn't seem like Vernita and the bus driver would be on a first-name basis, considering Nikki gets off the bus on her own unaffected by her mother's knife fight.    Did I miss something? Who's Sarah?   Local record store. I was able to bootleg-check it before buying it. But as is the nature of these things, you can't count on it.    You gotta watch both Kill Bills. Without volume 2, you miss out on some of Tarantino's best work.       I tend to distance the author of a given work from its actual content. What the work *is* is all that should matter. I can enjoy the works of Lovecraft even knowing that he was totally racist. I don't need to know the author to enjoy the story, or the music, or whatever.    Don't eat my West dude I'm serious   Jesus Christ tumblr how deep does this rabbit hole go.    You're all wrong.   \\[T]/ PRAISE THE SUNBUTT   That title made me think I was on Buzzfeed for a second.       any platformer is better with a controller.   Racing/driving is better.  Sports games tend to be better with a controller.   JRPGs (maybe not all, but definitely Pokemon and Final Fantasy VII)  Some third person action games (Dark Souls, Skyrim in thir person with a melee weapon)  Pretty much anything else is better with kb/m   Chances are I'm already bored of it.    "I love my mom! I love my dad's money!"   Hell, they're probably working on it as we speak.   A new Jontron has been in the works. Apparently January's didn't get the Jontron seal of approval and he scrapped it.    I guarantee the JC2MP guys are going to be working on it within a week of release.    I've been making do with FFVII and emulated Pokemon games. It's just not enough anymore.    [Link to original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2vr4fn/cindy_crawford_released_an_untouched_nsfw_photo/)      Link couldn't get Zelda to excuse him.   10/10 LSP   And it's not even justified, Ubisoft's recent PC ports (Far Cry 4 aside) have been complete ass.    you could try /r/explainlikeimcalvin.       I thought it was that he was trying to prove that Jack could chose, but  Jack ended up killing him anyway.    Assuming Godzilla's feats are scaled down from 100m (Final Wars) to 2-3m, each Xenojira is about 3% of the original Goji's power. This means that 100 of them will be 300% of Godzilla's destructive power in total (thanks fan calculations). While I admit I've only seen Alien once, the GojiMorph will still be pretty tough to kill. Each individual Godzilla won't do anything to the GojiMorph, so all the Xenojiras (or at least 33) would have to work together. This poses somewhat of a problem, because Godzilla (Showa fuckness notwithstanding) is more of a lone wolf. After Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla (the '70s one), Godzilla only ever teamed up with Mothra in Final Wars (and even that wasn't really Godzilla and Mothra teaming up, that was Mothra coming in to kill Gigan and Keiser Ghidorah, and Godzilla just happened to be there).   I suppose the Xenojiras have enough resistance and recovery to realize they can't go it alone, and one will eventually realize that organizing into two or three groups to take down the Gojimorph.   Xenojiras 9/10   Rosie and Rosey  Or Hardly Working   Can we talk about how on point this is?   At this point I actually feel like we're pretty much used to it.   Now if Fallout 4 were announced then *cancelled*...   Just use your pure imagination   Standard match in Tokyo.    *till he closes his eyes for swood            Also, would it fall under the Second Amendment if I kept it in a bunch of milk jugs?   A battle of the only two kaiju Godzilla hasn't defeated yet (in the movies).   Mothra has a twin egg as backup, and if she dies but the larvae win we count it as her win.   The Mothra is movie Mothra, **NOT** Mothra Leo from the Rebirth of Mothra movies. He is not the same kaiju as Mothra  The battlefield will be Tokyo. Both monsters get a day of prep.          Round 1: standard bout. Both have a standard level/chapter of playtime as prep  Round 2: They fight each other's bosses, boss rush style. Who comes out on top?  Round 3: Who can bed more members of the opposite sex in a day?   Round 4: Follow-up to round 3, who's *better* in bed?   I legit want/need to know      We were at a local burger place and I was starting to worry, because I know what this little coywolf does in public. But what happened next didn't start with him. Someone a few tables away started having a heart attack. I saw Wolf's eyes light up as he realized that this is what he had been waiting for the entire time. He ran over and ordered a bystander to call 911, checked for a pulse, and gave mouth-to-mouth expertly, as though he ad been professionally certified. It was when he got to chest compressions that the dark truth behind his fucked-up plan was revealed. I only found this out later, but it turns out he actually hangs out at restaurants all over town and waits for people to need CPR. Turns out he actually *tries* to break as many ribs as he can manage while doing the chest compressions.   The worst part is that because of Good Samaritan laws, nothing he does is *technically* illegal. No one even thinks to try him because he puts on such a good act, consoling their friends or family (if they're present) and most times even checking up on them in the following weeks.          After the Yui incident, Gendo knew Shinji would one day have to get in the Evangelion, so he tried to make him less dependent and bitchly by abandoning him. Because Evangelion is Evangelion, however, this only made Shinji a coward with some serious mental problems.   I just watched TTGL and this thought came into my head.    The title? Kill Drill.       Standard bout, No prep.    (Some Jon Wolf feats can be found at /r/jonwolf and /r/Jakeandamir)  So Jon Wolf, social vigilante, agent of public chaos, and general nuisance, is challenged with defeating Winston Wolf, Marcellus Wallace's problem solver.   Jon Wolf must create a scheme so subtle, so diabolical, so *legal*, that Winston simply can't fix it. What does he do, and how does he do it? *Can* he do it?   This is [Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_%28book%29) of the Living Dead. So all the zombies are actually just one big cloud of ash.   I'm going to Hell, aren't I?         It's American History X, but with the plot of Godzilla X Mechagodzilla as well.       I'm not talking about a pale white doll with blond hair and a blue dress, I want an actual *good* figure. Like S.H. Figuarts' figures. From what I can tell, the Disney Infinity Elsa is the closest to what I want.    To be more specific, does it for with a vegan *diet*, not so much the moral principles. I can't have animal fats for health reasons and I need to know if honey is still alright.    It's a battle of the women (so this Courier is female) who were shot in the head and went on to become heroes.   In both rounds, the events happen according to the whims of the Courier, meaning that she gets as much time as she wants. However, her opponent also gets that much time.   Round 1 is a straight-up fight between the Bride and Courier.   Round 2 has the Courier going up against Malala in a public speaking contest. Winner gets the Nobel Peace Prize.    The Bride has been tasked with seducing everyone's hyperactive explosion-loving director. What is the least valuable thing (to him) that could be promised to Bay in order to make him deny her?   I'm painting a bookshelf and I want to have a NERV logo. Problem is, I'm a terrible painter. I couldn't find anything by googling. Do you guys know of any way?   The complex characters are one of the best parts of Evangelion, but the complexity often gets pushed aside in favor of yaoi and/or Michael bay style action (looking at you, Rebuild). Is there any manga adaptation that stays true to the original without literally being the anime in comic book form?      I remember it, it's a chorus vocalizing in the background, I just don't know the name so I can look it up.       [From this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCr1fDHpiGw)      Unit-01 does have the S2 engine she got from Zeruel, and goes berserk. The Green Lantern corps is sent in to stop her from destroying Tokyo-3. How many does it take?      For example, Cloud as a clone of Shulk.   Was the Black Moon the meteor that killed the dinosaurs?    It can be any three kings you want (just identify them please).

What should I look into to achieve this?   Fight to the death in Gotham City.   	165
 I think it depends on where in the US you are.  The British section at one of local grocery stores is great (no haggis though).  It's the only place I can find Salad Cream! Wonder if they have an American or Canadian section in England?       Chicken Spaghetti  5oz spaghetti noodles, dried or 12oz cooked 1 Tbls butter 1 Tbls bacon grease 1 large onion, med diced 1 bell pepper, med diced 10 to 12 med white or crimini mushrooms, sliced thick 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 tsp Worchestershire sauce 2 tsp dark chili powder 1 Tbls all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 3 ripe Roma tomatoes, chopped 1/2 cup Chili sauce (not the Asian kind) 3/4 cup half   half or heavy cream 1 Tbls parsley, dried or 2 Tbls, fresh 2 cups diced or shredded cooked chicken, preferably not canned 1/2 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives 2 cups med cheddar cheese (8oz), grated  1. Cook the spaghetti in a large amount of heavily salted water.  Drain. Do not rinse. Set aside. 2. Heat the butter and bacon grease in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook onions, bell pepper and mushrooms until onions are translucent. Add garlic, Worcestershire and chili powder.  Cook for 1 more minute. 3.  Sprinkle in the flour and stir to incorporate well. Let cook for 1 minute stirring constantly to prevent burning the 'roux'. 4. Add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and chili sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, until slightly thickened.  5. Remove from heat. Stir in half   half, olives, parsley and chicken.  Stir to incorporate well.  Add spaghetti and cheese and toss well. Return pan to med low heat until it bubbles slightly and cheese melts but do not let boil.  This recipe can be made up to step 5 without adding the chicken and cheese then layered and baked casserole style in a greased baking dish at 350F for 25 minutes. Spaghetti, chicken, cheese and repeat but I feel this is unnecessary.    Of course you would and probably if she were a real woman! Sick F *K      And this is also why a good deal of people that believe this waste the precious time and opportunity they have while alive and couldn't care less about the desecration of the Earth even though the god they supposedly believe in made them the Earth's caretaker.     Well you're half way there by recognizing the your anger and the desire to recognize help from your fellow chefs.  Remember, you aren't performing brain surgery and no one will actually die.  Try to be more of a cheerleader than an individual, especially at this stage.  No successful commercial kitchen I know of has ever been run by one person alone.   That's what I thought.  I liked to mix a little plain yogurt and honey with a little cinnamon or allspice.      At sea!   Geoff, exactly what kind of slavery was it?   The french bread used for po-boys in New Orleans. Almost impossible to find anywhere else and I've found no recipe that successfully recreates it.  Soft and slightly chewy in the inside and so crackly on the outside you will be brushing crumbs off you no matter how careful you are.  It literally makes the sandwich.  No other bread comes close.  There are only 3 bakeries that make it but the best by far is Leidenheimer Baking Co.     What is the dipping sauce?   Aunt Tacca's Mock Cheese Souffle  8 slices of reg white bread, decrusted. You can use any other type of bread just make sure it's decrusted. butter 1 lbs sharp cheddar cheese, finely grated 6 eggs 3 cups milk or half   half Tabasco and salt to taste     Butter one side of ea slice of bread and cut ea in 9 squares.  Butter 9x13 pyrex dish.  Put bread in bottom with buttered side up.  Sprinkle cheese on top of bread.  Beat eggs well.  Add milk and Tabasco and salt to taste.  Pour over cheese and bread.  Lightly push everything into the milk mixture so everything in wet.  Let set overnight in the fridge.  Remove and bring to room temp.  Bake at 350F for 45 min. or until lightly brown and bubbly.      .... its gotta be Frito Pie!      You should really try making fresh ricotta.  All you need is whole milk or 1-2% plus some heavy cream, lemon juice and salt and white pepper.  No need to use raw milk as you have to bring it to a low boil anyway.    I've made mozz before but I found it's not worth it to me because of the necessity of buying citric acid and rennet which I have no other use for and of course all that stretching.  I prefer to by either whole soft mozz or a block of low-moisture mozz but never the shredded stuff because they coat it with a chemical to prevent it from sticking together which effects its melting quality.    Have fun and post your results!    The recipe is pretty self-explanatory but I will provide micro recipes if anyone needs it.   You must really, and I mean REALLY like rice!      Oops, I meant fettuccine.    Mother Teresa is/was no saint or even someone that had what we would think of as a modicum of a moral compass.  She rejoiced in the suffering of her charges and did little to alleviate suffering while rifling billions into the coffers of the bloated Catholic Church all the while enjoying the jet-set status of a billionaire and received firstclass health-care in the states in her final years.  I guess her final suffering was above those that truly could have used compassion.   Hundreds of women suffered needlessly because of Mother Teresa and ironically that is exactly the way she wanted it! Sick!!!!   Congratulations to your uncle!  So few people know how hard and prestigious it is to attain a Masterchef certification from the AFC.  Thousands of people graduate from culinary schools such as the CIA, FBI and Le Cordon Blue every year who can't hold a candle to the few hundred chefs that are industry recognized as THE BEST!    You're are so lucky to get advice from someone so knowledgeable and thank you for passing it along to the average cook!    I'm curious though, in your family, who was the best or worst cook and did that lead to his culinary inspiration?    The fat German was so hungry he almost wolfed down the entire sandwich before stopping to take a picture of it!      Yea but can you cook a proper French omelet?   Please tell me you also made homemade ricotta too?   Well, okay.  If you do it will just about reach mid-calf lol!   A bushel is about 8 gallons or anywhere from 32 to 50+ lbs depending on what is being wieghed.  I dig dill.  I even made a "dill dough" once but that's a lot of dill bro!  Did you mean a bunch?      Great job!  I'd love to do a prime rib but I can't seem to find one in any of my grocery stores.  Do I have to go to a butcher shop?   Very nice!   I only got the one plate at a garage sale but I had to have it!   Here ya go!  Sorry, I got sidetracked.  Rice Krispie   Peanut Butter Cup Brownies  Yield: 18 to 24 brownies  Cook Time: 45 minutes  Total Time: 3 hours Ingredients: For Brownie Base:      3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter     1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided     1 1/2 cups granulated sugar     1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed     1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder or 2 tablespoons brewed coffee (optional)     1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract     3 large eggs     1 cup all-purpose flour     8 full-sized peanut butter cups, chopped, or 1 cup mini peanut butter cups  For Crispie Topping:      1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips     1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter     1 tablespoon butter     1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal  Directions:      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; spray lightly with cooking spray.     Combine butter and 3/4 cup chocolate chips in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 60 to 90 seconds, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds to prevent scorching. When chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, stir in sugar and brown sugar. Batter may seem grainy, that's ok.     Add the coffee or espresso powder and vanilla extract and stir until smooth.     Whisk in eggs until incorporated. Sprinkle the flour over top and fold until just combined. Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips then pour batter into prepared pan.     Bake for about 25 minutes or until brownies are mostly done. Remove from oven and sprinkle chopped peanut butter cups and remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over top, then return to oven and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool.     Meanwhile, to prepare topping, combine 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, peanut butter, and butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 1 minute, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds, until melted and smooth. Add rice cereal and toss to coat. Spread cereal mixture in a smooth layer on top of brownies, then cover and refrigerate for at least 90 minutes or overnight, or until topping is cooled and set before slicing and serving. Brownies will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for up to 1 week.        A honey sriracha dressing.    Hard to see but the bun was lightly toasted, dawg.   Your doing it wrong!!  Hamberogology dictates that the greens, especially whole lettuce leafs be placed under the burger but above the lower part of the bun called the "heel" in order to catch the juicy drippings but also to lead them away down your hand and elbow, which may result in a juicy, tasty lick-fest but will also prevent the dreaded soggy, soaked bottom bun.  Shredded lettuce is another topic and will be addressed in my next online school of Hamberogology.   It just occurred to me that this would be a great name for a Food Truck in a Bark Park LOL    Give it a good spicy Thai peanut sauce base, add Asian pickled carrots and red onions then finish with a honey Sriracha dressing along with some  chopped scallions and your on your way my friend ; )   Si      Kind of hard when we don't know what you have.   nope   You are correct! I should have made that distinction.   Most Christian thought begins with the ideological framework that this planet was made especially by God just for humans.  Mankind was ultimately God's Special Creation and even after the "Fall" mankind was to have dominion of the Earth until mankind had no more use for it because of the Rapture.    Atheists, Humanists and some religions understand and accept as fact that the world we live in has produced millions of species of animals and plants, most of which (95%) have become extinct.  They do not subscribe to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of all creation but only a fortunate twig that happened to survive in a fairly recent geological fortunate turn of events on the so-called tree of life.  Some Christians label Atheist as arrogant because they believe Atheist see themselves as some sort of god or above a god.  Atheist, on the other hand, view the Christian view that the world exists just for humans arrogant as well.   What are some Christian perspectives on this subject?                We'd call this a Breakfast Chalupa were I'm from in Texas but close enough Amsterdam!  Looks even better than most served here!   Yes, German settlers in the Hill Country in Texas found they could take a tough cut of beef, pound the hell out of it till it begged for Absolution, soak it in a little buttermilk to further tenderize it, then cook it just like a weinerschnitzel!   Why can't I find Prime rib in the stores in Texas?  Is it called something else now?   Always put lettuce on the bottom! It prevents the juice from the burger from soaking into the "heel" of the bun so the burger won't disintegrate in your hands.  Other than that, great job!     I'm getting my aquarium ready just in case!  Probably would add a tiny toy Spock lol!   What are they good for?,  absolutely nothing!    Well, except they're so cute!   Chicken Fried Steak is probably based on the German dish, wienerschnitzel.  Texas has a significant population with German heritage that goes way back.  So much so that German tourists who visit the Hill Country in Texas can't or just barely understand what they are saying.  They also gave us great beer and Kolaches!     What, no kippers?  Seriously though, I now have "Breakfast In America" stuck in my head.  Looks great!    Those are some sexy brussels sprouts!  The mound of arugula could use a touch of vinaigrette unless it just there to make you think you're eating somewhat healthy *chuckle*      Texas, where to begin?  Pecan-encrusted chicken fried steak with poblano creme sauce served with one smoked brisket and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno with a side of fresh salad of Dandelion greens, topped a smattering of no-bean beef chili, roasted corn, avocado chunks and crushed Fritos drizzled with nacho cheese sauce.    California is a big state but here goes,  Take Tri-tip braised with Anchor Steam, slice thinly on a bed of Kale and Arugula.  Add marinated artichoke hearts, avocado slices and Sourdough croutons.  Use a Caesar dressing and finish with a fresh California poached chicken egg.      Exactly my thought.  This was New Orleans and because they are sue happy I had to pay higher premiums while I was stationed there.    The worst thing was we both worked in the same building and I had to pass her in the hall wearing her neck brace for a non-injury on my dime!     I gotta ask....what are cat head biscuits?    She was deaf and they thought that would be an advantage (sympathy) to her case even though they found no fault.  I still have the letter lol!  At least they didn't raise my rates.   What if you have the same insurance company?  Would it really make any difference to them?  Doubt they would sue themselves LOL! and in the end they could pick who they wanted to jack-up the ins policy rate.    My insurance company decided to settle when the "victim" threatened a lawsuit even though it was under 5 mph, no damage to either car and she refused medical treatment after requesting an ambulance.  Ask me why.    English is a very rich language!  It's why we say we eat beef and pork instead of steer and pig but we say we eat chicken and lamb instead of poultry and baby sheep.    Basic cooking methods are traditionally divided into two categories, dry heat and moist heat.  Dry heat includes roasting/baking, broiling, pan-frying, saute and deep-fry.  Moist methods include boiling, simmering, poaching, braising, stewing and steaming.  I may have missed a few but it's getting late here.  Souping, currying and gravying are not cooking methods.  You can use varying cooking method to achieve a soup. An example would be braising onions and simmering a veal stock for reduction for a French Onion Soup.    If I make a soup I may use many techniques but no one would call that "souping"  As for my vegetarian friends.  I sort off appreciate the many ways vegetables have been "disguised" as meat but at the end of the day they aren't and don't have to be cooked the same as "meat".     I'll let you know!   Was going to make Chicken Spaghetti then I ran across this!  Wondering if I should serve over spaghetti like Cincinnati Chili.       Stewing is a style of cooking and not a dish.  A stew is made up of smallish pieces of protein that are first pan-seared then cooked in a liquid much like braising.  The kind of protein, liquid and any additions used are wholly up to the imagination.     Ask for "the Animal"   Well if you consider Fort Worth close.  It's from Salsa Fuego.  Great burgers and Tex Mex that was rated #5 in the state by "Texas Monthly"   Usually made with Parmesan yes?   Molded into cups or bowls.  If you're a true foodie you'd refer it as as a frico.  This however, is something altogether different.  This is cheese love, or cheese chips!     The locals lovingly refer to it as "the golden halo".      Hats off to Salsa Fuego in Fort Worth for this masterpiece of burgerdome!   You shouldn't worry so much about how to pay for college, rather you should be more worried about how to pass your courses.    Your English is abysmal.  Look into a remedial class first.  You can take some online for free!   Did this all the time as a night baker in the Navy!  When I worked in a Flag Mess sometimes I'd have to go the Navy Exchange as soon as it opened to buy beer for beer cheese soup.  The looks I got! LOL   If I had a restaurant I'd give a discount to people for things like having well-behaved children or correcting misbehaving children.  I would also offer a discount for patrons with no children but have had to deal with disruptive kids around them.  If not a discount, at least offer a free dessert.       To begin with I'm not convinced that the Exodus ever actually occurred but that has no bearing whatsoever on my conclusions.  The lineage of the Jewish people is not based in Egypt.    Your assertion that most Jews in Israel aren't really Jewish is false.  Anyone today, for as little as a $100 DNA test, can trace their ancestry back to a specific geographical location all over the world.  Interestingly Arabs and Jews have a very close DNA indicating they are from the same stock.  Anywho... your comment about the Jewishness of the Jews in Israel has absolutely no bearing on your assertion of the supposed benevolent principles of Jewish Law and subsequent "tweaking" by Jesus of traditional Hebrew laws.             "All jewish law is derived from the principles of loving god and loving your neighbor."  I'm throwing down the BS card.  Your statement is about half right.  The Hebrews of the OT may have loved their god but they and their god certainly didn't love their neighbors especially when it was inconvenient for them.    The majority of Christians are unaware of the atrocities committed by Hebrews (god commanded it or was committed by their god alone) because their Christian education consisted of simplistic Christian children's books, children's bible studies or what their family told them but have never actually read a bible.  Most Christians are woefully ignorant of what the bible actually says and instead of actually reading it they depend on some so-called "expert" such as a preacher, priest or minister to read it and then explain and "interpret" it to them.    The "golden rule" factor was not and is not a part of the Hebrew faith.    Case in point, look at what they are doing now. the Christian political dupes who just want to hold onto what political power they have cow-towed to the demands of AIPAC that holds way to much political influence already.     Homo Erectus, wasn't that the title for a gay porn film?   Plus it's a school for non-English speakers where homophones are one of the most difficult but an important part of the English language to grasp.   Some psychotic people and some animals may lack morality (amoral) but all humans have an innate sense of right and wrong, that is they know it's bad to crap in the bathtub of the world even if it benefits them (which it doesn't because it's their bathtub too).  They are moral if they don't act on this awareness and are immoral if they are aware but do anyway. (no pun intended)  Amoral doesn''t equal immoral so I think your kids are safe.   I've asked this too and usually received a reply along the lines of the "Golden Rule" but like you said that rule is mostly culturally and religiously universal but is still not even fully adhered to in the bible.  I've never received a well-defined answer to this question and probably never will.       You are why I believe religion has a place in society even though I myself have no belief in eternal damnation.  Personally, people like you scare me.   These so-called "family friendly" hypocrites force their employees to sign a document that essentially negates their federally afforded and constitutional protections from discrimination in order to be employed.  Republicans will say that they have the choice to sign and work for HL or go someplace else but this is more common than you think and will most certainly and exponentially grow and when you're desperate for a job to feed your family you shouldn't have to worry about signing away your civil rights for a job.  HL and companies like them should not be allowed to violate federal laws that protect citizens from discrimination.   These "contracts" must be outlawed as a condition of any employment.      Most certainly he will cling to his Christianity more strongly than ever since his religion promises him a ticket to heaven if he sincerely repents and accepts Jesus as his savior.  Meanwhile non-Christians, some of whom never even heard of Jesus or didn't hurt anyone will burn in hell forever simply because they never acknowledged him.  This god/Jesus person sounds like a narcissistic sociopath, IMO, who only cares whether humanity praises him.    This really is the opposite of a true love that seeks no compensation or pay off.  Why would a perfect god need validation or admiration from it's creation?           I'm going to culinary school.  Last week we were told we don't actually fry eggs.  What we are actually doing is sauteing an egg.  Then we actually deep fried a whole egg and the result was interesting.  I took this one step further by just deep-frying an egg yolk.  Eureka!  It held it shape, can be handled and looks nice.     I'm so ready to try using my waffle iron for hashbrowns. I think it would work better than a panini press.    You have been bought up in a faith and you believe in it hook, line, and sinker because it's what you know and what they told you to believe.  The same happens to all kids in the middle east.  ????????????????    "False, everyone knows God exists, and comes to this conclusion naturally"  Calling the BS flag here. The thing is, if this were even remotely true, you have to be able define the attributes of your particular god before you can have a belief and babies/children do not come by this naturally.    "The message is restricted because God only plans to save some people."  Your response shows exactly why the OP posted his question.  Your response indicates that your god is only interested in his "chosen people" and doesn't care about other people he had created. From what his "chosen people" have told me they don't want this.  "Allowing sinful creatures to be born so they could be punished is not in itself evil unless you want to argue that justice is evil."  It could be said that your argument justifies the abuse and punishment of every child born.  According to you there is not one innocent baby born.  Obviously you are not a parent and I hope that you never become one.   God supposedly created all things including good and evil.....on purpose.   Your first statement is completely presumptive.  No one is born knowing a god or gods exist.  They only know what they are exposed to and learn what is expected of them from their culture.  Additionally, no one that "knows" a god exists and understands the consequences would willfully disobey a commandment of a god because of abject fear, unless they were mentally ill but that's another issue.   Your second premise, that a god is not unjust in not revealing its' nature and expectations to all of humankind because it doesn't owe it to them, doesn't make any sense especially if that god is omnipotent.  Why would the "message" be restricted to only a tiny part of humanity especially if that was the means to salvation?  Why were there "chosen people" in the first place?   The fact that the early origins of all religions were restricted to isolated groups indicates, not an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent god/gods, but only a belief system or mythology based on the actual living conditions of the group at that time.      Did you realize that you are the 666 commenter? lol   Most of my clients have dog doors leading to their back yards.  Some can walk their dogs but can't drive to a store as is the case with my blind client.   Who are you to say they "shouldn't" have a pet.  Often that is the only companion they have on a daily basis because they are home-bound.    You seem to have a lack of empathy coupled with an extremely  judgmental attitude about people and situations you know nothing about.   By mobility I mean not being able to get to a store.  Many are home-bound because they can't drive anymore but can still get around their house.  Meals on Wheels has enabled many seniors from having to move into a nursing home.  One of my clients is a young woman who is blind and another man was only 29 years old but enrolled in MOW temporarily after a leg injury left him unable to go down two flights of stairs.    You were right in the beginning,  that is a horrible thing to say.  FYI, client's services in Meals on Wheels are not based on income.  It's about mobility.  A lot of my clients pay money to MOW but they aren't required to.      I have a pet route along with my regular Meals on Wheels route.  I deliver pet food just once a month.  My regular route is only one day a week.  Both routes take only 1 1/2 hours at most.  I have become very close with most of my "clients" including the furry ones and it is one of the most rewarding things I do all week.    If you can spare just 1 hour one day a week please consider becoming a Meals on Wheels volunteer.  They always need more volunteers!    It's the day before that blows!   Everyone's reactions are different.  A lot depends on emotional support or rejection from your partner, friends and family, the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy or any prior history of mental health problems.    There are no scientifically valid studies that support the conclusion that the procedure itself causes any problems.   It was in the 80's, around $400.     Common arguments include the mother having regrets leading to severe depression and/or suicide.  Medical issues may include the inability to have children later or develop breast cancer.  http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/3/gpr090308.html   Having an abortion.  Not exactly a walk in the park but no latent physical or mental problems afterward.   I would agree except I always worry about bacteria growth from the grinding process.  I much prefer Beef Carpaccio.    I am trying to imagine the Jesus of Nazareth telling a starving person that feeding them wouldn't help others in the long run.    Then again, according to Catholic doctrine, life on this earth is inconsequential and the only import is life after death(oxymoron) and the best way to get a good death/life is to suffer as Jesus did.   So the masses are told to suffer while the priests live this life high on the hog.  Explain again why we, the masses, are skeptical of the motivations of a religious organization that has its own bank, government and voice at the UN that no other religion has?        Most "rednecks" make sure their kids get vaccines.  I should now as I proudly is one lol.  Seriously though most deniers are either immigrants or overly-educated, upper middle-class people who think they are smarter then the rest of society.     To let everyone know I'm an atheist.  I'll tell people if asked but I won't in anyway advertise it.  I'd like to wear the "A" on a necklace or put a sticker on my car but I'm afraid of vandalism or negative repercussions from my instructors and employers.      Glad to hear that he's your ex.  My question to you and one that you should consider very carefully is why you chose to ignore his rude remarks to you and women in general.  Why did you put up with his shit for a fraction of a second?    You stuck up for your friend but not yourself?  Why?  You obviously knew that he was a a misogynist before hand yet stayed with him.  Are the "positive attributes" that good that you would put up with his crap?  Listen, I had a boyfriend that stood to inherit a 20 million dollar fortune which I didn't find out for a long time.  He was a drunk and and even his mother wanted me to marry him but after he tried straggling me in a drunken rage I fought back the way my mother taught me to.  I put my hat on and left.  Nothing is worth losing your own dignity.  You're better off and I hope you find your self-worth!   Considering the amount of plastic surgery that's done for no other reason then "enhancement" I have to disagree that mutilation of the body is only a primitive endeavor. Starving and binging in order to achieve a body style is as bad as foot binding and is done for the same reasons.   Nah, she just sort of gave up and had no interest in anything.  I guess you could say it was the "fuck it, I don't want live any longer" diet.  Not recommended for anyone just wishing to just lose a few pounds.   My "selfish cunt" of a grandmother went from 250 lbs to 74 lbs in 2 years before she died.  You're welcome you asshole!   Not quite, our coffins have longhorns on the front.   toilet paper!   I think that Mark Twain summed this up in his essay about the arrogance of humans in thinking they are more "successful" than clams or bacteria.  Lower and higher forms of life is purely a subjective point of view.  If twenty thousand generations of my relatives have lived and died in your gut since your birth and, at any one time, more of my kind reside there then all the humans that are living and have ever died, I'd have to declare victory.  Who knows?  Maybe God has a hard on for bacteria and beetles and humans were an afterthought.      Unfortunately my mother embraced this idea in her later life. Her mistake was not caring of others opinions vs. caring about others feelings.  She came to the mistaken belief that she was now "entitled" to treat anyone like crap because she was old. She died without any close friends.  Most of her family had limited contact and those that were there put up with it for money.  Sad       	111
 This is nice.   [Front](http://i.imgur.com/E6md6hq.jpg)  [Back](http://i.imgur.com/zaAxhf9.jpg)   Just threw something together.   I'm guessing no?   Exactly.   In regards to the racist and/or offensive names, I think that is something that should be taken care of in a way other than random names.   Since joining, I've thought that there needed to be a tighter filter on names (both group and personal). Hopefully we can see this some day. Not everyone is all about the vile *grossness* that comes along with with "HairySpankyPeen69" and "D1ldoButtLuv".   Woet pls   I know it's not the biggest deal in the world, but when someone makes a group and then invites his buddies, no one is able to see the creative name he came up with.  Many times have I created a group making fun of a friend I was inviting to play. Much to my chagrin, they never take notice of my cleverness.  Anyways...I think it'd be reasonable to have the group name translate to the actual group itself.   It's been a long time since we've discussed this, and I just got done listening to the entire 4 hour 30 minute FFX soundtrack. So, I was naturally intrigued.  1. Which is your favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack and why?   1. What is your favorite Final Fantasy song and why?  **EDIT:** You glorious people have just given me a months worth of songs to listen to. I love you all!   I hope it was clear that I'm not trying to provide extensive and detailed strategies; rather, I am trying to offer some very generalized and beginners advice from (limited) experience. Seems like you guys are talking specifics, which could confuse a beginner all the more.    ^^Legal ^^Disclaimer: ^^A ^^lot ^^of ^^this ^^information ^^has ^^been ^^said ^^before. ^^I ^^am ^^not ^^your ^^definitive ^^one ^^stop ^^shop ^^for ^^all ^^things ^^TagPro. ^^This ^^is ^^merely ^^observed ^^advice. ^^Additionally, ^^you ^^should ^^seek ^^the ^^services ^^of ^^a ^^confident ^^professional. **** Defense is a humble position to play in TagPro. If you do your job well your team and/or the scoreboard might not recognize your brilliance. If you do your job poorly everyone knows (including the scoreboard), and your teammates might start a subreddit about how bad you are (i.e. /r/staertheslippyball). There are some incredible in-depth guides for defensive players that want to improve their skills, most notably are [Felix's Guide to Defense Part 1](http://redd.it/1njysa) and [Part 2](http://redd.it/1rre1k), and [Hob's Guide to Containment Defense](http://redd.it/1uohk0). However, if you would like to follow some simple introductory steps to playing defense in TagPro, hopefully this quick guide can help! **** ###The Five P's of TagPro Defense  1. **PURPOSE** - Discover your purpose as a defender. Typically, there are two players on defense and two on offense. Along with your defensive partner, your primary purpose is to defend your flag, disallowing the opposing team from leaving your base with said flag. Notice that I didn't say that your primary purpose is to refuse access to your flag at all times. Sometimes the best option is to allow enemies to momentarily take your flag so you can swiftly pop them back to their base. If they escape your base with the flag, it is your responsibility to chase after them until they are popped and your flag is back safely at home. There are certainly secondary and tertiary purposes of the defensive position, but as long as you are committed to keeping and returning your flag back to base, you are rolling in the right direction.  1. **PROTECT** - ...your flag: As previously stated, your primary purpose is to guard your flag. The only way the opposing team can score is if they grab hold of and escape with your flag.      ...your base: Know when to hold a button and when to let it go. Decide to clear speed pads every 10 seconds or know how they can be used against you and instead use them to your advantage. Bombs are typically not a defender's friend; eliminate them as soon as they spawn (as long as it is safe to do so). Take care of your base so an attacker doesn't use it to take care of you!     ...your power-ups: As a defender, the main power-up that is useful is Tag Pro. However, it is nice and wise to offer power-ups to your attackers, as it could benefit them most. You want your team to get the power-ups, not the other team. So if necessary, don't hesitate to take a power-up and use it defensively.     ...your teammate with the flag: This gets tricky and is a little more advanced because you might mess it up and be the reason why your teammate gets popped and the flag returned. But if possible, push enemies away from your flag carrier so that he or she can score.  1. **POSITION** - Sometimes you will want to hover on top of the flag to prevent an opponent from picking up the flag. Most of the time you will want to stay a tile or two away (usually on the opposite side of your opponent) so you can quickly pop them if they perform a "flaccid grab" (grabbing the flag without a real chance of escape, resulting in a pop). If they grab the flag and continue to roll towards you, there is very little you have to do to pop them. If they grab and then roll away, you will have more momentum than they do, allowing you to quickly catch them. Furthermore, you want to zone defend certain "chokepoints" that serve as entry or exit points into and out of your base. Positioning varies map to map and is largely dependent on the skill level of your enemies and your teammates.   1. **PATIENCE** - Getting juked is the worst. It is also, at times, inevitable. But you can do some practical things to help prevent breaking your ankles on a regular basis. It is often smart to let the opposing flag carrier come to you. Be patient and let them make the first mistake. Remember, they know where they are going, you don't. Refuse to over-commit. If you have to chase, do so with reservation. Drink Felix's advice like a soothing miracle tonic:      *The best way to chase is to go where they are going, not where they are.*  1. **PRACTICE** - Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make you better. Practice  fail  learn  make changes  improve. PUBs (public games) can improve your play, but it is difficult to play adequate defense if your defensive partner is subpar. PUGs (pick-up games) usually host better and more experienced players. I'm not suggesting that you jump into PUGs right away, but do aspire to grow in your skills and aim to take part in PUGs sooner rather than later.    I hope the Five P's have been advantageous to your progression as a TagPro defender. Now, go forth and defend your flag you impenetrable wall you.   Are you home yet?   This is wonderful /u/AMorpork. Thanks for doing this.   Do dolphins really gang-rape humans?   So here's my orderly tactic:   # Turn screen so passersby cannot see.  # Turn volume low and mask by background music. # Act like I am not in the office if anyone calls.  # Refuse to go to staff meeting or any meeting for that matter.  # Treat my coworkers like scum because anytime they come into my office they are taking away from valuable time that I could be investing into TagPro.  # Quit my job as soon as my boss tries to ask me what I'm doing. Like it's any of his business...  # Pack up office and leave because I was fired before quitting.  # Return to office late into the night and set whole building on fire.  # Don't take another job because, frankly, I don't have time. TagPro.    Do you play while at work/school? How do you do it without getting caught? If someone walks in, what do you do? HELP ME I'M AT WORK!   "Ooo two defenders. Uh oh, another spawning. Great patience. Oh! Oh! Juked! Oh! Double juke! Triple juke! And he's freeeeeee--"   *Boom! Pop!*  "...Dude..."   [This is my picture!](http://imgur.com/Q4cIh9R)  Thoughts? Suggestions?   What's the story behind this?   Upvoting just so we can get to the bottom of this. Spent the whole night listening to a PUG group discuss the bot's tactics and stats. Ready to unplug the bot and move on.    I look on Craigslist until my eyes grow sore. Luckily, I am an hour away from a military base where men and women are leaving at a moments notice and need to sell a car. That is often how I get them so cheap.  Just look for a deal and wait patiently for a deal and a deal will present itself!   If you are patient and refuse to get "car fever", then you can find an incredible steal of a deal for $5,000.  I recently purchased a 2003 Toyota Camry in great condition, one owner, and 105k miles for $4,000. You can do the same.   Just want to mention that /u/JuventinoSenator (Liquid) did an incredible job of hosting Maptesting Monday. He was very professional, organized, and friendly to all that wanted to get involved.   +10 friends points for being such a cool guy.   I can't tell if this is April Fools or real life...  My eyes are running. I no like...   Still, even if he was breaking the law in that manner, I don't know if it is justifiable that they would taser him in such a way. I hope that I don't ever get tasered for speeding or jaywalking. That'd just be terrible.   Bad video quality I know, but you can clearly hear the entire transaction.      Not sure about this one. It is a fun concept, but it came up about five times for me today and it gets old pretty quickly.   But have you ever played with squares?   This is wonderful. You should have ended it without the escape. It would have been funnier to imagine that the poor square never made it out alive.   Thank you for getting on this so quickly, Lucky. The bug had me right pissed off. This isn't some 90 degree bullsheesh. This is TagPro. We're freakin' balls.    I'm fine with this. We must remember that they are not working on a game for only a year. They are working on a game for 2+ years before release.    I personally would like to see it as an easter egg...  I think this would be a good idea. I enjoy the map and gameplay, but as many have already said, it is a different game type altogether. It is a fun gimmick map, not a regular rotation competitive game.   Not sure if you meant that or the opposite. But, I am currently investing 15% of my monthly income into retirement.    Great comments here. Let me try to address them as asked:  * I do not have cable or a home telephone. Internet is cheapest I can get. Cell phone could probably go down $15 or so which does add up.  * I just refreshed my auto insurance so, as far as I can tell, I have the lowest rate available. * I don't even recall giving them an average mileage. I'd have to look that up somewhere.   I would suggest maybe reevaluating how much you're wanting to spend on the house. I'm not sure if $250,000 would be a comfortable purchase for me if I was making less than $30k/year, although I do understand the roommate thing would help. What if you can only get two? What if one stops paying rent because of a job loss? What if you can't get someone to fill an empty room? It sounds like a lot of risk to me.  If I were you, I'd probably consider looking for a less expensive house or even rent for the time being.   Interest rate is at an even 5%.   I've had a townhouse for four years now. I would like to pay off my mortgage as soon as possible. I have an emergency fund, I am investing a percentage into retirements, and I have no debt.  I have been paying an additional $150 towards principal each month, but that isn't moving the needle quick enough.  I moved through these other financial steps quickly. Now I feel like I am stuck. What are some practical things I could do to help pay off my mortgage as soon as possible?   I feel like you aren't sure whether or not to apologize.  "I'm sorry...but it's really your fault. I love you guys...but you gotta stop being butthurt. J/k, It's all my fault, please forgive me. Jerks."   staer (D) i wheel b bad   Thanks!

Life kicks you in the nuts but you my friend you got up and stared life in the eyes and said "my turn".   Username explains your idiotic comment.   Straight from /r/conspiracy    Fucking asshole, THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT RICK HAS BEEN THROUGH. IT TAKES SOMETHING FUCKING HUGE TO SUPRISE THIS MAN WHO HAS LOST AND GAINED SO MUCH.    CONSTABLE RICK GRIMES.   Rick expected it. He knew that either carl or daryl needed some "fresh air" at some point.    Rick is outside so he could get the gun that he concealed, and he doesn't care if carl gets out because he knows that carl can take care of himself especially with rick close by.    Churchin' it up   Are you from salem? Do you happen to be a witch?   Tifu?    Fuck that, it was his house, his idea, and his hit . He pays.   Wow, thats beautiful haha   Lol thank you partner.   Bro, don't even comment.   I didn't say anything....   Really hope your kidding.    Don't watch it then.    Fuck you gibby.   Vision.   "C'MON TARS"   You need a fleshlight.   I meant it like he would have gone to the extent of killing someone to protect his girlfriend...   I don't know why people are complaining, the episode sucked and the viewer count showed. Hopefully the writers have learned from their mistakes.    Cats    Protecting the lady from her stalker with a handgun. Fuck yeah. Total win.   Shut up man, im trying to be sad :c   Haha your right about that my friend,  people come here from Mexico thinking its the promised land. Little do they know.   So why are you talking shit to me? We have the same thinking pertaining to our government.  We're fighting the same fight, just different tactics.   You love this shitty country? This country that kills its innocent civilians? Im not saying i give up, im just pointing out that our 'privacy' has been in the government's hands before any of us even thought that our precious country would do such a thing. This "country" for a lack of a better word is too far gone. I care about myself and whats going to happen to me in these dark dark days, im not rolling over and dying im just pointing out the obvious.     /r/wincest (   ) sorry, it is a curse...   Great please do. You not voicing your opinion or rather not even commenting will do this subreddit a huuuge favor.   How the fuck? Its the truth, i gave an answer that is logical yet you think im trying to throw you off, im not the bad guy you prick.    Everyones data in America has been seen. Everyone's. No one has private shit my friend we're all out in the open.    Those devices are License Plate readers so repo companys can get the car that they are trying to locate. Not everything is a conspiracy lol.  	101
 so with the arrival of new devourer i was wondering some new team comps. I believe that some of you would already have seen, although i am in bronze i feel i can talk about this.   Udyr, ezreal, nautilus, caitlyn, Gnar.  so my reasoning for this is because you can have well poke and good CC at the same time. in a team fight you can easily single target people with either Udyr or Naut. on top of all that you could poke out the enemy team or zone out carries with ez cait and gnar(mini). this team i also feel would work situationally because you would have gnar for backline CC and multi target stuns and knockbacks for a good ez ult followed by multi knockup from naut. Devour would play a huge role here depending on udyr path whether it was tiger or phoenix. phoenix would be great aoe because you could multi flame, and tiger would be good for single target kills on carries.  so this post was for my idea for some good team comps i wouldnt mind seeing some more be posted whether they are viable or not.   well im glad that im noticed in that regard but as you can tell the game was a loss i have alot of improving to do before i can even consider my self good.   thank you i love how you put chess in there it really puts it more in perspective for me with that analogy. i will be sure to take all of this information to heart thank you so much.     	4
 i dont know how i feel about this..   I'd hide too   or gas   this is nothing new..   Yes, the quotes are suppose to alternate. Being married to an english school teacher and having her looking over my shoulder right now, we can tell you with certainty that you made a bad decision.   and cheeseburgers apparently.   But remeber how to box step   its SNL..why would I be surprised..   this is sad   there seems to be a lot of whoring going on lately   Single?   Looks like someone could not come up with a gift idea in time..   i have friends too and we take pictures   /r/facesinplaces    use your own body weight as resistance first and go from there...simple push ups and pull ups are a great place to start   No porn...ur a rockstar   it is      who the fuck is Macklemore?               I live in San Diego, Ca            I totally understand the whole money thing...studios tend to take advantage of pple who are new to the recording game and to be honest you could have gotten the same sound prolly for free from some recording arts student who is looking for bands to track...i recorded some awesome bands while i was in school using that method and you would be surprised how much cooler pple are when there is no money involved! Im a 26yr old audio engineer with some good vision. Id love to mix your track if you have the ability to get the session file or at least the individual tracks. I do alot of mixing at my studio at home and would love to toy around with some different stuff if youre into it. Not looking to get paid, bt if the mix comes out well, id love to be able to use it on my audio resume...let me know what you are thinking and also with your vocals being out of key, that is a relatively easy fix for me with some of the programs i use...let me know..message me back on here and we can figure it all out! My name is alex btw   I have not no..but I will definitely check them out now! You a fan?   San Diego post rock. www.soundcloud.com/thievesoftheamericandream     My post rock band just finished our first EP. Take a listen and let me know what you think! Thanks everyone and enjoy!  www.soundcloud.com/thievesoftheamericandream   hey man! glad that you got a recording done in a studio! Such a good feeling! its a good track, but it sounds like the guitars are really compressed hard, especially during the distortion parts..it sounds like it is just slammed and really sucks the life out of the guitar tracks...the vocals are also very very in front of the mix, which i guess is good in some instances but it could prolly be mixed back a bit because the singer tends to stress some of his vocals at times. other than that it sounds good and keep rocking!               This is not wtf material... :(   beth?   That is an awesome painting! I want that for my album artwork for the band!   Keep doing your thing Nate! Looks great and can only get better from here! Interested at all in doing some album artwork!?         This is old news...             Ahhhhhhhh the cuddle fish, I'm sooo sawee Kyle!   Unfortunately tho bro..justin machado took that photo of me yesterday and i went out with him and 4 other close friends as his family is good family friends from high school bc he was my teacher...so i was with someone who knows what they are doing and was giving me great advice... the broken board was my own doing...ive grown up around surfing, seen it everyday in the water while i was on a sponge and have been in the water probably more in my life than on land... so i am not charging out on big waves not knowing what i am doing...i am riding waist high white wash trying to understand the feeling and mechanics of the board under my feet before taking it to an area full of surfers...being a sponger i know how surfers view someone who doesnt know what they are doing so i am not being irresponsible by just charging out like it is no thing...having lost people to the water, i understand it is not something to be taken lightly so please do not assume you know how I am approaching this because everything I do is always very calculated..  And stop using the word Kook, its unbecoming...    Hah oh yess know god speed for sure just never seen it written like that :)    No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :)   No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :)   Yea it is all instrumental music! We want to leave it up to the listener to make what they want of it :)   Hahaha ur right bro. What was I thinking...And learning on white wash u are right, Im so in your way and complete nuisance. It's all good, i don't set foot in PB, so you can claim that for yourself..I'll take a break at wind n sea, table tops, boneyards, hell even beacons or any other break in NC over PB any day so that's all yours man..  If your worried about a "kook" stealing ur wave, don't trip. I have lived here my whole life and have been in the water for most of it just not surfing, so I know my etiquette. But I will say out of everyone I've talked to about this learning experience, you sir have been the biggest Richard of them all, so I say good day to you   If you think I'm a hipster with the pbr comment...you are way way off base my friend...i forgot tho that you came out of your moms vagina on a Steve Lis and never were a kook...I hope you never try something new again so you can always stay in top of your game bro..    Thanks brotha! I appreciate that! Take a look at the videos online and check facebook from time to time for when the album is going to come out! We are going to make it available for download for free to anyone who wants it :) thanks again man!   Its actually a handle bar mustache bt its hard to tell from the picture..freddie didnt have a handle bar mustache ... :/   A female singer definitely would add something interesting to the music! Maybe some background harmony stuff during the heavy parts would be cool! Thanks for taking a listen, glad u like it :)   Thank you soo much :) it is very heart warming to have all this support..we really hope that once the album is done we can give it to enough people where it can just start to spread around to anyone who enjoys good music and we feel that with not having vocals we appeal to a more global audience while still maintaining a humbling sound :) glad you like it tho and I am always happy to talk music with anyone! Be on the look out for the new album coming soon, check the website periodically and facebook too :) thanks again!   I appreciate that. I am sure the other guys would feel the same way if they were here right now. We try to leave a lot up to the listener and allow them to really make what they want of it. The parts that grab you are intended to do exactly that and the rest is up to the listener :) be on the look out for the new album. Once its done I will put it online for free download to anyone who wants it. I will probably put a post on reddit for it :)   Hey thanks sooo much for taking a listen and glad u like! We actually take alot of our inspiration from the bands mogwai, russian circles, minus the bear, explosions in the sky, Sigur Ros, older Yndi Halda...a lot of post rock thats for sure but to be honest, I am unfamiliar with the band you mentioned but i am going to look them up as soon as I can! Thanks again, it means a lot!   Yea but i still get more pussy than you ;)   Yeeaaahhhh boooyyyyy   Ob logic! I was surfing at river mouth in del mar today when this shit happened! Ima need to find another board to get on...my friend is planning a trip to south america next june so i said i would learn to surf for when we went so I gotta do this haha   U should play clue bc u nailed it bro   haderp!   Thanks you sooo much! It is awesome to hear someone say that! We really put in the effort to make our music an experience! Im glad you appreciate the different song feels we put out there for you to listen to! We are trying to do everything that you just conveyed in your last comment so thank you :)   	66

 first the video was made simple so everyone could understand and learn how to make an omelette  in general and am not saying that my video is the best or perfect in the world beside the main reason of the video is to help some people to learn how to cook ... friendly = i appreciate all comments and thanks for taking time writing your point of view    no problem i always welcome comments and suggestions    the omelette i was showing could be stuffed as in the video and you roll it or it can be plain, but if you talking about fritatta =( thats when you mix eggs with vegetable : to have like tart) that's something else  thank you for your comment :)   	3

Boomerang had an Australian accent in 80's Suicide Squad. I like to think that it was Zantanna who mind warped him to speak in that accent.   The Eye was one of the first cosmic entities in comics. Since the Eye is Public Domain, I consider hin in a role similar to the Living Tribunal/the Watcher in my universe. "Eye witness the Multiverse unfold into anarchy....."

       I like to think what happened was, when you were young, you heard your mom or someone else talk about your great grandfather's funeral, and the whole thing just stayed in your sub-conscious. It then later someday returned perhaps in your dream which later felt like a memory.  Or  When you were young, you were sleeping while someone was talking about the funeral. You were perhaps in the REM stage of the sleep and were dreaming exactly what was being described by that person. That way you got a first person perspective of the whole thing and now remember it as a memory.     He is holding it with his index finger. And using his other fingers to hide it. Watch the video again, but slow the speed down to 0.25. It will become clear then.    How is that personal information, explain? A number used to scam people is personal information? Which when made publicly available will "harm"  the owner of that number? Is that what you are implying?  Also, no one is shaming anyone here. We are trying to prevent such a scenario from taking place in the future.  /u/oldmonq you should post the number. Or else, what's even the point of this trend?    I don't think the mods will mind in this case. And it's not like the number is some "personal information" of the scammer. Post the number so that we can at least report it on truecaller.          You comment the best pickup line in your opinion and other redditor's reply with the best anti-pickup line to that pickup line.

 ah; well in any case, "this guy" indicates that they're not exactly buddies   the same way that we all have the ability to sense when something is wrong with a friend or family member, or when you get that feeling that something is not right....you could call it picking up on the vibes, or feeling/reading auras from people, but we all do it; just some people have honed it as a skill and can do it better, or are more aware of doing it.  He must have really really needed to pass gas, and you were just receptive enough at the moment to sense that vibe and urgency radiating from him.  It's a perfectly simple and logical explanation.    Still a funny story though.   they said it was a random guy that did it; the friend was just there with them    indigo children  first time I hear that term.  And actually, I wouldn't say so. Every human being has the potential, it's just a matter of finding out, awakening, and honing it.   Everyone has dreams occasionally which predict the future;  everyone can sense when something is wrong with a friend of family member, and so forth and so on.   Doing more than that is just a matter of learning to harness and focus your energy for a purpose.    IF we are born differently in any way, then its a genetic predisposition to be more open-minded.   I was also into it from a younger age too, like spirits, knowing when I was dreaming and being able to wake myself up and such; but I didn't awaken my potential and get actually into into it, as in more actively doing things and participating, until age 12.   that's why they typically start you so young I think (usually between 12-16); it is easier to tap into your potential before you've been weighted down by adult responsibilities.   well, like I said, really powerful.  I'm assuming the numbers were drawn out of a hat or jar or something, manually?  that may just be really good luck (or a wiccan or Magick spell for luck, as some others said she may have been in that branch/brand of, um, energy manipulation if you will). If the drawing was done electronically, then that has a much simpler explanation, as thoughts are electrical impulses.  It is not too difficult to manipulate electronics.   oh wow; yeah I would say it is.  Although, the statue itself doesn't provide protection (that would be idolatry).  Believing in it does.  So you believed your protection was compromised, opening you up to the continuation of the dreams.    I was going to say that if that's the case, if the statue kept the dreams at bay, that maybe I never had a dream quite like that because of all the religious symbols my parents had put up in my bedroom.  Then again, I'd had malicious spirits in my room, at least once, so that can't be right.     the age doesn't surprise me one bit.  One can be at the height of his or her power at that age; both those working for good and for bad.   this is exactly what I was going to say, pretty much.  I practiced "reading minds" too.  One time I freaked this guy out in theater because I knew what number he was thinking, and he was like "She closed her eyes and leaned towards me and........" so the director went into a tale about how aborigines communicate with their minds.  But yeah, in middle school, I was also good at getting my way, with words.  I could talk my way out of anything.  In high school one time, I even talked a teacher into doing an assignment for something else for me on the board, without him even knowing it.    I don't try to manipulate people anymore though; that was immature.  You can subconsciously manipulate people as well.   Like one time, back in middle school, we were doing a fund-raiser, selling candles and stuff, and several of us had approached my English teacher to buy some from us.  She said she would after our assignment.  I made sure I was the last one to speak to her/ make an impression before sitting down.  Sure enough, she called me up first.  The others were like "that's not fair; I asked first."  It's just psychology.  now, some of the things you describe sound like more than that.  I was also quite lucky, but this is more than that.   She was probably just really powerful at manipulating her energy, and she was clearly at least somewhat darkside.  I encountered people who were darkside too.  It's a good thing your mom knew to tell you to wall up your mind.  You have a very open-minded mom.  Did you ever learn any more about protecting yourself?  like how to do an aura shield or anything?  every try to learn to read minds yourself?  Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about this more.  I'm always happy to help.   (I'm 21 too! :) ) predictive dreams are normal and quite common, but reoccurring dreams are a strange thing.  I've always thought of reoccurring dreams to mean that the same exact dream repeats over and over on different occasions.  If, using your definition, you take it to mean the same family of dreams, then I've had a few.  I've had some nightmares that I had a handful of times as a child, but I am not talking about that.  The most recent reoccurring dream I've had (by your definition), was last year; on a few occasions, I dreamed about a secret upstairs to my parents' house, which is accessed through a hidden door in their bedroom closet.  (the physics of the whole thing are physically impossible for the structure, so no, it's not actually secretly there).  The first one was an epic adventure involving aliens and the end of the world and whatnot, but the other dreams I've had there were your average everyday dream that just took place there at least part of the time.  Same place, same layout, same decor.  Now, this second example is a whole different animal.  It's a reoccurring dream and a predictive (or rather, indicative, dream).  Surely you are familiar with the classic "I Love Lucy" sketch with the chocolates on a conveyor belt?  Well, that concept of an assembly line type situation, where things are moving and I am unable to do my tasks on time to keep up and it all goes to hell. I have a dream like that every time I get a stomach virus.  It occurs right before I "get sick" for the first time of the virus.  It's a slightly different scenario every time, but it's always an assembly line type of task that I can't keep up with, and it always ends with me waking up in the middle of the night to run to the bathroom.   I only have those dreams when I am getting a stomach virus, and I have them every time.    It's not that useful as a predictor as I only have the dream when It's already about to happen.      working with the angels, but for the most part demons and dark energies either don't exist to me or I just completely ignore them.  if you're not fighting dark entities, then what do you do working with the angels exactly?   Healing?  like your name says?   you say you were going through some rough stuff, so maybe it was a demon trying to take advantage of your situation, or it could, of course, just be a manifestation of your concerns into a dream.  Fighting your inner demons.   It is weird that it asked for your soul though.  Never had anything like that happen.  Probably because they know not to bother asking, lol.   One day, God beckons to you from above.  "Come with me, my loyal follower, and I will show you the great things you long for."  You find yourself in awe that, having heard your prayers, among all others, he called for you.  You answer the calling, and in a flash, find yourself in Heaven.  Angels assure you that you will go home, that your life won't end here, but they offer you to stay the day.  They give you the grand tour of all the joy and bounty of Heaven bathed in the knowledge, wisdom, and love of God's glory.    You soak it all up, and are filled with wonder, comfort, and joy.  This could one day be your new home.  You enjoy the splendor of the afternoon; come to love the transcendent way of life.  Then, the angels tell you they must close the gates.  It is time for you to go. You knew it was coming, and it's all well and good.  You want to live out your life, afterall.  It would be nice to assure others of the powerful joy that awaits, to spread the word of the love and tranquility, but the Angels tell you that you mustn't tell a soul.  Unsure of what to say when leaving heaven, you simply thank the Angels and bid them farewell.    You find yourself back on the street corner at which you were called.  The corner is the same; but, you have changed.  You carry with you knowledge of a most beautiful existence, which you had the pleasure and privilege to briefly live.  You sleep soundly in bliss.  As you awaken, and return to the weekly grind, you realize how dry and tumultuous life can be.  You long to return to heaven.  But you have duties to fulfill here.  We must all do our time.    You, knowing what joy can be, having experienced the splendor, can feel tortured by its absence.  But you at least know that one day, you will return to Heaven; maybe in a different time, a different way, a different place.  One day, you will bask in the glory again, and live in peace forever.    This kind of thing happens to me all the time.  Sometimes things just fall between thing and I find them before too long.  BUT, Sometimes things turn up again months later, in completely random places.  It's very strange   life is?  no, you mean studying abroad is. lol   logical fallacies ftw   or, to be somewhat silly for a change (as the more serious answers have already been said), maybe the seagull was hosting the spirit of the person who drowned, and was desperately looking to share it with anyone who would be receptive.  the fact that it flew off right after is suspicious...  It could also just be a vivid hallucination.  I've never even dreamed my own death in any scenario.  If a dream gets to the point that I might die, I always wake up.  So, I can't speak to that at all.   you should post some of these stories on /r/Thetruthishere , if you haven't already   I'm glad Ms. Medium was able to help you.   I'm also pleased to see that you knew your attached spirit's name.  I knew mine as well.  He's been distant the past couple years.  Actually, I think it's probably I who have been distant, but that's another matter entirely.  Most spirits are harmless (physically); your descriptions before of the basement spirit sounded rather gnarly though.  I'm glad Ms.Medium was able to come and help you assess the situation.   The camera probably won't be able to pick up on anything you might be able to see (or you might see it in the video but others don't ?  not sure how that works exactly, as I can't see them in the traditional sense myself); not sure about the audio either, as your bf could hear a man but you couldn't.    Whether or not Steve is your guardian angel, I would think he'd want you to  get stronger rather than rely on him to stand up for you.  Feel free to message me with any questions you might have in that regard, and I'll give you any advice that I can.   HELLO; THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE IN HERE; I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK OVER THE POUNDING OF THE BLOOD RUSHING IN HERE.  CAN YOU TRY TO RELAX? TAKE A BREAK?  MAYBE TAKE SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE?  AND THE TENSION? THAT CONGESTION DOESN'T HELP; YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.  YOUR BRAIN NEEDS MORE OXYGEN!   [about the topic choice] by the way, did you know that Mr.Rogers spoke to congress? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q    It is important in life to be a good neighbor.  You may not always agree with your neighbor, but he has just as much right to disagree with you.  Cutting off heads isn't going to solve anything.  If you really want to convince people that you are right, that does not come from violence.  Violence turns people away from you.  If you really believe in your cause, then people will follow you for the cause.    Words are more powerful than you can imagine.  Use words to show your neighbor why you are so passionate about your mission, and maybe they will see things your way.  Be a movement which inspires people.  If you really want to build an Islamic state, then talk, preach.  Then, maybe, some people will listen.    If you try to force your neighbor to do something, he will just find a new neighbor.   ugh, horns are arbitrary.  Red and impish is devil enough for me   Ok, sir, I have completed my inspection, and I have concluded that you are either going to have to do some serious renovations, or I will have to condemn the property.   For starters, you CANNOT have a lava pool in your basement.  It's a safety hazard, a fire hazard, and every other hazard in the book.   Also, your home is too tall.  The building code states that no structure built within 30 blocks of the beach can be over 12 blocks high....yours is 100....  Additionally, having a trapdoor outside the entrance to your house, which leads to a dungeon, is highly, highly illegalllllllllllll---------------------------------------------------------- *thud*     yes, of course.  you'd need to figure out why it is there; what it's issue is.  Not necessarily who it is, but that may go hand in hand with why it's there.    What it is would also be good to know.   How to deal with the spirit depends entirely on what it is and why its there.    Using your former home as an example:  If, for example, it's a murder victim, he or she may want to avenge the murder.  Ways to help could be to talk it down to move on, or, if communication is possible, and he or she gives the name of a killer, to bring the truth to light.  Worst case scenario, in a murder victim example, would be that their body is hidden and was never found; if they reveal the location of it, then going with an authority of some sort to exhume it and properly bury it would solve the problem.  Again, that is just a murder victim example; but, even with that one case, as you can see, there can be multiple ways to address it, depending on the specifics.  So, how, might you find out who it is and what its' unfinished business is?  I would look into the history of the house for starters.  Find out who lived there before and if anyone died in the house, or if any of the people who lived there died in suspicious circumstances.  As I said before, the spirit may or may not be related to the other, nice spirits.  Trying to identify them may help identify it.  If those searches turn up nothing unusual, then the entity may have nothing to do with the house, but you, the current inhabitants.  Like I said, it could have been a negative force keeping an eye on you and your brother as you have demonstrated ability to see and sense spirits.    That was a hypothetical example using your description of your experience at home, but the methodology is applicable to other, similar situations.  ------- Regardless, work on getting stronger, and don't provoke negative spirits, especially if you don't know what they're capable of or what they want.   ah; "devil god"; so that explains his appearance.   real-life duplication glitch; cool! worm hole termporarily opened in the space between your bed and nightstand?  I've had things disappear and come back before, but that could easily just be misplacing or someone else moving them.  I remember reading another story on here recently involving finding something and then losing its' twin in the future (so it had glitched into the past).  Maybe it glitched in from somewhere else, and will glitch away again for its real owner to find it... or maybe its' yours from the future (you like the belt so much you end up getting another when it wears down, but then it goes missing (to the past here) and then you'll find it again and think nothing of it, unless you remember this incident at that time. )  It is documented now, my friend, so if it disappears as mysteriously as it came, and that future thing happens, you'll know.  Better yet, mark it.  Mark it in some indelible unusual way.  Carve your initials inside the buckle where no one would think to look but you.    so, if, in the future, you do buy another one and it disappears, when it comes back, check for the mark.  Cheers!   yes; I was thinking the same thing about the amnesia; everything in this story is medically explainable.  she's lucky she didn't end up permanently paralyzed though.  Epidural gone wrong can do that   no problem; I will draw a couple of these as soon as I can   I just found this sub today, but there is another sub, which I also found today, /r/DrawForMe which is exactly like this one, so you may want to cross post this there as well.    Would you want these to be drawn as best as possible, or as if a 4th grader drew it?     you did a decent job; that is actually good concept art.  Just take your drawing, and the pics of the individual items, to the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist will draw it better for you.  That's what I did with mine.  (By better, I mean a better-looking Pikachu for one, and a pointier style butterfly wings on another.)  Their improvements to your concept art can be major or minor, depending on the level of detail and the style you are going for.     it's perfectly normal.   Just, ditto everything I just said here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/3008ya/dreams_of_future_events/cpoh780   well, if a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, it definitely still makes a sound; what changes is whether or not that sound is of consequence to anyone.    so whether you film yourself or not, you're still going to do whatever you're going to do.  although, subconsciously, knowing that you're filming it, your mind may exercise more control, to make you behave, or the opposite, to make you show off.     by vengeful spirit I meant something seeking violent revenge, so likely not.    An unhappy spirit, certainly.  It may also have been some other entity entirely, keeping an eye on you / keeping tabs on you because you could see the others.   Or, alternatively, this negative spirit may have a problem with the other spirits, or the house itself.  Murder victim perhaps?  victim of some sort.   yeah, like I said on the original post; it sounds like this is a spirit you can peacefully co-exist with.  Just try not to think about it, and when things happen, don't worry about it; just dismiss it, unless it's really bothering you or causing some sort of inconvenience or discomfort that must be addressed; then, just nicely ask it to stop.   This is quite common and normal.  Some people are more receptive to it than others; some people remember their dreams better than others; but, it happens to all kinds of people, all the time.  My most recent one was in January.  I've mentioned it in other comments, but basically, in the middle of a normal, random dream, I had to go to the store with my mom to return some socks.  The next morning, guess what my mom tells me we have to do?  But the socks in the dream were white.  The irl ones were black.  But so what?  Some possible explanations (there is not necessarily one right explanation; these may all be valid and true, with some applying to some cases, and others to other cases):  - overheard something in your sleep - **picked up on the vibes/ wavelengths (vocal, radio, thoughts, etc)** - self-fulfilling prophecies - etc. (those are the main three)  another, more far-fetched explanation just occurred to me; this could apply to the ones that occur with longer spans of time in between, and is a perfect illustration by what I mean by "etc."; one could speculate this forever. : maybe your future self was thinking "I wish I knew about this sooner", and that wishful thought transfers the thought energy back in time through your dreams.    Point is, who knows.  We can sit here and think of plausible theories all day, but the bold one is most often the culprit and has the most logical support.  (I can expand upon this if you like).   ah ok; yeah; I just got that impression from what your mom said couple with your incredulous wondering if you did it, lol.  I think others may have got the same impression.  this may be an episode of somnambulism, or it could be someone else (living or dead) messing with you; if so, that could almost be taken as a threat.  But if it's been a while and nothing else has come of it, I wouldn't be concerned.  Particularly, given your mom's statements, it is likely sleepwalking/sleepmoving.  you may have used scissors or a knife on the sheets in your sleep, but if you did that, then that's scary in and of itself.   Whoa, ok guys; I just happened to come back here today, browsing, and I see how small this sub is.  I used to keep a blog about my dream adventures here: http://epicdreamadventures.blogspot.com/  Now, I don't sleep enough currently to have as many adventure dreams, but I do still have interesting ones, and predictive/psychic or what have you ones as well.    I've noticed people posting the latter kind on /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix   Anyhow, let's expand, and document our dreams more.  Remember guys, dreams are our subconscious's way of making sense of things.  Sometimes they're really random and silly neuron firing that is vaguely related to the day's media and events.  Sometimes they reveal (metaphorically, like a fable) things we subconsciously picked up on but didn't realize, or things that we don't want to admit to ourselves.  In the case of predictive dreams, time-stamped documentation can help serve as proof that you did indeed dream the event before it occurred.  Lastly, a tip for remembering your dreams.   1. get enough sleep (obvious) 2. (less obvious) take notes (just an outline/ bullet points) when you first wake up, if you dont have time to write/type it out right then.  This will allow you to come back later and remember enough to tell the story.  Within a few minutes of waking, you forget most of it, but not if you take bullet point notes.  That's how I was able to do that blog so well.  I never added to or embellished anything in those dream stories.  Lots of them were great for that though; full of potential.  I can turn some of them into nice short stories if I wanted to.  Anyhow, let's get back into the dream-story-sharing; what do you say?     harmless poltergeisting  I'm skeptical of that statement.  I mean, I understand what you mean (moving stuff), but...that can escalate/ go south quickly; but, again, that depends on the nature of the spirit.  So, again, look up the history.  A friend of mine has a ghost on her property which I did not find out about (having never stayed there long enough) until like the 8th time I'd been there.  we were standing talking.  there was no one behind me, and something thunked/flicked my purse.  I felt the tap, but there was nothing there to have done it.  I expressed my surprise, and then she told me about the boy who was killed in a fire there, and who sometimes messes around in the house.   he's been around for many many years, and is clearly harmless, not a vengeful spirit.    Just make sure you look into the history, ok?  can't stress that enough.  edit: to clarify, I was getting ready to leave, and thus, I was wearing the purse (handbag) when he thunked it, which is how come I felt it.   just this I guess: https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/301jdo/ghost_hunting/cpoeitn  	41

 8, plus most of the game he was injured in. Plus several games in earlier seasons. Altogether, it adds up to about the same number of games Brady or Peyton have missed in their careers due to injury, but I see your point.   By that logic, it doesn't matter if someone was great 2 seasons ago (or last season for that matter) if they have fallen off now.   After this season, he will have 2 MVP seasons, and a Super Bowl MVP. You don't think someone with those stats should make it in the HOF?   Rodgers has already had an injury that sidelined him for most of the season and come back from it.   You're good. Most people here see your intent. I was just pointing it out for OP.   I'm sorry, but that's just not right. Banks look at intangibles. There's no way they'd trust two 18 year olds with $100,000 loan. This guy's "work history" was a retail store as a teenager. No loan officer would approve that. Like I said earlier, is it possible? Yes. Likely? Not a chance.   Dude I'm not saying it's not possible. Just that it's unlikely. This was retail, not life guarding. He would also have to have averaged 35 hours a week while in school full time, never taking sick or vacation days, never spend ANY of the money, and find a bank willing to loan a couple of 18 year olds somewhere in the order of $100,000.  Taken in its entirety, it seems unbelievable.   I don't doubt that it's not possible. But **16 years ago**, working retail as a 16 year old. Nobody would be paying $12/hour.   No don't post the yelp review here.  Now, if you didn't actually do anything that you're aware of, he likely has very little evidence (if any) that you did this. Any judge will see through this charade as an attempt to scare you off your claim of collecting your paycheck. It will be painfully obvious to everyone.   Also, did he threaten to sue you over text, letter, phone call, or voicemail? If anything besides phone call, save all the evidence for court.   Just to reiterate on that 2nd point, OP.  We were all young and dumb at some point in our lives. Unless we have been told before, we don't know not to talk to the cops and fully trust them as authority figures.  Yes, you told them everything which will be used against you in court, but at 17, me and any number of people on this sub who like to chide people for doing that probably would have done the same thing in your situation.  Eventually you'll be past this. As for now, the best thing you can do is hire a lawyer if you can afford one.   Maybe knock on the apt door and ask the guy if he's month to month. Because if he's not, he'll want to have a word with the landlord as well.   I think Johny was a little too mad for the interview.   That's what I feel is going on here. Does the dude have 1.5M met worth? Probably. But I doubt he earned it starting from purely a retail high school income and investing in housing with his other 18 year old friend to get himself started.   But this guy would have had to make that same amount nearly 16 years ago. Inflation kills a lot of that.   I don't need you to lie, buddy. But let me entertain the question: how on earth do I seem insane? I'm legitimately questioning the guy when his story doesn't add up.  If it's a lie, then he should probably stop misleading people. I'm not saying it is, only that his story is suspicious, as numerous others have pointed out here. ~~But if calling people out doesn't matter, why are you doing it to me? I mean truly, who should be the one to "shut the fuck up and move on"?~~   Yea I agree. There's just no way.  I'm trying to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, but he's making it hard.  Like if he said his grandparents gifted him $10K, and his dad was a contractor by trade (to the point he could actually learn how to rehab a house by 18), and he got his loans from a hard money lender that happened to be his uncle. Yea, then I'd believe a little more. But with this story and his refusal to answer specific questions, I'm suspicious at best.   I'm just pointing out what doesn't make sense, and since you are refusing to clarify I cannot see how it would be possible.   That's not how it works... If she turns 15 tomorrow and he turned 17 yesterday, the age difference is only 2 years and 2 days.   How off? I just don't see it unless you were earning at LEAST $12 an hour (which almost nobody would pay a teenager in retail in 1998). I mean you still had some expenses as you admitted in other posts here. You still had school, and you probably took some sick days here and there. I mean it's just a bit unrealistic when you insist that you did this all without any family help.  Also how in the world did you get a bank to loan you tens of thousands of dollars to you and your partner with almost no experience and no credit?   Assuming you were making around 7.25 an hour, which would be appropriate for a 16 year old retail job, to earn $20k, you would have to have averaged over 30 hours per week every single week, after taxes, to save that amount in 2 years. That's assuming you never spent a single penny. On top of this you were in highschool for these 2 years.  That's just not realistic.  Edit: just realized you worked in 98. At a retail job, your wage almost surely would not have been more than 6.50, (5.50 or so after taxes). Meaning you would have had to average nearly 35 hours a week with no sick days, and never spending a penny.   I'm not saying there is a law that states he can detain people. I'm saying the bartender has a moral duty to call the cops and that laws designed to prevent rape override company policy in any reasonable person.   How did you get $20K from 16 to 18?  Did you go to college?  What kind of job did you have, and can you give a rough break estimate of your earnings throughout your 20's?   You realize laws overrule "policy"?   Smoke sesh brah   My 1L Property prof JUST covered this as a hypo today. According to him, the Blue Neighbor would get an Easement by Necessity across Purple Neighbor's land.  This situation is complicated by the fact that Purple informed Blue of fencing in the gravel road area, but it seems to me that a judge will require the easement across Purple's land, and for Blue to compensate Purple for it.   See now you have a reasonable argument there. There was likely something in your contract that said they must provide you with reasonable service, which any judge would determine Sprint did not.  OP, on the other hand, he just wants out (and maybe reasonably so), but you gotta pay according to the terms of the contract.   Just FYI, you signed the contract that (I'm assuming) stated when you terminate, you are responsible for the full last month. So you are no longer bound by the contract, but are bound by that condition. I understand why you're angry, but you literally signed the contract stating you would abide by that condition.  No judge will let you out of this. It will only ruin your credit score, costing you money in the future in the form of higher interest rates if you had a higher credit score.  Just pay it.   Then it would have been on to /r/legaladvice. Man Reddit really does have everything! Dude should get his budget checked over at /r/personalfinance  while he's at it.   I'm not saying it made him fight a bad fight, only that it most likely affected him in some way. I think he would have done better if he did not have the mental aspect of nearly dying from the weight cut, and I don't see how you could argue against that.  I'm sure it was you, but whatever, deny all you want. It was minutes after my comment, deep into our comment tree when you're the only one likely to see it or with any motive to downvote. Further, you only had 1 upvote on your previous 2/3 comments, meaning if it was someone else, it's highly likely they would have downvoted me and upvoted you at the same time.   I am simply saying it is more likely that he is affected more than the average fighter based on the fact that he almost died from a weight cut. Even if it is only a mental effect, every time he cuts to 205, it's somewhere in his mind that he nearly died, likely affecting his performance even a minimal amount.  Also, you're a jerk for down voting my opinion.   Dude. At least spray paint it the same color. I had my car keyed and did that. Nobody can tell unless they're less than 5 feet away.   How are you debunking it? With what evidence? My argument is that it has a possible mental effect on DC enough to affect his performance. You cannot conclusively say DC would not have performed better at 205 without the weight cut.   I'm just saying, it's a factor.   A bottle of ketchup in 40 seconds?! Yeesh!   Unless the weight cut takes too much out of them. Remember, DC had to be hospitalized for kidney failure and almost died in the Olympics when he cut to 211 pounds. Now he wants to cut 6 MORE pounds. Yea, he's probably on a diet to help the cut, but it's just a factor to keep in mind.   If we both win out, then it still comes down to week 17 for division title, you know.   It's so funny how the other side sees it. It took me a second to even remember what you were referencing.  To me: we barely missed sealing the game by Adams' fingertips.  That's POV for you though.   So refreshing.   With my taxes, absolutely. It is a problem of our society, and we should solve it as a society.  Edit: Not to mention, the cost of what? A few port-a-potty's and a dumpster? Yes I think that is cheap enough where it shouldn't even be a controversial issue.   I think one nice act is pretty good. They are not totally responsible for all the people they feed. Are they responsible for housing the homeless as well just because they feed them?   Surely the solution would not be to provide them with bathrooms and trashcans, but instead cut off their food supply.   Third Parties ~~can never~~ are very very unlikely to win in First Past the Post systems. It's [Duverger' Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law).   Gerrymandering   More likely, flexibility.   I was just pointing out the difference between the words though.   I was not pointing out anything specific to this series of events. Only the difference between objective and subjective.   100% disagree. You never know when you could be fired, have your car stop working, family member die and need to attend the funeral, etc. That's the whole point of emergency funds. I fully believe everyone should make 6+ months of expenses a priority. I don't think he needs to sell any possessions to reach that emergency fund amount, only that any excess money go to the emergency fund before anything else, including debt or retirement.  Edit: Your point that 6 months is overkill unless you have dependents or a mortgage seems logically wrong. Why would either of those decrease the amount of emergency fund you need in time? It seems those should only effect the amount of emergency fund you have, which is already controlled for by saving 6 times monthly expenses.   Objectively reasonable belief does not mean specific to the person, only to the standard of a reasonably prudent person.  You're thinking "subjective."   Hey, just to piggyback on this post and give you some more opinions, I definitely think you need more than $1K as an emergency fund. What if you lose your job? 6 months of expenses should be the MINIMUM. I'd bet that would be at least $8K for you, if not more, depending on your expenses.   Eh.... sure.   I enjoyed 22 Jump Street far more than this sequel. HB2 had some decently funny moments, but nothing crazy. The beginning of how they got into their predicament felt too forced. And the movie just didn't capture the magic the first one had (jokes were almost too raunchy to make up for lack of plot).   SPOILER BELOW!!!               They could have just filed a lawsuit and not had to go through with the entire process. The excuse given in the movie for not filing the lawsuit was "oh the other side has powerful lawyers." People still sue Walmart. This was a textbook case of breach of contract they had and they would have easily won in court.   Yea, I've lived in the middle of Texas and now southern California my whole life. Something tells me we don't have the same definitions of "incredibly temperate."   I'm seeing it.... Yea, I'm there.   That was rude.   I don't get this.   When did he become governor of Alaska?!? Man I miss some big news sometimes.   Wait did this actually happen or are you just being funny?   At this point, can we just skip the Siver fight and have Conor fight Aldo now. Then at least Edgar can get his rematch sooner. I'd have him fight Lamas for the next shot at the same time Aldo/Conor happens.   I'm not going to say this is a good option, or that I'm recommending it, only that it IS an option:  You could always lie to her and tell her you love her and want to be with her but will break up with her unless she has an abortion. And afterwards you actually can break up with her.  Important to note: if you take this route she will likely hate you forever and fall into a deep depression. On the other hand, if you think she willfully lied to you about her taking proper birth control, you might not care.   Thanks for the info!   Ok, that makes sense. Is a borrower able to drop it if they refinance, like PMI?   It is for the life of the loan. That's why you need to refinance to get rid of it.  Edit: I think I'm confusing MIP for PMI. If so, please disregard.   You're wrong. And for a very simple reason: preventative care is cheaper than fixing a health problem.  You ask what incentive people have to stay healthy. The incentive to live longer! It would go against human instinct to let yourself get sick merely because your healthcare was free.  Back to preventative care. It is VASTLY cheaper to use healthcare to stop a disease before it happens than to heal one after it already starts. With free healthcare, you would have most of the population going to the doctor multiple times per year to stay healthy or catch health problems early. Whereas today, many Americans wait to go to the doctor until the last second because they cannot afford healthcare.  Further, people who wait until the last second for their healthcare are often using their local ER, which is substantially more expensive than a family doctor. And because they are poor and have no health insurance, the cost is passed onto tax payers.  As a country we pay more per person for healthcare than any other nation in the world, and it's not even close. And for this, we receive less services. Many thousands of Americans DIE every year directly because of a lack of access to affordable healthcare. That is not a recipe for success. Single payer is the most economical and moral solution.   For some countries, yes, it is a longer wait time, but for others they actually have shorter average wait times to see doctors than the US. I specifically remember one study that broke down wait times by service received and by country. I don't have it off the top of my head right now since I'm in the middle of studying for finals right now (ugh law school), but I will try to find the source and edit it in by tomorrow.   Cheaper per capita, longer life spans, less medical bankruptcies, shorter waits for doctors (in some countries-not all- and only for the lower four quintiles of income, since the rich will always get their healthcare in the US), not to mention much lower costs per service since they are substantially less bloated with beauracracy as insurance isn't big in most of those countries.  The biggest thing though is that the poor in those countries are much likely to receive preventative care and thus save the ER room bloat when they would otherwise go in for the flu when it's about to kill them instead of receiving a small amount of care a week earlier. This saves the govt in those countries billions every year.   Right there with you buddy. Econ major here who studied health economics under a couple PhD's while in undergrad, and it's just mind blowing how much better and cheaper those systems work.   Wait. You're saying you don't think single payer is the most economical healthcare solution?   Instead I'll leave this quotation that is on point instead. It has a source in it. Just for background, I'm a law student and virtually everyone in the community sees Chemerinsky as the premier legal scholar on Constitutional Law. Here he is talking directly about Obama enforcing the immigration order:  The president clearly and unquestionably has the authority to do this, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law. Presidents always get to decide what laws to enforce or not enforce. Chemerinsky cited the Supreme Court case United States v. Nixon, which held that the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case. The president can direct law enforcement to decline to prosecute an entire class of people  in this case, parents of U.S. citizens  without even approaching a legal gray area, he said.  Source: http://news.yahoo.com/how-congress-can-fight-obama-s-immigration-order-193627501.html   What a feast he would be!   Presidents can and have simply ordered laws not to be followed. Regardless of whether it is against their oath of office or not, nearly every president has ordered select laws not to be followed. That's exactly what Obama has done with not enforcing raids on medical marijuana dispenseries. Why no public outcry there?   Please explain how you think the Supreme Court will find the executive order unconstitutional. Nearly every president for the past 50 years has acted unilaterally on immigration and none of those have been found unconstitutional.  The bottom line is that it's completely within a president's scope to enact this type of order.  You are correct in that processing work permits do cost money. And congress could pass a budget defunding the permits. But Obama will never sign such a budget, and thus it will be congress who will be blamed for not passing a budget which could lead to another govt shutdown which the Republicans will surely bear the burden for (again).   I agree we'd have to see the order before knowing for sure. I was speaking in generalities based on what it seems the order will be. And merely costing the money to print the order is not substantive enough to be practically defunded.   How would an order telling them not to enforce the status quo require money?   You can't defund an order that requires no money. All his order would do is stop enforcing the current deportation effort.   How do you know what to dispute and what the actual codes are?   I dunno. Women are outpacing men in higher education. Continue that for another 100 years and I definitely think average pay for women will be above men.   This isn't on you, but it is extremely frustrating that not one of those sources provided the ACTUAL pay gap after controlling for position, education, experience, and hours worked. I mean why are all these authors assuring us the gap "virtually disappears" then not providing the actual gap? So frustrating.   I agree. I was being very conservative there.   Money talks. I believe at least 90% of people would choose the latter option.   Well of course. If a person doesn't agree with the taxed item, they are unlikely to indulge in it and thus won't be paying the tax, while people who do indulge will be stuck with the extra tax.   According to this compound interest calculator (http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) if you start with $38K, add $12K per year for 40 years and the market grows at 5.5% then yes you will have over $2M.   However, at average annual inflation, prices will double every 20 years (source: http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp). This means that your $2M will feel like $500K. At the safe withdrawal rate of 4%, that means you'll be living on $20K a year. That sucks. However, you can combat this by raising your contribution rate as your income increases over those 40 years. I don't have a calculator, but I imagine you could easily have $4M in the account by retirement, meaning $1M in today's money, meaning you'll live on what feels like $40K in today's money. That's realistic.   Not sure if it works anymore, but I have a POTENTIAL solution.  About 5 years ago, I set up a credit card, one of those 1 year no interest cards, with a $10K limit and bought coins from the US Treasury, then just went and deposited them at my bank. Free shipping, no fees. Bank gave me some crap, but allowed it.  Or you could buy a big expensive item such as a TV with your credit card, and just resell it as brand new on Craigslist. Yea, you'll lose about 10% but desperate times call for desperate measures.  Edit: Buy an Amazon gift card! You can buy them up to $2000 and you can sell them for probably 97% of the value. Sell on Craigslist with A TON of proof.   Look into PAYE. Depends on when you got the loans and if they are federal or private.  PAYE works by:  1) taking your salary 2) then subtracting 1.5 times the poverty line, now $17,500 3) then you pay 10% of the amount left each year (divide by 12 for monthly payment)  If your income was $30,000 for example, you would pay $104 per month MAXIMUM.  You pay the amount according to the formula for 20 years and anything after will be forgiven. Although you will be taxed on the amount forgiven as if it were income, but this is still a better deal than if you paid the whole amount.   Oh I have no idea. Was it?  I was only saying that cause I moved here a couple months ago, and the planes fly so close to the buildings where I live.   Not true. That could be charged as criminal mischief. They're creating the impression they just stole from you, which is dangerous in case anyone retaliates.   I don't know cause it hasn't come out in my area yet. :(  They did a very poor job letting everyone know that it was such a limited release. But I'll let you know what I think next weekend.   Took me a couple looks, but it says GLUE, most likely as in "I like huffing glue" by the looks of him.   This is now a realistic fear since moving to San Diego.   Sorry I have no advice but to wait out the process.  However, in the future, the best protection you can have is to use a bank account, and use a credit card attached to the account to set to auto-pay the full amount every month. In a situation like this, you would still have money to use (up to the credit limit) and almost surely not be responsible for any of the money the thief spent.   What is the breed of that dog?! It's so cute.   You need an attorney. Depending on the state you live in, he may be able to get half the house's equity or may not, also depending on what proof of him cheating you have.  Do not sign anything without an attorney. If you cannot afford to pay him half the value of the equity in the house you may be forced to sell and split the proceeds.   It's almost hilarious that a cop caught with a theft conviction will be back on the job in 30 days. Almost.   Possibly from the perp's point of view, but a prank can still be a crime. And here it appears to be.   It's so weird to watch those accident scenes where the medics are loading the victim after having seen the movie Nightcrawler.   Seriously. If that happened in the US, he'd be in federal prison regardless of how many lives he saved.   Assert dominance. Keep petting cause I'm not a little bitch and I need to show him who's boss.   Oh my. Dumb me didn't even notice your username. Cheers!   1000% on the Supreme Court point. It looks like Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsberg, and Breyer will all need to be replaced within the next presidency. 2 liberals, 1 conservative, and 1 "swing" (who is really more conservative). If Clinton was president, the Court would be composed of 6 liberals to 3 conservatives after these four current justices were replaced and that would massively change how the court rules than if we got a Republican in office, where the Court would then be composed of 7 conservatives and 2 liberals in that case.   I'm being hyperbolic but serious. In those oil towns, demand is so high for labor that fast food restaurants have to pay $13-15 per hour because otherwise those workers would just go work in the oil fields. (Source: http://www.cnbc.com/id/101767406)  The average wage with under a year experience is around $67K/year, while the average wage overall is $100K/year. (Source: http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/oil_workers/)  Yes, it is a legitimate option, but it's not very realistic for most people. If someone had no family that relied on them and no reason to stay in their current city of residence with a massive amount of debt, and wanted a little adventure in their life while simultaneously taking care of that debt, I think it's a viable option. But only you can answer that.   It's not his top priority. It took 6 years to get here.  Also, the number of issues he can handle is not some finite resource (although technically it is, realistically it is not). He has many many people working on solutions for many many issues. Why not handle immigration while it's a hot topic?   Agree. Where in her career has she shown exceptional strategy? Meanwhile, she has a proven track record in banking. While I'm all for her moving up in the party, this is more of a horizontal shift than vertical.   Listen, I'm way more in agreement with Sanders' views than Clinton's.  But here's why I'm going to vote for Clinton over Sanders in the Democratic Primary: because Sanders won't win the presidency and Clinton can and likely would against any Republican challenger.  The reality is that if Sanders went up against a Republican challenger in the general, he would probably lose. The fact is that Americans in general just aren't that liberal. Here's a chart posted in another /r/politics thread that shows how the Dems of the US are basically the Conservative party of the UK (http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2014-11-06/tax5.png). Yes it isn't a perfect representation, and is only one issue, but I think you would find that general trend to be true in many other issues here in the US.  While Clinton will do many things I will likely disagree with in her presidency, I'm thinking bigger picture. And I'd rather have Clinton in office than the ACA repealed, immigration reform stifled, marijuana legalization held off further, gay rights trampled on, and net neutrality a dream.  If Sanders (by what would be nearly a miracle) beats Hillary in the primaries, he will almost surely lose the general election, and you can say goodbye to all those issues I just listed.   I'm guessing he's including FICA, and maybe even a 401K contribution.   It is not. She need to give them 60 days written notice as soon as possible. Then file for eviction assuming no changes by then.  Also, she should give the new January tenants the courtesy of letting them know the property won't likely be ready January 1st.  	104

 What else are you supposed to do when another man looks longingly into your eyes from a kissings distance?    Not sure if anyone explained, but this is copied and pasted from an article:  The important thing to note is that theyre not suing Fox under US Law (because it would probably go nowhere and theyve probably been informed of this by the French Ambassador in Washington).  The lawsuit is most likely in French Court (which has a lower standard of proof for libel cases than US courts, and less restrained by Free Speech statutes like courts in the US are) and I also wouldnt be surprised if a similar suit had been, or will be filed in European (EU) court (Which is actually more serious and a bigger deal because that ruling wouldnt just be binding to France but to EU member states).  More than likely Foxs ability report and operate (effectively) in France is what would be effected, with broader implications in the rest of Europe which is why they were so quick to come out with that apology last weekwhich you never EVER see them do in the US even when theyve been proven patently wrong in their reporting by THEIR OWN news reporting, sometimes.  Britain and Birmingham was probably never going to suedespite Rupert Murdochs shaky relationship with the government there over the phone hacking scandal, due to similar high standards for libel suits (which is why the tabloids there put the US Tabloids to shame), and also because Murdoch has a lot of connections (read: business interests) there, but the situation is vastly different in France.

 The fact that there are lobbies dedicated to both playing as a team and playing as a singular entity would suggest the idea that the developers did mean for the concepts I'm arguing for to be the appropriate terms of playing.   There are a ton of factors to count in, seeing as it's a new game that is exponentially growing in popularity, so accounting for all current and foreseeable issues in the game is going to be near a impossible task. So referring to the mechanics of the game, such as the "w" feature would make for an unstable ground to stand on as changes everyone can safely assume that the game is going to undertake several changes in the near future. That, and the W feature is both a weapon and a tool that can be used to ally.   I do agree that temporary alliances are by all means justified as a means to overthrow someone of larger power, but you can't deny that permanent alliances, be they founded in the game, or premeditated (the $ clan comes to mind) do make for a pretty unfair and hardly enjoyable experience for the rest of us who are trying to play the way the lobby dictates we should.   That's where my original point comes back. If you want to form bonds and work as a team to overthrow larger targets, then play in the team lobby where players are expecting that kind of imbalance. Leave the free for all lobby to the people who are trying to survive by themselves by whatever means they can.      So it's just for the novelty of acquiring friends in an unlikely environment? I appreciate the kind of satisfaction you must find from that, but it can still be argued that it's immoral to purposefully team up with someone in a game lobby where players are explicitly deciding to play every man for themselves. It's the classic "my needs are greater than your needs" complex, but the satisfaction of the few "unfair" players hardly outweighs the satisfaction the players who are being cheated out of the game style their suggested.    Do you actually do this?  I don't get the chance to ask in the game, so I'll ask now.  Why don't you just play teams instead?   Go play teams. That's what it's there for. It makes the game so frustrating to be swallowed by people who just team up on you and feed each other when necessary.  Also, I can't be the only person who specifically targets players with the name "Team? = W" can I?  	4

 Hey! I was there on Friday :)     	2
 Meanwhile t[hey tell children to throw cans at shooters to protect themselves.](http://www.wjbf.com/story/27843713/students-told-to-throw-cans-at-a-shooter)          This is one of the weakest arguments I've heard. It makes no sense. The fact that there are drunk drivers has never been used as an argument to do away with laws against driving under the influence. The fact that people rape is not a case for making rape legal. What about domestic abuse? Fact is, people will abuse their spouses. Criminals don't follow laws. Should we make it legal to punch your wife in the mouth because, shoot, people are gunna do it anyway?   When I encounter someone using this type of "reasoning", all I learn about them is that they've never been intellectually challenged and likely have no idea what debate team was in high school.                                                          Much of America agrees with you. However we have a broken electoral system and a gridlocked system of center-right democrats and fourth-reich republicans. The NRA owns the republicans and many of the democrats too; the fact that we allow unregulated and unreported and virtually unrestricted financial lobbying and donating to the electoral system by groups like the NRA means that our votes, our letters, our protests are being virtually ignored. Follow groups like   http://momsdemandaction.org/  http://www.bradycampaign.org/  http://www.parentsagainstgunviolence.com/  and many more to see how many Americans are truly working to change this. I'm sure our country looks crazy as fuck from the outside but many of us just want to know we can send our children to kindergarten and get them back alive with no bullet holes. And personally as a mom, I don't feel that way at ALL. My own parents are older and they discuss our entire family leaving the US. It's absurd.    And yet everything they are saying about this family in articles is that they are a "gun family" - shooting ranges, guns with them on every outing. Scary to think these *are* experienced gun folks. They're just so comfortable with the weapons that they have a false sense of safety. It's like carrying a vial of ebola virus around. Ticking time bomb that could kill any of us.    Fairly sure the three older siblings who witnessed it will end up cluing him in. All four kids witnessed the shooting. From the articles I've read it sounds like there are guns everywhere in this family. Hoping law enforcement at the very least removes the guns from the home, since they clearly put the children at risk.    It's abhorrent. As a parent in the US, I am uncomfortable sending my child anywhere without a drastic change to our lack of gun regulation. We lose an average of 82 citizens a day to gun violence.   [Each year, more than 30,000 Americans die in gun suicides, homicides, and unintentional shootings as a result of the ready availability, and accessibility, of specific classes of firearms.

Now I'm making the same expression Plaid Jimmy is.       http://www.motherjones.com/files/pubhealth%2011_0.png      Grounsell said there will be no charges in the accidental shooting.  **"accidental"**  We fail these dead children every time we don't charge a parent.          Vetri Ferman said the victims were Nicole Hill, Stone's ex-wife; Patricia Flick, Hill's sister; Flick's husband, Aaron; the Flicks' 14-year-old daughter, and Hill's mother and grandmother.  ...  Another neighbor, Ashley Deane, heard the same noises, likening them to a car or truck hitting a house.  She said she heard what sounded like four gunshots and could hear children screaming for their mother.  Deane said she could hear Stone telling the children that they had to leave. She said she looked out the front window and could see him with the children, who were in their pajamas.  Deane said Stone looked at her and said, "She's hurt," referring to his ex-wife. Stone and the children got in a car and sped off.  This kind of shit should not be happening to children.  From another article,  ["They've been fighting for years, real bad," a neighbor, Michele Brewster, told the Allentown Morning Call. "He's been tormenting her. She's gone to the police, and she has told everybody, 'He's going to kill me.'''](http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-pennsylvania-manhunt-20141216-story.html)  It will be interesting to see the fallout from this case, to learn how someone with a record of threatening to kill his ex-wife and mother of his daughters was able to access a firearm. Accountability.       Exactly. No charges filed, most likely. And often, no guns removed from the home! Fucking absurd. KKK/NRA   People with guns.          The only thing causing shootings is the presence of guns and the inevitable combustion with human emotion.    No, that's why we have registration, inspection and insurance for cars, right?

Doctors should lobby for gun control like Australia has, for starters. We are all paying for this scourge.    We need electronic tracking of ammo, not just sales.      Police said the boy may have mistaken the gun for a toy.  * Like police only in reverse!       Upon searching for the gun, it could not be located. Officers also searched for a shell casing from the fired weapon, but again turned up empty handed.  No charges have been filed.  Un. Fucking. Believable.             **Between January 2009 and July 2014, there were at least 110 mass shootings in the U.S. Not all of them make headlinesand the story the data tells is different from the one that mass media would have you expect.**  Using FBI data and media reports, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of every identifiable mass shooting between January 2009 - July 2014. There were at least 110 mass shootings.  **The Washington gun lobby claims that areas where gun-carrying is restricted - gun-free zones - cause mass violence rather than reduce it.**  Our analysis show this is not the case: an overwhelming majority of mass shootings take place in private homes where gun carrying is unrestricted, and less than one in six incidents took place in a so-called gun-free zone.  **Perpetrators of mass shootings are not the people you expect.** The press often focuses on the mental health of the shooters, but our analysis shows that only 10% of perpetrators exhibited signs of mental illness that were reported to a doctor or other authority figure prior to the incident.  **Perpetrators of mass shootings are generally older than perpetrators of gun violence in the U.S. as a whole.**  Whereas FBI data shows that the median age of gun murderers in the U.S. is 26, the median age of perpetrators of mass shootings was 34.  **Domestic violence is a factor in the majority of mass shootings.**  In 57% of incidents, the shooter killed a current or former partner or family member.  **51% of mass shooting victims are women.**  In contrast to gun violence generally, perpetrators of mass shootings disproportionately target women. Whereas only 15% of total gun homicide victims are women, 51% of mass shooting victims are women.  **High-capacity magazines put the mass in mass shooting.**  When perpetrators used high-capacity magazines or assault weapons likely equipped with them, they shot 159% more people resulting in 65% more deaths.             An analysis of mass shootings, defined as those in which at least four people were killed with a gun, conducted from January 2009 to July 2014 by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety found that of 110 mass shootings, at least 63 of the cases, 57 percent, were related to family or domestic violence. In at least 20 incidents, the shooter had a prior domestic violence charge.  Dee Price Childers, a volunteer with the West Virginia Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a division of Everytown for Gun Safety, released a statement on the Monongalia shootings. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of yesterdays mass shooting in Monongalia County, she said.  This terrible tragedy is yet another reminder of just how easy it is for convicted felons to get their hands on deadly weapons thanks to background check loopholes in federal and state law  and just how often domestic violence turns into deadly gun violence.              The condo is owned by 46-year-old Jon Holzwarth. An internet search revealed he is in the internet security and firearms businesses.  No one answered at Holzwarth's door where a sign reads: "We don't dial 9-1-1" with a metal cutout of a pistol dangling below.  There were also emblems about guns on his Jeep.          * Recognizing the role that assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines played, the authors said Lanza's easy access to them "cannot be ignored as a critical factor in this tragedy." The ready availability of assault weapons in the U.S. is an important public health issue, they said. * Lanza's "severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems" were combined with a preoccupation with violence. With access to deadly weapons, this "proved a recipe for mass murder," the report concludes. * The report questions whether Lanza's race and privileged socio-economic status impacted how he was treated. "Is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision-making of white, affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority?" the report asks.

 I've never hired a prostitute but I'm working on a short story which requires it so here we are.   My assumption is that maby sex workers would be bored and do a bad job hiding it or they'd try too hard to be pleasant. Which of these is more accurate (if either of them is true to life at all.)     That was actually The Island of Dr. Moreau. Also supposedly he got some police transmissions and such during takes and in the middle of a line would say things "there's a robbery at Woolworth's."  http://thefilmfacts.blogspot.com/2012/12/calling-all-cars-marlon-brando-in.html  For Apocalypse Now, he's clearly adlibing. In the outtakes he says things like "I can't make up any more dialogue for today."       Eh, it's not that cool. It really has to stretch for some of the shots.    Those British forts look really cool. Yeah, I guess it would be creepy to spend the night in them, but that's true of any abandoned isolated building.

For example, I read this article about Clerks: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239  And I must admit that even though I'd seen the movie before, I'd never thought about it the way he put it. I'd also never heard anyone call the movie on that before either. Do you have any examples that come to mind?          He can play timid very well. See "The King of Marvin Gardens."

[Hmmmmm...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ArcmLYVKs)      Is this some of that rape culture I've been hearing so much about?    I think this is a really great cover for Gerald's Game: http://officialmattroberts.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/geralds-game-cover.jpg  This rerelease one strikes me as kind of silly: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sph-E-jJmL4/UORwT_63WBI/AAAAAAAAGKQ/PDBadysEhcI/s1600/GeraldsGame.jpg  Also, yeah, that pink cover for To Kill a Mockingbird is a bit of an eyesore.    Boy, I don't think Ford was the lynch pin for Blade Runner in the slightest. Really, I think Deckard is the least compelling part of that movie.    Okay, I am in talks with the [White with Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl4kgoeSbNo) director to adapt a short story. It's tentatively entitled "Please God" but that may change.  [Here's the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY)  TL:DW: a guy wakes up in a room strapped to a bed. Someone comes in and tortures him purportedly because he was having an affair with the wrong person's wife but actually because this is the torturer's fetish and the tortured person is indulging him because he thought this would be the ultimate act of love.   So, which of these approaches would you recommend:   A. Prolonged POV shots (Not a gopro, I think those tend to shake too much to properly simulate vision) to make it more immersive.   B. With conventional multiple camera setups because then people pay less attention to how the video is being shot and more to the story and acting.   Thank you for your time.

I meant if every major let's player was hit with third party content matches or copyright strikes.    Oh dear. I just realized I still kinda dislike Pearjack for that time she narced on Fluttershy. I am clearly a bit fucked in the head.    I understand this is borderline out of the question unless I guess some company thought they could knock out the big names and replace them with their own to make the games essentially long ads. I guess it's more about whether you really need that footage of gameplay to really know how good a game is.   Personally speaking I've never really just rushed out and bought a game on the basis of a Let's Play video versus a written review or a trailer, but this isn't about me.     I ask because it remains probably my favorite single fanwork even though I'm a little too young for the kind of games it's an homage to. I think it balanced the storytelling and gameplay just right and its rudimentary graphics are much more evocative than they reasonably should be.   But has the fandom at large just sort of lost interest?   Hey! Watch it Pinkie! He ruined causality to get into a relationship with Twi, so don't you try to edge in on that!   I guess there's the Up series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Series.    Gonna make a Thneed out of it?    I have a manuscript I kind of set aside for awhile which I took a look at again and now feel might have potential, but I want a second opinion and to get the thing in shape to show to a potential agent.   I know it will probably cost me over a thousand dollars to do this, but that's not really a problem.    You know what's really funny about that? A year or two ago, Wong said in the "Writer's Workshop" (a subforum for writers to pitch ideas to each other) that if Cracked ever became the kind of page that had to run that kind of clickbait at the bottom of articles, he'd quit writing for it.    You know why the pop culture stuff is so much better? Because it's just taken from TvTropes.   Seriously, I used to write for the site and I saw people blatantly group together lists taken from Tropes and WMG pages.    Any man who must say "I am the director" is no director.       British hearts don't melt, or there'd be nothing left.    This might just be a related question, but isn't there a relatively big Brony community in Russia?    If I lived in Finland, I'd view everything as cancer just to make life interesting.    Taken from username Cookie Monster's comment on an article about the movie:   "One more thing that make Star Wars work so well, that only just occur to me for first time, is that it not try and shoehorn in romance. Luke and Han both flirt with Leia, but story never about one of them getting girl. Leaving that storyline to Empire Strikes Back work well, because second installment not have to do as much world-building and have room for romantic subplot. But it also make Leia something other than prize for hero to get at end of movie. When she and Han do get together, they on equal footing, because first movie already establish her as independent person.

They're either explicitly made to be unintelligent and loose or repressed and boring, particularly the ones in Seduction by Design.  I believe I've seen a couple of hers fail the Bechdel test, even.   Have you ever found this with some other female authors?     But he's the only one making a big point of not saluting.

I didn't mean they'd necessarily ship two background characters, just that there'd be a same sex couple. Probably one made specifically for the episode.    So really badly animated and pixelated in the sheets?    This OC is all wrong. That mane is supposed to be red!   I was bullshitting with my brother about the show while we were doing an errand and we mentioned the whole "Lyra/Bon Bon" thing. He wondered if you could show like a same sex couple in the show. Not something like it's central to the episode and it becomes a very special episode which would bore the shit out of kids, but they're just there and maybe they've adopted a kid or something.   On that note, since there are a lot of conservative parents out there that watch the show, are there any controversies like that or was it only the Brony thing that kicked up any dust?    I saw [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/V0BaBCw.jpg) and I became curious if there has been someone who made a good faith attempt at what she argues. I know it's a joke, but maybe an eccentric rich person or particularly hardline activist might have taken the notion at face value.      Has anyone ever donated land to Native American tribes?    You introduce a neat notion like that into my life and then crush it instantly? Why are you taking me on this emotional roller coaster?!   That's not very nice.

It's about a repetitive format because that is reassuring and gives people's lives constancy and making obvious jokes because people will think "Hey, I thought of a joke like that! That means if this channel is funny, I am funny!"     And now you're doing it.       I wouldn't have it any other way.       I meant the MLP movies. Yeah, the Transformers movie is pretty good.

Of course the only person that understands what I'm talking about isn't the top-rated commenter.    So now clickbait=any article on a popular subject?     I saw Sarah and heard her many times before I believed she could be real. She hid in shadows, edges, and in corners of my vision. I would hear walking quietly and cautiously around the house at night--breathing, crawling through the attic, everywhere. Sometimes she would shriek or weep for some time. Everytime I saw her, she was carrying some kind of stuffed animal with her. She was here when I moved into the house. Shell be here as long as the house stands, perhaps longer.   I know why Sarahs here. I learned about it by reading up on my home at local history at the library. What I read in this old newspapers... well, I had thought I experienced a bad childhood, but compared to hers mine was idyllic. Her father would be revealed by a postmortem to have suffered from a brain tumor at the time when he went mad. His madness drove her mother to leave the home, and he seemed to direct his rage towards his own body and her. She was not allowed to leave the home for her last few days as he became obsessed with a butcher knife. He apparently found many occasions to use it on her and himself. .   Her life ended in something Ive seen reenacted many times now. On the last night, holding her stuffed bear to give her courage, she walked out into the hallway, a cut on the back of her hand opening as she squeezed it. She went to ask her father to let her leave the house. He must have gotten up and killed her then, because when this part of the haunting happens, she falls on the floor and begins to bleed out.   I first saw her... reliving this experience that I finally believed she was real. When I saw her walk in to the living room that night, she was not a mere ghost of light or smoke. She was as physical as I was, though I still dont understand how that was possible. She was looking off to my left as she begged her father to let her leave even though I didnt see any sign he was present.   I let this happen to her once. The second time she came down the hallway to beg the empty air to let her leave. I yelled at her to run but she didnt seem to acknowledge me. When she stopped her plea, which meant her death was imminent. I ran over, picked her up without thinking about the implications of what it meant, and carried her away.  I was expecting what I did to mean nothing: That she would just bleed and die in my arms again. But apparently, somehow, moving the body she had beyond reason from the room prevented her from dying again. I put her down in the bathroom and she was looking up at me, still alright   I can hardly claim to be her savior, though. Shes still dead. A short time after I carried out of the living room, she still faded away and resumed the same pattern of haunting the house, even the part involving walking into the living room to ask her father to let her leave, as if nothing had happened. Well, almost.   Just an hour ago, she came into the living room again, looking the same as always and holding a stuffed animal the same as every other time. She looked like she was strangling it. I had moved the chair to where her father must have had his, and she looked me in the eyes as she approached.    Hello, Sarah, I said as I got up.    No. Please, no, Sarah begged as I approached.   Theres no one but me who has to see her. Theres almost no one who would believe this pretty little girl is still on this plane of existence. No wonder I didnt believe she was real.   How could I be so lucky?      What's weird is that Elsa isn't really growing up in that image. She'd abandoning adult responsibilities.

Seriously, I have a weird thing where if there's a specific bit of food like a melon or whatever that a character is invested in, I hate to see it damaged. It bugged me in MLP when that happened to AJ's apple and when it happened to Gromit's marrow.    Why? Bears really aren't what comes to mind looking at this.          I get it: Larry David sucks as a comedian and as an actor. Thanks for the daily reminders, Reddit.       Christopher Plummer was *really* hoping no one would notice.                This is a rather roundabout way for Criterion to announce they're going to release Greed.    Shame that Mansfield wasn't able to make a viral "Ten Minutes of Sitting at a Table with Sophia Loren" video and expose the objectification she experienced during that encounter.

Do you still drool over how gorgeous this shot is: http://youtu.be/3jLaf5qj8cs?t=2m5s  Or have you seen the movie so much by this point that you can't really get into it any more?    I know a lot of people warn the younger folk to leave this subreddit and things like that, but I genuinely enjoy reading comments and such on here. It's the subreddit where I don't feel a need to posture as a more normal and clever person than I am, where I can let it slip that I'm totally kissless, yadda yadda.     I wonder why don't you see this more often.      Because I mostly read positive stories in terms of filmmakers making financially successful films against all odds, I was curious if anyone has a particularly bad story of a movie just ruining everything for the people that made it.   All I have is one my professor told me about that he had a friend who shot a movie on 35 MM independently. When it was finished, the friend wasn't willing to show the movie to anyone else, never mind seeking distribution for it.     I know his horror stuff is generally considered at best hit-and-miss, but I just listened to an interview he did with Kevin Pollak's Chat Show and if nothing else, the story behind the making of Cabin Fever is fascinating. I imagine if he wrote out and edited his thoughts it could very well be one of the most fascinating stories in the history of movie making, or at least in the top half.           Probably Breaking Bad. But that's because the only other shows I've watched in their entirety are The Wire and Oz. I'm not a completist.    I knew someone who complained about Taxi Driver because she said the soundtrack reminded her of The Dark Crystal. The fact Taxi Driver came first by like a decade didn't matter to her.       I was watching a Let's Play video of Ethan Carter and was really stunned by the graphical quality of the portion on the bridge over the river. While I saw some things that in hindsight were very well-designed such as A Link to the Past and that sort of thing, it never really leapt out at me as beautiful-looking or what not.   I didn't ever play it as a child, but I was surprised when I looked back on it at how well the graphics of The Curse of Monkey Island held up when I tried them a little while ago. I also liked some of the stuff in King's Quest V more than I would have expected for how primitive it is and for how difficult some of the gameplay can be.       There's cute, and then there's just showing off.    I was watching Robocop (80s version) for the first time. There's the character of Bob Morton who is presented as this complete sleaze, a really lame guy when he tells Murphy "You are gonna be a bad motherfucker!" and all that, but towards the end, I kind of found myself liking him anyway even though he was clearly supposed to be unlikable and usually I wouldn't like a character of that type. It was odd.   Ever felt that?    http://listverse.com/2014/11/05/10-weirdly-famous-people/  Just skip over #9. It's a really lame entry, but the rest are pretty weird.    But that he noticed this particular reason to kill Krazy 8 is really unlikely unless Walt was practically an X-man.    I and a guy in Las Vegas are in preproduction on a short based on this story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY (with permission from the author)  The TL:DW of it is that the story is about a guy being tortured because he had sex with the wrong guy's wife.   Now, if it were your job to shoot this, would you take:    Option A: Shoot it conventionally with closeups, fairly conventional shot lengths, etc.   Option B: POV shots from the victim's perspective, ideally only two of them if possible.   I imagine I don't need to go into any details about the pros and cons of each option.    It's all that chemistry training. You shatter enough test tubes and stuff you can eyeball shattered things and notice missing shards.  ...  Okay, yeah, it's a stretch that he noticed this.    Impressionist Twilight.          This is just a knockoff of "Yoga Hoosiers."          "Not even close."   Not that you'd know it from actually watching him.       Since you've hit more than 150% of your goal, do you have any stretch goals in mind?    I'm still a fan of their comedy style, but while I was watching their track for The Dark Knight, I honestly decided about a quarter way through to just turn theirs off and just watch the movie. There are flaws to be found in the movie, but I believe it's well enough made that even the jokey nitpicks aren't very entertaining.       Pretty easy when you give the cat that slow-motion handicap.   	162

In Canada (atleast in Calgary) you're obligated to shovel the side walk by your house even if it's covered in 5 feet of cold ass snow. Instead of chilling with cocoa my dad and I would be busting our asses clearing that.   You forgot the coca extract for the Aztec chocolate. And the ritual part where the priest rips your beating heart out of your chest                          	52
 Yeah, the difference in controllers were because of different [regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System.2FSuper_Famicom)   Actually, it's "R" and "ZR", not "Z1".  But still no R1 either.   With the strength of 5 gorillas!   No it isn't, but Miracle Whip is.  Next question.   If it was a Buffalo Wilds Wings commercial then they forgot to make the game go into overtime.   All that technology, but they can't put arm rests on the seats?   The only flaw in your argument is that the top and bottom of the stall are open to release the gasses you speak of.  Therefore, the crack is not necessary.   So who else wanted to click on the OK button?   So why did the Wii's price inflate by $35 since launch, but the PS3 deflated by $30 when they were lanched 2 days apart from each other?   Ohio State does that.   That's why Harry and Lloyd drove across the country in Dumb and Dumber.  Much cheaper.   I like to think of Jesus as little baby Jesus.   At first I thought it was just a fat co worker going to get some food.  Then I later learned of the real danger I was actually in.   And I got mad when my brothers messed up a box that the N64 game was kept in.   There could be anything in the mystery box.  It could even be a boat!  You know how much we've wanted one of those!   The Big Lebowski, actually twice.  Dude - "I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off."  And again the Dude - "I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?        Thanks, I'll try there!         Oh sure George Costanza, always leave on a high note!   Would you like some gum to make you feel better?   I have the copier room to duck off to in my office.  If people are in there I just act like I'm looking for something that printed, then seemed baffled when my paper didn't print for some reason.   I loved Burn After Reading.  But several of my friends watched it and just said it was dumb and won't give it another watch through.  Because I think this is a movie that needs to be seen more than once in order to get everything.   I love this movie too!  Even my brother who doesn't care for Star Wars gave it a watch and he enjoyed it too.      Wait a second.  How did you take a picture of the chair full of clothes if you are asleep?   I am guessing he just painted those games.  But I don't think he said for sure.   In the original post he states that they are actually all old sports games and they printed off labels of the games you see.  Otherwise this would be tragic to waste that many copies of a good game.   I always thought loading bars were to let you know how much time you had to drink until the game was ready to play?   I think guys standards go down with age.  This therefore makes the attractive girls looks that much better in perspective.   I think so.  Maybe someone should combine the two movies and see what happens with no sight or hearing.   Some others I can think of would be: Clerks 1 and 2, BASEketball, Ghostbusters, Tremors (only the first one), Big Lebowski, See no Evil, Hear no Evil, UHF, American History X   This works until they are digging through dumpsters for bottles and half the trash ends up outside of the dumpster by the time they are done.   So you've seen the movie even though it hasn't been released yet?  How is this possible?   I hate to say it, but I kinda agree with you.   Nope, not Brandon. So you can cross that name off your list of possibilities.      This is how I imagine it would be for me to try to get a decent picture of something while on the road.   I was just kidding when i worded it that way.   I'm not sure I can justify $4,000 just for karma on here.      A little anti-aliasing would help out his tie.      Am I the only person who actually kept my games in the boxes they came in?      Did he finally get arrested by the cop and is now sitting in jail?   I'd say it's a springboard from Portal 2.   Ha, thanks for the approval!      The question is, does he do this every morning too?         Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestar_Runner_Characters#The_Poopsmith) who you're talking about?   I'd say more like overly attached wife in 25 years.   I think it's the fact that as you grow up you actually expand your horizons.   That would seem like a simple choice.  The PS2 will play any PS1 games for you.  So why not save $10.   Well, you didn't want to leave a surface uncovered in case that was the one area you needed to place a portal.      Hope you brought an umbrella.  Otherwise the rain will get you all wet when you get out of the lake.   My name is Voit, dumbass.   Tommy Pickles?  Oh wait, wrong show.   And with the small trophy presentation have the Karate Kid music "You're the BEST aroooouuuund" playing!   I'm not sure if you spelled BLEEEUUUUUGHRRGHUUUUGUUHBL  correctly.   My dad is the janitor at my local high school.  For some reason he seems to be the favorite employee for almost all of the students.  He usually dones't say much and almost never smiles at people.  I ask others what makes my dad so likable, but they don't really have an answer.  But whatever it is, it seems to be working.   And so would your little sister.   Really?  	67
 I still think Mr. Green is behind everything. Maybe he killed his wife or maybe she really did commit suicide, Nicole doesn't give much detail about the wife, and consequentially whatever motives Mr.Green might have for killing her. However, either way it would be easy to find a motive for him killing all those high school girls. Plus he would have the strength, influence, and access to the school to pull off something like multiple murders of students at the school. As for Nicole missing, Mr.Green knows she is looking into the murders quite a bit, is somewhat estranged from her father who does happen to be an ex-cop, and she looks up to himself as an uncle. This would be the perfect opportunity to not only get rid of a possible future liability, but to also fulfill the the last letter of his wife's name. Most likely he completed the "ritual", for lack of a better term, at his house when she came over for tea. It sure doesn't seem like the authorities questioned him very well. I would say press harder on Mr.Green, he may be holding her for some reason, at the very least I believe he knows more than he is leading on. Good luck and I hope you find your daughter sir.  	1

 Thank you! You are very helpful sir. Will take look at that and add it if it works.   Wait, in next version I will make 1x1, 2x2, 3x3. Hope it will help you.   Widget updates only once in 30 minutes (not to drain battery), so slowly disappearing, would be hard to do but will take that into mind.   Sorry, it needs 4.0 as below that there is a real mess with accessing/reading calendar events and for sure will have some problems - so I decided not to do it.   Seen, read, and that is awesome to hear that it seriously helps people.  I would say "enjoy app" but you certainly are.   No, it works on all 4.0. Somebody else have same issue - try reboot phone (yes, I know it is weird).   It is already available to download with sizes - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy!   It is already available to download - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy!  About colors... wait and I will come back with some awesome customization.   It is already available to download - 2x2 or 3x3. Enjoy!    Zmniejszyem w aktualnej (1.9) wersji - 2x2 albo 3x3.   In few day I will post a version with such features and customization of them. So stay tuned.   That's a lot of text - I'll save it somewhere to read it on phone when on the bus or something.   Customization is coming, but Probably (at least in first update) outer ring won't be - only calendar colors, maybe background.  About tapping - working on it. Probably you would be happy.    Sorry for copypasta but I would have to wrote it too many times today:  "Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local google play servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones."     Maybe... Who knows, I have to take a rest after correcting all bugs. Most likely I will just give a presentation at local (Warsaw) GDG meeting - if yes I will try to record it to share it.   Sorry to say, it is closed to devs (at least I don't a way to make it for Gear). Maybe Sony Smartwatch or Pebble.   Thanks, corrected it (I uploaded without noticing it) and now we have to wait till google play updates.   Sorry for copypasta mate but too many of you and I didn't slept in last 30h. It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it.   Thanks! Haven't seen it but looks very interesting. Would do my best to make it work.   For now there is a list of 10 of them, and choosing at random - would be in 2.0 version - matter of 2-3 days.   You wouldn't believe how my calendar lately became full of events... mainly test ones, but hey! People looking at your homescreen would know that!   Sorry for copypasta mate but too many of you and I didn't slept in last 30h.  1 - It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it.      There was a discussion in other comments, I have removed it, in 1.9 version (should be rolling out).   Damn, I didn't know it is there... Fixing it. Thanks.   Sorry for copypasta but I would have to wrote it too many times: "Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones."   All credits with layout goes to Dawid Cielak, I just said that there need to be a ring with colors.   1) Yes it is a problem, probably I will go with making borders around each event, and smaller event will be on top. Not ideal but almost close to it. 2)Color sync is on its way. Title/description would be hard, and I don't have ready answer to that.   Make sure that in calendar that you choose there is some events in next 12 hours - add events before adding clock, as it updates only once in 30 min.   1 - It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it. 2. Will do, thx, I saw that but has forgotten. 3. Will change - in next versions there would be normal activity as there will be more options to set - customization!   It is known (to me) bug - apart for you nobody found it. So ssssshhh... *they don't know*.  [Serious] I'm working on it.   Sorry for copypasta but it is post up: "Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones."   Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones.   I have to do some mindstorming with friends/myself and see what is the best way to do so two buttons, or one configurable, we will see.   You should feel lucky - there is already uploaded update (version 1.9) with 2x2 and 3x3 widgets. You should be able to download it in 1-2hours.  	34

 The way I see it he thinks Mexico is dangerous because of gangs and corruption. Whether true or not this is a governmental issue not a race issue. He is willing to say many nice things about Mexican people so it's not like he doesn't like them just because they are Mexican.  	1
 Founder of a really shitty social networking site   I still haven't seen anything on the London Riots, I would love to see a film from both the viewpoint of a Rioter   A Policeman.   If you haven't seen it yet, check out ["Hitler: The rise of Evil"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346293/) with Hiter being played by one of my favourite actors, Robert Carlyle. It follows Hitler from childhood right up to the early stages of WW2.   Thats fantastic  	4
 Ensure made my teeth turn all dark and stained and then when I complained about it she said they were simply rotting due to my condition.  Went to my dentist, nope, they're just stained, and they were pissed off the dietitian hadn't said anything about possible staining.  Oh, and she tried to push me to 3,000 calories through the tube. I would have to be hooked up to it for *20 hours* at that amount. Not only did she want to make me hate myself, she wanted to take any form of a life I had at that point.  	1
 Done :)   Video: http://youtu.be/05fggqZoVFU  Fundly link: http://fundly.com/windows-surface-pro-3  (Fingers crossed that this works! Lots of love, reddit!)   "You have violated my religious rights."  That is fucking absurd and everyone's reaction should be "that's fucking absurd."   I did not know this. Thank you.   I've never had any luck getting my phone to act as a wifi hotspot (but then again I'm not that tech savvy).   Nothing that is noticeable enough to come to mind. It does seem to hog the connection though, rendering tablets and other devices struggling to reliably connect.   Good point and I think you're right about that. I was primarily referring to travel where I stay with family and friends (I don't do much hotel traveling).   Yeah that was intense.   I have one on all TVs and am considering getting one for travel. They are pretty much an integral part of how I access my digital media: Netflix, HBOGo, Google Play Store, Google Music, YouTube, multiplayer games, Photos, etc. You can also mirror any Android device.  It's a luxury in the sense that it's not necessary or anything, but that can be said about most things we buy. Chromecasts are affordable and pretty awesome.  For $15? Go for it.   Hot cop is best cop.   I think that's the entire point here... if the first people to get here can't claim any right to the land, how can the European settlers?   O_O   Sweet. Let's turn Georgia into a mecca for marijuana and pass a joint all the way to the bank.   I don't think it's a stretch to compare social mobility in Western countries. America doesn't exist in a bubble.   He said it was supporting evidence, not sufficient evidence to prove it. Minor but important distinction.   I don't think I've ever seen the colored "2 days left" feature before.   That getting an indictment is easy if the prosecutor wants one.   Would diving through the wave even remotely work? It was fairly narrow.      This is my first experience with the actual hive mind. That was today, right?    I'm not basing this just on the President. I'm basing it also on *the Republican-led committees*. All *seven*. Not everything bad that happens is the result of ill intentions. Sometimes shit happens and mistakes are made. All evidence in this matter indicates that's exactly what happened here.  You're basing your position on your own assumptions, and that's it.   No they weren't. All an executive order is is a directive from the CEO (the President) to his employees (executive branch government employees). Nothing nefarious.  On the immigration issue, I'm not certain but I bet he's exercising prosecutorial discretion to tell U.S. Attorneys to stand down on certain deportations. And prosecutorial discretion is not a radical concept either.  Edit: For the downvoter...  An [Executive Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) apparently is not what you think it is.   Totally nothing to see here folks!   You forgot your source: the Republican-led committee.  And again, why are you assuming the worst motive? Everything you wanted to be true about this conspiracy has failed to materialize. So why can't you accept the fact that you might also be wrong on this as well?  Is it because you've made up your mind and want to attack the President, facts be damned?   Yes, they do. When a government employee does something in their official capacity, they are generally held to whatever government standard is applicable.  And it has nothing to do with a chain of command to me as a taxpayer. It has to do with the government being required to follow certain rules.  Short of security concerns, the government generally cannot prevent the press from reporting on its activities. That may (or may not) be applicable here.  But the fact that they are government employees is extremely relevant.   Conflicting reports don't mean you have to sit on your hands and not make an assessment about what happened. That's what they did. No conspiracy. Get. Over. It.  And I'm relying on Republican-led committee reports. You are the one who refuses to change your mind in light of a massive amount of evidence suggesting you should.   Or they were just making their best assessment at the time given the information available.  Look, y'all have beaten this Benghazi horse to death and found nothing to support your crazy conspiracy theories. At this point, why insist on assuming the worst possible motive? Seven committee investigations now strongly suggest doing so is unreasonable.   I agree he's talking tough, but I'm skeptical whether he will follow through.  And Congress is undoubtedly more powerful than the President legislatively but that doesn't mean Congress should legislate in bad faith or that the President is powerless. If they try shenanigans (such as tacking a law to refund Obamacare onto a bill to fund the government) he needs to call their bluff.   Did you even read the article? The committee found that there were conflicting intelligence reports about the cause of the attack.   No matter how many times Benghazi is proven to not have been a scandal, you'll never let it go, will you?  Too much invested in it, I suppose.   While true, you will always run up against things like the First Amendment when dealing with the government.  They are customers, but they're also government employees.   So when you said we elect people based solely on merit, you meant "but only in the last few decades"? Doesn't seem as lofty with that qualifier (particularly because the same can be said with regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.)   As a liberal Democrat, I agree. Defense always loses.  Obama needs to respond with force. Start pounding the GOP in the media NOW and don't stop. Call their bluff and stand firm: your bad-faith legislation will be veto'd and you will shut the federal government down.   Isn't that the point? NOT to act like the psycho murderer?   You probably could have received the same deal, but you wouldn't have known to request it. One of the primary advantages of hiring an attorney is that you are hiring someone who is very familiar with the system and how to navigate it.   "Augusta was recognized in an annual survey by the Center for Digital Government, a California-based national research and advisory institute on information technology policies and best practices."      How on earth can you make such a statement based off one anonymous internet post?  You went from zero to drama queen...   You don't think gender plays a role in who we elect as President? Forty-four consecutive males is not statistically likely if the contests are truly blind to gender as you suggest.   Civil law judges are considered less powerful than common law judges. The roots of the French civil law system include a reaction to the powerful judges prior to the French Revolution who protected the aristocracy.  Importantly, civil judges generally cannot invalidate legislation. This alone makes common law judges much more powerful.   Is it what I'm thinking of? Overgrown and looking like something out of Walking Dead?   The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.  Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.  I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.  I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.  As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.  Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.  Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.  I love it here, and can back that up quite easily.   Do you mind being specific (as to "a lot to complain about" and "doesn't compare to many other cities this size")?  The tone of this post and your original one are quite different. If you agree about Augusta being an objectively nice place to live, why would you pity someone who is moving here?      Try Auben Realty for housing. They are local and do a great job.  For live music, Sky City will likely be your venue. Whiskey Bar, Stillwater, Craft   Vine, and Bee's Knees are a few of the great bars downtown (off the top of my head).  As for touristy stuff, there's the canal and the river. I personally love all things canal but you're arriving in the winter so it won't really be accessible for a few months.   OP, don't listen to folks like this. Augusta has a large melancholy band of pessimists that poop on everything about Augusta.  The area is objectively nice: good climate, good economy, cheap standard of living, access to outdoor activities, plenty of restaurants, etc.  Plus we just built the first new nuclear reactors in the country and are now the home of the U.S. Army's Cyber Command (fun tech development).  Welcome and I hope you enjoy our city!   If it's a jobs program, let's call it what it is.   I pretty much agree with your entire analysis but question where the line is. First Amendment freedom of speech is a political and legal right, and it should be.  Private freedom of speech can't be political or legal, or you quickly run into enforcement problems with the First Amendment.  So is it social pressure? That's seem to be all that it can be. And that is almost by definition lacking in consensus. But if there is consensus, like: Black people are worse than white people simply because they are black, can't a position win?  We value the free market of ideas *in search of the truth*. If it leads us to that truth, why tolerate the falsehood?   I disagree. The will of the people - as a whole - is best expressed during a Presidential election because everyone gets to vote for the candidates. There are 435 House races and 33/34 Senate races during each midterm election; it is hard to determine whether voters in those races were voting for or against any person other than those in each race (such as the President).  The recent election was certainly a Republican win. But it did not represent the will of the people as far as the President's policies are concerned nearly as well as the 2012 election did.    Freedom of Speech, as an idea, ... almost certainly covers any kind of institutional or mob-based attacks against speech  Source? At least in the United States, it refers almost exclusively to government attacks against speech.  Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech? Wouldn't that then be a violation of my First Amendment rights if the government stifles my speech to protect the speech of another?    Freedom of speech is a concept which can be extended to anyone trying to suppress speech.  Is it though? At least in America, it almost exclusively refers to the First Amendment version, i.e., no *government* interference.  I'm not really aware of any generally accepted concept of free speech that holds everyone should be allowed to say anything without repercussions from private individuals.  (Same edit from another post in this thread) Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech? Wouldn't that then be a violation of my First Amendment rights if the government stifles my speech to protect the speech of another?   Adding my anecdotal experience: smoked on and off for 15 years and have been smoke free for 3 thanks to e-cigs (don't smoke those either).   The veto power doesn't make him a king. But it does represent something of a People's Veto in the sense that the President is the only federal elected official who is accountable to every U.S. citizen.  Congress can't really claim to represent the will of the country like the President can.   The mortgage modification process is a joke in its entirety. The shenanigans aren't limited to Ocwen.   Didn't he basically ignore the multiplier notice though? I don't think Uber fleeced him, he just didn't pay attention.   Fairly certain I've ridden a dirt bike there. Weird/awesome place.   The President is also the only one in the federal government essentially elected by the entire country.   67? No way.   That's like saying if you are pro-Second Amendment, you are pro-forcing-people-to-become-gun-makers. In reality, there will likely *never* be a shortage of doctors or gun makers to that extent as long as a functioning society exists (because of market forces).  Edit: Another and perhaps better example would be attorneys. We guarantee due process of law, so if there is ever a shortage of attorneys, I guess we'd have to force people to go to law school.   OP is gay. Probably not friendzoned.   *LITraly   For the way I use Keep for work, this will actually change so much. No longer will reminders be an everyone or no one thing.   I feel like I'm from the future.   Story?   Nice try, NSA.   I said both are acceptable, which the article does imply ("some writers"). Either way, if enough people use it (e.g., ain't), it's correct.   ? They ruled it constitutional *as a tax*.   Both are [acceptable](http://www.grammarbook.com/numbers/numbers.asp) (Rule 11).   This problem is a lot like losing your contacts because you lost your phone: easily and completely avoidable.   I understand the sentiment but please don't lose patience with *supporters* of marriage equality. They only have to keep beating this dead horse because a good many people still continue to fight the advancement of civil rights.   Unisys      And with (1) you get to blame government red tape/growth.   the only reason Augusta even matters.  Hold up now. Ft. Gordon (pre-NSA/Cyber Command), SRS, Plant Vogtle, and the Augusta National might disagree. And James Brown.   I get all excited when I receive an actual letter from someone I personally know. These days they're more often than not "Thank You" cards but I still like 'em.   No, that doesn't help at all.  The comment you replied to has been deleted. What were you referring to here:  I am defending the Constitution of the United States of America and the fact that it sets forth requirements for voters. Im sorry you dont like the Constitution.     Ran across this last night and thought it was kinda interesting.      Where is this in the Constitution?   The U.S. Army is basing its Cyber Command in Augusta. Cool tech shit is happening. Ex., Unisys just announced a 700-person IT call center.   /r/Augusta   [Brett Lee Clark](http://www.brettleeclark.com) does an excellent job. Not sure about cost though.   Until most businesses publish a contact email address *and* monitor it daily, the fax will have a place.   So is it finally happening? Are batteries improving?   Students or student teachers?   I apparently like Kentucky.   Why have the camera app on the home row on a Moto X?   I like this idea.   How many light years away is this though? We are looking into the past.   SCOTUS here we come... how could they deny cert now?   Is this the first circuit split?   The county clerks likely took an oath to uphold the U.S. and state constitutions so if any particular clerk wanted to issue licenses, they probably could.   The only real salient point is jurisdiction. A federal district judge in one state doesn't have jurisdiction over any other state.  Federal appellate judges have jurisdiction over multiple states, and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all states.   Why not just move to another country where taxes don't exist? Somalia might be a good choice.  Or do you enjoy that violence funded peace and security provided by the U.S. military via tax dollars too much?   A sizeable percentage of Americans actually probably would, though.   But the savings will accrue to the private landlord by way of a tax exemption. It's a direct diversion of taxpayer money to a private company.  If you're for privatization, fine. But private, nonprofit companies should pay taxes.   Be prepared. I've been practicing for 7 years and still get nervous (and older attorneys all tell me the same thing). Use your nerves as a weapon against being unprepared. You can stutter and fumble as long as you are prepared.  Other than that - practice. It simply comes with doing it over and over again.   If there's one vote that shows that voters had no idea what they were doing (with regard to this particular vote), it's:  **Georgia Referendum 1 - College Tax Exempt: 73% yes; 27% no**  What ideology supports extending state tax breaks to private companies? Certainly not the conservative one.   I think these are rare throughout the entire country. The Wikipedia entry states the first North American diverging diamond opened in June 2009.  Neat. Can't wait to try it out.   Dressage... haven't heard that term since November 2012.   Yep.  Hold on, everyone. Augusta 2020 will look a lot different than Augusta 2010.   Same here. Loyal since the start, and try to persuade others to use it. Very fine example of crowd-sourcing.   Not just his.   A realization that hardens every attorney.   /u/Stricker2054 essentially said:  Hydraulic pressure is hard to beat if hydraulic pressure exists at a level to make it hard to beat.  Edit: You may be trying to figure out if it is subtle or not - in which case I just might be unobservant.   I think this is what is called a difference of opinion.   Maybe Book Exchange on Bobby Jones (if they're still open).   Wow, the sentence is a very subtle tautology. Great example of saying something without saying anything.   Beetlejuice!   This makes me very happy for some reason.   Yes, I think they are real people in Columbia County (a post lists their names but I'm not going to link to it).  It's creepy to me because of the heavily implied "order" to vote for Republicans if you live in Columbia County. Also that the county is some sort of monolithic voting block.   I know at least one other person who doesn't support the minimum wage being increased to $10.10 because then they would be making minimum wage, and I honestly just don't get the mentality.  Do you want people to barely make enough money to live just so you make more than someone?   Man ain't that the truth.      GA here. "Punch buggy, no punch backs" always and forever.   Government intervention (likely by way of higher taxes on businesses and high earners) seems inevitable with automation.  Society will crumble if a few hundred people own all the robots and don't have to pay anyone.   There's a quarry off Riverwatch near I-20.   Quarry?   Tell the bigots to put their principles over money and ditch the iPhone. Then watch how many don't.    Will update post in ten years.  I've calendared this. Better fucking deliver, OP.   I know you're joking but serious question: Did Hitler ever serve in any armed forces (and in a combat role)?  In other words, did Hitler fight for his country?   My reply is that I prefer shitting and fucking in privacy. There are plenty of things that we want to be kept private for completely valid reasons.  	121
 Aww, the author is pissed because Reddit never links his stuff.   I immediately thought of Anchorman. Thank you for the happy thoughts.   These aren't the comments you're looking for.   Something I whipped together in Gimp a number of years back.  It still makes me smile.  http://imgur.com/TeQVp?full   I'm not saying it applies to the OP, but his post spawned this rage induced loathing.  I apologize for being angry on the Internet.

Hollywood took a cool idea and screwed it up the ass.  Very disappointing.   I tried to upvote you, but reddit just gave me this error:         Or you could just get in touch with the guys over at Jone's Big Ass Wine Glass Rental.   CHRISTOPHER ROBIN!!   I could use a little virtual affirmation. Validate me Reddit!   My only point is more attention would be given to it, not that it would magically be cured in two days.  I was agreeing with the principle behind it.   Sad, but true.  Our priorities in this world are fucked up...  :-/  EDIT: Never  mind, the downvotes of Reddit have spoken. The priorities of the world are completely in order.   "This" needs to die a horrible slow meme death...   Is a man in a yellow wig and Hooter's outfit still queer?  Is the man on the bicycle checking out the narwal or the Hooter guy's ass?  So many questions...   So would this beam/laser have to be directed into the eyes to be effective?

 Sorry but I don't think it would work. Think of the group Pussy Riot out of Russia. I hear that on news outlets regularly and the anchors say it without hesitation.      Meh. Probably a 4. Two days ago I was laid off a month shy of my 2 year anniversary with the company and Im pretty deeply in debt from medical bills. BUT I have a wonderful husband with a solid job that can briefly support us while I find another job.   Lol that is pretty weird, but hey whatever works!! I'm up for giving it a try. Trying on jeans and standing in front of the mirror are two things that I do from time to time and they work in a really unfortunate way.  The night I posted this my husband was working late and I did miss him, so maybe there's some truth to that. I'll let him know it's his fault ASAP.   You're right, one little slip up is not going to make me lose all my progress. In the past I always overreated to things like this in the past and gave up. I'm working on that.    Thank you, that's great advice!! I actually did spend some time on the living room floor doing double sit ups and push ups to feel better about it. I also logged it like you said, and it turns out it didn't negatively impact my day nearly as bad as I feared. I guess I just overreated. Tomorrow is a new day!   That makes so much sense, thank you for the advice! I'm definitely the type of person to go down the road and get a treat at the gas station if I remove everything from the house.   I'm having the hardest time with cravings after eating well all day. I've been logging everything I eat and following my macros on MFP. Today at lunch I even got a free chocolate chip cookie the size of my hand, and I resisted eating it and ate only my planned meal.  Later in the afternoon I started to break down and went to find the cookie where I left it. Luckily my coworker threw it away, preventing me from eating it. But as soon as I got home from work, the hunt began. I found some peanut butter chocolate leftover from Christmas and even ate some chocolate sprinkles out of desperation. All the while reading articles online about how to overcome sugar and carb addictions. I didn't put the candy down, I finished every bite while reading about portion control and overcoming cravings.  I'm afraid of logging what I just did to find out how much I threw off my day. It would have been my best day this week, but I completely screwed it up. What can I do to control and overcome these intense cravings?   Sorry for the late reply I tried to figure out how to find players on the website and I couldn't. Also I'm still very new to reddit and I have no idea how to PM but feel free to inbox me!!   I joined Chris   Heidi Powell ' s diet bet that official begins today, Jan 5th. You bet $30 that you can lose 4% of your body weight in 30 days. All the winners split the pot.  If anyone is participating I'd love to follow you on the website throughout the month!   This is actually exactly what I'm needing right now. No judgement, just support. Someone who knows how this feels.   Fonts. Fucking fonts    "The best way to get over someone old is to get under someone new!" No. Just...no. Deal with your shit, learn something from it, and try again later.   The day my best friend told me he was moving out of our house, I wish I would have talked him out of it. He killed himself in his new apartment leas than a month later. Turned out he planned it pretty far in advance but I feel like I could have saved his life if I had tried harder to make him stay.   Louisiana accents are never right.  True Blood is like nails on a fucking chalk board in terms of bad accents, and north Louisiana looks nothing like that.    Constantly pointing out how much he hated drama, couldn't stand liars, and absolutely hated cheaters. I was young and stupid, he was older and hot so I believed him. He turned out to be all of that and so much worse. Cheating, lying, drug abuse, etc.  I've learned that if someone has to constantly point out how upstanding their character is, the exact opposite is most likely the truth. Good character speaks for itself and doesn't need constant verbal reinforcement.   	16

After the really unsatisfying initial release, this is a huge treat.

But how did Eva Longoria even manage to find this one? Is she gonna be a producer on the next Continental film?    sINCE dc STANDS FOR dAMAGE cONTROL WE nOW know thatthe line up for the capy capy DC big bad PG-13 movie will be  Captain Kangaroo  Will "What did my son tweet this time?"

Hope this clarifies it for you guys. I saw everyone loosing their shit, but it didn't seem like anyone knew so I used my powers of vast comic book jknowledge to enlgihten you about who is going to play what in the new slip N' Slide movie.                                        adubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba  BOOM!  dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbaBOOM!dubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubbadubba                                                            Why would anyone want this film dedicated to them?  why did they keep doing the same "I'm about to walk out of the room oh shit i made a noise" trick 12 times?  So this baby stayed in the cabinet all night and part of the day and NEVER made a sound? Does no one go to bathrooms in bus stations? I've been to bathrooms in bus stations and it's like a urine donation center where they pay 5 dollars for a half gallon of your pee.   If Michael Myers house is curse why did someone sell it to a new family? Who are these people? Why do they keep a shit broke down car on the lawn? Do they want it to look like a halloween house? The dad said he doesn't like halloween.  Why is the mom so naive? Like her kid keeps running away from her. Can't she see that this kid is a lost cause? He probably wants to get offed.   What does the annoying blonde kid everyone hated have to do with Michael Myers? He's not blood releated. They don't make mention of this shit other than saying that he gets nightmares. But the baby is related to Michael Myers. What the fuck is this mythology?  What did the legion of the tipped hat do to get Michael Myers to have a kid? Did someone jerk off Michael Myers? Is Michael Myers a horny guy? Because he doesn't give any signs of it.   Why does the legion of the tipped hat seem in cahootz with Michael Myers, but at the end Mr. Myers kills them? What was the point of them anyways? They were fufilling some half assed made up prophecy that i'm still not sure what the goal was, but they don't make sense.  What's the green goo? This addition made no sense. Why is there green goo? There's one insert shot of a bunch of letters. Is this Green Goo concentrated letters? Did scientists discover the alphabet is real? Why has this not been shared with the world? People would love to see real life letters. Sesame Street would be so cool.  Why is Michael Myers so fucking overpowered? I get he's a cereal killer, but this guy has fucking transportation power, but he can only walk. This makes no sense. How did he get these powers? Isn't Michael Myers just some large ass idiot with a high pain tolerance and a killer streak? Why is this not enough? Why does he need to be Halloween Goku?   Why is Paul Rudd in this movie? I don't get his presence. He puts these family idiots in more peril second only to the main lady who's just a danger to herself. What's so important about the teenage kid? He's annoying. Let him go.  Why is this called the curse of michael myers? Michael Myers is just a dumb killing idiot machine. The curse is by the cult of the tipped hat. What does this have to do with ancient letters? Those letters never appear again after they are mentioned.   Why even bother making number 6 if you don't have a script? This shit made no sense. Why does the lady not just drive till she runs out of gas back to town? Why did she stop at the bus station?                      I tried everything to get him to watch anything other than the 8 or 9 Marvel movies. I tried breaking his arms, I tried showing him other movies where I edited the Marvel logo in to trick him into thinking that MArvel produces Orson Wells and Carol Reed movies, I even tried to take him to a hypnotherapist to get him to see that Marvel movies aren't the best thing ever made. It turns out my son is leaving with my DVD of Batttman Vs Superman. Should I be worried? He said he wants to fornicate passionatly with the DVD and that there's nothing wrong with a relationship between a DVD and himself.   My son has also decided to sexually identify as a DVD player and I told him you can't do that because it's all about imax and blu ray 8k you'd be behind the times and I'd have to disown you can't you idenify as a blu ray player at the least or a pc and he said no because he likes consols better and I said I have to disown you son. I don't know what to do. Is Battman captain of the Marvel team? I just can't figure a way to get to my son fifi.      Why are there no subtitles for Eddie Redmayne. He speaks like he's trying not to get caught pissing off in church.  Does NO ONE live in Chicago? I get the whole "we got alien CGI artists who can fix this to hide our presence" but during that whole dogfight apparently only three people live in the city.   Why bees? How did this not get established in the prolouge?  Why is Eddie Abraxis so careful to not kill other human beings sometimes but sends his goons to kill three guys just ramblin' around a Chicago bridge? This dudes track record seems inconsistent.   Why did Queen Kunis know about the telescope, exact make and model of the one stolen from the house in the beginning, was being sold on ebay? Her mom didn't tell her this stuff, or at least it's not established.   Why did Channing Tatum break character when Mila Kunis offered to dress his wound with a tampon?   Why is Mila Kunis in this movie? Why does everyone look like they are from Farscape? Is this a Farscape movie?  Why does Mila Kunis' cousin keep saying "Only English?" Does he know he's in a movie? Are CGI subtitles expensive?   Why is there a romantic comedy in the middle of a space opera? I feel like Tim Gunn would feel these clash and would be poking at this movie saying "MAKE IT WORK."  How did Channing Tatum Master Chief that ship shirtless, in space, and without a suit? Only Master Chief can travel in a slipspace rupture outside of a ship.         Best prequel to Insidious possible. Was great to learn Lin Shaye's origin as a evangelical fighting against the Knights in Satan's Service. The camera work was also pretty awesome. Lots of movement, not a static shot in the whole movie.    Why does this guy make 3 mustache jokes within the first six minutes of the movie? Is this his thing? Is the mustache Mortdecai?           What are these levels for creatures? Why mention that they have levels if you're not going to mention them again?  Why did Ben Barnes love interest admit everything villainous she's doing to Barnes' face and the dude didn't go, "Wait wut you're spying on us?"  Why did Jeff Bridges sound like he had fallen and had not been able to get up for such a long time?  If Ben Barnes is a witch why doesn't he have cool powers like everyone else? Is he a big dud witch?   Why did Antje Traute sound like she was phonetically reading her lines off a cue card? I know she can speak fluently.  Why was Ben Barnes dad such a push over and what happened to the pig catching Barnes was supposed to do? They're in a small fenced area, how hard is it to catch one?  Does that big Ogre man have like super fast legs because he moves slow as fuck but he manages to find these dudes where ever they are in no time?  What's the deal with Pendle mountain? Is it a mountain? It doesn't seem like anyone has trouble finding Mother Malkin's hideout. It doesn't even seem like it takes long to get there at all? Can Pendle Mountain really be a mountain or a hill?  Why is [Marco Beltrami's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDhvQzcSes) better than anything in Seventh Son?  Why does Dijon Honeysue seem so overpowered and smart for the first hour and a half, but then turns into a big dolt in the final fight?   Why did Malkin think there was going to be a sequel?  EDIT: Since making this post I have some additional questions.  Why is this not a Marvel movie?   Why does Mother Malkin need that gumball crackerjack toy neckless when she and her crew are already ridiculously over powered?  Jeff Bridges has one week to train Ben Barnes, but this dude Barnes seems like he's pretty much a boss with fighting shit? What's the point of training?   Why did JEff Bridges keep a demonic knight in his house if he knew that that shit would be dangerous?  Why is this movie so geographically fucked? I mean it looks like this shit has vast expanses between shit, but they seem to get everywhere really quickly? Do these dudes got nike j's or some shit?  And on the journey, they got one week, but it seems like they go past one week? Why one week? Mother Malkin seems like did a fine job without one week to fuck up shit? Why is Jeff Bridges so bad at his job?  What is Mother Malkin's skill set? Why does she have some sort of power to do interior decorating? Where do you get that power with all that shit?      	197
 Gt Jade Sueta   Not unless you are on the same xbox. That fits up to four players.   You can get a three month sub. 20 bucks. Besides, you need a lot of people for hunger games, and you can't play it w/ out a map to play on. So to play hunger games on Xbox, you have to be famous on YouTube or something anyway   You can only play with people on a different xbox than you if you have a membership.   However, you can play in a world with someone if they are on the same xbox as you (split screen)   I'll be on in a few minutes. I have to use my kinect, since I can't find my regular headset, so I might sound weird. Gt: jade sueta   Hmm. I only have about 60'friends but I'll try the internet thing in the morning. Ps. How do you reset your internet? I'm an idiot.  Edit: I now only have 46 friends and I reset my internet connection, it still doesn't work..   Amen   What do mean "max to about 50" (sorry, I know nothing about anything)   Not that it matters or anything, but I'm a girl:)   GT jade sueta   Like storyline. It takes a while to play through. ( I think )   I have seen two library's, and spider spawners in front of a stronghold, but never a spawner in a stronghold.   I'm on mobile, but if you go on YouTube and look up stampy's lovely world, click on one of the videos. He build a bunch of different things every episode and they are pretty awesome.   I might be free tomorrow I'll help ya then.   Let's plays are always fun. Especially with 2 people. Like stampylongnose and Iballisticsquid are my favorite mine craft you tubers. They are really funny, and kid friendly, too.    Going into sixth grade or seventh? (Middle school starts in seventh grade where I live), and I'm also going into middle school this year.   GT: Jade Sueta. You can add me I'm too lazy.   Aww I just had to get off. I'll be back on in a few days though!   Am I too late? :D   Whenever I try to play with someone, it tells me to log in. But then it loads for a while and says " you have lost your connection to EA nation." Even when I first enter the game and press start, the first thing that pops up at the bottom is "you have lost connection to EA nation," has anyone else had this problem?   That would be awesome? What's your gamertag?   Xbox.   Yes sorry I forgot to clarify!    Does anyone go on this subreddit anymore? I'm looking for people to skate with, since none of my friends have this game. GT: Jade Sueta.    Wow. I'm glad you never got an abortion. I wish you and your children the best.   Do you regret it? We're you ever considering abortion?   Yes.    If only there was a solution to being called mainstream.......   The list is the same as everyone I have asked. Ever.   Interesting. What's your favorite drink then?   If I were to go to England, and do my best accent, would you be able to tell I was from America?    favorite song?   Favorite color? Coffee or Tea?  Favorite food? Would you rather cut off your leg or cut of your dominant arm.   Sorry, I had to go. Try to be on tomorrow. I'll have a mic then.   Oh haha I should have figured. "Shane" anigans. I'll try to get on for a while.   My GT is Jade Sueta.   Will you be on in 3 hours by any chance?   Photograph. Or maybe Don't. Or Runaway.    I think the option for more than 8 players is ridiculous. It would lag so bad, even with good internet connection.    Well, my step mom keeps calling him ed sheerian and she already said "no listening to Ed sheerian when your family is talking to you." But I have no idea who Ed Sheerian is so I'm just gonna listen to Ed Sheeran instead.   I'm not really obsessed with him as a person. All I really know about him is he is a twenty-three year old singer from England.   Yes, actually. When P!nk's Truth About Love came out, I would listen to it more than a normal person would. But still, it was not to the same extent that this album's obsession has caused.   My family is starting to get mad at me for not paying attention to them. I just love his new album so much I feel I HAVE to listen to it.   Actually, this really isn't the Stampy we know and love. We love the child friendly, upbeat, joyous Stampy that never curses.   If you don't like it don't watch it. Simple as that.   Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.   My cousins are 8, 4, and 6 I think. There about 7 other people in the theater so it was nice except a kid kept kicking the back of my seat( I don't even know why they were there the entire theater was empty almost) I think they liked it. The four year old kept shouting( IM TIRED! IS IT OVER YET??) which I kinda wanted to say myself. I only liked it because the robots cute.   The robot was really cute, but it felt like the movie was over in five minutes. It was going really slow, then a bunch of action for like 20 seconds, then it being slow again. I spent about 1 hour watching pieces of metal forming a spaceship in the air.       To be happy and do what you want with your life. Don't waste your life doing things for other people, because at the end of the day, it's only you. Yolo. Don't waste it.   Guns.    I don't have skype.    Oh, I do to!  I think I'm gonna go to bed,  batman! I'll talk to you tomorrow night I guess.   I don't really care to be a comedian, but my lifetime goal is to be an actress. I am so excited to enter 7th grade this year so I can join Drama!    Black ops 2 is my favorite call of duty game. Minecraft is my favorite arcade game. Halo reach is my favorite Halo game.  I also recommend Skate 3 and Naughty Bear!    Probably my obsession with humor. Whenever I hear someone laugh I want to make them laugh more and find out the joke and everything about it. I love making people laugh, so here's a joke!    Why was the baby strawberry sad? His parents were in a jam!    Okay, that was a bad one, but I need some time!    Yes! I feel like I have to go play xbox and find a way to politely excuse myself from the people that created me. And that's great that nothing has happened from the energy drinks. Just be careful!    My underwear. Accidental wedgies are the worst.   I would kill to be in your spot right now. I love talking to people over the internet, but it is totally different in real life. Except for family and best friends, I would be down to live as  a bat! Have you ever gotten ill  because of the amount of energy drinks you drink? Or has it ever affected you?   Look up Nigahiga's YouTube video "Dear Ryan, the chicken or the egg". I think the chicken came first.   This is actually REALLY interesting incase you didn't know. I would love to know more, but the problem is I don't know what to ask!  Do you ever get lonely since you have little social contact?   I concur! That's about where I am :) and I'm assuming you turned out fine :D I'm obsessed with books, which I wouldn't really consider geeky   What kind of kid were you in middle school   What time do you normally go to sleep in the morning/ wake up at night?   Where are you most ticklish?   Coke or Pepsi?   Well can't you  reverse it by doing the same thing with your new schedule so it will flip again? Then you won't need sleeping pills or anything. Just a thought!    I wanted people to know I was a girl when I had my old xbox live account. I just kinda kept with it.  	68

 I've never heard of that before. Perhaps I'll look into it.    I have IBS-C, and I get really bad cramps and when I "go" it's just awful. I spent a lot of days in the hospital as a kid because I would get so backed up and impacted. I, too, have described the pain like giving birth. In fact, I often joke that child birth should be a breeze for me considering I've been dealing with this pain all my life.   The fact that you have black stool is a bit concerning. It could be something as simple as something in your diet, but it could indicate something serious if there is blood in your stool. You could have an irritable bowel disorder such as Crohn's.   You should definitely see a doctor, particularly a gastroenterologist. I know it can be embarrassing and scary - I used to have the same feelings. I would always lie to my primary doctor about my bowel troubles because I didn't want to deal with it. This led to a shitty (ha, pun not intended...) childhood - I didn't go to sleepovers, hang out with friends much, or really date anyone because of my problems. I kept myself sheltered. However, with some support, I finally buckled down and finally saw a specialist. Mentally, I feel so much better knowing I have a diagnoses - someone affirmed that I wasn't just making my stomach issues up. Physically, I feel better because I'm having less flares, and now I have more control over my life since I'm not always having bowel issues.   So, yeah, definitely recommend going to a doctor. Hopefully /r/IBS will give you the support you need.   I wish you well :)   ...and I put the coat on her!   That's what I thought... Highly frowned upon at least.    Wow, thank you very much. I am trying to be more proactive, and I refuse to give up this time. I have started a migraine log and I'm trying to be as thorough as possible. Thanks again for your input. I'll try searching for other (and hopefully better) doctors.    I went to a doctor about a month after my concussion, and she told me my headaches were from taking too much medicine and not from the accident. She refused to put me on anything. I was only taking Advil a couple times of week, if that .   He didn't offer any free samples, just told me to try my mom's first. It was so weird. My husband about lost it when he said pregnancy was a treatment lol.   This guy is supposed to be a migraine specialist. People gave him good reviews on HealthGrade, but he just seemed a bit whacky to me.  I must admit that I was not very prepared for the appointment. I randomly decided to make this appointment one day, and when I called they said "oh, we had a cancellation so we can get you in tomorrow morning!" which means I had less than 24 hours to prepare. I'll definitely be more prepared next time.   Thank you so much for your input.    This was the first time I've ever seen this neurologist. I haven't had much treatment in the past - I've only ever been prescribed two types of preventatives and the Relpax.   And no, I've never thought about that option before... What exactly is a neuropsychologist?    I've lived in Kentucky my whole life, I don't know how to properly pronounce Louisville, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.    I have an INFJ personality type, which is supposedly less than 1% of the population.    [Yoo-hoo, big summer blowout](http://youtu.be/lpzvS0ATxB4)  Btw, I am extremely ashamed this is the first thing that came to my mind.    Fack - Eminem. I like Eminem, but this is quite possibly one of the most ridiculous songs to ever be recorded.   [Listen if you dare](http://youtu.be/CU6AQIuf-go). Extremely NSFW.    I tried changing my password to GameofThrones but the error told me it contains too many dead characters.    Damn. Now I wish I would've sent him one of our Marauder's Map wedding invites. Needless to say I'm so jealous! Congratulations!!!!   The lyrics for "By the Way" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers are "con job, boot strap." The first time I heard the song it sounded like he said "Cunt job, boob cat."    It's never stated for sure who that's supposed to be. However, if you google search Professor Aurora Sinstra this picture shows up. Additionally, according to Harry Potter Wikipedia, Sinistra has dark skin. It seems a lot of people believe it's her.    Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth.   Edit: also, Heath Ledger as the Joker.    Sarah Jessica Parker - Horse. Also see "equestrian."  	18
 ok you need rocksalt in that shotgun or something made of solid iron. also get some holy water and some exorcisms and maybe the winchesters!  	1
 Freakylinks.   Yes, he just kept him around for his savagery.   A painting contractor was speaking with a woman about a job. In the first room, she said she would like a pale blue. The contractor wrote this down and went to the window, opened it, and yelled out "GREEN SIDE UP!" In the second room, she told the painter she would like it painted in a soft yellow. He wrote this on his pad, walked to the window, opened it, and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady was somewhat curious but she said nothing. In the third room, she said she would like it painted a warm rose color. The painter wrote this down, walked to the window, opened it and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady then asked him, "Why do you keep yelling 'green side up'?" "I'm sorry," came the reply. "But I have a crew of blondes laying sod across the street."   Not all of his supporters were branded with the mark either, Greyback for example.   Sentient.. you keep using this word, I do not think it means what you think it means.  They cannot talk, and sentient means you are aware that you are alive. (are dementors alive?)   Picture a wasp nest for dementors. There is almost a pheromone of fear that is sent out that attracts them all that they would seek to feed on.   I used to have a white rat. Very cunning creatures they are.   The lion knows what I'm talking about.   Not all of us.   I will start with the Wizenagamot, (OotP, Fudge) when it's spelled Wizengamot. (wIzen-gamot) If I'm not mistaken.   I can think of a few, I want to hear yours.   Curious that question.   Perhaps she drank enough to sate the circumstances until her death?  One needs an hour per dose, and maybe Barty Sr. procured enough to last a few days until she died?  That would be horrible drinking nothing but PP for days.   That's funny, not seen that before.  Happy cake day /u/jmg83.   Well, that would be up to the Wizengamot to decide, right?   Veritaserum is not allowed in wizard courts because it can be fooled if the recipient truly believes what they are saying. Same reason polygraphs are not admittable evidence in muggle court, they can be fooled.      I took the pottermore quiz three times. Two Ravenclaw, and one Slytherin. I'm comfy where I am.   Edit to your previous comment:  Yea, they sent Dawlish after Augusta, LOL. Big mistake there.   Augusta: Where's Neville?  Harry: He's fighting.  Augusta: Naturally, I must join him.  I also missed the battle of the astronomy tower in HBP. That could have been so exciting.   I KNOW! That was the first big battle we got to see, and damn if it wasn't glorious! Neville deserved so much more respect and screen time.   No, Neville probably made the most progress throughout book 5, and he was a badass at the BotM, I wish we could have gotten to see it all.  "Dubbledore!"      Maggie Smith- given, Richard Harris- RIP, and I'm going on a limb here and say Emma Thompson. I've always loved her as an actress, and she was the perfect Trelawney.  Evanna Lynch for honorable mention.   Naked Gun 2 1/2.   -Gambondore  FTFY   Or the extra 15 it took you to reply?   Dag nabbit!    Albus Dumbledore explains that it is unwise to make a horcrux from a living thing (Nagini) because all you have to do is destroy the container beyond repair, and it isn't hard to kill something alive.  Harry was not a *true* horcrux anyway, they require an enchantment/ritual to make and he did not do that in 1981. When Riddle used his blood in the graveyard, that kept Harry alive as long as Voldemort was because he used Lily's blood and her sacrifice, so it worked as sort of an anti-horcrux for Harry.   Especially in GoF.   Before the ministry fell, there was no taboo. I am under the impression that the taboo was instated after the ministry fell so the DEs could find members of the Order. When the trio were at Tottenham in the coffee shop, Hermione says Voldemort, and that's how Rowle and Dolohov found them.   Ron found out about the taboo after he had left the other two in the Forest of Dean.   Indeed.   No, the DEs attacked the wedding because they had just killed Scrimgeour, and all the protective enchantments the ministry had put on the Burrow were no more.   the young bull says, "I'm going to run down this hill and fuck one of those cows in the valley."  The old bull says, "I'm going to walk down and fuck them all."   Thank you, I'm watching the episode now.       I'll probably get down voted to Kronos for this, but as all of the best have been cited, I'll offer this bit:   "What I am about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it is a gut feeling. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do."    "Of my friend, I can only say this: Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most ...human."  I posted this when Nimoy died.   His arms open, his sails unfurled.   I was born in the Chinese year of the dragon, the only fictional animal in the Eastern zodiac. I have a dragon tattooed on my forearm.  I was also born under Libra in the Western zodiac, the only non living representation.  TL;DR: I am a strange one.   Nothing. It's a spell to unlock doors.   That depiction of my wand is damn near spot on. Thank you /u/obversa   Cheers Spooky.   First use of a Colin Hay song also, if I'm not mistaken.   A woman came home just in time to find her husband in bed with another woman. With superhuman strength borne of fury, she dragged her husband down the stairs to the garage and put his penis in a vise. She then secured it tightly and removed the handle. Next she picked up a hacksaw. The husband terrified, screamed, "Stop! Stop! You're not going to......to....cut it off are you?!" The wife, with a gleam of revenge in her eye, said, "Nope. You are. I'm going to set the garage on fire."   I'm American mate, I doubt I could add to this discussion. I commented so I could see the future posts.   Books first.. Always.   Has been for almost seven years, dude.   [Me too](http://i.imgur.com/3n468q7.jpg)   I like what that guy said.   Because Harry is not a smart man.   There are worse things than death, Tom.   Paging /u/DrFreud   A very thirsty man goes into a bar. As he waits to get the bartender's attention, a regular sitting next to him calls out, "I'll have another waterloo." The bartender gives the regular a tall ice cold drink and asks the newcomer what he would like. The thirsty man points to the man next to him and says, "I guess I'll have what he's having, a waterloo." So the bartender brings the newcomer a tall ice cold drink. The man takes a long deep drink and calls out, "HEY! This isn't any good. It tastes just like water!" The regular bar patron sitting next to him says, "It is water. That's all I drink," He turns to the bartender and says, "Right Lou?"   Why isn't lake Titicaca filled with boobs and poop?   The ring was cursed and caused Albus' death. After he broke the stone, he knew that he wasn't worthy. It's all explained in the *King's Cross* chapter.   IDK, but I do know that Harry was against killing.   Harry knew that he was the master of the elder wand, and that he would win the battle.    Voldemort has no remorse and is incapable of emotions like caring and love  Correct, how many death eaters did he whack at Malfoy Manor after Harry and Co. escaped?   I would agree that Severus was a better wizard than the marauders.  You have to realize that it wasn't just The four Gryffindor boys picking on Snape all the time, Snape took his shots at them whenever he could. Remember the bit in OotP when Harry was talking to Lupin in the fire at 12 GP?   Pardon my assumption.   Oh wow. I would look like an ass if their were hidden points for them somewhere, eh?  One point...      No, she was a strong snake he found in Albania. Still it is extremely unwise to make a horcrux from a living, sentient, being.   Only because he made her a horcrux.   I answered your question.   As of 00:00 EDT we Claws were up four points. Yea, we won.   Tom Riddle cared for no one. All he wanted around him were people he could use.  But to answer your question, I would say Bellatrix. He actually became angry when Molly killed her.   Perhaps Harry is giving him praise that Albus feels is undeserved? Is that your point?   I had never thought of it like that, but I can see it now. Take my upvote.      Yea, Colin wasn't of age either to stay for the BoH.   I'm with you. Not to mention the shuffling of the timeline. Harry got the Firebolt for Christmas, and it had to be stripped down. He didn't get it at the end of the year.   Dennis was also only a fifth year, yet he snuck back in to the Battle of Hogwarts.  Honestly, I think Dennis Creevy is a Gryffindor that I would love to learn more about. That kid had nuts of solid steel.  Edit: I don't remember, and I'm not about to look it up. I could be wrong.   I had not put that together. I wish Columbus could have directed all of them.   No.   Yes, ABC Fam includes all of the deleted scenes. We even got to see Petunia telling Harry about losing a sister before she left 4 PD.   Dumbledore's greatest power. Love. When Lily Evans cast herself between Harry and Voldemort that night, it protected Harry. When Riddle tried to kill Harry, the spell rebounded and destroyed his body leaving him nothing more than a spirit. The remaining bit of his soul as a result of killing Lily latched on to the only living thing it could find which was Harry. Horcruxes require intent...  The damn cat was probably hiding in the basement.   Cedar with dragon heartstring, solid, 13".    Ride the train both ways because it's a different experience both times.   If you would like some real input, there is a WWOHP Wednesdays here where we share pics and discuss what to do there.    that the student's wandlight tribute to Dumbledore removed the dark mark.    Yea, Bagman brought them to the pitch, and asked them if they knew what it was going to be. Krum mumbled, "maze."   No he's not. He's a puppet of the Koch brothers.   That was when I was a teen to my twenties. Then I discovered the sweet varieties of kush.   I used to smoke from the time I woke to the time I went to sleep. Now I just smoke one bowl a day.    Garlic on nails  That would make them more delicious!   Kardashians.   When Dr. Cox was trying to save his friend to no avail in *My Lunch.*  /r/Scrubs   Barack Hussein Obama   Bananas.   The full Scrubs theme song.   A four inch piece of compost after a failed BMX attempt. It slid straight into my calf muscle, and I had to go to the hospital to remove it, and take an IV of antibiotics.   Looks like an uncut member.   I like to hike in especially high places, and I am always terrified of falling. I get vertigo extremely easy, and I even have dreams about falling off cliffs.   Not the falling really, just the sudden stop at the end.   Do you think it was ever possible to just touch your wand in the right place and record within ten feet/meters? I'm thinking about the charms on the WWW Umbridge charm. It was in the book something they made that had her voice.   Harry, Snape and Riddle all found a home they never had at Hogwarts. I think they were described in DH as 'the three lost boys.'   You are correct.    Gooch/Kate Micucci was a comedian long before she was ever on Scrubs, and the original lyric is 'fuck you'. You're welcome to google it.   Hermione has butterfly bandages on her face which makes zero sense.  You're telling me Poppy couldn't heal a simple cut?  As much as I hate GoF film, Alfonso was the worst director in my opinion.   (I used his given name instead of his surname because I don't know how to do the accent mark over Cuaron.)   Yep. The beginning of OotP is 1995 I think.   He said I was exceptional!   Not to mention that The Book of Love was the absolute best song to end the series with, and then Bill is the trashman at the end.          Some years back I got one of those 20Q games designed as a snitch, that is age appropriate also.   That's just Hermione.   Thanks KoKo. Good morning to you.    I would assume so. It's the magic of the Veela that attracts people to them. Remember the QWC when the Veela were on the pitch, and everyone was strangely attracted to them? I'm sure they could attract even the straightest of women, supposing that it was a female Veela. Or the same for male Veela really. It's just their charm.   Yes. Those two lines between them were also improvised, and like you said, Harris was smiling at them being super creative together.  Edit: *Let's hope Mister Potter will always be around to save the day.*   Kingsley was a main factor in keeping Sirius free by leaking false trails that Sirius was abroad. Long story short, I doubt Shacklebolt ever considered Sirius guilty after 1994.   Isaacs had read the first two books and improvised that line. I don't think it was in the script. Columbus had told him to say a gibberish spell, and that's what he came up with. Sorry I can't find a source.   Aside from everything else, it's just a very well written epic. I forsee HP being required reading in schools in the near future.   Sure as the stars above, I'd really like to fuck you.   Then his legs are asleep.   I always love Ted and Gooch's duet.   I woke my wife up laughing.    *My own American Girl*   I shower every second day, and wash my (long) hair every fourth.  How often do you brush it?   Everybody back on the bus!!   I would have a blue smoke dispensary called Sorcerer's Smoke.  We would have many locations throughout the wizarding world, some in muggle villages disguised as normal smoke shops.  Sorcerer's Smoke would cater to those that need a bit of relaxation in their lives, and has just recently come on to the open market.  Our claim to fame would be the many visits by the Dumbledore brothers, and a few more notable aurors in the early underground days. Sorcerer's Smoke used to be a secret on the black market before we became a bit more main stream.  When you walk into our homey shop, you will have your choice of almost fifty blue varieties to help any witch or wizard relax no matter what mood they may be in.  The walls are lined with plush couches and chairs to sink into while you enjoy your wares, so come on down to Sorcerer's Smoke, and relax after a long day!  Edit for [picture](http://i.imgur.com/hDYK4EY.jpg).    I see it as Lupin had just come off a transformation and as he wasn't quite endowed with gold, it was the cheapest way to get there. I also see Lupin riding the HE as a bit of a machina so She could introduce dementors and patronuses.   Oh yea, it's ridiculous. I pause it so I can fast forward through the commercials.   	118
 I think it is fairly absurd that the NIH estimate for number of postdocs working in the US has an error of 15,500 people.  Are you fucking serious?   Five will tie; Six is needed to break the record (currently has 503, record is 508).  I would say the SF game has to be the odds on favorite for when the record goes down.   I know the season has only been going four weeks and five days, but to the Seahawks O-line, it seems like nine weeks and five days. The first day seemed like a week and the second day seemed like five days and the third day seemed like a week again and the fourth day seemed like eight days and the fifth day you went on a bye week and that seemed just like a day and then you came back and later on the sixth day, in then evening, when we saw each other, that started seeming like two days, so in the evening it seemed like two days spilling over into the next day and that started seeming like four days, so at the end of the sixth day on into the seventh day, it seemed like a total of five days. And the sixth day seemed like a week and a half. I have it written down, but I can show it to you tomorrow if you want to see it.    Speaking of the Raiders, I will need you to beat them.  Let me explain.  At the moment, the Raiders have won 4 more games, all-time, than the Broncos (including playoffs).  In five weeks, these teams play each other.  If my math checks out, should the Raiders lose out, and the Broncos win out (until that game), my glorious Broncos will be able to overtake the Raiders for most all-time victories in the AFC West *by beating them*!  I want this very badly.   Whoo!  I love color-on-color uniforms!  The Broncos' Blueberries, Ravens' All-Blacks, even the stupid Chiefs All-Reds from MNF!    I want orange pants for my boys, but will settle living vicariously through other teams until I get them.   I think that is a legitimate opinion.  Even an NFC championship outside of the Clink has to make em nervous.  ( I feel similarly with Peyton and the Broncs; would rather not play in Cincy, Foxboro. San D would be okay.)   Does it say what kind?  We lost Clady to a Lisfranc last year.   And also we're not sissies.    Yup.  Trent Dilfer revealed [the secret] (http://lightlybuzzed.com/2014/10/06/vine-trent-dilfer-explains-secret-winning-nfl/) yesterday.     Particularly when he tries to jump the route and guesses wrong; no DB in the league can recover from something like that.   I think it was exactly like this (or very close to it).  Poor communication or missed communication resulted in Thomas and Clady both going in for the block.   Yeah, no worries.  For some reason they are very insistant on keeping separate runnings for regular season wins and all-time wins - I guess so you can compare an equal number of games from all teams (hence, why the stats you gave had both teams playing the same number of games).  I have been bitten by that bug before, so I knew to look for it.  Go Broncos and No Go Raiders!  I *really* want to have the pleasure of surpassing them in wins **in person**!   This is regular season wins, right?  I think the Raiders still have us in All-Time wins.  Yep:  459-397-11 (Raiders) vs 455-396-10 (Broncos). [Source] (http://www.profootballhof.com/UserFiles/file/W-L-Start-2014.pdf) (I added 3 to Broncos total and 0 to the Raiders total because they suck)  Say what you want about the Raiders ("Fuck the Raiders" is a popular choice), but even as bad as they have been these last 10+ years, they have still won more games that we have.  It looks like we are four games behind the tie, and five games behind taking the lead outright.  Hmm, we play the Raiders in 5 weeks . . .  So, if the Broncos win out and the Raiders lose out, then we could pass them in all-time wins by beating them!  I never knew I wanted this so badly until now!     Very very stupid play from Julius here.  It is right at the border of being legal / illegal (what with the lure part of the rule), but I think it is clear that there was no reason for JT to throw this block - A) Clady is fully capable, B) The play develops way too fast for this to be needed, and C) He either missed his target (more likely) or deliberately tried for the knee (less likely,  I think).  I would doubt any malicious intent, but this was very poor judgment and execution.  It really sucks that the defender was injured here, on what should have been an innocuous play at those positions.   I know, right?  Nice manufactured narrative, mediaheads.   Ugh, I hate that shit.  And the records!  Just assuming Manning would hit 500, and Brady 50000.  You know people's careers can just end, right?  Holy shit shut up until things actually happen.   We have to make different categories for scripted and reality shows, because, "The Swan" actually happened.    There are a good number of Pats fans who know their NFL history, know the rulebook, and realize the difference between a lateral (which is intended) and a fumble (which is not) - and they are handling that play well, explaining everything nicely.  Good on ya.  And then there are a lot of Pats fans ignorant of NFL history, who are content to bitch and moan instead of educating themselves.  Read a book.     Take care of this first drive and it is a 10 point game.  That has to be the plan.   You're probably about 50% to score from 1 yard out.  50%  7 points = 3.5 expected Value  You're almost100% to get the FG (sorry, Romo).  100%  3 = 3.  3.5  3.  Math says go for it.   They did the bye with us.  They have 12 straight weeks of games!   That's the spirit, horse-bro!  (I know they are also horses, I guess)   Well, Season 4 of *The Wire* is possibly the greatest season of television ever.  There was bound to be a little let-down.  I dig ya, though, season 5 has some weirdness.   He is also 14/16 on touchbacks.   My wife just flipped her shit hearing that.  She said someone would never say that a mother was babysitting her own kid.    Truf.   AhahahahahahahahahahhahahaHhah!   Matt Flynn looks like Peter Saarsgaard (probably one too many As)!!!   But if he kicks another, it is 42-13 (instead of 42-7, maybe) - so the HC can argue they kept it within 4 score on TNF against hated rival GB.  It's what scared shitty coaches do everywhere!   Hahahahahahaha.   Left out 3 TD,  0 INT.     Vikings bad.  Packers better.  Ponder worst.   She knew what this was . . .   Only out by 5 yards.   Booooooo.  I am 30 points in the hole, when Lacy was a non - entity 3/4 weeks.  Whatever.  Still gonna win.   I anticipate that some of the games will be good.  There's Pats/Jets next week and Chargers/Broncos week 8.  Probably a few more reasonable ones too.  But, in reality, Thursday games are a travesty.  Nix them altogether and give us two timeslots of December Saturday games after CFB goes into bowl hibernation.   Gif request: sad vikings fan whose ear flappy hat wasn't even purple.   I *really* like the matte.  I want matte.   DM,SF   This is still better.   Dumpster fires are at least warm.   Yeah, and Goodell never saw that tape, neither.   4 minutes left in the 2nd quarter and they are already looking for other shit to talk about.   Fuck you and your Matt Cooke - employing Wild!  J/K.  Excited about opening up against your boys.   So what are the reasonable hopes for good TNF games?  Chargers @ Broncos is week 8 or something.    How do you feel now, with this statement committed to Internet permanence - yet with 7 more points?    McKinnon Out Burger!  McKinnon Out Burger!   I am sure he will just keep sexual assaulting people and get on the commissioner's exempt list.   Powered through,  though, eh?   Meh, Bad, Meh, God, Undetermined.    Here's a fun little hobby of mine:  every time someone says, "Suck" in what is assumed to be a socially-acceptable situation, I mentally add in, "Dick" or "Cock".  You know, 'cuz that's what it really means.  As a result, I was in hysterics early on in this video.  "Following up on that, why do you say they suck [dick]?"    This was *exactly* was Tebow was like for a population of our fans.   Line has crept up to Broncos (-8).  You can be scared if you want, but that is a really strong line.  (FWIW, I think that line is WAY too high.  But, Vegas, etc.)   Hating OCs is all the rage these days.  Patriots, you guys, Steelers, hell even some over in /r/denverbroncos are pissed at Gase for his two-tight end heavy game plan (which went to shit when Virgil Green got concussed), and continuing to run the ball.     There were a couple of Wild Cat-style plays with Tebow under McD, but you're correct that Tebow didn't start until Stidesville's interim gig.   I don't agree that players (or even Belichick) acting like they are above the press is the issue - the issue that Belichick (and other coaches) have always had is with lazy, unoriginal, or goading questions.  These are the real problem - not the press as an institution, but the shitty reporters who are either bad, boring, or intentionally trying to stir up controversy.  I mean, if you just coached or played in a loss, and the reporter asks something like, "Tell me about the inability of your team to pass protect tonight" - *what the fuck are you supposed to say*?  That is such a shitty, lazy question, and it should be treated with as much respect and effort that the interviewer gave to the interviewee.   That is why I respect Belichick when he goes on one of these broken records - give him (and his players) enough respect to actually ask an insightful question, or be prepared for your bullshit answer.   AWW, THAT'S KINDA NICE.  AND MEAN.     YES!  I NOTICED THIS AND SPECIFICALLY TOLD MY WIFE THAT FOX JUST FUCKED THE STEELERS!!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU AND I CAN AGREE ON, BUT I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY WE BOTH HATE THE STEELERS.   "Toxic love", but yeah, you're really close.   No contest.  Avatar was straight-up Evil Military Man destroys native home at behest of soulless corporate white collar nobody.  Tired, cliched, stupid, insulting.  The "evil" here is comical, unimaginative, and can teach us nothing.  Ferngully was blue collar normal people just doing their jobs when they are taken for a ride by a force greater than themselves (and kinda mystical).  This is how evil is done in the real world - common folk unwittingly ascribing to evil ideas far greater than they understand.  Ferngully  Avatar.  And that's without even talking about the musical numbers.   . . . as a singing lizard.   So the relevant maths here is: 2012+18 = 2030.   This is exactly what happened with Shanahan in Denver, except the coach only bailed the GM out enough to be AFC West division title competitive.   Generally, as an enveloped virus, you're talking 10s of minutes outside of the body.   Largely, the thought is that an organized, first world medical system has the appropriate infrastructure and knowledge to prevent any outbreaks of epidemic proportion.   Additionally, the general populace in the US is more trusting of medical personnel and not as prone to superstition as the populace in Western Africa.  That being said, there hasn't really been an Ebola virus epidemic in a place with a very high population density,  so it is not really known if unique challenges will present themselves in that sense.  Regardless, much work is currently underway, and some of it is very promising.  Multiple strategies for treatment and prevention are looking to be very effective,  so I think that it is very likely that even in the case of an Ebola outbreak in the US, it will not be catastrophic.    Rise to vote, sir!   Tonight my wife asked if the Redskins did the tomahawk chant ( like the Seminole and Braves) and my answer was: "Nah, they're racist enough already".   I think 10-6 runs away with the East, and 9-7 could be good enough.  If the Pats are that team, they'd be a tough out in the WC in NE in January.   Ditto.   Edit:  obv, Ravens fans remember.  Also me, because I am a sad man.   Exactly; nobody remembers that the Ravens went 1-3 and fired their O.C. The December before Flacco evolved into Elite Joe and cruised to a Superbowl MVP.     CTE may actually destroy the NFL.  It looks bad, bad, bad.   What's your scotch?   That is the worst time management I have seen outside of a 49ers game.  Hon.  Men.  Cowboys.     Archer joke dude.  Relax.   Nonsense; just tilt your head back.   Read a book.   You, sir,  are technically correct - the best kind of correct!    Bold 4u.  Love it.   Yeah, it is almost fun at this point, seeing who gets roped in and who just chuckles to themselves.   I want all oranges.   Made Aviations for wife and I, what did I miss?  Oh . . .    So eyesores.  Much orange.  Wow.   I wish we had all All-Orange Unis.   Yeah, that is outstanding.   Ha!  At the -40 mark atm.  It's a joke, people. Multiple congratulatory posts and I get lambasted for my joke.  W/e.   That's because you've only watched ~20 games!  J/K.  Good game Seahawks.   And your* a moron.  * sic.   I love manufactured stats.  Stfu, idiots.   These concepts are not compatible.   I like to call him Philipe Rios.   So cool.  This is the game we deserved.   I already came.   Book says 2.  Wtf Fox?   Nobody ever likes the whistling guy.  There were these two assholes *right* by the mic on the boards of an Avalanche game last year just baking all the time and talking.  Fuck them.   Yeah, I might have tried for the reverse situation.    Good conclusion drawn from a large sample size, all of which were from both teams at full strength on neutral fields.  You're doing God's work, sir.   What kind of discussion even happens there in that ref huddle?  How do you pick up an offsides call?  There's two refs who are on the line - maybe one of them says everything wad fine?  Wtf wad he looking at, and why is his opinion worth more than the one who threw the flag.  Absolute bullshit.   Better yet:  give it Brandon Perna.   Your brain has swapped some concepts on you.   Ditto NBC and FOX   What a responsible opinion.  You are cool.   That infuriates me.   Anus.  Anus.   So I live in Madison now.  I am thinking about traveling for the opener.  Should I?   Do you take cash?  	105

I just type it out   4th paragraph   The improvement in condenser heat transfer, which is just one step in the power-production cycle, could lead to an overall improvement in power plant efficiency of 2 to 3 percent based on figures from the Electric Power Research Institute, Preston says  enough to make a significant dent in global carbon emissions, since such plants represent the vast majority of the worlds electricity generation.

I'm going to rant about this... it's as much a rant as a suggest... / a suggest as a rant  batteries.  i can understand in cell phones, certain laptop designs, etc ... ...but, extended battery packs.     if this thing can lift 200lbs ... or even 20lbs for 2 hours...  My guess is you're using a combustion engine or fuel cell? I mean, you'd almost *have* to be.   ...which is awesome!  but, even the battery powered drones.  why not make extendable battery packs that use standard 'I bought 'em at walmart' battery pack extenders  My favorite cell phone battery extender deal is [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Energi-To-Go-Battery-Operated-Instant/dp/B000JD09P4) ... and it came out nearly a decade ago.  Why they're awesome: it's simply a case.  sure this one comes with 2 AA's (non-rechargeable) ... but I keep a 4-battery quick-charger in my car all the time (with 4 batteries in it)... and one of these.  if for whatever reason I'm *not* using my car charger, I can use this thing (hiking, fishing, camping, ... festivals, airplanes, that sort of thing.  'whatever' keeps me from being able to plug my phone in while still having me want to use it ... bike riding.)    but, what's awesome about it is... well, how its applicable to what i'm about to say.....which, in itself, probably *isn't* applicable to your design relative to the fact that it's probably not even battery powered to begin with (which is awesome btw! ... but even with it, I can come back to it).  what's awesome about it is I can throw in more batteries.  standard, rechargeable 2800mAh AA's (or higher, just that all of mine are Energizer's 2800mAh so I'm using that as the example).    *each* cell with enough to nearly charge my 3'000mAh phone entirely up. ... and there are two of them.   if they die? I can simply swap them out with more... and have the next pair recharged in 15 minutes with the quick charger if, for whatever reason, I *don't* have a car or house charger with me.  If all my rechargeables are dead (it's happened... European tour trips and Octoberfest all day drinking binges and the such happen.. what can I say :)  ... I can just *buy* two AA's at *any* store and.. ...i'm back up   running again.  ok, the second variable with this.. that I feel is applicable.   pass-through-powering... *while* charging.  the ability to plug my phone into it, *power* the phone off of them, as *well* charge the battery at the same time.  now, apply this to the drone.  *if* the drone's battery powered (and even if it isn't, and i'll get back to this in a sec) .... and *esp* if the drone can lift... 2lbs.. let alone 200....  then it can lift extra batteries.  Why *not* make the drone just as capable?   create 'packs'.  *like* this.  I mean, I buy a remote control car, hell, even a free flashlight from Harbor Freight.. and it has a cheap piece of plastic with some metal that lets me throw 3 batteries into it that act like one... or parallel them if more voltage is needed... ..slide it in   out... and... move on with life.  a drone with similar capability would be awesome!    let me screw one of these into the bottom where the camera screw hole is... *then* screw the camera into the bottom of *it* ... or something along those lines ... ...but, in such that I can throw on more power... quickly... and still get the other features.  ...and with standard batteries!  make the 'port' where the cable or whatever plugs into ... ...hell, *make* battery packs of certain shapes, sizes, configurations, etc ... ....*sell* them on the site... ..but also allow for 'generics' to be used.  it's the universality of it.   and, when dealing with something that can lift 200lbs??? hell, you could throw *ten* of [these 9lb 60Ah-equivalent bad daddies on it](http://www.jegs.com/i/Lithium+Pros/403/L3420R/10002/-1?CAWELAID=1710807060 CAGPSPN=pla catargetid=230006180000848939 cadevice=c gclid=CjwKEAjwnKCrBRCm1YuPrtWW0QMSJAC-5UYkGR873uqGn2z1rT-Rpk_B9JXm7xxoMNBVRjBbbYwU8hoC1WTw_wcB) and *still* have 100lbs to spare...  ....if a passthrough charge/power port is available ... like every. single. cellphone   laptop have had since ... 1990.  alright, jump back...   lets assume all of this is completely inapplicable because you're using a fuel cell or h-c fuel... .... well, i'm going to *assume* it'd be a serial design.... fuel cells aside (for the moment), that using some sort of ICE, said ICE is powering an onboard generator... onboard generator is hooked up to capacitors... and cap's are powering the electric motors.  if the design is made in a modular fashion... the ICE could be swapped out *with* a fuel cell.  and, in turn, the fuel cell could be swapped out for batteries.   after all, it's electricity going to the caps... (and/or batteries) ... so, to make the 'core' energy source compartmentalized in a design in such that it could be 'swapped'  it'd be like dropping a generator (a standard bought-it-at-lowes depot) generator into a compartment... (on the ICE or fuel cell design... the ability to carry a second fuel tank would be awesome too!) ...  hooking up the cable.. and closing the compartment before starting it up and sending it on its way.  I suppose the point is, 'modularity of design' such as to offer versatility in what the customer wants... and, in such a way that the customer can swap it out or add on more as they see fit.  obviously something like [this](http://geeknizer.com/worlds-smallest-petrol-engine/) or [this](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2001/04/02_engin.html) are more for 'in the lab' b.s. ... but,   well, you get the idea.  tiny ICE or fuel cells with 'expandable' tanks... that can be swapped for batteries.... combined with the ability to allow for more, larger batteries to be added on... ...in such a way as to extend time   range, as well to allow for 'fast swapping' or 'refueling' so it can get up and go again.  obviously [this one](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/the_miniature_fuel_cell) is a bit dated ... ...and [this one from 2013](http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2013/01/31/why-are-portable-fuel-cells-such-a-flop/) probably isn't much more recent...  but, in the end, it's been clearly proven that electric motors can be massive (nuclear submarines, diesel-electric hybrid trains, nuclear powered aircraft carriers, etc) ... ...and can move a LOT of weight.   and that, well, *with* diesel-electric hybrid trains *being* an example... that h-c chains can store a lot of energy in a small space, provide that energy to a conversion system (fuel cell, ICE, etc)... and that that, in turn, can produce a lot of electricity to power said motor...  the rest is just design, proper configuration, etc.  ...and having the money, time, incentive, and application-necessitating to put it all together...  just as applicable to UAVs and ground-based drones, imo... as those other.   applied to agriculture?  well, again, 200lbs is awesome.  hell, 20lbs is awesome.

So is an hour flight time!...20lbs or not!   Yeah, the 'law of accelerated returns' is definitely beginning to apply itself to drones....  ....but, so much of what would be awesome if developed.. ...so much of what I've rambled about (for instance), is dependent on *so* many variables outside of just the drones.  the drones are just one of the pieces tying other elements together.  but, that also means that parallelism can happen in the development... with advances happening on *multiple* fronts at once.  but, I still think it will take years-to-decades (if ever) before it's all really put together .. if ever.  but, even as most of it currently sits, *I* can see no real technological limitation to *any* of it ... even now.  sure there will be advances that will make it all the more 'effective', cheaper, widely deployable, ...widely utilizable... ...but, as it currently sits, it's more just a matter of 'putting it all together'.. ...then advancing it generation after generation.

I'm sure if I spend some time thinking about it I can come up with a better one. but, thanks! :)   I just posted an answer to another that address some things.  I saw your other post after I refreshed the page.   check out the edits I did to the above post if in case I did them *after* you saw the 'first draft'  your post had some things in it I *hadn't* thought about, namely the microfertilization.  personally I see this as being *way* off, but maybe/hopefully I'm wrong.    I mean, I suppose much of it comes down to power source ... thus, how much weight a drone can carry, how complex they can become, etc ... ...i mean, I *suppose* you could have a 'big drone' flying overhead feeding supplies to a smaller drone connected via a tether   tubing system that can spray xyz directly onto a needed plant...  to take your pest thing farther... with ultrasonic, radar, and other 'imaging' approaches, I'd imagine even *insect* identification could go on ...and, subsequent   directed spraying.   so, caterpillars on your leaves? beetles going crazy?  spray 'em!    ???   but, I see much of that as being *really* far out .. if ever  I totally agree with you on the first steps basically being an imaging thing ... ...a carry over from the enthusiastic photographer-drone op.    I mean, with the right regs in place, there's really no reason drones couldn't be 'suv-sized' .... on down to these smaller pocket-sized drones....    i've always been curious about a 'drone tether' ...  like, high gauge speaker wire running between a larger drone to a smaller one powering it...   or just powering drones with cables to begin with.... I mean, a microUSB 3.0 cable is pretty small, and some are much lighter than others, and those things can pump out 100w .... ....if the cable is being supported by a hydrocarbon-fueled 'mother drone' and smaller ones are simply drawing the power from them (ie, hovering *below* them vs above them) ... then 'swarms' of drones could work together (tethered or not) to cover a few different angles of it.  um...  but yeah, i'm of the opinion that it's definitely going to take an denser fuel source, and nothing's as dense as hydrocarbons... [except nuclear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials). ... so a drone with an onboard generator powering smaller one *could* make sense?   I mean, right now I think a lot of the view is on 'standard' drone sizes... but, with the right regs in place, why *not* have a 'car-sized' [drone hovering](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-hoverbike-is-basically-a-giant-quadcopter-drone) supplies overhead.   I think the idea of dumping water from above is obviously just ridiculous... but, 'swarming' software tying a few different drones together? with a 2-3 hour energy source? how is that completely unrealistic?   Auto take of an landing is coming  I think this will be a big part... and, I'll take it farther.    I mean, my roomba can automatically take itself back to its charging station, why can't a drone use similar software and automatically land in an area that automatically connects it to a charge or refill station?    more than that, the ability to automatically pick up different fuel tanks or spray tanks....   I know on the one hand this sounds absolutely absurd but... if it can go back to a certain point automatically then land... ...and do so on a V-shaped thing that naturally 'drops' it into place in such that a 'nozzle' or something injects fuel into it (think air compressor hose or something... with the fuel being n.gas or something 'like' that) ... ....why not have another similar with a tank of fertilizer or pesticide?    on the one hand, this sounds absurdly expensive and totally niche.  on another though... vineyards are *huge* and can make a *lot* of money.  the ability to automate a spraying of a 5'000 acre vineyard???    you say 400mph, but even 25mph or 40mph to get from a field back to a barn back out to the field again ... and while the farmer stays out in the field tending to other things until it gets back?       which brings in simple 'delivery drones Amazon-style'     have a barn with some guys in it, out in the field fixing something. run out of a $2 box of staples fixing a line and have to load your shit up in the truck, drive 10 minutes back to the barn, get it, only to drive back ... vs send the drone to the barn, guy in barn gets called/radioed in to throw in the box... and the drone flies back.   the time/energy saved in something like that is *huge*    .... something like that could eat up 20-30 minutes easy... vs take '5 minutes' for a drone... *while* the guy in the field is still doing his deal.  and the only thing *that'd* require is a drone that can carry an x-lb payload and fly a predetermined path... and back again.   throw that on a guy making $35/hr and do that just 1x a week.... let alone a few times a *day*?  and for a *few* guys out in a field making that or similar?    savings add up pretty quickly.    ...and, again, nothing more complex than an 'Amazon delivery drone' to do something like that.   Flying between rows is not what aerial drones do well   not *yet* ... but, with the sensors you mention above?  I think they *could*.    *why*? is another question... but, between grape rows, just check out the [vine rangers](http://www.vinerangers.com/) vid... between corn rows... obviously there isn't a *huge* cost advantage to this... but, take something like the DJ's prop guards... make them a tad more complex whereby the entire blade is surrounded.. then covered top   bottom with a light weight screen... ...i'm not sure how this would mess with aerodynamics but... ..in such that the unit is protected... then fly it along?   ...reinforced by sensors, of course for flight path and such....   then there's the 'drone' element that *isn't* flight-based drones.  I think there's just as much potential for ground drones to do just as much...and the two working in unison feeding information back   forth... drone on the ground... potentially with much greater power supply... tethered to a drone flying directly above it?  .... going down a row or a line?  monitoring soil *and* aerial data at the same time?   obviously these could be done wirelessly... as well done at separate times and the data stitched back together, but for accuracy's sake, the ability to do both at the same time *seems* like it could drastically cut down on the cost of sensors spread throughout.   and, again, the energy-capability if it's, say, a vineyard where the rows are far enough apart that a power-tether wouldn't get hung up on leaves and such.  I know the focus is on aerial drones but.... that limits things a *lot*.  I'll check out the links.   Just a list?  - automation      meaning: I want to be able to program a path... either via a map, a recorded flight that I 'train' it to do, whatever.... and then every day at preset times, it will send me a text message or app notification, I say 'go ahead' or 'delay' (in case it's raining.. and assuming it hasn't tied into local weather or something) ... ..and, basically, it'll fly along that path and record every day..  ...w/out me (really) having to do shit.  - different fuel sources than just batteries      fuel cells, the ability to cover much wider areas (fields can get pretty big, and depending on the level of accuracy ... it may take more than a standard 20 minute path)    ....  fuel cells or something *like* that would be nice.  - automatic take off and landing... for recharging       so if a preprogrammed flight is going to take 10 recharges to do throughout the day... it can go, do its deal, fly back to base, charge, then fly back out again and pick up where it left off (my roomba can do this)  - local 'grid' accuracy      *like* a Roomba's 'walls' or whatever, something that lets me place sensors around the fields, the rows, etc to create markers.... be them solar powered, rfid, whatever.  the cheaper the better.    but, something like this to create a more accurate area so that I can more precisely lay out the physical area of the farm and paths I want covered  - sensor tie-in      If I place sensors around the farm... moisture levels, shade coverage, that sort of thing... .... a mesh network would be nice whereby the sensors can connect to one another, and then to wifi access on the farm to get data to me.   if this isn't available... a remote farm, something like that... ...the drone can 'RFID-ping' the sensors, record the data... and bring it back in such that it'll auto-hook up to a computer or be accessible over wifi or upload the data to an online account when the drone auto-returns to the barn or house or garage or wherever  - take a vineyard as an example     the ability to fly both above rows... as well *between* them  - take a corn field for example     the drones would need to have their blades covered so as to *not* get tied up... yet still be effective .... and, fly *between* rows of corn to take assessment of below-canopy crop health   - more than just imaging and sound    this one gets tricky but... heat, moisture recording, etc      this ties more into software that isn't drone-specific, obviously, but the ability to do radar for picking up soil erosion, moisture content, etc.     - livestock focused      if the tags on livestock could be RFID and 'pingable' from the drones to know where they are, track movements of them, etc.      Lets say there are 20 animals in a field, each tagged with RFID, each with their own serial/barcode number.  A map of the field has already been made and programmed into the drone's software... drone knows to go fly a preprogrammed path along that map, counting the head (ie, pinging the tags and filling in a database).  lets say 15 of them are all in one area but 5 are separated from the herd.    ...the drone would not only 'know' which 15 are there / which 5 aren't... and would then fly the preprogrammed path for that field to 'find' the other 5...   once all 20 are found, fly back w/out wasting more time/energy on it.   if 19 are found but there's a 20th gone astray... fly the path until it finds it.  after x-minutes *not* finding it... send a notification ...  or if it's lost, out of the area, etc, send notification that it's not in the area and... well, smartphone alert making the 'shepherd' aware that one of their flock has gone missing.    a lot of this ties into *other* sensor grids that could be set up on a farm... and, lots of other technologies beyond *just* drones *but*... the drone could play a *critical* part in enhancing this   - to act as a temporary wifi repeater ....      so, if i have a grid set out on a farm but it's too far away from the barn or what not to download data... .. to be able to fly out and connect to it, but not just download data (or upload it) ... but also to tie that part of the grid to the drone... then the drone, in turn, to bridge to the barn or what not...  ...though, this is largely silly, but it'd still be nice software to have in the drone ... given that the drone *may* be network-connected-capable so why *not* include something similar.  but, the idea is the drone could go to an area, hover for x-minutes until the data is downloaded, *know* that the data is downloaded, then move on.     obviously this is also redundant with just going out and downloading the data itself and bringing it back.    but, definitely longer flight time and more-capable energy source.  that 4hr fuel cell drone posted the other day would definitely be necessary   - irrigation monitoring    lets say there's drip irrigation installed... the ability to fly down a line and 'see' whether or not the drips are dripping... sprays are spraying, etc.   be able to detect the moisture of the lines in such as to know it isn't just moisture on leaves but actual spray coming out... ie, to let know if there's a clogged or broken line.   those are the ones that pop up in my head.  edit: [felt compelled](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgriDrones/)   I just read the wikipedia on it, obviously not the same thing, but given the amount of time I have to dedicate to the subject it'll have to suffice.  Regardless, I was being sarcastic above. I'm personally of the opinion that Israel clearly *does* have nuclear weapons, and that it's both hypocritical and should be brought to the forefront of any talk with or about Israel.  Nuclear weapons are *the* weapon of mass destruction, and any   all who have them should be held accountable *for* possession of them.  It's not like we're talking about chemical weapons or daisy cutters... These things are largely designed to level *cities*...let alone entire bases or entrenched underground facilities.  It's morally   ethically irresponsible for *any* country or 'other' possessing them to *not* be forthright about such.  But, that's just my opinion and, quite frankly, it means squat in any real scheme of things relative to this.  But, to blast Iran for *potentially* developing them while *not* remaining 100% clear about their *own* situation is laughably hypocritical at best, and completely unacceptable somewhere in the middle.  edited: because typing a comment on my phone's reddit app is impossible if it's over 5 characters long   oh yeah, holding off is definitely a must.... for me at least.  like, even if this shit were available here, now, today... i'd still probably wait a bit.   ...even for Lasik (*with* wavefront/mapping) I'd still probably hang back a bit... ...unless i was like glasses 24/7 or something.  then i'd definitely get that shit tomorrow (it's 7pm now so...) ....  ....but, as is, I don't even wear glasses so...    but, on the other... yeah, i mean, if i could take my eyes now, get these put in ... ...why not?  'cause it *reads* like they could be removed pretty easily and things could heal back to normal ... thus, 'upgrades' would be allowed.  ...but, in the future, I wouldn't be surprised at *all* if they had this... and combined it with like transparent monitors or lazers or something that wrote images on the retina... ....so, i could see optically what's going on ... or, if need be, it could 'record' an image, then write it on my retina in a majorly zoomed-in way .. and, not just 'zoomed-in optical frequencies' ... but pretty much anything ... Predator-style.   like, if they can show it on a monitor, they can write it to your retina.     that shit'll be fun!   really great at parties! :P  I wouldn't be surprised if they get to the point they can put something right on the optical nerve.  I've definitely read where they're working on that.... how far along they are is 'anyone's guess' though   but, some Jordi (sp?) shit from star trek would be pretty f'in cool too!    ... w/out that ugly ass visor, of course   lol.... well, *normally* ClickHole's fucking hilarious ... but, that one's actually the 'most serious' one I've ever read from them..  like, it's still a joke, but technically, mathematically, everyone of them rough-calculation works out to be true.  it still made me crack up.. but i'm pretty sure I was crying in disgust at the same time  was awesome! a real rollercoaster of emotions.  kinda like skydiving   [potash](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/agrium-cuts-earnings-expectations-to-bottom-of-earlier-guidance/article16425506/) is an industry   there was a [potash glut](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/agrium-cuts-earnings-expectations-to-bottom-of-earlier-guidance/article16425506/) going on... I imagine it'll only continue to grow with projects like this.  but ash has its own issues.  applying it directly to the soil shoots the pH way up and throws everything off.   and, though mixing it with compost works...  i highly doubt farmers are wasting the time to spread compost over a field that they're only going to grow straw in   hopefully sooner than that!    as far as 'body augmentation' goes... I'd much rather get one of these than, say, a tattoo...  most of my family's had lasik (bro, sis, mom), as well a few friends.  my brother got his back in its 'earlier' days (~2000?) ... my mom   sis were 2005? 2006?  my brother was too early for it when he got his... he had to go back for one readjustment in like 2003, and then the next one he went in he got the wave front shit (wave mapping, wave front ... it goes by different 'brand names' but it's essentially all the same tech).  my sister just got the standard... *despite* me telling her to get wave mapping ... my mom went a year later and I *made* her get wave front.  like, she got an appointment at the same place my sister got hers... I called them up, researched their 'wave front' tech they were using, found a better place that was using a newer approach (read: machine) doing it... called *them* and scheduled an appointment for my mom, cancelled her other one.   manipulated the situation such that I told my sis I'd take my mom...  picked her up day-of, drove her to this *other* place... knew she'd fight it at first... but, told her to go in, give it a chance and if she didn't like it, I'd pay for the other place's entirely...  once we got there she begrudgingly sat through waiting room deal (~15 minutes?) and what not... (god was she pissed!) ... but, after we got in there and the doc explained the differences to her between the tech they were using, etc ... she realized 1) the doc was better and 2) the tech was better.  I ended up paying for it all anyway ... just because she's my mom... ...but, my sister has since had to go back to get hers readjusted 3x and now has to wear glasses while night driving or reading anything longer than a menu... ...my mom (older) has had one readjustment.. and the doc says she has about 3-4 more to go.  my sis is 'readjusted out' and they say that even with the wave mapping, they *may* be able to only get one more readjustment in on her... but recommend holding it off for a *while* ... like, years-to-decades ... like, in case shit gets 'really bad' again   um... my mom? can still see great and doesn't ever need glasses (despite being almost 70).  but, I suppose the point of my story, if there even is one, is... it's your freakin' eyes! only the best! if anything at all!   luckily i'm still pretty much 20/20 (used to have slightly higher... like 20/22 in one eye, 20/23 in another... was awesome and shooting! I've slacked off in the past decade though... but I used to be able to put rounds through the same holes.. or just slightly off.. probably still could but breathing techniques and rhythm gets thrown off from 'old age') ... but, yeah, I'm prob 20/20 - 20/18 at this point.  I'll definitely get the wavefront ... and, this shit (if available) if/when/as I ever go to get my eyes 'adjusted'.  Hopefully it's out by then.  I'd have *no* qualms getting this put into my eye... even to*day* if it were available.  ...though, I'd prefer the tech to advance a bit more first.  but, the cool thing about this *vs* the other (and the two can totally be combined together from what I gather) is that *un*like lasik (wave mapping or not), this is an insert ... so, i'm going to imagine it can be 'adjusted', removed, replaced, or 'other' as tech advances and as the eye ages.     .....granted, I'm no optometrist but my grandfather passed at 89 and never needed glasses.  ... I get that a shitload of it is genetic... but also that a shitload of what happens from there is dietary or situational/conditional to how you use your eyes.

I first read about it back in early-to-mid 2002.  Was in a Forbes or Fortune (I'd send a link if I could find one) piece that was covering war-tech worth investing in.  Like a lot of advanced tech being worked on at the time, it all got classified or re-classified by lil'Bush.  My guess is, before Obama gets out, one of the last things he'll do is de-classify a shitload of military tech that'll *flood* the market over the next presidential term.  Really surprised why he hasn't done it *yet* ... but, then, there actually *has* been some 'creep' over the past few months ... more so than the past few years at least  (from what I've seen).  But, yeah, this got classified because it was being used for snipers.   or, well, that's what the Fortune/Forbes article said.  ... was saying something like 20/30 vision or something for the average person (or, they can see at 30ft what the average person can see at 20... forget which side the numbers fall on) ... but the the average sniper was like 20/25  (or 25/20) ... and the olympic ones were like 20/27-20/28  (or 27/20-28/20... you get the point) ...  obviously a lot more goes into sniping than *just* eye sight but... it plays a pretty critical part.   ... and that these took *every*one who used them (with normal vision) up to 20/30... and that with certain tweaks, advancements, etc, they were looking like they could get up to 20/40 if they had the proper funding to advance the science ... ...again, it *was* a business magazine .. promoting investable companies for war-tech. so, to show not just an already-existing market for already-existing tech/product .. but a longer term investment play too with promise of future advances for ... future customers.  anyway... but yeah, it's real.   and, from what I gather, it's going to advance farther ... like, when combined with wave front and such...  ....like, tailor-made, eye specific lenses... combined with continued advances in the tech.   should get really interesting  edit: but, just google 'bionic eye' and you'll get dozens of other sites covering it   good article.    ...for an industry piece.  raises a lot of good points   questions. glad to see the industrial sector is beginning to chime in... ...i know the 'industrial world' has seen the utility of these for a while now ... but, pieces covering them have been few   far between.  ...and the whole thing is *long* overdue   [you may find this funny](http://www.clickhole.com/article/6-things-couldve-been-bought-15-trillion-governmen-2407)   My M8 does this...

       Google knows so much about me already, it seems futile to fight it.  You want my medical records too? Sure, why not?  g+ had that chicken and egg issue that a lot of networking products have. Nobody uses it, so there's no reason to use it.             I love this show so much.   I remember when it was announced I was like, "A Hannibal Lecter show on NBC? Wow, that's gonna suck." Boy, was I wrong.   The show is just so horribly beautiful, it's almost unbearable sometimes.   Not really that spoilery. More about the general direction of S3 and some discussion of episode titles and character beats.   The Thirteenth Floor(1999) is pretty much the exact same premise at The Matrix, people living in a computer simulation and unaware of it.   It's (loosely) based on a book from 1964 called Simulacron-3. I read that book twenty years ago because I had heard that it was a proto-matrix story. In it, each individual's personality is saved on a giant, rotating storage drum. It's very cool, in that retro-future kind of way.   Is this really so confusing? A university has the power to kick a student out, either temporarily or permanently for any number of things, including things that are not crimes.  That's the extent of their jurisdiction and their power to enforce their rulings.  Were you thinking that I was implying a university does or should have the power to send someone to prison?   I've heard this quite a bit and it's not that simple.   I think that it's reasonable to say that a university can and should take action in cases where the evidence for guilt isn't quite strong enough for a criminal conviction. Furthermore, I would argue that there are actions that might not rise to the level of a criminal complaint but could and should warrant a sanction of the offending party and/or protection of the victim. You can name any number of instances outside the sexual assault spectrum where this is true.  But trying to be fair in these cases is a really difficult problem. There are political pressures from all sides. The rules of how to proceed are wildly inconsistent. The people adjudicating the process generally don't have any training or expertise and can often be quite biased. No to mention that trying to fairly figure out what two drunken college kids actually did in a darkened room with no witnesses is nearly impossible.         Just a little salt, please.  I don't get the ketchup thing at all.      He was great as mob boss Theo Tonin on Justified.   It would be nice if occasionally judges were asked to resign because they sentenced an offender too harshly.      If I get this right, you were laid off, not fired for cause? So it's no big deal.  File for your benefits and don't worry about about.  Best of luck to you.   How are you eligible for unemployment benefits if you are working?         It's a decent word, but I'm not sure how I feel about it.   I don't get this. If someone is in your assigned seat, tell them to get up or get the flight attendant.   How much of a pushover do you have to be to go, "Oh well, I guess I'll give up the seat I booked" because some entitled a-hole decided they don't have to follow the rules and can just do what they want because they're so special?      I just love that there's a company called General Atomics. Makes me feel like I'm living in an Issac Asimov story.   I think that's very true. The "loser pays" idea sounds great at first blush, but it puts plaintiffs with limited financial resources at a serious disadvantage.   The better solution for patent reform would be to hire more and better patent reviewers and subject all proposed patents to a more rigorous investigation.                I always find it fun and a little mind-boggling to talk about this stuff.   I bought my first computer in 1983 with money I saved from my paper route. As an aside, there's another thing consigned to the dustbin of history, the paper route.  I got a Commodore 64. It cost me $300. The price had just been cut from $600 and I jumped right on that. I couldn't swing the money for a floppy drive, so I got the attachment that let me save my programs on a cassette tape. Later on I'd get the money for a real disk drive and a 300 baud modem. I was living in the future.            I'd call that justifiable homicide.   I'm not sure where you are, but federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. That's roughly four and a tenth hours for thirty bucks, not three.  Either way, the law is clear. You must be paid for all hours worked.  If you feel that you'll be fired if you speak up, it may be in your best interest to keep quiet.  Perhaps you can approach your boss and ask him what he thinks the best course of action is. Tell him that to do the job correctly takes five hours, but you're not being paid for all that time. What would he like you to do?  You can always keep a written log of all hours worked. In fact, I would suggest this. Depending on the state you're in, the labor board may make the company make you whole when you leave the job. In most states, you'd have to sue.      Are you on payroll (w-2) or are you a 1099 contractor?   I'd say I'm half kidding. There is a lot of robot research in Japan that I think is partially due to this issue.    Solution 3 -  Robots      Aasif Mandvi too. Lot of heavy hitters on this show.    He's such an idiot. I'm looking forward to him getting shanked in prison.  Maybe Jonathan Banks will show up and send him to Belize.    Nothing is going to change until we start sending people who do this to prison.   Fines are just a cost of doing business. If people start thinking they might actually have to spend some time behind bars for fraud, they might think twice.            No, I saw the article on Google News this morning and decided to post it.  Not everyone on Reddit is a karma whore.         Not a surprise, sad to say. The numbers were terrible, even for NBC.  I had some small hope they might keep it and perhaps retool because otherwise they'd be the only network not in the Marvel/DC superhero universe. I'm not sure what characters they got to include in the show, but they hinted about more than a few.   The supernatural side of the DC universe could make some interesting TV.         It's kind of amazing to me that we have military bases named after men who broke their oaths to support and defend the Constitution and took up arms against the lawfully elected government of the United States.      Seems legit.   This is the first real movie I remember watching with my daughter and it instantly became her favorite. I think it's maybe the best movie for children ever made.  And it's almost infinitely rewatchable. It never gets old or annoying.  Something you'll appreciate as a parent because littlers love to watch the same thing over and over and over again.         "Yes, it's hilarious. I don't have to laugh to think it's funny"   Yeah, I just don't agree.   The McNulty arc was just plain stupid. The newspaper story was boring. A lot of the characters did dumb things that I just didn't believe they would do. I really felt the hand of David Simon moving the characters around in very unnatural ways to suit the story he wanted to tell and the sledghammer of message he wanted to hit the audience with.  I never watched The Wire when it was first on. I got caught up a couple years ago when Cablevision got HBO GO and I binged the whole sixty episodes in the span of two months. So I took the show as it came and I didn't have a lot of time to chew over the episodes or get attached to the show the way a lot of people did.   I think sometimes people get attached to great shows like The Wire and they make excuses when they end poorly.    I appreciate you addressing this, but at this time I still don't feel confident that I can buy a used/refurb phone from eBay or whatever and have it work. The refurb sellers like the one I bought I bought my current Ting phone from flat out state in their listings that their Sprint refurbs are not for use on Ting or similar MVNO carriers.  The whole thing is a mess and I just don't know what to do at this point except shell out  money that I don't have for a brand new phone direct from Ting.    My The Wire season rankings are 4 3 1 2 (big big gap) 5  Sadly, The Wire S5 is just bad (imho) for a lot of reasons. Maybe you'll like it more than I did.   I remember watching the old 80's Buck Rogers show using an electronic perfection game as some kind of control console. It was funny because they didn't even modify it or paint it and I had the exact same game sitting right next to me. a  Edit:  Here it is:  http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Misc/LakesidePerfection.htm   Corman's movie cost a reported two million dollars to make. By making it, the studio retained the FF's movie rights.  How much do you think those rights would go for today if they were to be sold on the open market? How much would Marvel/Disney pay to get them back?      Some professional sports teams sneak a "state of the art" clause in their stadium deal, forcing state and local governments to fund an unending series of upgrades and updates to their arenas addition to the huge expense of building the place in the first place.   I try to post links about this stuff from time to time, but there doesn't seem to be much interest here on /r/sports         I work in a very safety-conscious environment, so I'm always thinking about how things might fail in an unsafe way. I'd worry that people might want to use this like a sous vide machine, set it up and let it cook by itself for hours or days.   Problem being, if the Meld has a glitch or fails in some bad way, you could easily have a bad fire.  Hopefully you'll include a strong warning not to let the Meld work unattended and perhaps a physical OFF switch so it can't turn on accidentally. You might also consider having it have the ability to send an alert/alarm to the user's phone if there's an issue or malfunction.  I think this is a very neat idea and if I hadn't exceeded my toy-buying budget for the nonce, I'd pre-order one.   Good luck!   Can I still use the burner with the Meld knob as a regular burner?  Also, have you thought about safety concerns? Is there some kind of auto cut off if the temp goes too high?      My Anova sous vide stick can adjust to different volumes of water in the cook bath fairly easily. Modern PID controllers can do all kinds of neat things and they can actually be had fairly cheaply these days.  Cheap, easy-to-use, precision temperature control is going to revolutionize the way people prepare food.       If you're just counting years from the start of the show, you're clearly correct about the date.  On the other hand, the events in the last episode are clearly the Viking sack of Paris that happened in 845 in the Earth Prime timeline. Not to mention that Athestan's child with Judith is almost certainly Alfred the Great, which makes it 849 AD.  Furthermore, it seems like we're seeing Rollo being set up to be Rollo/Robert of Normandy,  which is even later down the timeline.  The show is basically a Viking Saga, so things like continuity and accuracy are not high on the lift of priorities. I just wouldn't get all hung up on what year it is. Just enjoy the ride.   Except that that's Charles The Bald on the throne in Paris and he won't even be born until 823.  My only point is that it's silly to try and talk about what the real year is in the show. It's a mishmash. It's like a show where the main character fights along side George Washington at Yorktown and a few years later he's hanging out with President Abe Lincoln and discussing the Gettysburg Address.    The show plays pretty fast and  loose with the time and events.  The show begins with the Viking raid on Linsdisfarne in 793 CE, but the events happening now take place in 845 CE. The Vikings, lead by the person who may or may not have been the historical Ragnar Lothbrok, raided Paris in 845.   Hirst basically takes people and events from the late 8th through the late 9th century and squashes them all together as he likes to make the story.    The article calls it a patent, but other articles I've read refer to it as a trademark. Trademarks don't expire, as far as I know, so I was unclear as to what the actual issue is.  I used intellectual property because it seemed generic enough to cover whatever it might be.      My wife spent a lot of her summers there, right around that time period. I told her she should get a series bible and submit a spec script.      It's a kickstarter film and OP likely stole and posted the trailer, since it's a "backer only" premium right now.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vantispictures/aurora-twisted-robot-love-story     	84

 Might want to read this first if you haven't:  http://www.ea.com/news/we-can-do-better      There are lots of things you can do after you've built a profitable city.   For example, try a different profit strategy. A different layout. Gift away some of your cash to make your vision of utopia (one that's a dream to live in, but may have to rely on continuing gifts). If you're not playing with others, perhaps take on an entire region by yourself and build all the different types of specialized cities (electronic, mining, oil, tourism, gambling ...).  In a way, you can't really win with games like SimCity. It's all about showing off your creativity, what you can do to make your city different from other people's. Some of the game mechanics do limit your freedom a lot, especially if you want sustainable cities, but if you do have a ton of cash that you can gift away, then that frees up some of the things you can do.   I have one city with 3 processor factories and 3 CE factories (all fully upgraded), with two trade ports (one via rail, one via shipping - probably don't need both, but might as well. Had to build two ports since the rail and water connections are at opposite ends of the map - but this is good, as it provides two paths for trucks to receive/deliver materials). Can easily do 4+ million per day. I'm importing all the needed materials, even processors, as that's the best way to ensure no disruption to manufacturing (you make less, but then factories less likely to shut down a few times a day as it runs out of materials).  For this 140k population city, one half of my city is basically all these factories and trade ports, and so the traffic there is mostly just trucks going from place to place.  I can probably add another 3 or 4 CE factories before I run out of free space, and before traffic issues becomes a bottleneck.   I had a problem with a city where recycling was doing fine, and then the number of recyclables dropped to almost zero (about 500 or so, but the trucks never leave their garages), and garbage went way up, even though education was still 4/5.   Had to bulldoze and rebuild the recycling center to bring recycling demand back up again. Turning it off and then on had no effect.  This was before 2.0, but I don't see many people mentioning this bug, so it probably wasn't fixed in the patch.  	5

I have no arm hair left.   never seen or heard of ridge gourd   looks yum!   my tandoor: http://i.imgur.com/98fHLzg.jpg   recently acquired an awesome tandoori over and my naan is not sticking to the walls - or it's sticking too much to my naan pillow - it's either the dough, my tandoor's too hot, or not hot enough...I dunno, anyone have a authentic, tried and true naan recipe? thanks   inspiring! I may do this w/ chicken this weekend - thanks!   I loved it as well - I wanted to fucking slap the shit outta that kid! which I think is what they were going for...   $80!?   \m/   'bout half.   and another...  https://noblebeastofman.bandcamp.com/   1 example: https://unspeakableaxerecords.bandcamp.com/album/infiltrator   dude I picked up the Swallowed cassette as well and it KILLS! I can't wait for my vinyl!!! Love Skull Fist as well! NO FALSE METAL! \m/    picked up The White Goddess from 20buckspin a while back and am not disappointed - besides, cheese is delicious!   new Obituary, Sacrificio, and various bandcamp discoveries...   is it explorable, or is that whole runway area fenced off?   One of my favorite parts of the day - when I get home after work I have like an hour and 20 before the wife gets home.  I hang out in the kitchen and spin vinyl.  Just got the new Obituary yesterday and was spinning that  - which is awesome.   the 2 week creeper...  http://i.imgur.com/gvcMCnj.jpg   and there you go bro...   http://mobro.co/awesomemattstache   BABADOOK!   12 days in and still, barely a shadow :(  http://i.imgur.com/oItYarC.jpg   there ya go - good luck!  \m/   was trying to get the basic recipe in the title...      awesome man lemme know! \m/   it is...you know that perfect bite of pancake though? the one w/ just the right amount of syrup and a little crisp of bacon at the end...it's like that, only better.   RECIPE: http://www.ranchogordo.com/html/rg_cook_mondavi_tostada.htm         I recently went in on half a pasture-raised hog w/ a friend.  I home-cured some bacon recently and holy crap I will never go store-bought again.  We should def hook up when you get up here.  \m/   how did it go by the way?   I like your bulk salad idea - what protein are you filling the crock-pot with?    would love that thanks   wtf do you do w/ kale - gimme a good, simple recipe and I'll try it...picked up our csa after work today and guess what?  3 KINDS OF KALE!!!   totally....listening to Reverend as I type. \m/   I dunno, I've tried all the ones I mentioned - Bloomfield is cool cuz you can opt to just go out to the farm and pick everything yourself which is really neat (http://www.bloomfieldorganics.com/upick/) - we're just finishing our Twin Palms CSA now for the season which has been great.  I think we're just gonna do farmers markets for a while and see how that goes - too much fucking KALE lately. \m/   competed in strongman for years but have slowed down...less weight more volume type stuff.   I've been training there w/ a buddy for 11 years...Mon-Fri 13:00-14:00   well obviously.   will it be recorded - for playback tomorrow for example? sounds awesome! \m/   that's where I am yo! the CD will be MINE!!!  \m/   saw your post and instantly thought of that intro - thanks!   nice! listening to the album now - thanks!   haha great post!  Metal Church - Burial at Sea, from the album The Dark  @ 00:19  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN5HJjD7vd4   sweet! just ordered the vinyl edish from dark descent! can't wait! \m/   Wow, one of my favorite albums of all time.  I picked this up on cassette in 1989, at Warehouse Records in the Del Monte Shopping Center in Monterey, CA.  That was back in the day when you bought a tape just cuz it had a killer cover...no other reason. \m/   so many great CSA's around here. Tierra, Twin Palms Ranch, Tara Firma, Bloomfield Organics just to name a few.   MylesAhead is all about O-lifting, not powerlifting.  I squat   pull @ Powerhouse. \m/  	56

 They need to alert Brock and Reigns to plan out a new finish to the match. Hence they needed all three at the same time for this. The Stomp = F5 = Spear = Stomp = pin looks like it was planned with detail, and won't happen if any one of them was out of the loop   They need to plan the cash in sequence with all three people for the finisher ballet to work.   Holy shit, it's only around 2 minutes from Rollins running down the aisle to him winning the belt?  watching it live, at the time it felt like 10 minutes to me      Meltzer believes that Lesnar was fully informed of the new plan before he signed his new contract last Tuesday.  This I think is the most crucial part of that. It shows that the creative already had it planned, but kept it from both Seth and Reigns. The decision might even be because of Bork himself, as he might have refused a new contract if he was pinned.  Reigns and the whole Anoa'i family might have been told after Royal Rumble that he would win, but they changed heart after all the heat he is getting, which makes sense with all the dirtsheet news we are reading  Or, this is just an elaborate April Fool by Meltzer      Efficiency. It's not just purely down to the lower revs. A Le Mans engineer once said that any noise is just wasted energy. And with the 100kg fuel limit, engine manufacturers had to make engine as efficient as they can.   chicken and egg problem. They need races on the track to get money to upgrade teh fencing           I don't even realise it's April 1      Enzo as Fry  eyepatch Carmella as Leela  Big Cass as Bender   I thought it's a football chant?   650D + 70-200 F4 + 1.4 extender. The lens has no IS, so some pics do look blurry if the panning is too fast   weird. Works fine for me  http://imgur.com/lvZccNu here's another link. I kinda hate imgur for deleting the exif tho   http://wakarimasenlol.com/20150327wall-_MG_5860.jpg     It is. Genii has a working relationship with Proton to use the Lotus name, hence they will feature the logo whenever they race in Malaysia   http://i.imgur.com/Nz4P1oj.jpg  Also this is my current wallpaper   Turn 15. It's free entry and free roam on Friday so you can just go to anywhere and everywhere you want. Sadly I forgot to go to the turn one and only realised I could get good pictures there after i got home   celeb inductee and WM is in California and Ahnold is a friend of Bruno      You mean Reigns   I had it since it was first launched. And the reason was simple. I am not from the USA and for some reason the PPV is never shown in HD here. But it was smooth sailing today. And I was using a VPN, not even a direct connection   So we will be seeing another Taker match?    Because it's to plug a movie?   "Hey Paul, you need to go out to this Terminator theme so we can plug the new Arnold movie"  "No, I ain't doing it"  "We will let you get over Sting..."  "okay hand me the damn helmet"   Depends. The Rock has limited in ring abilities but he's a charming guy on the mic and entertaining, hence why even casuals loved him.   I can see female liking Reigns, but male casuals? Not at his current level of mic ability   Triple Action Bed Match between Seth and J J Security?   Was smooth.  Ironic part? I'm not even in the country listed to get the Network, and I have to use a VPN. Even I was surprised that it stayed smooth   It was to plug in Ahnold's movie. And it's best for Trips to be the sacrificial goat for it rather than anybody else   He was just acting   I don't doubt Hogan. He's been pushing for another match for a while so he's sure to be fit. But Nash? Man, DDP did wonders   FCUK YES THIS IS AWESOME! REIGNS DID NOT WIN AND LESNAR IS NOT CHAMPION! MARKING OUT!    NOTICE ME STING-SEMPAI!   Kane and Big Show. This feels like Royal Rumble all over again   This is because the HOF ran late, so they put the most illustrious name just after the middle so people could just go to sleep after it and watch Diesel the next day on repeat   the fact that Punk uses the dot to make sure everyone sees the original tweet means that it was not really serious in the first place.    Fujinami has already been inducted by Woooo!   PLENTY OF HOES!  Someone print a T-Shirt of this   http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-f-to-pay-respects   HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE WORM!   Please press F for the rest of the night   Whoever control that mic should get a pay raise   if you are a part of a twin you're highly likely would get a twin offspring as well   I was actually expecting to see Brooke with Bully Ray and then I remembered it was just a TNA storyline :/   What's the sound like coins dropping when he downshifts?      He was not at ONS. It was all Dreamer and Heyman   Sadly El Ray is not an option to other countries, such as Asians   At full res, the quality is not what you would call good, say compared to /u/IncredibleThings   I just realised that after you mentioned it and went back to see my pics  http://i.imgur.com/sDmRs57.jpg  You're right, can't seem to see it here    Friday is always like this tbh due to it still a working day. The front grandstand has quite the crowd by the end of FP1 and start of FP2   Hamilton's car being towed (heat haze is not camera effect)  http://i.imgur.com/HrqGUef.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/yHa2Xju.png   http://i.imgur.com/QWVZv7n.jpg  Cars are definately louder this year   http://i.imgur.com/98dXcyH.jpg  Thankfully it did not slam into the walls without tyre barriers   I was wondering why it was Bridgestone when I realised it's not from this year      I have always loved WWE's Legend of Wrestling. They usually get the people that in the know and most will yield some sort of interesting story of backstory. And they are willing to talk about other wrestling promotion in the show as well.      I use borderlinx to get a USA and UK mailing address. I usualy just use Hola plugin to view the network. Note that sometimes you won't be fast enough on vpn to view live shows on the network on HD, but non live shows are usually fine for me.    Nothing new. Basically what Brawn did for the 2009 season where he prepared everything two seasons prior and caught everyone with their pants down   You mean 90% of the world?  But thank you         https://vimeo.com/120105946  OSW did a review on the rumble. It's more funnier and exciting when listening to the guys explaining each match   F   scan it, and get a shop to print a larger version. Don't worry if it looks blurred due to enlargement. Since if it goes on TV it will look smaller and sharper   During the design Tilke made sure that you can basically see half of the track from wherever you are seating, hence why the hills are abundant around the track to create a theater like natural stands   Bottom of the car could have hit the driver's head   Triple H for me was the character that suits the situation.  Need a heel for a babyface to get over? Get HHH  Need a babyface for a hell to get over? Get HHH  Need a hell for a B+ player to get over? Get HHH            Mosanto Weed Killer   I honestly think if his engine did not develop a problem at Hungary he could have won that race   Yes   KLCC for obvious reasons (Petronas)      Also as long as they (Mercs) are winning or near the top, other teams would want their engines, which in turn would be profitable in the long run as well.    iirc the biggest merchandise movers are the kids that would ask their parents to buy them stuffs.  Smarks would look at the price, balk and walk away   Helps that he's charismatic as hell and I was surprised to know that NXT is his first wrestling stint. He looks so comfortable in the ring and with the crowd   She should get Snoop Dog to do her Main Roster song   They could make her (him) wear some generic cosplay for weekly and house shows, and get a licensed costume + song for PPVs ala Finn Balor   "So this is where the big boys plays huh?"   And it does not even have to be a diva. They could make it ala Nagashima Yuichirou.    Who was Mr America   You're right. Didn't notice that it's still 28nm. Might be they are still struggling to manufacture/fabricate 22nm chips for it to be financially viable for end users   The card is heavy and the reference design does not have a backplate. Wait for ASUS or MSI to manufacture one with backplate. Not only it keeps the card from sagging, it dissipate heat better too   I don't think you can use a VRAM the same way as you can use your onboard RAM, correct me if I'm wrong tho ^^;   Just woke up. Sorry. It's morning in Asia and I had a long day  - Gallery updated with some more pics, but since the NDA has long gone, you guys should have seen pictures/benchmarks floating from other sites already  - 3D Mark score for Firestrike Extreme http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/6261359  - In comparison, a GTX980 running on the same machine http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/5555099  - Card is quite hot. Nvidia should find another design to be honest. Can't wait for an MSI or ASUS version with a proper backplate      Sample, hence the NDA   DX11.2 / Win8.1 sadly.   I don't think Twitch would mind if it's from NVIDIA or AMD since it's mostly about gaming at the end   Ironically doing just that. Rendering a 6Mbps VC1 video to two pass 3Mbps H264 while running Assetto Corsa.    If you seen or touched the Nvidia engineering sample GTX980, it's basically the same.    yes   ironically twitch is all twitchy for me. Ustream is smoother   6 more hours. ;-)  They are showing the keynote live as well: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/gpu-technology-conference-2015   not until the NDA is over sadly. Sorry mate :/      They would let a wrestler do it, if they tell Vince in advance that they are doing it.   CM Punk did it to Cena without clearance and was reprimanded. I don't see any problem for Bork to do it if he gets the proper clearance   Apparently Vince thought when people points to the WM sign it looks weird so they add the play button, implying they are pressing that   Also while people (and even WWE) make it sounds like he inherited the business, he bought out the company from his father.   Hopefully I won't be a McLaren. At least Virgin fought to be Manor  That aside, not all press conference are shown or aired. For example the one after the British GP where Hamilton got his hand on the real trophy and shown it to the media was not aired. We only knew it after journalist tweeted the picture out   Honda CAN give them engines, just not this year, as they have an exclusive deal with McLaren. And looking back at today, Helmut Marko would rather have the Renault than the Honda   This is from the media press conference right? They usually never record/show this on TV. Unless FIA releases them on their youtube channel   http://www.fia.com/championship/events/fia-formula-1-world-championship/2015/2015-australian-grand-prix  Everything is there  http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/championship/documents/20150315/2015_01_AUS_F1_R0_Timing_RaceLapAnalysis_V01.pdf  Specifically you want this one   for us (since we borrow Arabic names in Malaysia) "" is pronounced Nasir (Na-seer) here  But yeah, it's highly different from "Massa"   http://osp001feh-vod.hls.adaptive.level3.net/web/live/wif.html   Random stupid question. Was watching the qualy replay and there was a mention that Manor's old base has been sold to Haas.   Could two teams share a base? For example, Manor rent some space from their old base/factory from Haas.    There should be a list of all the bumps Hebner took in his career      This just in  Bernie's not interested in sparks for 2016, hires Michael Bay to put TNT on random cars for each races   Ah, that means you will be able to access http://www.racematelive.com/  It's Fox Sports F1 companion site, where they stream onboard, live timing, pit lane camera, etc. Region locked to the country that they are showing F1 tho   Asia   Because I've been watching it for the last few years?   The irony is the BBC needs him as much as he needs the BBC.   The reason that Top Gear works is that Top Gear buys most the cars (with taxpayer's money mind you) they feature on the show (except for special cars like from Ferrari), hence when the presenters gave some bad reviews, car companies can't retaliate. This is what makes Top Gear special, as they can basically say what they want without repercussion, something other car shows, which the cars are sponsored, can't do   Why not just get the old Arrows three seater? Get a paid rich kid in the third seat. That way you can have money AND have an actually good driver driving the car   Is the mechanic on top of the roof drunk? :D      True. I had a hard time finding Sin Cara's matches in the network   IIRC Billy Gunn and Road Dogg are also travelling with the WWE show hence they need someone that is always at the performance centre to be the head trainer   *Every time Corey Graves hands over the mic*  "Hey yo!"   Hence the NXT special you see happening this week. For a PPV, no.  They have an agreement with FSU, and it's better for the students of FSU to see and learn in FSU itself. Remember, the students are NOT learning how to be a WWE staff, but they are learning how to produce a TV show in general   As much as I also wants to see this, it won't happen. The Takeover special is always done at Full-Sail for the students there to learn how WWE makes a live show/PPV.     Mercedes-AMG GT S and Mercedes-AMG C 63 S respectively.         I have question dear Mr Bork sir, does Mr Bork prefer fighting with Goat Man, or Steroid Infused Man for the gold shiny thing?       Scott speed  Isn't Scott an American?   Watching it in a cinema is awesome, especially with the 7.1 audio.   - animation is as good as it can be, but the CGI sometime looks overdone. I love how the crowd was animated/CGI'ed. They do not look copy pasted, but looks like a crowd of individuals  - I know the manga was kind of funny. But I never expected they would keep it in the movie. Lucifer/Ral adventure was kinda weird to watch, but man it was funny  - After watching this, now I realised why Char/Casval hated Amuro. He was the original angsty, emo kid in a death machine and Amuro stole that gimmick   http://i.imgur.com/PbMFBfG.jpg thank god they are showing it on cinema here      Didn't they do this for most of their cars? I remember there was an article on the Red Bull in Hungary (I forgot which year) that they arrived expecting it to be hot, but after finding out the temp is not that high, they paneled off the cooling vents   because only 6 cars have cameras in them per race?   	139
 I guess what got me was the fact that, in order to look powerful, I would have to be a lesbian? Haha   Yeah, I don't know either...   I was wearing tight black dress pants, a black blazer and black heels at work.    I've been asked by a coworker (in front of other coworkers) if I spit or swallow... No matter what my response was, it would have been incredibly awkward. I laughed and just walked away and I heard him say "she swallows..."    At that point, I figured "fuck it" and I walked back and said "yeah, I do. I can't believe you asked me that, but whatever. I'm not ashamed." He was surprised I answered, but I'd rather come off as confident than have them make up their own stories for what I choose to do in my personal life. *shrug*   Yesterday, I got two...    * I like your boobies! * You look hot! Like a power lesbian or something...  I work in a bar, so I get a lot of weird comments and compliments from drunk people.   I find that it's really hard to gauge! Sometimes they're walking *just slow enough* to have it be awkward if I hold it, but have it close in their face if I don't. **Life is so hard!**   A Bloody Mary.   Or, you know, going for a run and sweating it off, despite wanting to commit suicide.   Dr. Pepper, man..... That shit is a symphony of flavors!   I tend to like a lot of the weird drinks. Celery Soda, Moxie, Ginger beer, Birch Beer...   Reddit.  I didn't like the way the layout worked, but once I gave it a fair shot, I was hooked.   **Edit:** Thanks to whomever gilded this comment! I feel warm and fuzzy inside :3   "Enjoy all of the diseases you don't have antibodies for!"   And with that, I puff into a cloud of smoke and disappear before they kill me for being a witch.   I am really good at ignoring/walking away from people who annoy the crap out of me. When I'm sober, I sit there, painfully, and listen to people's incessant dribble all while looking like I'm the most interested person in the world.   The perfect formula for predicting the success and quality pun comment threads   Always. It gets awkward when they are walking really slowly and I just stand there like a fool waiting for them. Btw, I'm a girl. Politeness goes both ways! :)   Cocktail waitress here.... Taking drinks off of my tray when I have a large party. I have it down to a very delicate balance, damn it!   .... Jesus. :(   Bless your heart! I've been there and it's brutal. Glad to see you having fun with it!   I don't really work out, but I should... I really like kettlebells and I ride a bike for commuting purposes, but I mostly just try to watch what I eat, haha...   If my non-existent baby was a girl I'd name her Wynona Ryder, hahah. Or Lucille II...   I have a cat named [Hercules](http://i.imgur.com/NnTBvzI.jpg) whom I love very much. I would also looooove to have a pet fox or raccoon, though!   -professional fart noises-   3D printing is the way of the futuuuuure! I hear that organic matter can also be printed 3D! Wild.   Thank you!!!!! :D   Haha I'm thankful this is something I now know about   Smart move. I can totally relate. You go girl!   1: nope! I work at a bar that's underground so no one will wanna go. We are clooooosed :)   2: only in my bedroom so I've been a hermit lately, haha...   3: ummm... I've been fond of rye manhattans for a while now. I also really like most gin drinks. Tom Collins are my jam and pimm's cup :)   [I like to draw and some people think I'm good at it :)](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com/)   Okay! I usually default to animals. Do you have a favorite?   I don't think so! But if you want, I can show you my profile...    No, I sadly don't have a dishwasher. Melissa has got me one upped on that... I have always wondered if people often try to pee in litter boxes at crowded parties though...   I looked nothing like an Asian baby and was confused for an Asian teen mom   Yes! What would you like?   1: George Michael   2: the phantom contractions   3: cloth because I hate myself...     Well if they could, they would chuck it not very far... Unless they were up chucking wood ;)   1: Dark if anything... I'm not a huge fan of sweets, though! I prefer olives :)   2: I love scrambled eggs with cheddar and hot sauce! Fresh tomato and avocado on the side with lemon juice and salt. Simple and delicious!   3: None because they're pussies and have no chucking abilities   1: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds   2: Fuck Tom Cruise, Marry Gary Busey, Kill Mel Gibson (obvi)   3: Hell yeah! I need to get significantly drunk to handle the crazy that entails, though...   OH GOD WHAT DID I MISS?   I like your shirt! Where did you get it? Are you gonna tell work you quit or just not show up? That's what I did with my last job :3      At least there is video evidence -weeps-   hahahah damn it! I'm so happy there is video evidence   Holy shit Melissa actually exists?!   Yes I'm so happy you got a screencap of this!   likewise! :D   this is the funniest thing I have ever witnessed   Hi I am Shea, the creep that was lurking in your hangout :)   Spain is so fun! I happened to be in Valencia at the right time this year and got to participate in Las Fallas. Such fun! I'm a little envious you're there and I'm no longer. It's a beautiful place.  Also, you're a babe.   Well excuuuuuuuuse me, princess!   I'll post more in the comments as I continue to write this out. I just really need to get this out somewhere... I apologize for my crappy writing skills.     Its been a long time since Ive openly written about what my life was like growing up.  A part of me has been putting it off because Im not sure how vividly I remember it but despite the amount of time Ive had to move past it, I am still affected by it somewhat regularly.     First off, a little backstory may help:   Before I was born, my mother was married to an Israeli man. I have an older brother who was born in 1986. I am not sure how long she had been with my father prior to that, but I was born two years later. My mother was a model in the eighties. Nothing noteworthy, but from what I gather, she did well for herself. She was a beautiful woman and met my father through a friend of hers. My father was a wealthy businessman who owned a limousine service and invested in a few local restaurants. My father had property in NY and MA; possibly more, but I am not certain.   In 1988, my father was arrested for drug charges that pointed to him as the leader of a Brookline cocaine ring. Based on the legal documents I could find, he had been responsible for trafficking somewhere in the realm of 350 kilos of cocaine from 1986 to 1988 and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.     Growing up, I didnt know my father. I knew of him through idle mention, but my mother had already settled down with a new man during my infancy. As far as I was concerned, my stepfather David was whom I called daddy. Growing up, I remember him as a very good father- he was goofy, loving, supportive, etc. He was the co-owner of a motel in Old Orchard Beach, Maine where we would spend the majority of our summers. My childhood seemed pretty great in a general sense- I was provided food, shelter, and often, love. From an early age, however, my parents fought a lot. I used to be a pretty happy and outgoing toddler, but there was often fighting in the home that my brother and I would bear witness to.   I suppose I should preface that mother is bipolar. Being the youngest and most sensitive child, I was often subjected to psychological, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my mother. Children are inherently needy; they rely on their parents to be a support system during their upbringing and, while I was provided with a lot of love and great experiences growing up, there was an insidious darkness in our home that grew steadily over time.     To summarize what life was like growing up, here are a few memories I have, both good and bad, in as close to chronological order as my memory will allow.    *  My mother used to sing songs to me while running her nails through my hair as I fell asleep. I often asked her to sing me sad songs because from an early age, I was all too familiar with crying myself to sleep (and the deep comfort it brought)   * My mother threw wonderful, extravagant Christmas parties for her friends that were always such a joy to participate in. The preparation it took prior, however, weighed on her and she often took it out on my brother and me. One vivid memory I have was of her slapping me and shoving my face into a cookie wrapper I left on my bedroom floor; she shamed me like an owner shames their dog for having an accident.   * If I wasnt polite or if I spoke out of line, I would be smacked on the mouth and shamed into submission. My aunt recalls a time that she took me into the city during one of her visits; she said that I waited for her at the door with my little suitcase packed and refused to leave the doorway. She bought me a stuffed Pumba doll from the Disney store and when I came home, I insisted that it was okay that I had it because it was on sale and that I wasnt a burden and/or hadnt coaxed my aunt into buying me frivolous things.   *  One time, my mother stabbed my stepdad with a steak knife. My brother, stepdad and I spent the night in a motel and he called us out of school the next day. I dont remember much, but I remember sitting in silence in his car in the rain while he thought about what to do. We returned home the next day.   * In middle school, I remember my mother beating me and mocking/shaming me particularly bad. I was already picked on pretty bad in school and didnt want to show up puffy faced and disheveled, so I skipped school and instead hid in our family van. Since I didnt have a watch, I returned home at what I thought was an appropriate time, only to be berated further.   * Some nights, when I couldnt sleep, my mother and I used to dance to Roy Orbison records in our pajamas until I was tired.    * During thunder storms, my mother allowed my brother and me to draw on all of the mirrors and windows with washable markers.   *  My mom was amazing at sewing and often created our Halloween costumes, wedding clothes, holiday garb, etc. from scratch. The house was always decorated beautifully for holidays, and my mother made the most creative Easter baskets, threw the most fun Easter egg hunts, etc.     When my mother was a good mom, she was the best. When she was bad mom, she really made life a living hell. My stepdad is the kind of man that secretly needs a woman to bully or control him. I spent my whole childhood believing that it was normal for my dad to sleep on the couch downstairs. He did his best to protect me when he was home and I always idolized him as my protector and my best friend. Despite his aloof urgings, I was still subjected to consistent, sporadic shaming, beatings, mockery and threats. My own mother would get drunk nightly and call me a cunt; I was told that I was a loser, unwanted, a drama queen, etc. on a too-regular basis. The mother I loved was the living embodiment of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. For fourteen years, I familiarized my beautiful mother as the volatile monster, dormant only when she was left alone to sit in the pantry and chain smoke cigarettes and binge on Coors Light.     After fourteen years and countless character and body shaming, physical and psychological beatings, and having to carry my mother to bed drunk, my mother kicked my stepdad out. Loud fights, name-calling and character bashing were a nightly occurrence and my stepdad just endured the abuse like a prisoner afflicted with Stockholm syndrome. It was less than a week later that I followed; I had confessed to my therapist that my mother had beaten me pretty badly on our staircase (the first confession I outwardly made to my therapist, or anyone else, in fourteen years). I was sick of being treated like garbage, and since my stepfather was gone, the abuse only got worse. I remember so vividly the moment my therapist, Gerarda, asked me if I was certain that I wanted to make such a claim, because it would change my life forever. I told her I was, but I had no idea how much my life would change from there.      I LIKE HOW EVERYTHING IS ALL CAPS EXCEPT FOR no balls LOL ISNT THAT FUNNI   Some restaurants I haven't seen here:  * [Tavern Road](http://tavernroad.com/) - Fort Point * [Shiki](http://shikibrookline.com/menu/) - Brookline * [Seiyo](http://seiyoboston.com/) - South End  Also, gonna echo these recco's:       Craigie on Main,   Ribelle,   The Publick House,   Oleana,   Toro,   Dali,   The Gallows,   Russell House Tavern,   Eastern Standard,   Lone Star (alternatively, Deep Ellum as well), etc.    oh my....   Oh my god, my ovaries   Oh, I know what's coming :)  edit: but I WANT TO BE HER      I can't get killed because there already is a main character named Shae in the books/show. :(  Granted, my name is Shea, but it's pronounced the same.   How is this not getting more attention?! Damn fine.   [A school consists of all male, smaller fish and one female, larger fish. When she dies, the largest of the males changes gender to become the dominant fish within the school](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/08/clownfish-are-all-born-male-a-dominant-male-will-turn-female-when-the-current-female-of-the-group-dies/)  I tried to tell a guy who was wearing a shirt with a clownfish on it at a bar that it was a great way to pickup ladies... All you have to do is correlate it to the equivalent of "chicks are the better, dominant gender in some species" or some stupid shit...  ps: I am a female. I am also an ass at bars, though.   [Here you, go...

 Hey, no problem!   Tweet this at him! It's really good honestly      Bush did 9/11  Dick Cheney benefited from the Iraq war  Jet fuel can't melt steal beams  Obama is a lizard person  #Illuminati   Just look up "Chance The Rapper [song] Remix" and look through the results. You're bound to find something    Ah, I see. Well that's cool. I personally think it would have been better w/ no drop and just like a really nice remix and warp of the vocals and all that jazz.   Did you find this off the A Capella remix someone posted?   OG just means it has "Nike Air" on the toungue.  I have no idea if they're legit or not, but that's what that means.   You obtained these for fucking $13.   Wat.      [These] (http://www.greats.com/products/the-bab-triple-black)  [These] (http://www.greats.com/products/the-royale-nero-black)  [Or these] (http://www.greats.com/products/the-royale-high-triple-black)      The Thrift God, Paul Cantu  SneakerHeadInTheBay  YoAnty  HesKicks   Thank you for making me laugh like a dying seal in the middle of my Math class.   Ah, I see.   Holy fucking shit XD  Do U.S. based products generally take that long to get to you?   Alrightie yeah, thismakes a bit of sense. Thanks for the info   I've seen Gel Lyte IIIs and Gel Lyte Vs, but are IVs a thing? If so, could you link a picture?   Is it really? I downloaded it and the title is "Long Time 2"   No, I mean the two different songs off #10Day.   I personally like the latter (Long Time II) a bit more.   I personally don't like the KD 7 Elites. They just look really odd to me. But, good for you man! Wear what you like   I'm with [Tuesday] (http://www.reddit.com/user/Tuesday), I think the Sock Darts are ugly, don't really understand the hype.  Then again, everyone has their own style, so like what you like.   I'm not too big a fan of the Ventilators. But, I can definitely see the appeal in them.  	24
 The Frankfurt School of Finance and the UN Energy Program collaborate together as [FS-UNEP](http://fs-unep-centre.org/). It could be the resource for you.   An *unchecked* desire for profit is evil. Let's say you, hypothetically have a ton of nuclear fissile material. Rather than turning it in to the GOI - you want to have an open auction on it where everyone from Iran to ISIS is invited - and you will sell it to the highest bidder. Why should you be arrested? After all, as per you, you just wanted to profit, and a desire for profit is not evil.   Mail your program coordinator - they often send out mails to current grad students to match them up. And yes, try Craigslist but take the listings with a grain of salt. Also, try calling up [The Apartment Store](http://www.apartmentstore.com/) or the [Vairo Village](http://locations.rentberger.com/vairovillage/). Many grad students live in apartments owned by either of these two companies, and they may be able o help you out.   Yeah, that same woman who destroyed HP. Even though I partially blame HP for hiring her in the first place - considering how it was open knowledge that Fiorina bombed out Bell Labs, setting American science back by decades.   Its a good article - but you can take Akamai as one another example of university research translating to a company.   I suspect timelines. Tangential to the point /u/Vertov_throwaway makes - PhD research is often more fundamental which translate to the market much further down the line, rather than an immediate breakthrough. Also corrollary: how many CS companies are actually based on novel breakthroughs? In fact most of them are succesful because they have the most polished interpretation of an already established idea.   How about a progressive tax - increase the rate with alcohol content? But as a liberal Indian living in the States, I have drunk more than my fair share - I am still not a hundred percent sure about loosening alcohol laws. I have seen enough shit on St. Patrick's day to change my mind on alcohol.   Calibri is a terrible, terrible font. At least use Palatino.    Try the [Boston University's LEAP program](http://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/special-programs/leap/). It gives you a Masters Degree in Biomedical, Computer Systems, Electrical, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical, Photonics, Manufacturing or Systems Engineering in three years. The program is specifically tailored for students who did their undergrad in liberal arts - so it may suit you really well.  I know several students who thrived in this program, and even went on towards PhDs in engineering at either BU or even other really prestigious STEM schools.   I am a bit surprised that ARL was not the target, given its much more sensitive work.   From personal experience - stay with an apartment company rather than an individual landlord. And also, may people sublet their apartments for the summer, or for a semester. Subletting is cheap, and you will have the time to search for a good place, if you don't mind moving again.    Also, interestingly apart from Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota education budgets have been slashed per capita across the nation.   And honestly, while I knew that Louisiana was bad, I did not know that Arizona was worse.   A PhD, even though comes under the purview of education, with all its associated paperwork and degree - is for all purposes an apprenticeship.  It is a relic of an earlier era, one to which graduates of the modern education system often find difficulty adjusting. The modern educational system is defined by structure and standardization - while a PhD is exactly the opposite. In fact if I have to take a guess, increasing standardization across curricula will soon trickle up to the doctorate level too.  I am not raining on the OP at all, in fact academia is filled to the brim with assholes (any department which has more than 15 faculty at least has one). But I am rather commenting on how different the PhD experience is for different people - precisely because it is a multi-year apprenticeship masquerading as a degree.      My adviser absolutely *loves* meetings. Which translates into something like 9 hours a week in the summer. I have tried telling that meeting so much is not very productive, as I cannot get results every alternate day - but I have not been able to convince her.  Fellow subredditors, what is the optimum meeting time per week according to you? And how do you try to achieve that?  	15
 When I washed dishes for a living the head chef suggested the "pissing cow" technique. Stand with your legs as far apart as possible and you'll be a lot lower.   Number 14 just shrunk somebodies laundry.   Give the Celexa another week or so, these types of drug need to build up in your system for a while before they take effect.   Have you explored any non-medical treatments yet? There's so much out there for you to try and everyone has something that will work for them. Don't give up hope, we're all here with you!   That document is brilliant, thanks for sharing!   I actually went for the grab-bag idea in the end. I got the previous speaker to choose the next speaker's item, so that there was always a bit of time for everyone to think about the question. All-in-all I think it went down really well and I got lots of positive comments afterwards!   Looks like a used dog toy!   Similar problem with my wifi in the past, the password was "cuntbubbles".  I have no idea how it came into existence, I blame my flatmates.   This was fascinating, thanks for sharing!   Thank you so much, this is really useful!   Hi everyone,  Tonight I am going to be Table Topics master for my local toastmasters meeting. I have come up with a seasonal theme for this and am feeling well prepared on that front, however I am unsure how to introduce table topics to the group, particularly if there are any new members.  Does anybody have any advice or key topics I should address when introducing this portion of the meeting? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am still awaiting my Leadership manual - it is being shipped to the UK so is taking a long time to arrive.  Thanks in advance!   Glad to see this at the top, the very fact that the quote starts with the word "but" is a red flag.    Thank God you're here, to the top with you!    I always jerk off when I'm tired, helps me sleep.   I don't think anyone in the thread has said it was intentional, at least I don't think anyone was being serious.  I hope...   At my local club we do the CRC method - commendation, recommendation, commendation. Gives the speaker an area to improve in but sandwiches it between praise so they're motivated to do it again.   Last night our topics master had some pretty good ones that she actually used with her Primary School class at the start of year for ice-breaking.   The questions we had were "If you could have any super power, what would it be?", "If you could speak another language, which would you choose and why?", "If you won the lottery, what would you spend it on?" and "Who (living or dead) would be at your dream dinner party?".  They were really fun topics to discuss and quite suitable for beginners too as they're all quite light-hearted.   Hey Alison_Hendrix,  I'm in a very similar position at the moment, just started a Masters degree and it scared the shit out of my when I first got here. I also used to be an overachiever and have found it a bit of a shock how much harder I have to work here!  Turning 22 is a scary age, I couldn't agree more. Everyone says your life will start to fall into place at this age but I can vouch for it not being that simple. You do have to work hard for what you want to achieve, but you CAN do it.  Take a step back from your situation at this very moment and try to stay calm. You're probably using these past couple of months to define who you are at this point in your life, and convincing yourself that you're a person who panics and can't get things done. Try to think of your life in the context of who you were before that as well. You've achieved so much already and with just a little bit of hard work you can achieve everything that you want.  Don't get too hung up on the past, focus on what you need to do in this very moment to succeed.   Oh, and try meditation!  	16
