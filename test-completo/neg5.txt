 Kevin Bacon will be joining and Victoria will be helping out today!   I think I know.    It's a terrible premise combined with terrible characters with a mix of terrible dialogue.    I can't believe that movie got made. Seriously.    I know this movie wasn't received very warmly, but I find it strange that even Coen bros fans don't place this one too high. It is in the same vein as The Big Lebowski in that it is a big much ado about nothing and characters with very familiar and strange quirks. What does R/movies think?   Too many. I wish kids would stick to FB and leave Reddit alone.    That's not the point the writer was making. But thank you for telling us something we already know.    "You still don't get it, do you?"   I seem to always get downvoted when saying ANYTHING remotely critical of this movie, but there just isn't anything special or unique about it. I agree, it's a great movie and there's nothing fundamentally I would change about it, but I feel like people (younger people in particular) see this as their Stand By Me. It is a very good movie, but really isn't something we haven't seen before. Go ahead. Downvote me.    I agree. It wasn't a bad movie at all, but there was nothing unique about it.    Another "mind blowing" fact that gets brought up is John Cazale.    I know folks hated it, but I loved the circlejerk r/movies did on April 1 with Leo and his hand. Def illustrates my point.    Any post where Starship Troopers in mentioned, a long line of posts pop-up saying "you know its satire, right?" as if they are blowing minds. What're yours?    The first and second Left Behind weren't bad at all (insanely better and closer to material than Nick Cage's) and Like Father, Like Son is still hilarious.    Alan Rickman doing his "Bill Clay" in Die Hard still throws me off. I literally have NO IDEA where the difference in his accent is supposed to be. "Ahhhh! Ahh!! You're one of them!" I'm like...we know its you, Hans.    Which dead trio would you like to see come back and make a movie? And what would it be about?   Trace Buster Buster!   I liked this one a lot. Completely unexpected.    John McClane in a battle against himself....to quit smoking.    I'll see this if Bill Paxton returns to talk about his small dick more and drop words like "buttermilk" again.    The anticipated third installment: Fun with Wick and Jane   This time Gary Sinese actually gets to go.    They should play that as a Double Feature with Judd Apatow's next movie: The is 41: Debbie dies   I had never even heard of this and had to look it up. Any good?   City Slickers 3: Come and Get Me   The fake sequel to a movie that explains the premise in its title   What other reasons? He thought Robin Williams would be a better Batman?   Verdict?   WHO THE FUCK UPVOTES THIS SHIT??  	29

 Like constantly walking around with a taser, or having my boyfriend accompany me? I do. The reality is. It can still happen.   Thank you! I'll keep all that in mind! I'll look through some of my favorite books and study up on the dialogue!   Thank you so much! I'll definitely try those!   So, I have a book lined out and ideas completed, but I have a horrible time with dialogue. I know the characters and how they are, but when they talk to one another, it seems like a bad movie or a cheesy rom-com. Any suggestions?   In the novel I'm writing, I plan on having the man in love with the main girl, and she kills him in the end. So many would-be da girls would throw their books across the room. I want to break that stereotype. She then goes on to rule the land without a husband or children   I would totally want to read something like that!      There was a story a lot like your's. I don't remember the name exactly, but she completely ignored its presence and it dissipated after awhile. Might try that.   I think that the pros just didn't like Reach and 4, so they quit because most of them came back for MCC competitions.   He is so beautiful! I will post a picture when I get his Christmas presents! Baby socks! Also, sorry about the deleted reply! I didn't realize I was on my boyfriend's account!   Sure will! :)  	11

 Sometimes I don't get geeks, even though I've been one myself for most of my life.  I loved both of the reboot films /because/ they were different.   On this subject, does anyone know what became of the cars after they were abandoned? Surely someone, somewhere took a picture (intact or otherwise)...   for private plates you have to renew every year and if you don't it reverts back to the original plate number   Just to be a pedant, this isn't actually true.   Private plates on /retention/ (that is, not on a car but rather on a piece of paper) have to be renewed annually, but private plates on a car remain with the car for life, or until the owner transfers it away to another car (or retention). If you sell the car, the plates go with it and, in fact, its been known for cheap cars to change hands at inflated prices so the buyer can transfer the plate into his Merc ;-)    Yeah, but have they turned up again?   I'm guessing you don't travel so much. Or read. Or anything....   Is it me or has Button's signature been flipped...?   Can't be as sure about Fred's, but JB's certainly looks backward to me :-)   ...or she said no because he was daft enough to spend such a ridiculous percentage of his income on something so trivial!   Scots are, by absolute, incontrovertible fact, also British. They can deny it all they want, but it doesn't make it any less true! Scotland is part of Great Britain and (arguably, more importantly) also part of the United Kingdom. Obviously, a good percentage of Scots aren't tremendously happy with this, but plenty are and, as a country, they decided to remain part of the union.   For myself, I was brought up in Scotland (though I be a sassenach at heart) and though I now reside elsewhere, I'm proud of what little Scottishness I absorbed in my time there.  I have spent many a happy day in Glasgow (in fact, the last time I stayed was in the very hotel being shown on these horrible pictures) and I feel deeply sad for those affected by this. I don't suppose it was anything more than a tragic accident, but that doesn't make it any less awful :-/   How awful :-(  It sounds like the driver was unconscious at the time. Not sure of his condition, but if it were me, I'm not sure I'd want to come back...   Errr, it is.  Great Britain, typically referred to as "Britain" includes Scotland and thus Glasgow. Of course you could have also been referring to The United Kingdom and of course that too includes Glasgow (they voted for that and everything!)  Leaving this aside, nasty scenes in Glasgow that I don't think anyone, North or South of the border wants to see :-/   3rd Jesus?  Oh yes, of course. The fat one balances the two skinny ones.  /python   I think I've stumbled on official Reddit idiot day or something.   Did I miss an announcement?   Not quite sure that Rubens was quite as chilled out as perhaps he came across on the day. This gives a different take on it:  http://www.grandprix247.com/2012/05/10/barrichello-reveals-how-ferrari-forced-him-to-lose-2002-austrian-gp/  In effect, he argued with the team for 8 laps and in the end, they threatened to sack him if he didn't let Schumacher past. Rubens had no choice but concede and I'm amazed at his composure after the race!   I'd just like to say that very little of this applies to the EU for the majority of people. The US is simply insane in what people will accept as normal!  I work 40 hours (although I do oversee updates on evenings occasionally). Rarely work outside of normal hours IG I can help it.  I always smile when I see the US referred to as the land of the free...I think this doesn't apply to the inhabitants :-/   Looked OK to me :-)   Excellent. Not seen that for years - great watch.   Charlie Cooks Favourite Book by Julia Donaldson and Alex Scehffler. I still know it off by heart even though it's been a couple of years since I least read it with the kids!  Highly recommended :-)  http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/140503470X   Err, its the 25th November.... Early?   Did you notice Maldonado rushing to find an extinguisher to put it out?  No, neither did I...   I liked that too - obviously they too agreed that it was a suitable summing up of their season.   Have an upvote - Next time get your sorry ass up earlier!   Yup, and he's British too.  Were all so prou.... oh, wait.   Real or not?   Obviously CG, but intended to be built?   Nope. Just nope.   What on earth did I just watch?   Well that's it - I'm sticking to Formula 1. At least there's no corruption there....  Oh.   There's also pressure building against energy drinks too.... Red Bull might be next!   People are talking about football, but all I see is hand-egg.....    Her frustration is matched solely by the fear that this could happen to any one of us.  Nope, not even the smallest chance.  I'm still astonished by what you guys in the richest country in the world have ended up with for healthcare!   When "push to pass" meant afterburners!    I remember Top Gear talking about some Scandinavian banger racing series that worked to the same system:  You could spend whatever you like on your car, but if a competitor wants to buy it off you, you /must/ sell it for 500 (or similar). Such a system was self regulating, easily policed and kept the series low-cost for everyone.  I like the idea of Vijay walking into the Red Bull garage and buying their car for 250,000 :-)   F1 is not a sport. It's a business.  Simple.   Name calling?

 [Here's](http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/08/28/josh-gordon-suspension-browns-nfl-legal-options) a solid read in regards to Gordon's legal options.      All valid points and you are right to say that a single payer system may not be the most efficient system for the US. I can't say what system would be more efficient.  I do think that the US needs tighter control over its healthcare system, with the ACA the country is moving in the right direction.  The top 3 (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan) most efficient systems do have tight controls over their systems even though the implementations of each system are quite different from on another. Sources: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/29/most-efficient-healthcare_n_3825477.html   http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-efficient-health-care-countries    A single payer system in the US would go a long way in solving this issue.    Good luck with your interviews! And thanks for the responses everyone. Your insights have been quite helpful.  I think I will end up going back to school in the fall to take a few comp sci courses to have a better foundation in that field, as well as taking a couple more math classes (calc 2 and linear algebra).  From that point I hope to apply to a grad program.  In the meantime I will try to learn as much R, Python and data science/ ML concepts in order to develop my own projects and try my hands on a few Kaggle competitions.  Hopefully this works out well, and thanks again.   I do have projects in mind, and have thought of participating in a Kaggle competitions as I go forward in my studies and improve. However, since I don't have the proper educational background would all that be enough to convince a potential employer to hire me?      I just graduated with an accounting BS from CUNY Hunter, but dont want to pursue a job or career in that field.  I am more interested in the data science/analytics and visualization field.  I have taken math and stats courses (Calc 1, a basic Sats course, and an Econometrics course), and I have also taken a Comp Sci 1 course, which taught some C++.  I am currently doing some self-learning focusing on Python (Learn Python the Hard Way), R (Courseras Computing for Data Analysis), and Databases (Stanfords Intro to DB MOOC) and later moving onto Caltechs Learning from Data course.  Im not sure if Im wasting my time or I am better off going back to school and take more Comp Sci and Math courses.  Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.   McCarthy just said, in his press conference, that Lacy "should play."     I thought adults knew better...   Yea there is that possibility. However there are apps that let you use either a smartphone or tablet as a remote for the android mini pc.  I currently use the droidmote app on my galaxy s3 or nexus 7 to control an asus tf700t connected to my tv.  There's also a cheapcast app that emulates certain features of chromecast (ie Youtube casting) that one could also use.    Android mini pc's are currently available.  This product doesn't sound much different than those.  The biggest difference, and an important one, is that it does come directly from Google so quicker OS updates will be available.   Wilfork was healthy at the time, NE run defense has been non-existent since his injury.  Like you noted Spiller was unhealthy during the Miami game so.  Pitt is a better run defense than JAX according to DVOA coming into this week: http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef  That Pitt game, the whole Bills offense was just awful, it was Manuel's first game back from his knee injury.  It was just good to see Spiller play with the same explosiveness he had last year, even when he came back after limping off the field.        It all depends on who your other receivers are.  I know ppl are excited about what Brown has done the past couple of weeks but that was against 2 awful defenses.  Haden is really damn good, brown is probably in the mid-teens for WR this week.  	15
 With the exception of the first 2-3 episodes the CG for Space Battleship Yamato 2199 were great. The space battles are amazing.   The inconsistent quality of character animation remained distracting though. At first, I thought it was the weird combo of CG and limited animation frame rate but the characters really just had robotic animation. Oh well, sacrifices had to be made to produce those awesome full animated (24 fps) action scenes.  Hopefully Polygon fixed their character animation for Ronia, the Robbers Daughter .      [Space Dandy Finale - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/space-dandy-s2-episode-13.html)      More shorts from the same director (Hiroyasu Ishida)  [Rain Town](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLAfM1RXwRs)  [Fumiko's Confession](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0iH9XpzD7Y)   The action looked good with nice camera movement. The MC and her sister's CG model looked fine but everything else was an eyesore.  The worst thing about this was those 10 minutes had zero storytelling.      We need more Gintama. I miss Kagura.      [Zankyou no Terror Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/zankyou-no-terror-episode-11.html)   Such a heartwarming show about friendship, growth and finding a joy in something among friends.  Even though there's an overload of cuteness (which I didn't mind) and a few sappy moments, the show didn't really depend on these to carry the characters and the story. These were just aspects that complemented the core of the show, which is the sincerity of the bond between these characters.         Lovely use of [eyeline match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeline_match) in this [sequence](http://imgur.com/a/M9S2k). First we see Tanaka looking out the window. The reflection of the crows makes it obvious what's he's looking at. Then it cuts to the crows themselves. Next cut is Daichi looking up at the same crows. A nice flowing continuity from one shot to another that also creates a sense of connection between the two characters.  [Haikyuu!! Episode 25 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-25.html)   Let's see. Saazbaum attempted to kill the person that Slaine loves the most and started a war that killed millions or maybe billions of people. Then Saazbaum learned that the princess was still alive and made his intention to kill her clear to Slaine. And yet Slaine felt compelled to save him.  There's very little between Slaine and Saazbaum that should outweigh his love for Seylum or simple logic. Yes, Saazbaum spared his life but it wasn't exactly out of mercy or that he valued him as a person. The thought process of, "Hey, I would totally kill you but I owe your father one" isn't exactly a sign of goodwill. If that was enough then Slaine isn't so bright. Well, maybe I'm discounting the effectiveness of Saazbaum's slide show presentation of his feelings.   As heart-wrenching that episode was the lasting impression is how the clumsy writing made Slaine look like a huge idiot, which really shouldn't be the case.    He sure found a balanced diet.      [Tokyo Ghoul Episode 12 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/tokyo-ghoul-episode-12.html)   Probably should've done hair loss treatment and transplant earlier in the balding process like Tom Brady did so it wouldn't have been as noticeable. Well, Brady also had the advantage of wearing a helmet.   Haven't seen the show but I approve of using a Soil and Pimp song for the [OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQf-NkWz7Yo). We need more Soil and Pimp in anime.   The last two episodes adapted the most emotional parts of the manga really well. Dare I say, it did them even better since I didn't get these feel while reading the manga.  People want a second season but this might be one of those rare times that an anime original ending might be preferable. Unless you're in a mood for wishy washy romance melodrama. I certainly was at the time so I still found it entertaining  but there was a definite drop-off in quality.   The OVA sold well. I'm hoping that would encourage making another season.       I would totally watch an anime about some dude romancing a single mother.    This strike anyone else as being... low?  I'm guessing that the majority of the hype was due to Netflix picking it up, which doesn't really affect Japanese sales. Nonetheless, great show.  The manga is not really popular so these sales seem fine. Also the series is only sold as BDs, which is baffling. Not having it available in DVD is money left on the table.    The talk with Takeda and the meal were delicately well handled. They were those scenes that let the moment speak for itself and let the audience absorb what's happening.  edit: [Haikyuu!! Episode 24 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-24.html)      I love how moody the intro was. Kind of wish that the episode maintained that.  I think the storyboarding carried that scene. The insert shots of the glasses were timed so well with the dialogue.  [Space Dandy S2 Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/space-dandy-s2-episode-11.html)   That "Queen" Revy. Damn.   To be fair, I think fitting large amount of exposition into the story is easier done in books than a visual medium.      Maybe he has a doting younger sister holding back his power.   This show actually handles escalation quite well. Despite Tatsuya being OP as hell his feats remain exciting because they don't get flaunted that often until the right moments.      [Zankyou no Terror Episode 9 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/zankyou-no-terror-episode-9.html)   Here's a few resources:  Cinematography:  http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/  http://collegefilmandmediastudies.com/cinematography/  http://www.indietips.com/category/cinematography/  [Cinematography: Theory and Practice](https://soma.sbcc.edu/users/davega/filmpro_170/FILMPRO_170_Text/Cinematography_Theory%20and%20Practice%202ndEd.pdf)  If you want to look into composition more:   http://photoinf.com/  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPRAH7AKMWw  Shameless plug: [Anime Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/)   Your complaint has been less and less of a problem lately, at least with the shows that I've been watching. Take Akame ga Kill for example. It's a rather low budget looking show but the dialogues are handled competently.  Let's use this scene as an example: http://a.pomf.se/olnybc.webm  Shot by shot breakdown  Establishing shot  a wide shot that gives a sense of time and place. The two characters are at a dinner table and its late afternoon (sunset colored sunlight)  Medium close-up of prime minister  High angle shot behind the prime minister with the camera tilting  yes this fits your complaint about characters talking while facing away from the camera but this actually serves a purpose. The camera tilting to the prince is a visual of the dialogue flow with him at the receiving end.  Medium close-up of the prince (continuity from the tilt shot)  Medium shot of prime minister (shot reverse shot). Prince holds up a paper and PM looks at it.  Cut to an eyeline match of what the PM is looking at, which is the paper with a list on it (again this is continuity from the last shot).  Close up of PM (with some badly done shallow focus) and then prince (shot reverse shot). The close ups give a better sense of their predicament.  Re-establishing shot, slow zoom out and fade out to black.  The cinematography wasn't elaborate. It wasn't compositionally heavy, although the arc in the background was used as a framing element and the ray of light as leading lines. But, IMO it wasn't stale shot making and had a decent grasp of visual continuity.    Rafael asks:   In film, the camera is one of the most basic yet powerful tools of expression in a filmmaker's arsenal. As you are a film scholar, I'm sure you already know the power of a well-composed shot. My question is this: Anime relies a lot on static shots, largely for budgetary reasons (moving backgrounds, characters on a rotating dolly shot, etc. are hard to animate as perspective changes). There's not a lot of tracking/dolly/crane/steadicam shots in anime. Knowing how much the movement of the shot (or lack thereof) influences how the audience views a scene emotionally, how do you think has anime's reliance on static shots influenced its cinematic language? Do you think they've explored techniques in the static shot enough so that they don't have to rely so much on tracking shots to communicate the same emotions? I'm aware that there are numerous other things that affect the shot composition, but I wanted to ask about static shots specifically.   **Moving the camera is actually something that didn't pop up much in motion picture history until relatively late. Early silent film cameras were bulky and heavy, and moving them was just too difficult. (You may have seen footage of a giant merry-go-round built for doing chase scenes in the silent era. The merry-go-round was for the actors and set, while the camera stayed on the ground.) This started to become less of a problem towards the end of the silent era, but then when talkies came the additional burden of the sound equipment and having to stay absolutely silent during shooting put a damper on adventurous camera technique. It took a long time for cinema to recover from the stiffness introduced by microphones. While cameras might have been able to shift around in place on a tripod, actually moving the camera, and the devices with which that could be done smoothly like dollies or jibs (mini-cranes for cameras) were things that had to be invented after that point, starting in the late 1930s. Hand-holding the camera was often too shaky until the Steadicam was invented, and that didn't become commonplace until the late 1980s.**  **Animation had similar limitations in that you could always move the camera, but doing so was a lot more trouble than it was usually worth. The low-budget nature of anime also meant that new inventions that made such things easier were slow in coming to Japan. Multi-plane animation techniques pioneered by Disney in the 30s and 40s (which you see as different layers of backgrounds panning across the screen at different speeds) didn't get used much in anime until the 1970s. And Japan pretty much skipped the early computer-aided drafting era of animation in the late 80s, not integrating computers into their workflows until early 2000s. So, for a very, very, very long time -- until the last decade, really -- anime creators were pretty much stuck with only the camera techniques they could draw by hand.**   **Luckily, this worked quite well when combined with Japanese filmmaking, which leans heavily on the Yasujiro Ozu school of long, still shots, with cuts to close-ups for dramatic effect, and cuts to random little asides (a piece of litter, a glass of water -- Ozu called these "pillow shots") as a rhythmic pause, as if the life of a scene is taking a breath. The technical limitations of anime and that style of filmmaking work very well together, which is probably why the art form is so heavily influenced by it, whereas Japanese live action filmmaking has long since moved on.**   **I think the economy with which the camera moves in anime tends to inherently give those shots more importance. A moving point of view shot happens so seldom, and the craft in which things move is so labored and clearly difficult, that it can't help but make an impression. It's similar to how body language is portrayed in anime: every twitch of a finger, every eye movement was a deliberate choice by the animators, and is important; it's never because an actor had a fly land on them or has an itch. That extra motion doesn't happen very often, so when it does, we take notice, and try to observe why it's happening. It adds meaning to a scene.**   **There are still moving camera shots that take my breath away: hand drawn ones like the subway shoot-out in Kite, or the opening shot in The Heroic Legend of Arslan. There are moving camera shots that make me chuckle because they couldn't quite pull it off, like an early scene in Black Magic M-66 where the camera chases two people running through the woods, and the perspective of all of the passing trees gets completely screwed up. Even Paprika, which was an all-digital work, made innovative use of changing perspective in several shots, to breathtaking effect.**   **Lately, I think some of the best, most pioneering work in terms of changing-perspective animation can be found in some of the insanely intricate swimming scenes in the current season of Free! That show is visually mind-blowing, even if all of the exposed flesh in that show does nothing for you.**  source: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2014-09-05/.78369   Out of the most recent anime the ones with the most impressive camera work have been Ping Pong and Knights of Sidonia  Spoilers Ahead  Ping Pong:  http://a.pomf.se/aukrgg.webm  http://a.pomf.se/nbzcdg.webm  http://a.pomf.se/ylphst.webm  Knights of Sidonia:  http://a.pomf.se/qjsztz.webm  http://a.pomf.se/pfspxc.webm  http://a.pomf.se/lxnluh.webm  There's also this [great scene](http://a.pomf.se/mtkpxg.webm) from Zankyou no Terror.

I'm aware that there are numerous other things that affect the shot composition, but I wanted to ask about static shots specifically.   **Moving the camera is actually something that didn't pop up much in motion picture history until relatively late. Early silent film cameras were bulky and heavy, and moving them was just too difficult. (You may have seen footage of a giant merry-go-round built for doing chase scenes in the silent era. The merry-go-round was for the actors and set, while the camera stayed on the ground.) This started to become less of a problem towards the end of the silent era, but then when talkies came the additional burden of the sound equipment and having to stay absolutely silent during shooting put a damper on adventurous camera technique. It took a long time for cinema to recover from the stiffness introduced by microphones. While cameras might have been able to shift around in place on a tripod, actually moving the camera, and the devices with which that could be done smoothly like dollies or jibs (mini-cranes for cameras) were things that had to be invented after that point, starting in the late 1930s. Hand-holding the camera was often too shaky until the Steadicam was invented, and that didn't become commonplace until the late 1980s.**  **Animation had similar limitations in that you could always move the camera, but doing so was a lot more trouble than it was usually worth. The low-budget nature of anime also meant that new inventions that made such things easier were slow in coming to Japan. Multi-plane animation techniques pioneered by Disney in the 30s and 40s (which you see as different layers of backgrounds panning across the screen at different speeds) didn't get used much in anime until the 1970s. And Japan pretty much skipped the early computer-aided drafting era of animation in the late 80s, not integrating computers into their workflows until early 2000s. So, for a very, very, very long time -- until the last decade, really -- anime creators were pretty much stuck with only the camera techniques they could draw by hand.**   **Luckily, this worked quite well when combined with Japanese filmmaking, which leans heavily on the Yasujiro Ozu school of long, still shots, with cuts to close-ups for dramatic effect, and cuts to random little asides (a piece of litter, a glass of water -- Ozu called these "pillow shots") as a rhythmic pause, as if the life of a scene is taking a breath. The technical limitations of anime and that style of filmmaking work very well together, which is probably why the art form is so heavily influenced by it, whereas Japanese live action filmmaking has long since moved on.**   **I think the economy with which the camera moves in anime tends to inherently give those shots more importance. A moving point of view shot happens so seldom, and the craft in which things move is so labored and clearly difficult, that it can't help but make an impression. It's similar to how body language is portrayed in anime: every twitch of a finger, every eye movement was a deliberate choice by the animators, and is important; it's never because an actor had a fly land on them or has an itch. That extra motion doesn't happen very often, so when it does, we take notice, and try to observe why it's happening. It adds meaning to a scene.**   **There are still moving camera shots that take my breath away: hand drawn ones like the subway shoot-out in Kite, or the opening shot in The Heroic Legend of Arslan. There are moving camera shots that make me chuckle because they couldn't quite pull it off, like an early scene in Black Magic M-66 where the camera chases two people running through the woods, and the perspective of all of the passing trees gets completely screwed up. Even Paprika, which was an all-digital work, made innovative use of changing perspective in several shots, to breathtaking effect.**   **Lately, I think some of the best, most pioneering work in terms of changing-perspective animation can be found in some of the insanely intricate swimming scenes in the current season of Free! That show is visually mind-blowing, even if all of the exposed flesh in that show does nothing for you.**  source: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2014-09-05/.78369   ~~GKZ5EBBK8RM~~   [Shiki vs Lio alley fight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VPDTQViU3c), I thought was the best fight scene of the series and maybe one the best in anime. I actually liked the first half of that movie, too bad the second half took a nose dive.      I'm glad Naru's fall wasn't made into a big drama and was appropriately used to strengthened the bond between the four and as a feel good moment.  [Sally-sensei's Yosakoi](http://gfycat.com/DescriptiveDelectableBluebottlejellyfish)   Samurai Flamenco   A writer/director can come up with a safest premise that's moe-centric and panders to the otaku and still not get funding for a $500k 24 minute OVA. Let's get real, that's too expensive and not a sound investment.   [Mushishi Zoku Shou Special - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/mushishi-episode-11-and-12.html)   The reactions to Kageyama being complimentary were funny. Chemistry between the characters is the best aspect of this show.  That Oikawa flashback was awkwardly inserted. Probably would've worked if done in between sets or during a timeout.   I'm not even sure if they're actually adoptive siblings, or Akari just started calling him Onii-Sama because they're close childhood friends.         I think she's an amusing one note character. She fits the guilty pleasure vibe of the series.   Kind of disappointing the it's not his. I was ready to add AI and Robotics Expert to his resume.   http://i.imgur.com/PDdW9jZ.gif   Don't deny it. Just accept the power of the lewd.   She ain't dead. That ship would be totally useless without her. Unless they turn her dead body into Aldnoah fuel.   I feel that some of the story details in this episode like Marito's past and the state of Martian politics and society should have been revealed earlier and would've gave the story/characters a stronger foundation.    I've been watching some older anime lately, like Future Boy Conan, Maison Ikkoku, Utena and Touch. The voice acting were fine but they weren't some revelation exposing me to the wonders of pre-2000's voice work.  I do understand the complaints about high pitched voices but when shows have teenage girls being voiced by full grown women then of course it would sound unnatural as they try to adjust their voice to match a younger age.  [First 10 minutes of Tomino's new show, Gundam Reconguista in G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN3KN5Xlo8U). Again, the voice work is fine but nothing special. On the other hand, that Yugo Kanno OST is sounding amazing.   Kokutou just loves crazy.   Gainax animation at its peak was that epic Asuka fight scene and the The Wings of Honnamise rocket launch.   Another LOGH thread made the front page of /r/all a few days ago. Hopefully that got more people watching.   I need to catch up on some western shows anyway.      Eh, they just don't want to admit that they messed up on Hosada.   The show is hit or miss but some of the hits are really good.  This episode (S2 episode 8) isn't guitar themed but the soundtrack for it is great. Great episode by the way, even if you end up not liking the story (I didn't like it that much either), everything else was exceptional (cinematography, animation, art, etc.) and a delight to watch.  I would also recommend S2 episode 5. Probably the best episode of the series.      It was predictable that something bad would happen, but with characters so likable and so easy to root for the expected mishap still leaves an effect.  Sally-sensei might save the day in the next episode and perhaps change Machi's view of her.  Stay strong Naru. The Princess, The Tsundere and The Blond got your back.

[Space Dandy S2 Episode 8 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/space-dandy-s2-episode-8.html).      Bob cut looks great on Senjougahara and Tsukihi. The rest look better with long hair.   The show's animation, character and ship designs can use a remake. The first season's character design had some mannish looking women.   I'm no chemist but the potassium chlorate can act as an oxidizer for the initial ignition. The oxygen in the air maintains it. Whether that initial ignition is enough to start a reaction in a Hydrogen filled atmosphere might be the question.  The head of "strike anywhere" matches contain an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate together with tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, glass and binder.  The phosphorus sulfide is easily ignited, the potassium chlorate decomposes to give oxygen, which in turn causes the phosphorus sulfide to burn more vigorously.   The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder.  The side of the box contains red phosphorus, binder and powdered glass.  The heat generated by friction when the match is struck causes a minute amount of red phosphorus to be converted to white phosphorus, which ingnites spontaneously in air.  This sets off the decomposition of potassium chlorate to give oxygen and potassium chloride.  The sulfur catches fire and ignites the wood.  http://depts.washington.edu/chem/facilserv/lecturedemo/MatchHeadReaction-UWDept.ofChemistry.html   This show just has a way of highlighting characters in a very gratifying way.   Sugawara is definitely better at being a glue for the team and seeing the bigger picture but Kageyama gives them intensity and edge. Kageyama can get overwhelmed mentally while with Sugawara it's physically/athletically. I like how the show presented these differences.   I miss Senjougahara. This arc kept dropping her name too, tease.   The feels are coming? While I've really enjoyed this show, the emotional and thematic parts weren't very engaging despite being presented well. I think if the show decides to dig a bit deeper it could turn from being a good show to a great one.

Finally, Asseylum does something.   Inaho wants that Aldnoah tech that Asseylum can provide and he doesn't want to risk having Slaine get in the way of things. Although, getting that tech comes at the price of prolonging the war and more casualties but Inaho would probably see it as strategically justifiable for the sake of reaching parity with the Martians. I think Inaho will be entering Machiavellian mode.  Of course there's also Asseylum's view on things to be taken into account. The show is starting to get more interesting with all these significant factors coming into play. I hope its handled well and avoids over-simplification or being convoluted.   The show was Gundam-esque from the very beginning.   You should watch Space Battleship Yamato 2199 for the quintessential battleship badassery.     The only thing that I am 100% sure about is that the Martian rebel girl will try to kill the princess after she has outlasted her usefulness. She seems to have a bigger grudge than most of the Terrans and I don't blame her for that.  It's hard to sympathize with her since her father was part of a group that started this whole damn mess that killed millions of people.

Also, people need to keep in mind that talent development is a fickle thing and having a stacked farm system doesn't guarantee long term success.  2006 D-backs farm system is probably more stacked than this Cubs farm system and only made it to the playoffs twice since then. That prospect class included Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Chris Young and Carlos Gonzalez. Although, Quentin and CarGo were used as trade pieces.  On a more positive side, for the past two seasons the hyped 2010 Royals farm system has been coming to fruition. Although Hosmer and Moustakas have been disappointing.

When I reached the opposite door, I leaned my head against it and tried to calm my rapidly beating heart.   Taking several deep breaths, I slid Scottss keycard through the blinking card reader and was rewarded with a green flash and another soft click. The creature was right where Id left it, as still as the statue it was pretending to be.   I took my time wandering around the room, my eyes never leaving Jameson Scotts prize exhibit. If the demon was as satisfied and successfully warded as Scott bragged it was, than the creature either wouldnt notice or wouldnt care about my presence.  I was starting to hope he was right.   When I finally came around to face the statue, I approached it slowly and unbuckled the velvet rope with a shaky hand. I was so close to it now that all I could see when I looked up was the underside of its gigantic head. I suddenly wondered if years of schooling would help me read the words inscribed on the statues stone platform. I bent down and started to pull up the velvet covering when I heard a quiet scrape above me, like stone on stone. It was a sound Id heard before, in the soundtrack of my nightmares.    So I had been right all along, the statue wasnt dormant. It was a hollow victory. I dropped the velvet and backed away from the statue, trying to determine what had moved. Nothing had changed to my naked eye, but I know what I heard.  Bumping against the back wall, I decided to play a wild card. I needed it to move perceptibly if I wanted proof that the thing was still dangerous. I turned away from the demon and faced the wall, using an arm to brace myself. I couldnt believe I was doing this.  I pushed my chips all in.   Do you really think Im scared of you, after all these years?" I asked quietly, my voice echoing around the room like a gunshot. "Youre just a piece of rock now. Harmless to me.    I held my breath and waited. Nothing.  Feeling both disappointed and relieved, I sighed and turned around, dropping the keycard as well as my jaw. Though it hadn't made a sound, the statue was now not only facing me, but leaning out, as far off its stone platform as it could. Its mouth was open and, almost imperceptibly, growing wider by the second.   You cant leave your platform. I breathed, as much to myself as the creature. My whole body was shaking and I was quietly backing up, slowly, slowly to the door. I'd gotten what I'd come for, now it was time to leave.  It happened in the breath of a second. There was a sudden crack as the demons tail whipped through the air behind it from one side to the other, as though it were not made of stone but of flesh and blood. The glass encasing it on either side shattered, the makeshift wall behind split in two and the velvet ropes came crashing down; one of the poles sent a sigil flying across the room.   I screamed like Id never screamed before as the creatures neck seemed to stretch across the room toward me, one of its wards no longer effective. I turned my back on it and ran for the door realizing too late that the keycard now lay under a heap of rubble. I reached the double doors and tried to jerk them open, hoping they werent locked from the other side. They were.  The creature was once again still as stone, everything but its eyes, which followed my every move, hungrily. I beat on the door, yelling for security and wondering if I was doomed and which thought would be my last. In my hysterical panic I suddenly remembered how I had escaped this fate 13 years before. I stumbled back from the doors as much as I dared and ran at them, shoulder first.  They moved, creaked even, but ultimately laughed at my efforts. These were no rotten, decaying church doors. Crazed with fear I backed up to try again and this time just as my shoulder reached the door, it opened from the other side and I went spilling over on top of something hard  or someone.   He rolled over and I passively registered that Id landed on an enraged Bannock. He was standing and pulling me up by the strap of my backpack before the door had even closed behind us.    Bannock struggled to say something, trying several times, but was too angry for words. I didnt care; I threw my arms around him just happy to be on the other side of the door.   He didnt hug me back, just froze stiff and waited for me to get off of him. When I finally pulled back, I pulled my hood down and looked him full in the face. He wore a decidedly guarded look.     Did you see what it did? I asked, pushing hair back from my face, That thing is not dormant at all. Tell your boss that, and that it needs to be moved. Tonight, if possible.  In lieu of a response, Bannock grabbed my arm and headed toward the lobby. Since it was away from the exhibit room, I didnt care; he could take me to jail if he wanted, as long as Jameson Scott heard what happened here. Id made my point to him and lived to tell the tale.   Or had I? I suddenly wondered.  Honestly if Id learned anything in that room, it had been that the creature hadnt forgotten me- the girl that got away. My life was a black mark on its record, an insult.  And I had gone into its lair and challenged. What did I *think* was going to happen?  Of one thing I was abruptly certain: it wouldnt stop until it had my life. The creature would burn through a hundred cities, perhaps a thousand, to claim me. It had told me all of this somehow, hadnt it?  I suddenly realized my mistake. The creature had been dormant when Id arrived in Lannenburg as itd been dormant 13 years before in Deepwood. And once again I had awoken it from a harmless slumber. How many would pay the price this time?   How many people had to die before the end?   Finally understanding the true cost of my arrogance, I let out a muffled cry and faltered, wondering with revulsion if perhaps I should just go back and face my fate.   Wait. I coughed, trying to ply the guards fingers from my arm.  Bannock suddenly spun me around and pinned me against a wall, his arms braced on either side of my head. My eyes snapped up at him in shock and I recoiled from what I saw there.  "What the fuck are you doing here?"  "I was, I was just-  "Why did you come back, Katie? After all these fucking years?"  My objection died in my throat. But it couldnt be. It wasnt possible. And yetsomehow it was.  My legs gave out under me, but Jamie caught me on the way down. He was older than he should have been, and stronger than I'd ever thought the skinny kid from Middlesbrough could be. But his eyes hadn't changed, and it was Jamie all the same. Even his expressions were familiar to me, I realized. What I'd first thought was seething anger was actually just barely controlled fear. Had the creature killed me after all? Was I swirling in the dark abyss with Jamie and all the others who had been taken?  "Jamie?" My voice broke over his name.  "Christ, Katie, you need to leave now and never come back. Hell, leave the country if you can. Hell never stop looking for you now."  I couldnt register what he was saying. Who wouldnt? Leave what country? Jamiehow was Jamie here? He kept me pinned there; his hold rigid, his eyes desperate and little bit pissed off.  "Jamie," I tried again, "how did you..."  "How did I know you'd come here? When has the word no ever kept you from something you wanted?"  "No, I mean how-"  "We'll take her from here, Bannock.  A voice behind him interrupted me.   Jamie slowly turned to face the three men, only one of which I recognized.  "This one has been too much trouble. I want her gone." Jamie returned with ice in his voice.  "Mr. Scott says we're not to take orders from you anymore, Bannock. Give her here."  Jamie suddenly pushed me out of the way and I went sliding across the floor, the wind knocked out of me.  A rushing filled my ears as I tried desperately to catch my breath. When my hearing came back, Jamie was yelling at me.   Go!  I looked back to see two men down and Jamie struggling with the third. My sneakers struggled for purchase on the slick marble floor and when they finally found it, I was up and running toward the lobby on the wings of adrenaline. I suddenly heard a sound like a book slamming onto a table.   I spun around just as Jamie went down, clutching his shoulder. He fell on top of the man hed been struggling with  who was now unconscious.   Blood began to drip over his fingers and I went sliding across the floor as I tried to stop to double back for him.   Jamie started to say something but passed out mid sentence. His hand dropped from his shoulder and thin tendrils of blood began to race each other down his chest.  "Well, now that is impressive," Jameson Scott stepped forward from where hed been leaning against the door. "And Im not impressed by much at my age."  I stumbled over to Jamie, but Scott stopped me with a single click of his gun. He walked over and rested a foot on Jamies chest. I froze where I was.   "I saw you take my keycard, you know. You played the role perfectly. In fact, *everything* went according to plan. Except him. Scott kicked Jamie in the ribs but he didnt make a sound.  "What do you want?" I spat.  "Your name came up. I want you to die."  "Why?"  Scott gave a pretentious scoff. "This isn't a James Bond movie, Miss Ross, I don't need to explain myself to you."  "But you will, wont you? You want me to know how clever you are." I was playing with fire but why not? We were far beyond caution now.   "Hmm, you're quite bright. There might have been a place for you on my staff...if things had been different."  "Don't flatter yourself. Why then? Why are you giving a demon what it wants? Didnt it kill someone you loved?"  "My daughter, actually. And why? Its my gift to a world I was born too late into. You know, I was fifty by the time the internet was invented - fifty! What sad irony then, that I was a technological genius. Oh but the universe does love its sick jokes. Do you realize Ive single-handedly guided the history of modern technology? Its true. But I reached my seventies and then my eighties, and my vision began to fail, my hands would shake, I'd forget coding. I could barely manage to read at one point.  I'd made millions, but I hadn't even started. I decided the world couldn't afford to lose me yet. So, I tracked down every piece of ancient lore I could that may help me reclaim my youth. Most of it was rubbish, of course, but I was desperate. Id almost given up  until Metaraxes found me.  I knew what he was as soon as I saw him. So I bought him and warded him using the sigils I'd read about in ancient text.  Of course, there was an expensive trial and error period; many of my staff were killed in the process. But eventually, we discovered the right sigils. The first thing I did was track down the man whose name was etched into the granite at Metaraxess feet. I presented him for sacrifice and I was rewarded.  That was six years ago. I adopted a new name and started a new company. All was going well until your name came up about four years ago. It really stumped me because Metaraxes only desires those who are connected to him, somehow. I didn't know who you were and you're far from the only Caitlin Ross in the world. I did *try* several others. Metaraxes would take them, for certain, but the name never changed. I was getting desperate.  So you can imagine how happy I am that you showed up on my doorstep.  God is telling me that he approves of my methods and that I must stay alive for the good of humanity. My company is in the middle of revolutionizing surgical robotics, for Christs sake! I will take a few lives to save a million."  Furious at his arrogance, I struggled to keep my voice level. "Don't lie to yourself, Scott, youre no hero, just an old man afraid to die."  "No, Caitlin, I'm just a man refusing to grow old. What can I say? Im determined and resilient.  I want to be young until the day I die."  "Thats not resilience, thats vanity. Vanity is what youre buying with my life.   "Theres always a price for social change, Miss Ross. And today, the cost is you. Oh, but you look upset. Don't be afraid of death, my dear, not for such a worthy cause.  "I'm not afraid of death and I don't care about your diabolical plan, I just want you to get to the goddamn point." Jamies breathing was growing shallow and my voice dripped with animosity.  "As you wish." Scott nodded at something behind me and then there was darkness.  When I woke, I was lying on a cold marble floor, my brown mess of hair fanned out underneath me, stiff with dried blood and my wrists bound. I sat up slowly and tried to brush the hair out of my eyes. I knew where I was, there was no point in turning around to see it, but I did anyway.  It wasn't the fact that my name was engraved at the base of the statue that the velvet cloth had covered. It wasn't the wards, which had been moved from the demons feet to the doors and walls of the room. It wasn't even the fact that the demon's head was turned as to be looking directly down at me.  No, what terrified me most in that room was the man leaning against the wall, hands bound behind his back, as condemned to death as I was.  The blood on his chest had dried and he was awake; his eyes only partly open, watching me with an unreadable expression.  "You look like shit, Jamie." I said matter-of-factly as I pulled myself up to lean against the base of the statue, the only thing nearby.  "I've been busy," He said, his mouth curling up into a sarcastic smile.  "I'm sorry I killed you. Again." I tried to smile back, if only to keep the tears at bay.  "Nah, well survive this.  I admire your optimism, but look around. I rested my elbows on my knees and sunk my head into my arms.  I lived through it once before didnt I?  "Yeah about that - how?"  "About a week after you left things started disappearing around town: people, buildings, even roads. No one remembered them but me. Then one day, I woke up in an empty house. My dad and my brother were gone. So, I fled to the only place I knew was safe."  "The Damned Church."  Jamie shrugged. I figured it was the one place the demon would never go. I don't know how long I lived there, but it felt like years. I slept at the church and traveled to nearby towns to steal what I needed to live. And then, one day, the towns were gone. All of them."  As he spoke, I watched him, memorizing every detail of his face. Even when I was nothing, I hoped something was left of me, a little piece that would remember him.  "So, I decided to find the thing. My dad was gone; my mom didn't remember me, and the only person who knew who I was lived a thousand miles away. So I went from town to town until I found it. It was just there; standing in the center of town. Nobody even thought it was weird.  I was a pro at drawing sigils by then since Id spent some much time at Deepwood, and sigils have to be perfect to work, so I tried to ward it. It would take a little while, but the statue always managed to break them. Id find it a little further from its base every night. People didnt even seem to notice the statue had moved, what they did notice, however, was some kid loitering around their town.  Since I looked older, and the town was getting wary of me anyway, I joined the local police force and spent my nights on patrol downtown, keeping an eye on the thing, reapplying sigils. Occasionally, I would wake up outside and I'd know my wards had finally failed. Then I'd have to track it to a new town and start all over."  "Why didn't it just kill you?"  "I asked myself that until a few years ago when your name came up. I think it needed me - to find you. Ironically, in the end it didn't need me at all. You came anyway."  I thought about that and wondered for the first time if I actually *had* come back to prove myself sane. Had I really intended to kill it? Or prove I'd been right? Or had it actually been about Jamie all along?  "It took a long time, and a lot of towns," he continued, "but I finally figured out what I was doing wrong. A sigil will slow it down, but in order to stop it the ward needs to be blessed. And not just by anyone - by the second son of a Roman catholic, preferably from Assisi, Italy, or at least near the region. Don't ask me how I figured that out."  "So what happened to your second son from Assisi, Italy?"  "He disappeared."  "Shit." I pushed my hair back again with my bound wrists.  "Yeah. By that point I was a sheriff and Id been a city over. I came back to town to find my exit missing. The statue was gone. And that's when Jameson Scott got a hold of it."  "And that's why were you protecting him?"  "You think I was protecting *him*? No, he was transparent about his intentions from the start. I applied to be on his detail but was denied - no name, no experience. I only got on because I was able to take out all of his bodyguards in a sort of hand to hand combat trial. Guess all those trips through the police academy finally paid off."  "Agreed. How does Jameson Scott know more about that statue than we do?   Because he had almost 80 people on his staff who did nothing but travel every corner of the globe looking for any scrap of information on Metaraxes.  We arent the first ones to live to tell the tale. Just the first to stick around.  I did all I could to keep people away from that thing. A name would be engraved on it one day, and a new name the next. It took me a long time to figure out what he was doing. And by then...your name had come up. Hes became obsessed with you and I damned sure wasnt going to let him find you."  "Well that explains why you were mad when you saw me."  "Mad? Katie, I've never been more terrified in my life. I spent years leading him down false paths only to have you present yourself like a lamb for slaughter."  "I'm sorry, Jamie. I wasted all your fucking time.  You spent 13 years trying to protect me and I spent all that time trying to forget you."   "Well, it's no less than I wanted for you. To forget about this place, and me."  I heard the familiar stone on stone sound from above me.   "Is there any chance of reasoning with him? Your boss, I mean?"  "Not likely," his voice was dark. "He fed his own daughter to that thing."  He what?!  "For the greater good, he said."  God, Jamie, I don't want to die. I don't want *you* to die."  "You're not going to die here, not today."  I ignored his optimism. "Why do you think it hasn't killed us yet?"  Jamie sighed. "It's trying. Scott kept a close watch over his demon but I managed to get one thing by him. That statue is sitting on a sigil the size of a mini cooper. It's not blessed - but it's big."  "You're a brilliant bastard, James Karras."  "Well, I've sure had a lot of time." I heard a clicking sound and Jamie stood up, tossing a now worthless pair of handcuffs on the floor.  He walked over and stood me up; using whatever tool he had picked his own cuffs with to free me. I heard them click but when they fell to the floor all I heard with the loud grinding of stone on stone again. It was louder and longer this time.   "Don't look at it, Katie. Don't look up."  "Jamie..." I breathed, terrified. Suddenly, a face appeared behind Jamie. But this time, I wasnt hypnotized by it. Jamie saw the color drain from my face and grabbed me.  "Follow me- now!" He yelled, pushed me in front of him to the giftshop door. I heard more movement from behind us and turned around while Jamie typed a long sequence of numbers into the card reader keypad. The creature had turned its head and it was watching me. It was alive, as alive as it had ever been. The statue took a step off its platform which shook the museum floor. Its movements were silent, yet fluid and flexible, like a cartoon on mute.  "Jamie..."  "Working on it!" Suddenly the key pad flashed green and the door clicked open. Jamie drew a black marker out of his pocket and drew a long line down the middle of the sigil, negating it.   "What are you doing?!"  "Just trust me." Jamie pushed me out the door.  We slammed it behind us and tore across the giftshop to the exit. The door was locked. I turned around to tell Jamie as much but he was already hurling a table through the window. It shattered just as I saw the door on the other side of the room begin to bend as it was pushed in from the other side.  "How did you unlock that door?" I asked as we ran across the parking lot.  "Scott isn't the only one who's good with programming." Jamie yelled back.   I followed him to a black jeep sitting at the edge of the parking lot. We jumped in just as a loud bang echoed across the asphalt, god only knew what it meant. Jamie shoved his keys in the ignition and turned the car over. The beginning chords to Highway to Hell blasted from the speakers.  "Why not?" I shrugged as I turned it up. Jamie nodded and peeled out of the parking lot. We tore through town like the devil himself was chasing us - which wasn't far from the truth.  It was early, the first rays of sunlight streaming through the trees as we hit the highway. We hadn't gone more than 5 miles when a white SUV appeared behind us. It followed at a considerable distance.  "Why aren't they overtaking us?"  "Because this is what he wants. Scott knows where we're going."  "Where *are* we going?"  "Deepwood."  "Fuck." I said as I leaned back in the chair. But I trusted Jamie, so I didn't object.  "Wont it take the creature days to make it there?" I asked, eyeing Jamie's speedometer, which was at 90.   "It doesn't always move like that. It sometimes travels on another plane. I can't explain it. Everything changes and warps around that thing, even time. Thats why I'm about 8 years older than I should be."  He suddenly whipped off the road and headed for the treeline. The truck behind us did the same and we maneuvered randomly through the trees, though I figured Jamie knew where we were going. I held on for dear life and watched him expertly navigate the almost hostile terrain or downed trees and deep ditches.   "How far?" I asked after ten minutes.  "6 miles but you know how time is out here."   Did I ever. Four minutes yet somehow six miles later we bumped over a set of railroad tracks and arrived at the Damned Church, which looked smaller and more impotent than it did in my nightmares. The front door opened easily this time and I gave an involuntary shudder when I saw the Jesus statue - looking more judgmental now than ever before. The trapdoor was open.  "You lived here for years and you never closed the trap door?"   "Believe me, I tried." Jamie grabbed my hand and guided me to the hole in the floor. "We have to go down there."  "Fuck no. I snatched my hand away.  "It's the only way this will end, Katie."  Youve got to be kidding me, I muttered as I took the first reluctant step down.  "Wait, I suddenly stopped. You said it wouldn't ever come back here."  "It would for you."   Jamie followed behind me and took the stairs down, on shaky step at a time. Jamie followed behind me, flashlight in hand. I didnt see it until right before we reached the bottom. The demon was already here waiting for us. It stood in the same position we'd first found him in 13 years before, though this time its face was not stone. The demons eyes swept across the room in a wide arc, his tail was wrapped around the bottom of the staircase.  "If he was already down here, why couldnt we stay up there?" I whispered.  "He wasn't."  There were no wards to protect us now, and no where to run. I couldn't help thinking this was a bad plan.  "Well, he's here now, so let's go."  "We can't Katie. If we leave now, he will too."  "Well then what's your plan, Jamie?"  Jamie said nothing, just stared at the demon, who was now staring back at him. Suddenly I felt something like a tug, in the pit of my stomach. I stepped back, and then it happened again. I looked up into the creatures eyes, which had moved to mine and suddenly realized what was happening. There was another tug, harder this time, and I felt my mind, if not my body, being pulled toward the demon's head. A long black tongue jutted out to welcome me and the creatures mouth began to widen. So this was it. The nothingness.  The demons mouth was so wide I could have simply walked into it, if I had a body. The blackness started to close in on all sides, creating a sort of tunnel vision and then, in a violent jolt, I was snapped back into my body, a perfect sigil drawn on my chest in black marker. The creature screamed, an earsplitting sound, and Jamie flung me over his shoulder before I had even reestablished my bearings. We were to the top of the staircase in under a minute, the demon still emitting a deafening wail.   "I'm sorry!" He yelled "I was sure it would come for me first!"  We burst into the nave, and Jamie, seeing our company before I did, pushed me across the alter toward the crucifixion, which I took out as I fell. I scrambled back, kicking it away from me as I did. By the time I looked up, Jameson Scott was standing in front of the trapdoor, a gun to Jamie's head. His men hung back, but looked eager to get involved at a word from their boss.   "Get back down there, Miss Ross."   Fuck you. My last word was drowned out by a loud cracking sound that echoed  through the little church as the spiral staircase came crashing down below.   "Katie, don't-" Jamie caught a knee to the ribs, some of which I was pretty sure were already broken. I scrambled back further.   "There's- there's no staircase now. There's no way to get down there."  "Oh, sure there is." Scott sneered. His hired men laughed. "You're going to die either way. At least *this* way, you'll save his life. Metaraxes is trapped down there for the time being, so its to the cellar you must go. Perhaps you shouldnt have injured him by breaking his bond *mid-feed*."  "Katie, Jamie growled. "Dont be fucking stupid. Just run.  "Fuck no, Jamie. I didn't leave you in this place then and I wont now." It was time to pay my dues. I stood up to walk to the edge of the trapdoor. Perhaps, if fate was kind, I would die when I hit the floor thirty feet below.   I looked up at Jamie, intending my last words to be for him. I knew the moment he realized that intent.   Jamie jerked his body forward and threw himself and Scott into the dark hole between us.  "No!" I screamed as Scotts men scattered out the door. I skid over to the side of the hole, tripping over the smaller statue on the way.  'I'm here," came a pained groan from Jamie, who was just barely clutching onto the side. Thanking every deity I knew of, I pulled him out of the hole and back into the nave. His wound was bleeding fresh blood and I knew we didn't have much time. I laid him on his back, as he started to slip in unconsciousness, applying pressure to his shoulder. A moan came from the trapdoor beside us.  "Help me. Please... I'm hurt." So Scott had survived the fall. I grimaced and pulled myself over to the edge to peer into the darkness below. I could see nothing but the creature was no longer screaming. My blood began to boil as I let Jameson Scott wail away his swan song.   "Please...its staring at me, I can feel it. Pleasename your price, Ill pay it. Just save me"  I laughed. "Oh now, why would I do that, Mr. Scott? This is what you wanted, after all. You get to be young until the day you die."   Suddenly the trapdoor slammed shut, Jamie standing over it, as the entire building began to shake. The edges around the door grew bright, like molten metal before darkening like a blown out flame.  "Will it hold?" I yelled to Jamie over the increasingly loud earthquake. "Is it blessed?"  "Some say by God himself."  "I'd say that counts." I said to myself as I tried to stand up on the violently shaking floor.  Jamie hoisted me up next to him and ran for the door as bit of ceiling began to cave in. The door to the church swung open of its own volition before we got there and slammed shut behind us. The church came down in a butt of dust and splintered wood. When all had settled, Jamie was barely conscious. I walked him to the car and pushed him into the passenger seat. He was out before Id shut the door. I took one last look at the pile of rubble before climbing into the drivers seat and starting the car. I followed the same train tracks home that got us out of Deepwood when we were kids. I made it to the road without ever looking back.  I can tell you exactly how long Jameson Scott lived - 4 days. By the dawn of that forth day, he, and all of his inventions, abruptly disappeared from the world. There were a few I was sad to see go, like the rise of inductive charging and EyeGlass. You would have loved EyeGlass and you probably did, honestly.  Contact lenses that were actually cameras: they put GoPro out of business. I could never afford it, but you may have had one. I miss those YouTube videos.   Jamie spent a month recovering from his gunshot wound. After he was released from the hospital, we spent a few weeks weighing our options. In the end, we decided to hunt down people like Jameson Scott and the powers they wielded. You don't know about them, and if we have our way, you never will. Due to Jamie's time with Scott, we have some good leads. We have a lot of blood on our hands to atone for, and a lifetime to do it in.   Deepwood is dead; only Jamie and I even know where it is, so the town dies with us. I wouldn't try to find it if I were you - Ive changed a lot of details: names of towns, names of roads. Perhaps even *when* this all happened. I won't tell you and you don't want to know, anyway.  Somewhere, out in a hundred mile sea of trees and dirt lies the demons door. It's still there, under a pile of rotting detritus that used to be a small church. The door may be found again someday, it may even be opened. But one thing is for damn sure: it sure as hell wont be because of me.  [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)       Guilt can be a very strong and blinding motivation.    Yes, well, I never said I was smart. And Happy Cake Day, stranger.   I'm sorry, I ran out of room. I will post the rest tomorrow.    [The Lost Town of Deepwood](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xn677/the_lost_town_of_deepwood_pennsylvania/)  Harrisburg is an antiquated, yet charming Pennsylvanian town on the Susquehanna River with roots reaching back into the 18th century. At least, thats what the tourism brochure read. Id really have to take their word for it.  I had researched a lot of Pennsylvania townships in the last year, but this wasnt one of them.  I handed the brochure back to the tall, red faced girl behind the hotel desk. She sniffed loudly as she took it and unceremoniously slid my credit card back across the counter at me.  Thanks, I muttered.  The girl dropped a brass key on the counter which I eyed with suspicion. I hadnt seen a hotel with actual brass keys since I was a kid. I didnt know if it was my limited funds or Harrisburgs antiquated charm at work, but either way, it sent an involuntary shudder down my spine.  "Room 217. Check outs at 10. The girl said, wiping her small, watery eyes with the back of her sleeve.  I picked up my luggage and shoved off to find my room.   Eager to be done with it, I hadnt bother to ask where to find room 217. When I finally located it on the other side of the building, I was exhausted and ready for whatever awaited me on the other side of the door. It was as youd suspect: dated, droll and dusty. I took a short shower and spread my maps out on the painfully flat yet somehow still lumpy hotel mattress.  It was strange to be back in Pennsylvania after all these years. Honestly, I was just happy it was still here. I had spent years trying to pretend I'd dreamed it all. Trying to convince myself that I'd had a very vivid psychotic breakdown and I'd never actually been to Pennsylvania at all. And I might have believed it too - if it weren't for Jamie.  He was as real to me as the face in the mirror. I couldn't have dreamed him up if I'd wanted to. And if he had been real, than so had everything else. The Damned Church, the Demon and the hell I'd brought down on Middlesbrough. How many more had died since then? I needed to see for myself. I needed to prove I wasn't crazy, even if doing it meant I would have to face the consequences of my actions - the death.    I stared at my notes and topographical maps until my vision began to blur. Id been researching and preparing for this trip for a year and yet, here I was, in Pennsylvania, still with no real direction.  It had been thirteen years since Id stepped foot in this state and only for one of them had I considered coming back.   Id lived only half a life for  the last decade, slowly suffocating under the heavy, pungent cloak of guilt. Usually, I could escape it in Ambien laced dreams or when I was utterly black out drunk - which is an easy order to fill when you work in a bar. But a year ago, my tricks had abruptly stopped working and it had been too long since Id come up for air. Id known it was time to go back.  I spent an hour trying to find a comfortable position on the worn-out hotel mattress. When that failed, I picked up the maps again and studied their details, though Id memorized them all. I suppose I was waiting for something to just click, some small detail Id overlooked that would suddenly make all the difference; a clue as clear as daybreak that had been in front of me all along. But none came and when I woke again it was buried under a pile of legal pads and maps and suffering a sore back.  I showered again, not trusting the comforter, and reluctantly drank the motor oil that passed for breakfast blend coffee. I packed up my research, checked out of the hotel and sat in my car watching the sun slowly brighten the populated downtown area. At least the creature hadnt made its way here; this city had a population of around 50,000. But how many other cities with similar populations were gone because of me? It wasnt something I wanted an answer to.  Since I had no other data to go on, my plan was to drive to the least populated areas and see if what wasnt there would give me a clue to what had once been. Basically, I was looking for an area that by all logic should have a city  but didnt.  I put the Ford Focus in drive and headed west out of town. Half a day was spent driving to the middle of the state and another two days aimlessly driving around central Pennsylvania looking for something familiar; a mountain, a water tower, a road, *anything*. But it was as if Id never lived here at all.  On the fourth morning, discouraged and frustrated, I checked out of yet another shitty motel. I only had three more days before my flight back to Arizona and so far the trip had been utterly useless.  The man at the front desk took my key and gestured toward the continental breakfast of prepackaged muffins and  horse-piss coffee.  No thanks, I grumbled.  Wheryeadded?  Huh? I raised an eyebrow at him.  Where ye headed? He repeated, more slowly. I couldnt place his accent, the closest I could get was maybe southern.  Oh, ah, I dont know.  Well, if yer eaded down the 320, gas up before ya leave town. There aint no gas stations or towns between here and Lannenburg.  Butthats like 90 miles away.  Yep, never understood it myself. People get stuck on that road all the time, blowin tires and runnin outta gas. I dont know why the government hasnt done sumthin about that.  Because theyre broke! Someone yelled from the back office.  Yep, thats it, most likely. The state aint got money for it.  Ill get gas before I go, I promised and received an approving nod in return.  I practically ran out the door. For days Id been looking for the out-of-place, the not-quite-right, the bizarre and this waswell, it was odd, at least. And it was all I had.  I gassed up before I left town and followed the signs to the 320. As promised, it was nothing but dark asphalt for miles. No exits, rest stops, signs or ever mile markers. This was it. It just had to be.  Since there was no one else on the road, I drove well under the speed limit taking in every detail. Eventually I began to notice that periodically there would a gap. Not in the foliage, but in the coloring of it.   Every so often, a grove of trees would be duller, sicker. It was something youd only notice if you were looking for it. So the creature, as Id taken to calling it, could technically give life (in the process of filing in the hole of previous existence) but not very good life.  The fauna in these spots was  weaker and bore dull, almost muted coloring.  I continued noting these spots until I couldnt count them anymore. These had likely been cities or homes of people with lives, families, futures, all taken from them because of me. I felt the panic begin to claim the edges of my vision and quickly popped a Xanax. My panic attacks had become unbearable after Middlesbrough. I suffered from them still. The edges of my vision got hazy and I was able to relax a fraction.  At some point, I processed the presence of the dilapidated railroad tracks running parallel to the road. Id noticed them early on, but my mind had hidden the significance of this until now. They may not have been *the* tracks, but to me, it was a sign that I was on the right track (so to speak).  I was close. I had to be. And if Lannenburg was still there, that meant the creature hadnt made it that far yet.  I somehow knew - like I knew that Id once lived somewhere off this road - that the creature had been moving north. But it hadnt claimed Lannenburg yet. Why? Was it satiated? Had it left the area? Or was it just slow moving? Whatever the answer, I felt Id learn it in Lannenburg.  As I reached the outskirts of the city, I saw my first road sign since Id merged onto the 320.  *Lannenburg*  *Next 17 exits*  I decided to take the exit that would get me into the heart of downtown Lannenburg, if there was one. I hadnt researched the city of Lannenburg either, thinking it was too far north to matter. And yet, here I was.  The downtown area began to take shape off my right like the Damned Church had in the woods so long ago. But I didnt need spray paint to find my way anymore. I exited the highway and drove around the cityscape until I found a centrally located hotel that I could afford. I parked and heaved my bags out of the car, hoping they had vacancy.  They did, I was told by the overly flirty college senior behind the front desk, slinging his guitar behind his back.  Do you have wifi? I asked as he handed me the key card.  We do, but theres a $10 a day charge for the password.  Damn. I was on an extremely tight budget.  But I can give it to you for free if He let his voice trail off suggestively.  If what? I raised a skeptical eyebrow at him.  If you let me write a song about you-  he righted my credit card receipt so he could read it -Caitlin.  I sighed. Ok, yeah, fine. At this point there wasnt much Id say no to. I was going on four days of restless sleep.  He eagerly gave me the password and I retired to my room, first floor, thankfully. I took out my shitty laptop, connected to the hotels equally shitty wifi and pulled up the Wikipedia page for Lannenburg.  It was a larger city for this part of the state, around 55,000 residents, mostly due to the fact that Lannenburg hosted a state university. It was a progressive, young, educated town filled with hipsters and young professionals. Where to even begin?  I threw my notes, my phone and my GPS in my backpack and decided to start with the front desk of the motel, much to my own dread.  The college kid whod checked me in was strumming chords on his guitar and softly humming.  Excuse me.  He looked up at me and winked. Youre pretty eager, foxy lady, and I like that. But songs take time to write, even for the most talented-  Yeah, actually, I was just wondering, where can I find the university? I interrupted - suppressing an eyeroll.  "Mama, this whole city is a campus! I mean, whered you wanna go? You a new student? Ill show you around. I get off in-  No, Id like to find the, ah, the- This had been a horrible mistake. *Think of something quick, genius.* -admissions office. I need to talk to admissions.  Ah, well, thats about half a mile down Rooker Street. Thats the one-  -running in front of the building, got it, thanks.  He started to say something else, perhaps which way to go down Rooker, but I was already out the door. Not knowing what else to do  and wanting to get as far from the poor kid as possible  I picked a direction and started walking.  Even though it was May, I was still freezing. I hadnt been built for the far north and my blood had thinned out living in Arizona. With my backpack and my age I probably would have passed for any other college student on campus  if it wasnt for the hoodie I had pulled tightly around me.  I envied them all. Kids just a year or two younger than me going to classes, hanging out with their friends, making  stupid yet amusing mistakes. It could have been me, once. But I hadn't grown up like them. Even since Middlesbrough I had struggled with school and life in general. I couldn't focus, I couldn't laugh; I became a sarcastic, guilt-ridden introvert and I lost all my friends. Then my dad died and my mom started to look at me differently. I stopped talking about Middlesbrough the day I heard the word "hospital" whispered to my mother by a psychiatrist.  Even though I stopped trying to prove it had all been real, my mother never really saw me as her little girl again. I'd moved out at 18 and lived alone for years, working in an English pub, trying to forget how many people were probably dead because me - including Jamie, the knife that dug the deepest.  I walked the downtown area all day. I didnt know what I was doing, where I was going, who I should approach, or what I should ask them - I just knew I was in the right place. Id been drawn here for a reason; I felt it in my gut. This was where I was supposed to be. But for the fifth time in as many days I had to ask myself: what now?  I suppose I could have spent days wondering around Lannenburg. I could have left empty handed and never known what happened all those years ago. I could have never found him. But, as fate would have it, it only took half a day to find what I was looking for.  It was well past noon and I had stopped at a small caf to eat a sandwich. Since the restaurant was packed wall to wall with students, I went outside and leaned against the brick wall by the door.  I suppose I noticed it because it was so brightly colored. Or maybe because it was the only piece of litter I had seen all morning. Or, just maybe, it was simply because I was supposed to. But for whatever the reason, when a bright red flyer blew past my feet, I reached out to step on it.  Curious, I bent down to pick it up and read the heading:  **Tethen History Museum  Lannenburg, PA**  **Upcoming Exhibitions**  **13th-14th Century Judeo-Christian Relics and Artifacts**  Below that was a blurb about the museum, nothing too interesting. And below *that* was a description of the exhibits to be unveiled.  I skimmed down the list quickly seeing little of interest  until the very bottom.  *Statue of the Demon Metaraxes*  My mouth fell open. It was too much of a coincidence, nothing to be ignored. I checked the date on the flyer. May 2nd 2014: 3 weeks ago. I threw the rest of my sandwich in the trash and took off. Id seen the museum that morning and I knew where exactly where to find it.  It was only three blocks away and I got there in under five minutes, flew up the building steps and stumbled straight to the cashier window.  Student ID, please. The old man said, flatly.  Im not a student.  Well, you look-  How much?  Eleven dollars. I was gladly willing to pay.  I didnt stop to grab a map, instead joining a tour group already in progress. The museum, I could tell, was a veritable labyrinth and I certainly didnt want to get lost, not in here, not with that thing - if indeed, it really was what I half hoped, half dreaded it could be.  It took the longest twenty minutes of my life, but we finally came to the room Id been waiting for.  "Now behind this door is our newest exhibition on ancient Judeo-Christian artifacts. Please do not try to touch anything or you will be escorted out. These pieces are centuries old and may be damaged by the lightest touch.  *If you have behind that door what I suspect you do, than I  highly doubt it.*  Also, please no flash photography.  My heart beat a million miles a minute as the docent opened the double doors and my group was shuffled in. I lingered toward the back, letting everyone go in front of me. I had come thousands of miles and done months of research to find that statue, to prove I wasnt insane, yet when the time came to possibly face my nightmare, I was hesitant. Finally I was the last and the docent had to wave me in with a polite but impatient hand.  There were about a hundred things in that room. All sorts of things, really: sculptures, paintings, pottery, even other statues. But I only had eyes for the thing in the middle.  It was larger than I remembered. Not the twelve feet I had guessed, it was actually closer to twenty. But every detail of its face and body was exactly as Id remembered, though it was positioned differently now.  In the church, all those years ago, it had seemed as if it was standing, waiting yet content. But now it was positioned as if ready to leap off the stone square that it stood upon, its tail was paused in midair, instead of wrapped idly around its legs as itd been before.  Though it was taller than Id remembered, I could at least see its face this time. It wasnt particularly scary, just an empty, stony face, far from the hungry, animated one it became when it woke.  And like the crucifixion statue in the Damned Church, it had eyes only for me.  The rest of my group took photos, oo-ing and ah-ing as they made their way around the room. I stood directly where I was, against the now closed door, going no further. The docent walked around the room, discussing notable pieces of the collection and I only moved from the door when she finally stood before the creature.  "And, finally, the jewel of this exhibition: a granite statue from the 14th century. This is a representation of Metaraxes, a lesser known demon of Christian mythology. It is unique in its size as well as its crisp detail, especially for something so old. Our conservationists are unable to discover its place of origin or creator.  I edged closer and closer to the red velvet rope. Its eyes followed my every step. The room seemed to grow hotter.   The docent moved to the side so people could get pictures in front of the statue. Though I couldn't blame them, I barely kept from yelling. This was madness.  The stone platform on which the demon stood was covered in red velvet, which pooled at the creatures feet. It hid the words inscribed on the front of the granite stand that Jamie and I couldnt read those many years ago.  The docent droned on about nothing and I read the description plaque.  *14th Century representation of the Demon Metaraxes*  *Artist Unknown*  No shit.  And then I saw what I didnt know Id been looking for  the triangles. The symbols I would never forget, etched into the doors of the Damned Church. And once I found one, I found another and another. There were half a dozen of them. *So thats how theyre doing it.* They (whoever they were) had placed wards all around the base of the creatures stand.   The museum not only knew what this thing was, they knew about the sigils on the doors of the Damned Church and were *using* them to trap the statue here. The revelation was like a punch to the face. Someone was aware of what this statue really was and was blatantly risking innocent lives anyway. It was insane.  In a panic, I turned to find the docent and saw her conversing politely with an elderly couple.   Excuse me! I interrupted loudly.   Yes? She failed to mask her irritation at my rudeness.  Where did the museum acquire this statue?  This piece is on loan from a private collection.  Whose?  It belongs to Jameson Scott. The docent, feeling the exchange was over, turned back to finish her conversation.   Jameson Scott. I knew that name, but from where? As our group began to move out of the room I took one last look at the creature  Metaraxes  and shuddered. Its eyes had never strayed from me. I took my phone out and pulled up a Wikipedia page on Jameson Scott. I had to know who could be this stupid.  He was young  my age  but wealthy, had his own company and well known in the tech industry for multiple inventions. The words brilliant, pioneer and industry leader were scattered throughout his Wikipedia page, which had no picture. At the end of the article, under Personal Life, was a short paragraph about his interest in symbolism and ancient artifacts.  I shook my head as my group was herded into the museums gift shop. What did he want with the statue? How had he acquired it? And how did he know about the wards? None of it made sense. I wandered through the gift shop idly picking up trinkets and wondering just what to do. Should I warn the docent? The curator? Or did this Scott person know what he was doing.  Were the wards enough? Somehow, I didnt think so.  Are you going to the lecture tonight? Some one asked from behind me.  I swung around, my backpack nearly taking out a postcard stand as I did.  Oh! Sorry, I thought you were someone else. The redheaded girl turned to leave.  What lecture? I asked before she could get away.  The lecture our guide was talking about? I stared at her blankly. Jameson Scotts lecture on the exhibit?  Hes in town?  Yeah, thats what she said, the girl said, flippantly. You should go, hes really hot.  She turned to leave.  Wait- where is the lecture again?  The auditorium in the history building? Building E? She said, as if I should have known. And I guess she wasnt wrong. I was only a few years older than her and I looked like a college student. Apparently everyone thought so.  Thanks! I yelled after her as she walked off with her giggling friend.  I would definitely be there. I had a few things to say to this guy and I wasnt leaving Pennsylvania until I did.  I sat in the back of the auditorium, as was my custom. The room was filled wall to wall with people, faculty and students alike. An empty podium sat in the front and a tall, blonde haired security guard stood to its left. He had a gun on his hip and his hands were folded behind his back. Maybe he wasnt a security guard after all. I was pretty sure state campuses were gun free, which meant he was with somebody important. Jameson Scott, no doubt.  The guard stared straight ahead, his eyes boring a hole into the wall behind me. Lots of things about him made me uneasy.  The murmurs and whispers died down a moment later when a thin, attractive man walked purposefully onto the stage.  Good evening, he began. He graced the room with a smile that couldn't fool me. The emotion didnt quite reach his eyes; if anything he looked like the most stressed out and tired 25 year old I'd ever seen.  My name is Jameson Scott. I am here to speak to you tonight about a few ancient and interesting items I have collected over the years. I'm sorry, but I will not be answering questions about my company, our newest patents or my personal charities."  *Easy, Christian Gray.* I rolled my eyes.  There were a few disappointed groans from the audience but Jameson Scott smiled and directly a flirtatious wink at no one in particular. He was an alarmingly charming man.  "I have been interested in ancient relics, particularly those of religious significance, for many years. Since I was quite young, actually. A somewhat traumatic experience played the catalyst and I've been studying and collecting ever since. I'll begin with some of my more well known pieces and then move on to the more exotic.   Scott began his lecture on a bowl from Mesopotamia that was supposed to bestow on the user unnaturally long life  as long as you drank from it only water siphoned from the bottom of the Euphrates River. He spoke extensively about several other, equally uninteresting, artifacts before finally coming to the only one I cared about  the statue.  "Please study this photo for a minute." Scott clicked to the next slide in his sideshow and the demon statue appeared against a blood-red background, as imposing and terrifying as it was in real life. A blanket of heavy, uncomfortable air descended on the room as people averted their eyes from the screen and mumbled, uncertainly. I didn't take my eyes off of it.  "This is the piece I spent most of my life trying to locate. May I introduce to you, the demon Metaraxes." He paused for a minute and clicked to the next slide, a Dante-esque depiction of Hell.   "Metaraxes  belongs to the second hierarchy of demons, though he is virtually unknown  and this is simply because of his nature. Metaraxes doesnt kill or possess. He doesnt vie for power, bring darkness into the hearts of men or try to influence innocence.  Metaraxes eats. But he eats more than the flesh of man, he eats their homes, their histories and their souls. If you were to be eaten by Metaraxes it would be as if youd never existed at all. No one would remember you and the now empty piece of life you had carved out for yourself in the world would fill in as if you were never there. Everything that was you or ever would be you is gone.  Jameson Scott paused artfully to let his words wash over the audience; every soul in the room hanging on every syllable. I suppose it really was quite interesting, if you didnt know the heartbreaking truth of it  which I knew he *did*. For someone hailed as a genius it seemed utterly reckless of him to romanticize all this.  I crossed my arms and slumped lower in my chair. When this was over, one way or another, Jameson Scott and I would be having a conversation.   And this is why Metaraxes is an unknown. There is no one to speak his name or his deeds, alive or dead. Or there wasnt, for many centuries."  "At some point in history, Metaraxes grew tired of being unknown and un-worshipped. He proclaimed that those who prayed to him and brought him sacrifice would not only be spared and but also given gifts of everlasting youth and resilience  that which he had stolen from others. It is believed that several ancient civilizations took him up on his offer; they sang his songs, built his temples and created beautiful artwork in his likeness - such as the one in your museum - to praise the demon and reap his gifts."  "And this would have gone on for many years until a name was called that refused to be sacrificed. Metaraxes choose his tribute selectively but eventually a name would come up of someone rich or in power and that person would maneuver out of it, or simply commit suicide. In these instances, Metaraxes would grow angry and eat the city and all the people therein, leaving no trace that he, or they, had ever existed. This would have happens many times over the centuries."  Now this was interesting. The creature could be tamed, like a pet, and as long as you gave it the treat it wanted, you would be not only saved but rewarded.   Something else to consider is that no one ever knew how often Metaraxes called a name. Since the person would be absorbed by the demon, no one would ever remember they had existed at all. It could have been one person a year or five a day and no one would know but the demon himself.  You will find mentions of Metaraxes scattered in religious texts dating back as far as 1700 BC but this statue is rare in that it is the only known likeness of him ever to be found.  Jameson graced the many hands in the air with another tired smile and said, Im sorry but no questions, tonight. If you havent yet had a chance to see the statue of Metaraxes, I encourage you to experience it before it is shipped to New York next month.  Then, without any ceremony at all, Jameson Scott simply walked off stage and the lecture was over.  His security guard, who I realized was more likely a bodyguard, stepped forward to block several girls who jumped the stage to follow his boss. With him busy, I knew I had a chance.  As the throng of people pressed forward to the upper exits, I fell back and went out the rear. I sprinted out of the building and rounded the corner hoping to see what Id gambled was there.  And it was. Jameson Scott was climbing into the back of a white SUV when I spotted him. He glanced in my direction at the sound of his name but then shut the door and rolled down the window as the SUV began to pull away. I threw a Hail Mary.  "Your wards on that demon will never hold!" My voice echoed down the alleyway.  The brake lights came on immediately, but no one exited the car. Taking it as an invitation, I ran up to his window.  For a mere 25 years old, he sure looked like hed seen some shit. His lined, pale, yet attractive face no longer carried a tired look, but a surprised one. I bent over to catch my breath.  He didnt speak, but opened the door and scooted over. I climbed in.  Who may I have the pleasure?  Caitlin Ross, I held out a shaky hand. His surprise seemed to turn to shock.  Caitlin Ross. He said slowly, with a strange inflection of reverence.  Yes, I said, exasperated. Im Caitlin Ross. And your wards  theyre bullshit.  He didnt even bother to ask how Id known, which in turn, bothered me. He simply tapped the seat in front of him and his driver let go of the brake.  Those wards have held for six years, Miss Ross. I assure you, theyll hold.  You have no idea what youre dealing with here.  Oh, I assure you I do. There was a hard, yet sad edge to his voice that suggested  personal tragedy. I wondered if Id misjudged him after all. My apartments are only a block away. Perhaps we should speak more in my study. This isn't a conversation for anyone to overhear.  I noted the finality in his voice and, nodding, sat back in my seat. As long as I got to say what I'd come to say, I didnt care where we went.   We were let off at the corner where several men in his personal detail were already waiting. Scott escorted me into a private entrance and private elevator with only one button marked Penthouse.  As soon as the elevator doors opened, one of his men ushered me into his cavernous study and the door was shut behind me. For whatever reason, Jameson entered from a different door a few minutes later, followed by his head bodyguard whod been at the lecture. This one didnt like me one bit, barely concealing irritation and shades of panic when he saw me. He was older, clearly over 30, with dark blonde hair and a square jaw.  Jameson sat down behind his desk while I continued to stand. He gestured to an empty seat in front of him, but I shook my head. He gave a suit yourself shrug and turned to his bodyguard, whose eyes continued to bore angry holes through me as they did everything else he looked at. This was quickly becoming enemy territory.  Scotch for me, Bannock. Anything for you, Caitlin?  Ah, no thanks... I mumbled as the guard  Bannock  raked his hair back from his forehead in exasperation, I assumed at Scotts familiar use of my first name. *Im no threat to your boss, buddy, if anything he is a threat to everyone else.*  I returned his icy glare, never wavering until his lips grew into a thin line and he curtly nodded to Jameson and left the room.  First, Scott begin, I want to establish-  Do you have any idea what youre doing? I asked, suspending all platitudes.  Jameson leaned back cautiously in his chair, giving me a casual go-on gesture.  Why would you bring that thing to a populated city? Why would you put it on display for all to see and touch? What sort of arrogance allows you to think that you could control it with a few poorly copied sigils?  He had made no move during my short outburst other than to tent his fingers and stroke his jaw with his thumb.  Which question would you like me to answer first?  Just then the one called Bannock opened the door with a little too much force and brought his great lord and master a scotch. He turned to stand beside Jamesons desk, which seemed a natural and familiar spot for him.  You may go, Eric. Jameson clipped without so much as looking at him. The guard didnt move and I continued to stare daggers at him. We engaged in our own little personal, silent standoff. He, like the statue, had eyes only for me, and they were filled with rage and fire.  He can stay, I ground out, finally. Let him know I'm not afraid of him. If he was grateful for my help, he didnt show it.  As you wish. Your question?  I slid my eyes reluctantly back to Jameson. How did you get it?  I bought it from the government.  The government had it? I asked, incredulously.  The state of Pennsylvania. It appeared on government land, in the middle of nowhere, according to the surveyor who found it. They shipped it off to PSU who dated and appraised it and then they put it up for auction.  They just *sold* it to the highest bidder?  Yes and why not? Its just a piece of granite to them and they needed the money. The state of Pennsylvania is suffering its own financial crisis. Though I suppose thats what happens when in essence 20% of the state just stops paying their taxes. Its a curious thing.  I winced. He didnt need to elaborate.  Why did you buy it? I demanded.  Because I have personal history with Metaraxes. He has taken from me.  Hes taken from me, too, but I'm not parading him around in public, risking peoples lives, their *souls* according to you.  If you listened to my lecture, you would know why I do that.  I remained silent. Jameson sighed and leaned forward.  Youre right, Caitlin. The wards wont hold him, not forever, and we don't know what will. The only reason theyre holding now is because Im *giving* him what he wants.  I scoffed. You assume that being exhibited in a museum satisfies the creatures desire for worship? And you're willing to stake people's lives on that?  "I am. That creature has not moved a millimeter since he came into my care. I've employed teams of symboligists and demonologists to research, test and advise me on the safest course of action. And for our efforts, the statue has remained dormant."  "Yes, but it's not dead. You're going to kill someone, someday."  Jameson sprung up from his desk and was in front of me before I even had a chance to take a step back. His bodyguard took an almost involuntary step toward him but it was too late. Jameson was only inches from me and much more intimidating at eye level. Bannock seemed uneasy and ready to pounce if I tried anything. I didnt.  What would you have me do, Caitlin? Would you like to take custody of it? What would you do with it? Tell me, and I'll consider it."  Destroy it!   He gave a sad, desperate bark of laughter. Dont you think I tried that? Dont you think the first thing I did when I acquired it was try to kill it? I tried to incinerate it, hit it with a wrecking ball, I even ran it over with a tank. It wont be destroyed by any tools of man. And, believe me, Caitlin, I paid dearly for my attempts,  almost everything I love is gone."  "Then I'd put it back where it came from." If the church was even still there and *if* I could find it.  "No one can do that." He laughed.  "Who did it kill? Who that you loved?" I don't know why I cared so much, but I couldn't let it go. I had to know.  Scott took a step back but held his ground.   "She was...she..." He trailed off.  And just how did you escape the creature when it came for *you*?   This question hit him physically,  like a bullet. He leaned back against the desk,  suddenly weaker, defeated and less imposing. Bannock visibly relaxed, his hand sliding off the handle of the gun I hadnt noticed was still holstered in his belt.  That is a story for another time.  "Fine. But I wasnt backing down.  Then why you? Why are you the person who is qualified to own the statue?  Because I've seen it's face. My fate is bound to it as surely as yours.  Jameson Scott rubbed his face in genuine exhaustion. If he hadn't been speaking the truth, than he was a damn good actor. He looked up at me, finally, from hooded eyes that burned with some intense, unnamed emotion.  "And who did it take from you?"  "Jamie." I had nothing to hide and I wouldn't disrespect Jamie by hiding the truth. I raised my chin a little higher and crossed my arms. Scott's expression had turned milder, almost pensive and a sad smile graced his handsome face. The tension in the room abated, though Bannock was looking at me intently, his expression unchanged since the moment he'd walked into the room.   When Scott didn't reply, I decided it was now or never.  I want to see it.  No," he replied, quietly.  Alone.  No! This time both Jameson and Bannock had spoken at the same time. I'd known he wouldnt let me go - hed never let me near the statue again. Id assumed this before I'd even met him, which is why Id swiped the museum keycard off his desk as soon as Id had the opportunity.  Why not? I asked him, anyway.  Because he knows you.  And you know he could break the wards if he wanted to.  No, he could never get past the wards. They are perfectly drawn and blessed as they should be. But I wont risk your life. Jameson Scott suddenly seemed battle-weary, so much older than his 25 years.  Dont even try it, Caitlin,  he will take you if you do, and the only one who will ever remember you...is me. His plea was multilayered, intricately woven with threads of both deceit and familiarity. Once again, I was put ill at ease. There was only one more thing I wanted from this room.  Who did it take from you and how?  Tell me that and Ill leave Lannenburg in the morning and never come back. It was lie, but I was curious.  Jamesons eyes shifted to mine, perhaps to gauge if I meant what I said. He must have believed me, because his gaze drifted to the window and he answered my question.  I took her from myself. It was an unsatisfying answer.  Now leave, commanded his bodyguard before Id had a chance to reply. Jameson stared at me as I took a step back from the desk. His eyes were again pregnant with an emotion I couldnt name, but it tread a line between longing and insanity.  Perhaps desperate desire, perhaps insane desperation. Perhaps something in between.  I will walk her out. Bannock bit as I made my escape out the door. *God, anyone but him.*  No, I need you here, Andrews will see her out. The door closed behind me and I heard no more.  Andrews turned out to be an older man with a bald head and a white beard. He met me at the elevator and escorted me all the way to the ground floor, saying little.  Do you need a ride somewhere? He asked as we stepped out into the street.  No, I can walk. He said no more, just turned around and let the private door shut behind him.  Nice of him to ask, at least.  As I walked back to the museum, I had time to wonder just what in the hell I was doing. Why didn't I listen to Scott and just leave? What did I hope to gain by seeing that thing again? Couldnt I just trust that he seemed to have everything under control? Scott had the resources, the money, the people, and, most importantly, the motivation. He had lost someone too, after all, someone he loved, though how that had come to pass was not clear.   But I knew I had to see it again. Perhaps I could prove to him just how dangerous that thing was, regardless of the precautions he was taking. I needed to convince him to take the statue off display before more people died. It was madness, having it here. He was exposing innocent people, to a *demon* on a reckless gamble. If I could make the statue move just an inch or two, maybe even a turn of it's head, it was be on the museum security tapes and I could prove the thing wasn't truly dormant. I read him as a pragmatic, reasonable man - he would remove the exhibit at once. I trusted that much, didn't I?   Once again I pulled up Jameson Scotts Wikipedia page. All I knew was that he was  a pioneer in the tech industry, rich as a Rothschild and interested in 14th century Judeo-Christian artifacts. It didnt fit. It just didnt. ...unless Jameson Scott was telling the truth.  But even if he being honest about his past, Scott was still lying to me about something. Like everything else in the last week, I would have to trust my gut.  I arrived at the museum and walked around the giant building looking for the gift shop. At that moment I knew two things: the statues room was next to the gift shop  and museums usually had nighttime security.  I slid Jamesons card through the reader next to the door and a light flashed green while the door emitted a soft click. I pushed it open and peered into the empty giftshop. Dim overheard lights gave the room an eerie and foreboding glow.   The room reminded me of another room from over ten years ago, a nave, darkened by dirty windows and a muted, setting sun. I was younger then, more innocent, and Id had Jamie then.  What I wouldn't give to have him with me, now.  What would he say? Would he trust Scott? Would he attempt to stir the creature for the greater good? Or would he say I was stupid for risking my life? Jameson was convinced the wards would hold. Would Jamie have been, too?  Whatever happened, I hope I didnt fail him.  [Death of Deepwood, Pennsylvania](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29lk3l/death_of_deepwood_pennsylvania/)   [C.

Also, the above user was making a Hunger Games reference.    My baby goat broke it's neck and I was 18 and home alone and had to put her down myself. It was the most awful thing I've ever done and it haunts me to this day.    I you ever feel bad about yourself, just remember that if you were a fictional character people would love you for all the flaws, quirks and mannerisms that you hate.   It sounds like no one is currently living there (rusted spoon, perfectly laid out sleeping bags). So there are either bodies for OP to find or something just as bad.   Keep us updated on the story, this is getting good.   Thank you!   That was excellent. And mentally scarring.   Is this a series?  If not, did the previous owners seal themselves inside a concrete tomb? To what end?   It more sounds to me like they wanted the (tomb? shelter?) sealed tight so they had a shitty carport that "looked out of place" built over it.   Explain if I'm wrong, I may have the dumb.   Dude... That ending was nauseating yet satisfying.    Like /u/wdalphin said, read other stories! Sometimes you'll think of a way better ending to something you're reading and just build from there.   There's nothing for it, you just have to write it and post it. Trust me, I know how unnerving it is which is why I only post about half of what I actually write. But you just gotta do it, son.

 That was uni-corny   I was riding my bike home at night after work and I stopped at McD's to grab a burger.

  The original xtians were pretty close to the jews of that time.  The original Christians were Jews, full stop.   While what the hotel did was really wrong, suing is a bit over the top. They should give him an apology, a refund, and a free stay at the hotel for a week.   Hitchhiker's. Because it's short, sweet, and almost always on point.   Discworld has been going on for so long that at this point there are more books that I didn't like than I did like.   We've moved my office a bunch of times. The movers were all Irish. From Ireland.   Everything that's been said already is correct, but colonel is an exceptionally strange case.  1540s, coronell, from Middle French coronel (16c.), modified by dissimilation from Italian colonnella "commander of a column of soldiers at the head of a regiment," from compagna colonella "little column company," from Latin columna "pillar" (see column). English spelling modified 1580s in learned writing to conform with the Italian form (via translations of Italian military manuals), and pronunciations with "r" and "l" coexisted 17c.-18c., but the earlier pronunciation prevailed. Spanish coronel, from Italian, shows a similar evolution by dissimilation.  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0 search=colonel searchmode=none   I can't think of a single series I've been glad to have finished. Wheel of Time, Dark Tower, Harry Potter, regretted them one and all. Even Hitchhikers got progressively worse and I certainly regret bothering with the books that Douglas Adams didn't write.   very single one of my Asian friends  Asian-American friends.    I don't know what goes through their minds, never having done it, but I'd rather someone speak up and then have to apologize if they've made a mistake rather than letting people getting away with taken parking space they're not entitled to.   Yeah! Nobody should ever stand up for anybody else's rights. Nobody should ever stand up to assholes or bullies. I can't imagine what goes through anybody's mind when they try to help people. It's ridiculous.   I don't know where you live but I literally went card shopping three hours ago and hardly any of them have ribbons or bows.   And if some of them do, it's just a style fad. The way some cards have audio cards inside and play a song or a sound when you open them. Or the way some of them pop up. Or the way some of the are like three feet tall. It doesn't have any particular significance.   Technically both phrases mean both things.

Your body knows when you've had enough water because the cells that need the water are filled, and your thirst goes away.  But what inhibits you from drinking more? Nothing. You can drink water until you die and nothing in your body will physically stop you from doing it.    Nobody owns the rights to Bible stories so they can make Moses whatever race they want. The same goes for historical events. Nobody owns history.   As for anime, Asians don't care about racism the way Americans do; they couldn't care less what race of actor you cast in the adaptations.   If you have a market-rate apartment (not rent stabilized or rent controlled), they can increase the rent however much they want. There are no legal restrictions.   But it's not arbitrary. They need to balance making a profit against the likelihood that someone will pay the increased rent. If they raise it too high above other comparable apartments in the area, you might move and nobody else will rent it. If they raise it too little, they won't feel they're making enough money.   Most likely they will raise it $100 a month or thereabouts.   A Noahide is allowed, but not required or obligated, to mark the significance of the  Seventh Day in some ways.  http://asknoah.org/essay/the-seventh-day  So if they don't observe it they're not really missing anything they're obligated to do.        For the religious Jews, their calendar is the right one, and everyone else is observing the wrong holy day.  Not true. Non-Jews have no obligation to observe Saturday or any other day as the Sabbath. If they follow a religion with a different Sabbath day, there's nothing wrong with that.   Here's how Christianity's Sunday Sabbath developed:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_in_Christianity#Origin_of_Sunday_rest  And here's how Islam's Friday Sabbath developed:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath#Islam   Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender, men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component).   http://www.rightleftrightwrong.com/statistics.html   Fifty Shades of Grey is the only "spin-off" of Twilight that I can think of  that has been especially successful. And it didn't do it by mimicking Twilight the way Charlie Bone mimicked Harry Potter. So no, I didn't respond to the wrong comment. I disagreed that the reason why Charlie Bone wasn't successful and Harry Potter was had anything to do with the series growing as its audience did.   It helps, but I didn't think it's the worst thing in the world if you don't. Even though they do sometimes reference things that happened in previous books, they're not strictly a continuing story so it's not hard to follow along.   Charlie Bone was too similar to Harry Potter, that's why it didn't take off. 50 Shades of Grey is extremely different from Twilight.     but many, many more around vampires  Name five. I can't think of any off the top of my head.    As was already pointed out, SparkNotes and the like already exist. It is perfectly legal.   It definitely doesn't need decorations. Chairs are a good idea though since you'll probably have women in heels and older people who would appreciate being able to sit down.   There is no doubt that cops are better than they were, say, 50 years ago, it's just getting more attention now. The Rodney King incident happened 24 years ago; the Watts riots were incited by a police brutality incident 50 years ago.  In "the olden days" people were better at covering things up, that's all.   Through artificial assistance aka fake tans or using a tanning booth.   today I read a fact that the mental condition and stress levels of teenagers is close to that of mental patients in the 1950s.  This is a widely misused quote/statistic. It was originally reported in the 1980s, then a meta-analysis was done in 2000 about studies done through 1993. I can't find anything more recent. But even if anxiety has only gone up since 1993, it's part of a continuing trend, not something that is distinctly new about the 21st century.  http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp7961007.pdf  The only reason why things seem more prevalent than they used to be is because of the Internet and more of a willingness to admit things like depression, especially among boys.    Pandora's explanation:  Free Pandora accounts permit 6 skips per hour per station, for up to 24 total skips per day across all stations. The daily skip limit helps us prevent having to pay royalties on songs that are not being heard.  Upgrading to Pandora One increases your 24-hour skip limit, but does not remove the skip limit entirely. You can learn more about Pandora One here.  A skip is considered to be a skipped song, a Thumbs-down rating, or choosing "I'm tired of this track" in the menu of the music player.  Licensing is one of the most expensive aspects of providing the service, and we must pay the full royalties for a song, even if it only plays for a few seconds.  http://help.pandora.com/customer/portal/articles/24601-skip-limit   A small trampoline, if you have a room with a high enough ceiling.   If you wrote them, why not?    One for example I found by looking at the "What's New" feed at Internet Archive - they add a few thousand new books a day, all very old and very obscure. One day I just decided to read one. No had ever reviewed it on Amazon, Goodreads or anywhere else on Google search. I was the first person in the age of the Internet to post anything about it. The last review of the book was from 1912 when it was published.   What book was it?   Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. So many old/Christian terms I'd never heard of.    Boring or execrable writing. And forget halfway through, I'll put a book down on page one if I dislike it that much.    You have to link to the llama post directly, otherwise it'll be gone and nobody's going to scroll through a Tumblr blog just to find the post you're talking about.  That said, is it his llama? Do you think he might lend it to someone for a few hours? Asking for a friend.    Depends on the person.    I never knew that there were romance novels from the male perspective.   Me either. The only thing I can think of that comes close is lad lit, the male version of chick lit.  Though last week I read Graveyard of Memories by Barry Eisler (a thriller) and there was a romance in it from a male point of view. It was just as unrealistic as any romance from a woman's point of view.    Never up until now. I'm planning on reading the Hobbit and there are so many editions. The problem is that Tolkien actually revised the book after it was published and I want to read the last revision, but the book descriptions don't always make it clear which version the printing is of.    They are just sluts. No need for any qualifications. That's why I have no problem with this word. It's a behavior men and women engage in and both can be described that way and both are disgusting.   I finished the Unbearable Lightness of Being this week and the main character admitted to sleeping with over 200 women. He is a slut, period. That's not a D I'd want to go anywhere near.   Would you rather have an ice cream scooped out with a clean ice cream scooper or one that was used on every other flavor and never washed?    Caleb Carr has written a number of books.  I just finished the River of Souls by Robert McCammon today. I basically had to force myself to read it and I really wish I hadn't bothered -- it didn't pay off in any way in the end. It felt like a bridge book to the next one and the writing was so dull.    So you mean "what book you discovered by accident." And yet, even when I'm looking for new books to read, anything I come across can arguably be called "by accident" since I wasn't specifically searching for *that* book. You can't search for a book that you don't know exists.   I thought it was a great book, best one they "forced" me to read in high school.    For example, you can't say that a person watches movies well. That just doesn't make sense. (Which isn't the same as saying they have bad taste in the movies.)      Read the sources on the Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_flu   We have plenty of machines that can listen to a person's heart or lungs. But that's the problem -- they're machines. They're not cheap or fast or portable. Stethoscopes are basically perfectly suited for their purpose.   The book itself is about 80 pages, so if an edition is longer, it means there's an introduction and other helpful material. But those both look like crappy editions. Get a copy from a reputable publisher like Penguin or Dover.    They don't care about other people's babies, only their own.   Right. How doesn't this have more upvotes? Being anti-vax is predicated on the deeply delusional belief that their child will be fine no matter what. Every anti-vax parent whose kid got sick with something they should have been vaccinated against very quickly does a complete u-turn on the subject.   That's physically impossible. If the cable network is out, your phone is not connected to anything. You're talking about a local power outage only.   A real landline is useful in emergencies when the power goes out.   ITT: People who think a phone bundled with their cable is a landline. It's not. When the Internet (or power) goes out, so does the phone.   Nobody's perfect. But I'm not seeing how saying al hamichya is in any way analogous to having sex.    You're one person. I was once on a program on a kibbutz for a few weeks. The shul was literally right there, the weather was beautiful (in other words, no good excuses for not going). By the end of the program, out of 20 people, only two were still going to shacharit. So you're one of the two. But the other 18 are the normal ones.   Only if you're in kollel. Otherwise, just having to get early to get to minyan before work is a heroic feat.   Nobody's perfect, but remembering to say al hamichya is hardly impressive. A better example might be going to minyan three times a day every day. If you do that, that's impressive.    Are all singles "equal" (for lack of a better word)?  For this particular conversation: Yes.  What I mean is, does a divorced woman have the same status as a single woman?   See above.   Yes, that's the halachic ideal, so is saying al hamicha after eating some oreos. And how many times have you done that?  Every time? I don't understand this point.    Again, my point was that some wigs make the wearer look overly attractive  You are absolutely correct and even some rabbis that allow wigs frown on or speak out against these overly sexy creations. Looking good is perfectly tznius; looking sexy isn't. Looking sexy is absolutely forbidden.    The Outsiders (S. E. Hinton). I watched the movie once when I was a teen and once when I was older, thinking a little distance from the book would make me not hate it, but nope, still thought it was terrible.   Too long, overhyped.   Thanks, but how is being crucified defeating the dark lord of the underworld? Isn't that he died for people's sins? (Not a Christian, not overly familiar with the NT or Christian theology.)   Where is that in the Bible? New Testament?   Or Wizard's Hall by Jane Yolen. Interesting that the Books of Magic and Wizard's Hall came out within a year of each other. Clearly this was an idea that was percolating and Rowling caught the bug too, only it took her seven more years to put her book out.  In 1991, the author Jane Yolen released a book called Wizard's Hall, to which the Harry Potter series bears a resemblance. The main protagonist, Henry (also called Thornmallow), is a young boy who joins a magical school for young wizards.[74] At the school "he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard."[75] However, Yolen has stated that "I'm pretty sure she never read my book," attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes.[76] In an interview with the magazine Newsweek, Yolen said, "I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to cut me a very large check, I would cash it."[77] Yolen stopped reading Harry Potter after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of Harry Potter, calling it "fantasy fast food".[77][78]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_influences_and_analogues#Wizard.27s_Hall   Something you might keep in mind that lately there's been a huge backlash against creative writing courses, particularly MFA degrees. I don't remember their exact argument, but it's easy enough to Google.   I certainly didn't understand the difference at that age.  Were you were even taught the difference? Nowadays they have "bad touch" lectures in schools. When I was a kid we didn't. We got the rape lectures in high school but child abuse was a taboo topic.   I think children of capable of understanding the concept of "bad touch" versus "I find this really annoying but I'm willing to put up with it because old person."   I saw your comment below in the thread and at least where I'm from, boys are much more likely to get their cheeks pinched than girls. It's a different dynamic than you (and possibly) OP is describing. So if the touching comes off as creepy it would be better to tell to stop, but pinching, while not fun, is clearly harmless.    Would you be interested in a critique of the entire novel?   I once took a creative writing course (adult ed, not college) and I found it completely unhelpful. Each week we focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g., character, plot, description) and we had to read a short story that illustrated this technique, write a little in class and do a homework assignment. Maybe because one week per technique wasn't enough or maybe because I'm not the kind of person who can produce a story on demand, but I felt this was completely unhelpful.  Though I did eventually develop a story idea that has a ton of potential and I've been writing about it ever since, so at least I had that going for me.    That I lived with my parents. Too embarrassing. (Thankfully it's not the case anymore.)      It doesn't just taste bad, it smells bad too.   It depends what sort of community you live in. Where I live, this is very typical old-person behavior. And actually, it's worse than touching or patting, it's usually cheek-pinching, and kids hate it. But at the same time, I do feel like it's the sort of thing you just have to put up with.    Thanks, putting it on my list!   This is completely untrue. Popcorn is actually quite healthy and has tons of nutritional value. It is an excellent snack.  And the facts speak for themselves: a single portion of popcorn contains more antioxidants than all the fruit and veg most people eat in a day, as noted in a study by Scranton University. Antioxidants keep molecules harmful to cells in check, and are present in many fresh fruits and vegetables. Popcorn also has a large amount of vitamins; folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamins B, A, E, and K, as well as being a source of iron, potassium, zinc, and polyphenols which contain the antioxidants to fight off cancers and cardiovascular health problems.  http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/popcorn-healthy-5-ways-keep-popcorn-healthy.html   This article is a mess.   The reason why relationships can't be based on explicit exchange is because hardly anybody can handle the truth about themselves or anybody else. Not too many people are going to be honest about their failings as a friend or partner, and in any event, most people are willing to put up with their loved one's failings even to the extent that they put up with abusers.  But it's also because in every relationship, there's always somebody who loves/gives/does more and somebody who loves/gives/does less because there are no two people who are exactly alike and are in exactly the same circumstances.   Books similar to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series?    4 wisdom tooth. 4. Can't be taken out because they are mostly horizontal.  Why does their being horizontal mean that they can't be taken out?   Different reasons.   Fat doesn't conduct heat well, so while it does insulate your body, it feels colder to the touch. So wherever you have larger fat stores, those parts will feel colder.   Another thing is that your hands and feet are more likely to have poorer blood circulation than the rest of your body so they're more likely to feel cold.    How would you know these sounds are happening in real life unless they're waking you up? That means that at the time they're happening, you're actually minimally awake and shaking off the dream you just had and it feels like the sounds are part of the dream, but really you're just hearing them IRL.   There were tons of crappy books being published one hundred years ago. You're confusing 1908 with 1708.    While theoretically I agree with you, practically speaking, have you ever read Rowell? I had such high hopes for Fangirl and was sorely disappointed.    lauded as a great writer  I'm not sure what world you live in that anyone has ever lauded him as a great writer. Ever.   Read Ender's Shadow instead. So much better than Ender's Game.   That's what I did with Wheel of Time. So what I did was read two pages per day and took over a year to finish each book. That way I didn't really waste any precious time on it, but still finished it. Regretted starting the series in the first place, but didn't entirely regret finishing it.   Yeah, so this map is interesting but not entirely accurate, since there's a third category.   Aren't Newkirk through Church Avenue on the Q line below ground level?    Death and the Flower by Koji Suzuki. I've liked his horror novels and figured even though it wasn't horror, I'd probably like this too. Nope. Couldn't get through it.    Generally speaking, it's because your parents are supposed to be teaching you life skills, while school is supposed to be teaching you academic subjects so you can be a knowledgeable person and as preparation for a future job.   I'm so annoyed because I buy bananas every Monday night and not only were the lines out the door, the bananas were sold out. Should have bought them yesterday, darn it.   Off the top of my head: Where are all the exits. Not just the main one that the stop is named after, but all of them.    Your way is inefficient. One benefit of a re-designed subway map is so that it will have more information, not less.   Could you give me an example of a station where the cross streets would be important on?  All of them.    Why do the 2/3 go under the B/D/E while the 1 goes over them? It makes it looks like there's some significance to that, but there isn't.       I know a couple just like this and my sense is that the wife doesn't really care about their finances because she doesn't think they'll ever really need that much money, like a downpayment for a house, and she's really too young to begin to understand the concept of retirement, so she figures, so what if we live paycheck to paycheck and enjoy ourselves, life is going to be like this forever.  It might be helpful to sit down and work out what your long-term goals are, including buying a house, paying for your kids' college education, and having a decent income in retirement. Then maybe she'll understand why saving is a lot more important than she realizes.   Seriously? I feel like there's been a massive change from 2000 to now. The rise of the SJW, the fact that everybody on the Internet is stealing from everybody else, the massive amounts of pessimism about the future, etc.    Are all in the Isreali government Jewish?  No, there are Muslim Arabs and Druze elected to Israel's parliament.   Minimum of 40 hours. In other words, sure, I'd love to work four 8-hour days, but 32 hours often isn't considered full time.   Or maybe PBS isn't interested in Canadian programming.   Literally the one week a year that I must go into the office. Ah man.   Actually, I take it back. It might possibly be in his book of poems Between Tears and Laughter.   Edit: ~~Pretty sure it's a fake quote.~~ Maybe not.   The other two books are called The Mystery of Lord Sha and  The Face of the Shadow. All three are listed on Amazon India.    Maybe I'll work Monday through Thursday.  That would be the best thing except that I can't handle 10-hour days. I've  done it and it's left me a complete wreck. And if working full-time means working 40 hours, I'd rather stick with Monday to Friday.   Because even if recycling creates a certain amount of pollution, making new paper and putting old paper in landfills creates even more.   That is weird.  Is their family from Russia? Bad memories of the tsar?   You really think that anybody who named their kid Isidore had any idea what it meant? Though it is an interesting question how such an ugly name like Isidore became popular. Similarly Morris, Ira, and Irving.    if you have rule out any name associated with a saint, that's a lot of names.   Yes, that's right. Traditionally Jews gave their children Hebrew names and then at some point they added Yiddish names, which tended to be translations of the Hebrew name. Like Tzipporah-Feigie, which both mean bird. And then when English names came around, they tended to give English translations of the Hebrew names like Rivka-Rebecca.   I've known Jewish people with Gaelic names and all kinds of European names, so it's odd that Nicholas specifically would be off the table.  Nicholas isn't off the table. Like I said, if you eat ham and cheese, it really doesn't matter that much what you name your kids.    I have a couple of friends who have Fridays off for different reasons and the way it works is that Thursday night is for shopping and Friday is for preparing for the Sabbath. They never use those times for leisure activities. (One is single and the other is married with children, so you can't even say that it's the fault of their situations. Their situations could not be more different.)   If I were offered the option of having off on Friday but not Sunday, I would not take the offer.  And for secular people, they'd adjust to having Sunday off instead of Friday pretty easily. Considering that hundreds of millions of people around the world have off on Sunday, it's not like this is some kind of impossible thing to deal with.    Since you posted this 18 hours ago, I'm going to assume you're not a Sabbath-observer. As a Sabbath-observer, having Friday off does not make more sense. While it's nice to be able to have the whole day to prepare for the Sabbath, that's exactly the problem. The only thing you can do (especially in the winter) is have time to prepare for the Sabbath. So if you want to go to the beach in the summer or hang out with some friends or go to a concert on Saturday night, you're not going to be able to do that.  Having Sunday off works better regardless of whether you're a Sabbath observer or not.   You should be thinking about the meaning of the prayers that you're saying. And if you can't do that, just concentrate on the words themselves and blank out your mind to all other thoughts.   Google "university press" and look at their websites. As a clinical psychologist, you must subscribe to journals...? Look into those...?   It's a name that's strongly associated with Christianity. So any Jew who really cares about being Jewish and transmitting the tradition to the next generation would not give their child that name. Anybody who's a ham-and-cheese Jew will do whatever they want.  From the Greek name  (Nikolaos) which meant "victory of the people" from Greek  (nike) "victory" and  (laos) "people". Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Anatolia who, according to legend, saved the daughters of a poor man from lives of prostitution. He is the patron saint of children, sailors and merchants, as well as Greece and Russia. He formed the basis for the figure known as Santa Claus (created in the 19th century from Dutch Sinterklaas), the bringer of Christmas presents.  Due to the renown of the saint, this name has been widely used in the Christian world. It has been common in England since the 12th century, though it became a bit less popular after the Protestant Reformation. The name has been borne by five popes and two czars of Russia.  http://www.behindthename.com/name/nicholas   It looks like it was a French TV movie, never released on DVD since they don't have it on Amazon.fr. So... torrent?   Sounds like your best bet would to try to work for an academic or general non-fiction publisher that puts out either scholarly or popular non-fiction psychology titles. With your background, it will be extremely hard to get hired as a general editor or book reviewer.    I just googled "historical photos walking with newspaper" :P  You must have strong Google-Fu because I put in the same thing and got nothing.  might be the only one of those I think I've experienced personally.  That's lucky -- I've encountered a lot of bad behavior.    Thanks.  Though you do realize that these are not comparable to what people are typically complain about? The slow walker. The person who suddenly stops at the top of the train steps. The person who thinks that the whole world needs to hear them going through the ring tones on their phone. The person who falls into an open manhole because they weren't paying attention, etc.  Google tells me the first picture is of the day Japan surrendered, and the second two are of people walking their dogs in parks, not walking down Fifth Avenue or some other crowded area.  	117
 I can't make it sex ed, today. My son is sick.   We here at EA would like to announce our new plane pilot controller for out newest game; Terrorism Simulator, 2001.   Ms. Frizzle: And this, Arnold, is a close up of the clitoris. See how it swells?  Arnold: I should have stayed home today.   There is one more unforgivable curse. Some girls here may remember their daddy using it on them when they were young. There's no way to undo it. There's no such thing as being a virgin again.   First thing I think of is stone walls or great monuments. Something with a huge defense. Or even golems.      Hi, I'm johny depp. I'm here about the roll of chicken little.   Now if you turn to page 256, we'll discuss why the Gameboy will be the most sought after item in the new world order.   I bet, since we're both men, your wife won't suspect a damn thing.

So the right tire blew out, and since i made a joke about her being the cause, she called me a misogynist and not failed me, now I'm not allowed back for 5 months.   Got sued by feminist in sexual harassment case for reading her shirt. Almost pay $1 million. settle out of court for $250,000.   It's me! The Midwife! Here to OH MY GOD IT'S GODZILLA!!! RUN!

Anyway, popcorn for Jimmy, gummy bears for Jane, and a bag of potato chips for me.   The best time to wear a striped sweater is when you're holding the button to annihilate those who laugh at you.   Yeah I know where babies come from. You want the charts? Movie? or personal demonstration?   Marry Christmas. Here's a copy of 50 Shades of Grey.   I'll take celebrity genitalia audio clues for 1000.   All right, let's see what's under Drew Carey's desk.   You are a geek in middle school trying to up his street cred by sitting down with groups of delinquent and sexually active band geeks. Roll for intelligence?   And that's an awesome thing. Let me get this straight. It's awesome that these were reported for Apple to fix and spend time on instead of being abused by the finders. An operating system has to harbor a huge deal of running software, so I would expect operating systems to have more bugs and vulnerabilities than anything else.  But now instead of hearing that vulnerabilities are being attacked, they are being reported and addressed. And Lettie honest. We would all rather the next big update will be closing up these holes as well as performance improvements instead of mindless additions of new features adding more bugs to the list.   That would be so cool if it worked the way it were supposed to.   That 102%.   Deck size according to the official rules.  The size of your main deck should be anywhere from 40 to 60. Your extra deck should be between 0 and 15 cards. Your side deck should be between 0 and 15 cards.  People who tell you it *has* to be 40 are likely just suggesting that 40 is optimal.   That's why he's saying it should be an *option*. I'm sorry, do you not know what that word means?      I might just be grasping at straws here, but I doubt my sister won't make the news like I did. For those of you who dont know, I left links to my previous posts right here:  * First Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/ * Second Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/ * Third Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2w37oa/i_made_the_news/  I'll definitely give her credit. She's braver than I am. Insane actually. She's staying overnight in the hospital while the doctors tend to her stab wonds. Just inches away from the heart.  She found my bookmark while I was away at therapy. Im doing much better by the way, thanks for wondering. It was yesterday at therapy she invaded my bookmarks and found it. She could see it clear as day. At least according to her. When I try to see it again, I get another 404 error message. As if the page isn't found or doesn't want to be. Or it's pretending to be hidden. Here's the bookmark link I told you about:  cipherthecipherfor.schl.com/hotline/cipher#underground.  Go ahead, try it yourself. I wouldn't recommend it to be brutally honest.  Early this morning, she told me at the hospital how happy she was feeling to know people cared. When I asked her to go on, she shifted to a story about her friend who had hung herself last Thanksgiving.  She was convinced by the cipher that she could reach her dead friend with the cipher. Then, a bit more quickly than I was, she was convinced that suicide was the path to her friend. As she stabbed herself, she supposedly thought of the wound as a reunion wound. Sound cheesy? It's my little sister. I don't understand half of the things that come out of her.  I cant imagine how she and I could have such poor judgment. The human mind is a sick thing, and some great minds may think alike, but it almost seems like a coinsidence. I deleted that bookmark and even deleted my entire browser history to make sure I never find this cipher again. At least not on accident. I already regret leaving it here.  Although, I do feel a thirst to know a bit more. But, I'm hoping it will all work out in therapy.   Yeah. I do. Funny you should reply today. I was about to post an update.      Imagine having hype even though there were only 14 characters. It was still rather awesome. The game feels so much better compared to then.   Well, who made these entitled jerks the title police?   LE console?    This thread has been removed because the original poster has a dispute with another user which he has been ignoring. This user will receive a temporary ban from trading and selling until he works it out with the other user.   I ran into a similar problem where I needed to shoot a bubble as a deku, but every time I pressed B, he would take out the land title deed.   I know what you mean. One of the subs I mod has 10k subscribers and I've NEVER seen a post above 20 upvotes. I try my best to upvote more, but most of the content there is actually pretty mediocre. At least here, we don't have an excuse. There needs to be more upvotes.  I mod and made subs with only 900 subscribers that regularly get posts to reach 25-30 upvotes. Proportionally, that's just sad.   There's nothing wrong with posting it here. You should be allowed to edit the vine and clip or delete different shots of it. I'm not sure how. Haven't used to app to actually upload anything that needed editing in weeks.   Returning to their roots? Lol. This sounds cool.   It wasn't really a depression. It was more like a sudden impulse that took over my life. And now the results just won't let me move on. Everyone's afraid that I'll attempt suicide again if they don't keep an eye on me. The only real alone time I get is practically when I shower.   Well, this is a strange question to answer. Japanese cards are for the OCG, while most other languages are part of the TCG. Now, you may use foreign cards as long as you have a separate copy of the card (outside of your deck). This offers an immediate credible translation to prevent cheating or dishonesty.  However, if you're in the TCG, you CANNOT use OCG cards in your deck under any circumstances. This goes both ways. If Japanese cards were allowed in the TCG, they would probably be a lot more.  These are the rules for large sanctioned events. Your locals may handle it differently depending on a number of factors. I would first ask your judges, then make sure any opponents you face don't mind. But, always have an English copy ready.   Thanks. Don't be surprised if you get something tomorrow. I have been talking with the same people for way too long. It's driving me back up a wall.   Holy shit. Way to go Kaspersky.   It's actually not mechanically impossible. Two monsters with the same attack battling doesn't ebd in 0 damage, it sends in no damage. It's a weird concept.  Think of it this way, damage has to be felt in a value. The value of 0 cannot be delt. When we say no damage, it means there technically is no value to deal to either player.  Two more interesting bits is that a direct attack if 0 atk also doesn't set a value for damage. Also, two monsters attacking with 0 atk doesn't destroy either monster.   ... I'm not kidding. My friends actually believe Nintendo bought P:M.   There's a rumor in my small community that Nintendo bought Project M and is halting its development and that no new versions will ever come out. How the hell did this rumor happen? I immediately checked here and on the game's page and found nothing hinting that it was true.  I even had one guy tell me since no new versions were coming that he wanted his money back (that was used to buy a flash drive and SD card, I didn't sell him P:M) because no new versions were coming out.  Where the hell could this rumor be coming from?    "When I first showed off the new Zelda game on the Wii U, it seemed everyone was very excited and started proclaiming that a Zelda game had at last become open world! Zelda games have always allowed you to roam and explore a huge world.   "What's changed now is that the hardware has progressed to the point that you can now explore this vast world seamlessly; the underpinning of the game hasn't changed."  I can't wait for people to misinterpret this and say stuff like, "Oh, that means we're not getting the game we wanted. We're getting the same shitty linear game from last time."   Gerudo Desert in TP didn't have a lot in it. And never a lot of things at the same time.   Hair cleaner is sort of the same way. Most of this "cleaner" shit that promises better looking skin or hair is actually mostly comprised of stuff that can't actually do anything for us.   I really wish "leaks" would finally just be seen as a fucking joke on the internet. Isn't there anyone else who never takes a leak seriously?   Okay. Just making sure I understood!  Thanks    Have you ever heard of a slow news day? I attempted suicide and told the story a few days ago, there's the link to it in case you want to read about that.  http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2vnyia/i_attempted_suicide/  Now my local news station is hooked on my suicide attempt. Local channels have been buzzing the feed with how I starved for twelve days. How will people treat me when I leave my house? Will they see me the same? In one hand, I hold anticipation of the pity and uplifting comments I might get. The other simply holds dread for the ones that will look at me differently. As if I'm a freak that don't belong.  But I sort of feel that way. The last thing I need is for people to treat me like a complete satanist. If you couldn't tell, the town is highly superstitious. It makes me more than just glad that they didn't tell the town my reasoning for attempting. I faked the answer anyway. The real reason would sound absurd to them.  My chosen method of deteriorating my inner being was supposedly the biggest reason they are covering this. Supposedly nobody else tries to starve themselves to death. Please, do not call me asking if you can order me a pizza.  My friends are throwing an "alive party" for me next weekend. Kind of can't wait for that. Then again, I sort of don't want to go. I dread the possible mockery and a huge buffet of food being shoved down my throat through a funnel.  My therapist is calling me every four hours to make sure I have something to eat. My parents have been cooking every day now. Sure, eating sodium noodles is better than nothing, but I almost died of starvation. They don't want me dying from what I eat. How ironic that would be. Am I using that word right?  So I started looking at that cipher again. Yeah, I wouldn't be posting here if this wasn't about something weird going on. Let me correct myself. I tried looking at the cipher. The url I found it out doesn't work anymore. It worked the entire time I was suicidal. Can anyone else see if it works? Just as a warning, if you're afraid of the stranger parts of the web, I wouldn't want you to look.  cipherthecipherfor.schl.com/hotline/cipher#underground.  I took it straight from my bookmarks, so It should be correct. I even tried adding http://www. before it.  I'm just wondering if its just me of it its being taken down.   dank?   I don't doubt it. I have a friend with an LG TV. Probably the sexiest definition I've ever seen.   1. Make good vines. Don't skimp out on the production quality. There are many tiny things you can do to make your vine look a little better. If you're doing a voice-over in particular, don't do it in a setting where you see black bars running up and down the screen. Get a good view of the screen and don't make it sound like you're afraid of waking people up. If someone screams, make them scream instead of a fucking little whisper scream.    There's a particular voiceover I've watched probably more than 100 times myself.  2. Make vines that do loop. This sounds obvious, but it's actually a really good method. I've probably put in more than 40 loops in the "What's that" "Amnesia Spray" vine I saw. It's a simple loop, but it works.  3. Follow others. This sounds like a cheap tactic, but people do look into the following list of funny viners to see who they think is also funny and/or talented. And they look in the followed by list to see others that are into the same type of vines. So follow people who do vines similar to yours. Every once in a while, you can unfollow and refollow to put yourself at the top of the list for more exposure. It's not illegal, it's not hacking, and it's much more ethical than following channels that follow you just because you're following them (follow 4 follow channels).  4. If you cheat and use Vine Client or some other method of uploading edited vines, use a better camera than your phone. And learn/obtain better editing software if you can. It's simple, but it goes a long way.  5. Send your vines to your friends. Yeah, I'm serious. I have friends who skip my vines unless I tell them that I uploaded a new one. And most of the time, your friends' followers are your followers. So make sure they revine any vines that they really like from your page.   Well, if LG rolled with the good ideas and implemented them in their own unique and innovative way, that would be awesome. Sadly, it's less likely to happen.   You sound like an elitist piece of shit too. I've never fucking played the game. But I never will. I'll never fucking play a game that conditions me to want to play all day and tells me I'm not allowed to. That's pretty much the definition of shitty business practices.   I'm guessing Apple is tired of Samsung's shit.   Forgive me, but I've never heard of a game of solitaire that costs you extra money to play more than 3 times in 1 day. And solitaire decides where all cards are at the start instead of deciding what card is which as you reveal them. Yeah, solitaire is Unwinnable sometimes, but that isn't the creator's fault. That's more of a fault of the game's design that cannot be changed. But Candy Shit Does have a design than can be changed. They COULD make it so the game could detect un-winnable boards and tweak the RNG. But they don't. They would fucking love for you to get 10 unwinnable boards so you decide to pay 5 dollars to play an extra round that day.   And if I remember, the game market crashed once partly due to advertising and box art that were way too realistic and far beyond what the games actually looked like. People became so fucking tired of ads and box arts lying to them.   This is just pathetic. It's a ducking RNG puzzle that sometimes might not even spawn a winnable state. It just preys on poor pathetic loser phone owners who really have nothing better to do than be too frustrated with RN-Jesus to even care about their wallet.   The shape and size of the port is standardized. What's in the cord technically isn't.   I don't really support the micro USB being a standard thing. Not all cords are created equal. And, unfortunately, when you mix and match cords to devices, you could end up with cords that don't work any more or too much power being related to a device causing potential harm. This is likely more to do with Nintendo protecting their system. Believe it or not, I've lost electronic devices to using cords from 3rd parties or other devices.   How much do you want for it?   How much did you get that for? And how much do you want for it?   Luckily, I have more than 6 SD cards. So I can just install this on a spare. Wish me luck.   That's nice. I've been at this for since Melee. And even I haven't achieved a 100% L-cancel rate.   Please read the rules.   As supposed to Super Mario Bros where you went right and jumped over obstacles? It doesn't get much more linear than that.   She saved kittens. This is now my favorite good girl Gina meme.   The seller has informed us that you started demanding progress on the card only 12 hours after you paid. Users sending out over the weekend is a common thing. Sellers taking 1-2 days to send is also a common thing. Active traders often make as many deals as they can in those days so they can make a single trip to the post office.  If you needed your card(s) urgently, you should have made that clear beforehand and have been willing to cover for shipping.  I'm sorry, but your feedback is void. /u/hgxarcher will not be held accountable.   Every character already has Powershielding which provides a way to counter something providing 0 shield stun. Yeah, powershielding is rarely used and is frame perfect, but Smash is filled with rare events and frame-tight abilities.  And I'm not quick to put "gimmick" onto something. I know I get frustrated whenever any character is given something cool, everyone rushes to call it some sort of game-ruining gimmick or some sort of gimmick the character relies on. So far, I have yet to see anyone actually rely on a character's new ability.  Now, despite all of that, this mechanic looks extremely defensive and seems to encourage defensive gameplay. Part of the goal of Project M is to create a game where offensive is more favorable than defensive. I don't see how this parry being implemented across the cast would favor the game becoming a fast-based offensive game.   If it were true, then the scalpers win.   I assume either one of them got caught cheating, or one of them doesn't trust the other not to cheat. In either case. that relationship is heading to a halt.   Some of you will know me for the post that almost nobody could read. Here's a link in case you don't know what I'm talking about.  http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2u6af1/i_was_told_posting_this_somewhere_public_was_the/  Don't worry, I'm not posting anything like that again. I've learned my lesson, and it drove me near to death's cold hand.  I tried starving myself to death. Alone, isolated, and hungry, I collapsed from hunger 12 days into the fast. I was absolutely prepared to die, but I woke up mere hours later in the hospital. I gave my family an extreme heart attack. They asked why I did it, and I told them the whole story.  A few weeks ago, I met a girl online. It was through her older sister. On YouTube, she left a comment on one of my videos saying it made her day and that she had been contemplating suicide as well. Two days later, she decided against it.  It wasn't just chatting with me. She liked the company she had at home which also convinced her, and it included her sister. When the girl and I were talking on Skype, she had to step away. Her little sister filled in for her. She and I shared pictures and decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend after just an hour of chatting.  She stayed on social media for as long as she could just to see if I would log on. I would go on just to talk to her. But, suddenly, she just vanished from social media. Her older sister said she had committed suicide herself. A knife through the stomach. Bled to death.  Despite telling my family all of this, I conveniently left out the part about writing a cipher and trying to reach her through a public message. Who the hell would believe that? I don't even believe she heard me anymore.  I was told all my life that people who commit suicide neither go to heaven nor hell. Somewhere different. A special limbo of unforgiving nothingness I guess. I wanted to say a proper goodbye.  I found a cipher online. If I encrypted a letter to her and posted it somewhere public, she would get the message as soon as someone could decipher it. The rules were simple. People had to see it publicly and I couldn't tell anyone is was a cipher, I couldn't tell anyone to decipher it, and I couldn't give anyone the solution. The last rule is I could only post it to one website and only once on that website.  I posted to reddit. Other sites were no good since I had no friends to see it, and they wouldn't care. And then they would know about my online relationship. The creepypasta subreddit was perfect. I would have someone decipher it and not think I was serious.  But I still wanted to see her. My poor logic clouded my better judgment. The foggy road led to one place for all suicides. All suicides lead to Rome? If I was dead, I was going to see her. That's how it worked in the way I thought about it. But I'm not brave enough to plunge a knife through my heart or jump off a building.  And now my memory of the cipher feels fuzzy. Everytime I think about it, I seem to remember it less, and it causes me to feel desperate to see her. Ill be in therapy for a while to get over this. This bottle inside me needed to be open.      That's what you get when you try to upscale from 240p to 5k.   Unless it was your unmarried virgin uncle.   Jigglypuff. They never took puff seriously until I started playing with her. Heck, I even have a few friends that still don't take her seriously and just think I'm showing off by winning with a "trash character". The more they practice, the more they get frustrated that they somehow cannot beat me even when I use what they think is a bad character.  It kind of helps that one of them is so predictable, I can always call when he's about to dash attack.   Hazy Flame Ghostrick Frogs   Why? to announce another fetch-quest filled free-world RPG?   All is fair in love and war. And this is a competition between those who are accepted to compete. And if you bring the best deck, are the best player, and played the best that day, then you haven't done anything unfair.  If you'd really like to make some of them feel better, just help them when they ask for it. Give advice, hand out some cards you don't want/need, and just get along with them all around.  If my locals was full of shit players, you'd bet I'd be doing this.   It's just regular headphones with a cheaply manufactured chip that runs sound through the equalizer. Headphones are hardware. Beats isn't.   Well, I knew quite a few of these. Pretty much the only one I didn't know what effect of Fire arrows on gossip stones.   They own beats. Which isn't a hardware technology. Beats is a proprietary equalizer setting. That's right, an equalizer setting. So, if you knew the settings it used, you could go into the equalizer of any music player and have it for free. But nobody will know because it's hidden away by dr dre.   They basically admitted to doing what we all thought Kinnect on Xbox one was going to do.   There used to be something like that implemented at /r/YGOSales. It was combined with the eBay thread. Suffice to say, the quick-trade feature was never taken advantage of. Would be doubtful that any more than you would want to take advantage of it on /r/YGOBinders.   Well, make it hard to get out, but easy to deal with. So let's say it was a level 5. This basically means most search cards will not be able to grab it. Not to mention it needs to be tribute summoned or special summoned by a different card's effect.  Now let's assume this card has to be balanced around the assumption that your opponent has no hand traps. What's the most born damage you see a burn player deal on the first hand. It's around 2000. But, if you assume this player will be abusing equip cards, you have to factor Mage power and United we stand which could potentially give this card about 1500 attack on the first turn on a good first hand. Or a lot more if you play lavals and rekindling. (On that note, don't make this a FIRE monster with 200 DEF.)  So if you take that 2000 and take away the 1500, I'd say it would have to have 500 or less attack.   I see way too many people make this mistake. If you're going to take the time to write a story or tell a story, make sure you don't give away any twists, especially the ending, in your title. You want to draw people in, not essentially tell them what's up so they can move on. You lose views and upvotes this way.  **Examples**  Title: I Live Along  The Twist: There's someone or something living with the author that he or she's afraid of.  Title: I Looked In The Mirror  The Twist: something involving a mirror world  Title: I Keep Getting Called  The Twist: The caller is someone he knows or knew from the afterlife or just someone torturing him for no good reason.  Title: This is a True Story  The Twist: It's not.  ---  What other poor examples have you seen of titles in creepypastas?   Good. They don't deserve that money with the way they do their fucked up business.   That design is wrong. Go look at the file used in game. There is no line there.   The extra white line over "project" shouldn't be there. Change it, and promise that we can get proceeds to PMDT, and I'll buy some.   ... So?   Stardust Dragon and Utopia as platinum rares. Woop woop.  And effect veiler as an extremely short-printed Ultimate Rare.  Vanity's emptiness extreme short-print rare.  High Preistess of Prophecy as a common.  Raigeki as a short-print common.  LOLOLOLOLOL   Okay, I had been trying to defend it saying that it's an easy way of getting videos monetized since it's almost impossible through Google unless you have documents proving it's your video.  But this is just leaps and bounds over that line from questionable to bullshit.   Last time I did on this subreddit, everyone accused me of being a dick to the community.   In Smash 4, that would have done 18%. Lol.   Throw them off a boat.   Mango entered a 3.5 PM tourney? Which tourney? I'd like to see that.   My girlfriend plays Zelda. Pretty damn good too. She spent hours just trying to get down her tricks in 3.02. And yet, she's the only one I don't see whining about her new tools.   Edgeguard better maybe.   A lot of people say it is bad for P:M because it supposedly nerfed everyone to the point that only the Melee top tiers are viable. I simply don't see it. When characters win and top multiple tournaments, there's two factors going into it. The first is how good the character actually is compared to the rest of the cast. The other is the high amount of representation that these "Melee top tiers" get just because the playstyle from Melee somewhat transfers over well. This would be true for Fox, C. Falcon... and nobody else. I can't think of another Melee top tier that I see dominating tournaments.  Think about it. Nobody really knew how good Mewtwo was in 3.02 until EmuKiller showed everyone how far Mewtwo's new design could be developed. Until then, Mewtwo was severely lacking in representation. Afterwards, Mewtwo flocked all over with Mewtwo making headway in many tournaments.  People love to cry out that the spacies and other top tiers are immune to nerfs. But if you, just for one example, f***ing read Fox's change log, his upsmash was severely reduced, likely leaving Pikachu to have the absolute best upsmash out of the Melee veterans.  But a whole lot of changes, not necessarily nerfs, were done to each character so that ONLY PEOPLE WITH IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE of the game would pull off combos above 3-4 hits. But guess what, the people who know their characters the most and in the most numbers just happen to be f***ing Melee top tiers. They already have an intimate knowledge of how their character can generally pull off combos while the rest of the cast has to play catch up with their combo game. In 3.02, there were a lot of changes to make sure that certain moves easily converted into other moves for semi-easy combos. Now, all of that work has basically been reversed along with universal standards that ended up nerfing every character.  This is the first patch where characters weren't developed in a vaccuum but all studied and tweaked until they all  met the project goal. And since that included nerfs, everyone just wants to fucking cry that Melee top tiers are good because they're immune to nerfs. But they're not immune to nerfs. They simply already fit inside a Melee environment by fitting every point of the project goal.  This isn't a game meant to make the Melee veterans suck. So forget it if that's what you're expecting (that goes for anyone). Project M 3.5 is a great patch. If you want to whine that you can no longer beat your friend who keeps playing that spacie, get the f*** over it. Get better. And to quote Isai, "Don't get hit."   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is Apple trying to be google? Does Apple want google's action?   Let's do it America. I'd totally put bacon on my money!   You mind posting screenshots showing the refund *and* that you told him that before he left the feedback?   It's be quite a bit for shipping. You cool with that?   Can you explain your behavior pretending you know nothing about feedback? Care to explain why we don't seem to have any request to verify your thread? You have 24 hours to respond.   Gasp, a brony that watches spongebob.   Wasn't this common for too long? Companies able to pay Adblock, and if Adblock sees that the ads don't harm or intrude on the experience in the website then Asblock would block those?  I thought this was already a thing.   I'm really trying to get rid of as much as possible at the same time.   Wait, so they have the best running back at 1 yard away. Wouldn't running it seem like the obvious choice? When it comes to trying to work around what your opponent is doing, would t passing it in seem like a clever idea?   I couldn't imagine every character getting this. It looks so gimmicky, and the game is already a crouch-cancelling war at low %. I do think Yoshi would be a great candidate for this, especially since it also adds air-parrying. I would love to see how that affects Yoshi as a character.   That sounds right up my ally.   And? The total value of this stuff comes out to ~$115, and I won't charge the WHOLE value of shipping. I never do.   Easy mode? I don't see you learning 40 matchups.   [Here's what's for sale](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)  Shipping would be charged AFTER I shipped and have a receipt showing how much it costs. You would only pay $80 up front. If you want, I can send 1 portion for $50, then the rest for $30 after, then we'll see how much shipping was after.  But, seriously, I need the money, and I don't need these cards anymore.   Wait, so you had to post this because you probably couldn't get to a computer. Yet, this is being documented and posted supposedly after you've had therapy sessions and police search through your room. You must have had access to a computer between then and now somehow. And you have a smartphone. Couldn't you have posted this with that?  Anyway, never minding the somewhat apparent logical error, I hope you figure out what's going on as safely as possible. Can you hire a private investigator?   Okay, let's get another point out of the way, because many users here don't seem to have a certain concept through their thick-ass skulls.  KONAMI PREFERS TO SLIM DOWN THEIR BANLIST, NOT MAKE IT BIGGER!!!  So if keeping one card banned (broken or not) allows us to keep 2 or more cards that are much more generic and less powerful completely off the banlist, KONAMI will do that.  Stratos being banned allows so many other cards to be at 3.  So combined with the fact that HEROs have enough search, your argument that "you can't summon him more than once" is shit, because you can summon him about as many ways as you can summon Deneb.  And Stratos has exceptionally high attack power for being so damn powerful in his effects.   If it turns out it's a text message, I would offer them an ultimatum. If they don't want to hand over their phone, they must read the last 15 messages in the conversation.  If they're receiving a call, they can put it to speaker phone so we can all hear what's too important to wait until after class, or they hand it over.  Yes, I would be the hugest dick as a teacher.   Because maybe some people don't like to be public or whore out for attention when they donate to charity.  	128
    All gnomes are double agents.   If you make something grand share the codepen url.   I've read git isn't really the best for [binary files](https://robinwinslow.co.uk/2013/06/11/dont-ever-commit-binary-files-to-git/). If you're looking for something more for backing up your work check out [extended version history](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/113) in dropbox. Other services like google drive might have something similar though I haven't looked.   If you're interested in animating read up on [SMIL](http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/smil-animation.html#animationNS-AnimationModel)   Here is some light reading for those sleepless nights http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/      I can see how it's misleading now thanks, I think I updated the article in a way that makes my intentions more clear.   A good place for me (and many designers) to start is by tinkering with the code that makes the stuff run. You can [play with the examples in the article on codepen](http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/OPpbbR) without making an account or spending time setting up a dev environment.    Yeah view it here: http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/OPpbbR  Ironically enough, the medium.com publishing platform doesn't support .svg files at this time (or embedding codepens), the animation at the top is actually a gif :)         What are your pros and cons with polymer so far? I've been anticipating playing with it.            The way I learned how to do it was by drawing curved shapes in a vector drawing program (sketch, illustrator etc) and exporting to SVG to take the code apart.   After that I began reading the w3 spec recencyeffect posted to learn all the hidden goodies.    It's for a section in a larger piece for a web based project. The entire piece will be [animated](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html) in code.  I never thought I would do pixel art in a vector program until recently, though I believe hexels is vector based but I haven't used it in a while.    I suppose I formed a bad habit early and never thought to do it any differently. I'm glad I finally took the time though :)   What is the most frustrating thing about working with IE8?   I have never had a reason to use more than one background image until now. I fear there are thousands of small things like this I'll never have a need to know.      Thanks my secret is proper hydration.   Thanks, I updated the markdown title.      Thanks for this, I may try something similar for a star twinkle animation and it's useful to have samples to reference.       $img-path: "../../img/";       body {       background: url(#{$img-path}astronaut-ryan.svg) no-repeat fixed 0 0;     }      Trade Dev time for whichever current hobby consumes the most of your time. If you play video games for a few hours everynight try spending that time on your portfolio during the week and "cheating" on the weekends when you can resume the hobby for a nice break.    You just blew my mind as well.      Wow, that's amazing. I have a lot of polishing left to do on my current animations apparently.   Maybe try making the gradient greyscale and then applying a lumosity blending mode to it http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/transparency-blending-modes.html#about_blending_modes   Think of it as the opportunity to do an art project in a week. Make a website advertising your favorite super hero's services.   I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you want advice on how to create more things for a portfolio? So you want critiques on what you've already done?   The [top is empty](http://imgur.com/uXCv6kZ) on safari in ios8  	36

 Thank you I'll have to do a bit if reading about it see if it's something I'd be interested in    I've thought about the army but I'm sure my girlfriend and parents would kill me before I joined hahaha but I am going to look into it, as an engineer in the army how long do you get deployed for if at all?    Thanks i'll have a look into some of your suggestions, also i'm in the UK so i don't think that codeacademy is much use to me here.      Basically i'm in a foundation year of an engineering course at the moment and i'm really, really struggling with all the maths and i'm dying to do some practical work and actually learn something, all this maths just seems like it's a waste of time and leading to nowhere, i feel like i'm probably going to fail this course, but the thing is i really enjoy the idea of engineering, fixing things particularly, is there a course out there that judges you based on practicals rather than maths tests?  I've thought about apprenticeships and gaining experience through work but i have no idea where to start, i'm young and have never had a job, but i really want this to work also i'm in the UK so if you can point me in the right direction on where to start looking that would be fantastic, i just feel all a bit lost at the moment.  Thank you in advance.   One more and it would be a dugtrio   This is just wrong man, why does that even exist, you have to be pretty messed up to make a subreddit like that...   Thank you i appreciate your advice, i think it's more her decision than mine but i'll be there for her either way, thanks this is making me feel alot better about how i can help her out and what she'll be going through.   Yeah i don't particularly like the fact that we have to do this but being young and still in university it would not be good for us or the child to be brought up in a situation where we have no time to look after it, and i will support her no matter her decision if she chooses to keep it, i will discuss it with her and if she still feels like she can't go through with it, i'll be there for her, and thank you for your out look and opinion it's nice to have another point of view :-)   Thank you, i'll remember that for next time.   Ah i didn't notice that i'll remember that for next time, and i've looked and don't think i can edit in a serious tag, lets just hope the people of reddit are respectful!   Thank you so much for sharing your experience, i'll show her this tomorrow and hopefully give her some peace of mind, i know it's going to be hard for her and i'm going to be there every step of the way with her, this is defenitly what we want we've spent alot of time thinking about it together, and yeah her family would go crazy if they knew about it and she doesn't need that extra stress, thank you again i'll show her this tomorrow (she doesn't use reddit) but she might PM you from my account if that's alright and again thank you so much!    Sorry it's my first time posting, not really sure how to add it?   Genghis the war monger can he kill it, Genghis the war monger yes he Khan!   His humps are now on his chest    It seems to me like it's just the bottom part from a broken bottle that's been shoved into his eye not an entire glass bottle. But who knows for sure?   Hahahahahahhahahaha why is this so funny   Drugs are bad kids.   That Mario jumping sound scared the shit out of me.   Reminds me of Koh theFaceStealer from Avatar (not the blue one)   Thanks I'll check them out :-)           	22

 And I'm just sitting here with a 16MB connection. Asshole.   So how is this fallout series?? Any good as the hype?? Never played any of them.   And it's about time too! I thought dragons were way bigger.   Why don't you call yourself a Glartist?   Seriously whats the point?? I really do not get it. The point of digital is not having to go to the shop. If I go to the shop I'll buy the disc since you know it actually gives you something to show for it.   You're paying for the internet anyway, a few free loaders won't magically make it more expensive. If so you're doing the internet wrong.   I have a bird that lives outside my house. Let's call him a "special bird". He chirps all fucking night long, as soon as the sun goes down this motherfucker opens his beak and does shut it until the sun comes back up.

As a guy I couldn't imagine the the victims reaching out to the bully. It's normally the other way round for us.   Wow what a dick, destroying the family from the inside. Bullying level 9000.

There's no clan though, unless you want to start one. We can call ourselves the crimson duo and stop all the bad guys in our neighbourhood. Although my neighbourhood and your neighbourhood are different neighbourhoods so one of us will have move. Unless we can convince our respected towns to change the names of the street our neighbourhoods are on to Crimson street. Then we can both fight crime in Crimson Street but none of us will have to move. but first lets have that cake...it's a crimson cake.    nbsp;  Hope that clears it up for you!    No! I will never feel bad for Roach. She is a **dick**. She has left me stranded countless amount of times. Fucking un-loyal lasagne filler.   Edit: Changed Roach's sex.   Aha!! Gotcha now. There was never any clan!! Now you **have** to come to my birthday party!!! **MUAHAHAHAHAAH** ...I'm a genius!   All we ask from you is your willingness to help the clan on their ultimate goal for a better tomorrow   ^^^^^and ^^^^^the ^^^^^soul ^^^^^of ^^^^^your ^^^^^first ^^^^^born ^^^^^child.   Come, join us. We have cake!!   My fair guess is that they have moved on to the Witcher 3. This game was awesome but it never felt like something you could play for months on end [IMO ofc].   My pleasure!

I just got a 0.something click thanks to your reminder. As soon as I clicked the link the clock was at 20 so I decided to unlock the button just in case. I love you man!

I'm going to have to replay this game ...there goes another few weeks of my life.   Shoot them with your crossbow. One hit kill underwater.   You're right it does only show the "hold" option but like you said it should be obvious seeing as they are the only two modes of transport in the game.   Amazing scene through out. I'm guessing everyone went all the way in this one and got dressed to call the lodge.   Really guys?? It says so on the bottom right of your screen whilst playing. I don't want to be a dick here but if that got past by you, you are going to have a hard time playing the game. Detail is key. Happy hunting!!   Original pic came from /u/gmaknz [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/386t2v/dammit_roach_look_at_the_camera/)      That's an actual character in the game. Vernon Roche. It's a bit weird the used the same name twice.   This side-quest is quite funny. My favourite part was waking him up. He gets up with that thousand yard stare and flips you the bird.   OP's mom when she rolled over.   ....fuck.   Love how you really committed to the whole Witcher thing. Had to zoom in to read that text.   Smart baby.   You misspelled boredom and frustration.      looks like it was struck by lightning.   First post I've seen about my home town on the front page and it's about inter-species "sexual assault". Nice.   I still have all three in my inventory in case of impromptu masquerade ball.   That's not what society says.   You know a good way to avoid microtransactions?    **STOP PLAYING THESE RETARDED MOBILE GAMES, THAT IS ALL THEY ARE FOR!**   The game was a well built game, incredible gun play, good visuals, nice classes and interesting weapons but the non-existent story was too much to just let it slide. They built this entire amazing universe from scratch and told us little to nothing about it.   Yrden is key! I wasn't too fond of it at the beginning and thought is was one of the more useless signs, boy was I wrong. Fought a Cyclops yesterday and Yarden was a life saver.   That's amazing work, Kudos!!   The Rock of....   Yup, still have this baby and the pirate ship somewhere in storage, good times!   However, both the Xbox One and Playstation 4 editions of the game are now behind the PC version of The Witcher 3, which is currently live with Update 1.04.   nbsp;  I hate when articles have no idea what they're writing about. Yes PC has had one more update than console has, but that's because there was a problem with the PC version that console versions didn't have.   I feel you man, I had to go to my [only child] cousins house to play with stuff like this.   Pandas, and good riddance. Free loading good for nothings.   How did he even manage to pee with a camera on him a friend standing right behind him and a stick up his butt?? I can't pee when there's someone in the same room!   www.southpark.cc.com works for me like it always has. Don't know what OP's talking about.   "GwG!?"... () ^^^Y^^^^a^^^^^y  ...*clicks*..()   I wasn't scared of snakes. Now I think I'm scared of snakes. Thanks.   I chose the other path, Baron dies and now I have the sidequest failed. Apparently you can still pick the cards up form somewhere. There's a post near the front about it.   I love reading posts like these after getting bombarded for being a console gamer xD   I'm here with you buddy!   I'm on level 17 at the moment and my next story quest is Skellige. I still haven't gone over though due to the fact that I want to finish all sidequests etc in Velen and Novigrad. My fear is that I'm going to end up way to high level for the actual story missions. Should I continue clearing Velen and Novigrad or should leave them for later and go to Skellige. What do you guys suggest?   Yea but you still end up failing that side quest, damn.   You're clearly doing something wrong. Where are you storing you controllers? Do you leave them facing up?   Doesn't matter if you're black or white.   Firstly, welcome back!! now onto the matter at hand.   Games: I don't know what type of games you like but I suggest Witcher 3 [obviously] and Dying light. With those two games you have a solid month of gaming ahead of you. Also Sunset Overdrive if you like the outlandish type of games. EA Access is also a really good idea to get, 20 a year and you have access to all the games in the vault (currently includes FIFA 15, NFL 15, NHL 15, NBA Live 15, BF4, Plants V Zombies and a few others) plus 10% discount on all EA digital purchases.   Accessories:Adapter for headset if your using a third party headset, plug and play kit **and** thumb grip for the analogues (I cannot stress enough how much better this makes the controller).   Happy gaming!   **MILF!!**. No but seriously keep up the good work, looking great!   Mental picture is now complete and what a glorious sight it is!!    Full blown bear man in a drunken crying rage in the middle of a probably very echoy train station, wailing like a Wookie "WHY GOD WHY!? TAKE ME INSTEAD!!! *sniff* *sniff* All in a matter of a few seconds.    My mornings been made, thanks!!   I believe the word you're searching for is **REKT!**   I know right, it's multiple choice for a reason.   ^N^^E^^^V^^^^E^^^^^R^^^^^^!   ^^RUN ^^YOU ^^FOOL!!! ^^^It's ^^^not ^^^safe ^^^here!! ^^^^Also ^^^^thanks, ^^^^I ^^^^agree ^^^^people ^^^^take ^^^^stuff ^^^^too ^^^^seriously ^^^^lately.    The title was enough warning for me.....or so I thought. FUCK.   Everyone has different heroes.   Just drop yourself really hard on your neck and you too could spend the next 4-5 years trying to walk again.   This kid shows promise, but lets not put all our eggs into one basket.   [deleted, because I'm a moron sometimes]   That's absolute gold, must have been amazing to witness as a bystander. Glad your adventure turned out ok :)   Wow. Getting downvoted because of a joke comment, lighten up assholes!!   nbsp;  Edit: Forgot to answer your question. No I have not read the books, but that has nothing to do with what I said. I'm not arguing the fact that Geralt is an established character with a lot of history. What I'm saying is the way I play with Geralt is different. Am I not allowed to play the way I wish to play? Because I'm pretty sure that this is the reason for the game being multiple choice with many different outcomes, so that the player can play the way he/she desires.   If the pay's good the hours are short and I can play a lot of games in between, sign me up!!   Evil and brilliant, [I like it a lot.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/28GLa9T2CtI/maxresdefault.jpg)   The best line I heard was yestarday,   nbsp;  NPC - " look at his eyes, his whore mother must've laid with a stray cat!"   ^Or ^something ^very ^close ^to ^this, ^^I ^^was ^^^high.   I then proceeded to chop his head off...Nobody calls my cat a stray.   Awesome thanks!   This just goes to prove though that the map needs a bit of tweaking. That's clearly a merchant symbol. Loving the game though!   If you could stop popping to the top of the page whilst I'm trying to view the video that would be greeeaaattt.   People do want them back. We've just been over this same topic too many times on all the posts about the upcoming Call.of.Titanfall/AW Ops 3.   Well yeah but the one's inside city's tend to pay more, I've got stuff multiple items worth 200 crowns (not that I bought for that amount but what it says in the stats) and blacksmiths in villages only offer from 50-80.   but that 100% thoughh!! I ended up doing it twice, both on 360 and one. You could say I have a bit of a problem. I'm glad though that this time around the nuclear waste wasn't needed for the 100%. Fuck me that took forever and with no sea life in the last gen it was the dullest hour of gaming I've had in my life, but then again 100%.   I do remember Hatorri saying some one was controlling all the base materials he needs for crafting armour. Perhaps I have to complete the sidequest and take this guy out before other blacksmiths show up. That's the only reason, apart from IGN maps being wrong, that I can think of. Still a few levels away from being able to even attempted that quest though.   These new mods are really getting out of hand.   He's not the only blacksmith in Novigrad that's the thing, there are others that I've used and they appear on this [map](http://www.ign.com/maps/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/velen-novigrad) but for some reason they do not appear on my map. Maybe my game has bugged out a bit?? Not sure what to think tbh.   Really?? well that sucks. He isn't even a blacksmith in my game yet he's still making dumplings.    There a dwarf and a wife willing to craft really good armour for you if you get the tools for them. Unfortunately I cannot remember where or if he was a master but a little Google search might help. Good luck.   Is Gwent really that good?? I just find it way to be a lot of time wasting. There's already enough to do in the game without having to worry about my card collection at the same time. It's just a bit too much for my liking.   FTFY: Well   Not the direction I was heading in buddy. Just saying my version of Geralt does things a bit differently to the "real" version.   We should all get together and make a company where we make money by browsing Reddit;   nbsp;  Step 1: get together   Step 2: Give company a kick ass name   Step 3: ???????   Step 4: All the pancakes we can eat aka profit.   Geralt really isn't the type of guy to just murder anything that's a monster.   My version of Geralt and you version of Geralt are veryyyy different.   nbsp;  Edit: To make it clear, I'm not arguing with the real history or Geralt. Thats just not how I play with him. My Geralt cuts the head off anything monster shaped (i.e All the downvoters moms).   Team Triss ftw! tricked that hoe bag into staying yesterday.   Seriously, we're already looking at the next game?? Come on guys enjoy what was just given to us before looking for your next fix you bunch of crack whores.   I don't know if it's just me but a lot of the stuff (i.e merchants, blacksmiths, barbers etc) just do not appear on the map. Only when I'm near them do they appear and as you can imagine it's not very helpful.   Is there a map I have to pick up to update mine or what am I missing?   My map looks too bare especially Novigrad the biggest city in the game has one blacksmith showing in the whole of it, which to top off, is Hattori who is unusable unless you do his sidequest at level 20 something.   I'm currently at one level over my story quest but thing is I have a tonne of sidequests etc to do before I move onto this main quest. I see myself having to up the difficulty because it's just gonna get to the point where im one hit killing nearly everything.   A chat?? I would get straight fired. Yesterday I spent the entirety of the day browsing Reddit. I think I may have a problem.   ..it does.   The only thing I hate about Novigrad is the blooming map. For me it doesn't show where any of the merchants, blacksmiths etc are, only when I get near them do they appear then disappear soon after. Apart from that 10/10.   All that comes to mind is, fucking cunts.  	111
 If its a technique problem make sure you are correctly using your arms in your approach. Also make sure you are bending your knees enough and riding the board up making sure you get enough height up. If all else fails, leg workouts like squats, lunges, etc. will help you with height.   Pick her or your friend because that's what it'll end up being.  	2
 Again there's no winning, there are dead children on both sides.  It is unforgivable regardless of who does it or why it is done.  The idea that one side is more at fault than the other after all these years only prolongs the conflict and increases the number of dead.  Grief isn't ameliorated because a tally of corpses can be tilted to one side or another - it is just unbearable, radicalising grief.   I'm sure of that.  Human nature, on the other hand, is fairly similar globally.  Killing kids creates angry, violent parents anywhere.   I'll be sounding like Mutley for the next few minutes then :(   Which is great, but it's also politically dependent.  Remove the political support from the US and how much investment would happen organically / naturally?  To have sustainable investment there needs to be sustainable peace.   That's just exactly what the UK government thought about the IRA - it was horrific in its consequences, e.g. the Manchester bombing.  There's no 'winning' just blood, guts, misery   grief.  Guerilla warfare doesn't care about military strength, it circumvents it.     A better negotiation position is never going to be a bad idea. Hamas' election wasn't going to be a welcome development but it was entirely predictable.  Hamas being elected is a revenge vote, not entirely unheard of in Israeli politics either - or anywhere else for that matter.  Furthering settlements will further the appeal of Hamas and their ilk.  Guerilla warfare is insidious and does not need a 'nation state' to support it.  If Hamas is to be stopped, then their supporters need to be given a better solution. Nobody voted for the IRA in NI, they voted for Sinn Fin - the political wing associated with the IRA but not the IRA. A debate still continues about how much hair-splitting that actually was but it was enough to keep the ball rolling to peace.  It's not a fast process, the 'Troubles' in NI were decades long.  Margaret Thatcher signing the Anglo-Irish agreement wasn't something her manifesto suggested when she came to power but it happened.  Yet afterwards was no picnic at all - there were still bombs and horrific violence. Nonetheless without it, there wouldn't have been grounds to find a more lasting solution.  It's a bunch of people who know the final jigsaw picture, but not sure of where the pieces they hold go. Yet they don't give up, because they want their grandchildren to have better lives.   And the Palestinian factions are going to think exactly the same, it will never end if that's the basis.   Children are precisely what fundamentalists are indoctrinating.  If they didn't care about children this problem would fade out over 3 generations.   Perhaps, but the NI take on Catholicism vs. Protestantism created divisions much fiercer than their common origins would suggest.  It may not be the best comparison, but it's not so wide of the mark either. Plus, religion was used as a proxy for territorial disputes which I reckon brings the comparison closer.    they were almost dead from lack of watering  Ah now Ted, Flowers   Fruits are thirsty business.     Nope   All of what you said is completely valid, and it's all happened before. If it was going to work it would have worked by now.  It's time to try something new, overdue really - nobody is feeling safer.  Hamas are lunatics, shooting stone-throwing kids at a border is also lunacy. There's no gain in any of these tactics on either side.  If the idea is that one side should 'win', both sides will lose something.  What international investors will decide on the region if they think their business will blow up or that they must pick one over the other while risking retaliation from the side they didn't pick.  It's not going to be remotely easy, but both sides vote for people to fix this not prolong it. The begrudgery won't end for years, but as the NI process has shown peace needs to come first - the pointing fingers can come later.  An Israel and a Palestine that can live together will be a much stronger force in the region than one that wants to destroy each other.   I think the only answer is negotiation.  It seemed intractable and pointless in NI, but endless grieving is much worse than making elected reps sit at the table for years if necessary.  Plus, the current solution in NI didn't involve border changes - but a real assessment of the damage caused to both sides by both sides.  The 'who is at fault' argument has lost its usefulness. Let the next generation be a bit less used, and a bit more educated.  Bit by bit progress, not blow by blow status quo.     For real and for once, won't somebody think of the children.  There is no future in the current path, only the past.  The stable peace in Northern Ireland isn't because everyone decided to like each other. They decided to stop letting their children pay for their parents (mostly)   So will reading this comment or its link get NSA-flagged?  Should I delete this because I want to see my friends in the US or should I just invite them over to me?  Not exactly a tough choice, is there an on-going discussion or data on what all this is doing to US tourism?  If I do have to go the US soon, I reckon I'll be going tech-nude.   Though judging from the photos I don't think I'll be bringing any of my 'trainees' with me.       The Court's new ruling also states that documents on international relations or negotiations should not be automatically exempted from being publicly available.  My inner cynic is quiet this week, there seems to be plenty of genuinely good news going around.   I like this new spelling.   roflcopter   The situation in relation to the Fine Gael, Patry [sic], Co Mayo, accounting unit is still with the garda, the report states.  I want to get the popcorn out.        Equally fair, they could have returned to the shore before ~~the joints ran out~~ it got dark.   This man is a menace to Irish society.  First he picks Greyhound for refuse collection against the advice of **all** Dublin City Councils. Greyhound have their registration in the Isle of Man with its more generous tax options, as well as a laundry list of court cases against them.  The Isle of Man is, coincidentally, also home to a number of pension and investment funds that specialise in Refuse   Recycling. Pension   Investment funds being more focused on end results (profits) than working conditions, living wages etc. for any company in their portfolios.  Surprise, surprise - here we are a little later with 30% payroll cuts being mooted for Greyhound employees who have now gone on strike as a result. Is Greyhound part of an investment portfolio? I don't know - but it sure looks like it.  Then Irish Water and its mystery charges which were meant to be detailed this week, after several other 'deadlines' have been missed. He infamously stated that he didn't know all the costs involved or why Irish water was spending so much money on consultants. Though simultaneously insisted that his department knew all the costs involved.  The free allowance for Children is also to be cut apparently, but we don't know those details either.  Let's not forget his commitment to reducing quangos and increasing transparency in county council spending - only to then shelve the report on it and, naturally, create a new quango instead.  The man is not remotely true to his word, his actions have had consequences that range from the frankly suspicious to the stunningly callous.  It also worth noting that in his declaration of interests to the Dil he has **no** assets, apart from a gifted membership of the K Club. No house in his name, no investments of any kind. Or in other words, someone who could be very easily persuaded by a tempting bribe (assuming the declaration to be honest).              supergreen   In Malahide, in **Dublin**   According to the BBC, [Murray's nationality](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BrjWHJ-CQAAZnvp.png:large) is result dependent.   Strawberry plants usually have a useful life of 2 to 3 years, planting the runners of the first and subsequent plants to keep your stock vital.  Though that doesn't appear to be the problem here, so I'm guessing it's either the soil or the amount of sun.  Are they in shade, or did you use peat compost? Both can give you bad results.   Cheers!  Giving that a go now, could be a little while before I report back with results.  EDIT: Confirmed, AyeCurumba's method works. I've the full game now.   Yeah the circumstances seem more 'Oh My Hairgel' than OMG   a team waded into the water to escort them to safety     I'm having the same problem with Strider in the EU store.  It's 14.99 in the PS+ section though the EU blog says it's part of this month's IGC.      Meath council doesn't have enough funding. We're near the bottom when population is considered.      I think charging Neary is about the only way the Quinn family are going to reduce their problems - so this one could get really interesting.        Well, project Morpheus will be great for games just like the Oculus Rift will but of course that's not the only thing VR can be good for.  Something like 'Second Life' with a VR interface seems like a logical next step and potentially a VR killer-app, but Sony are unlikely to get or ask for detailed Second Life data. The solution, they made their own.  Ok, Home was a bit more basic but it still had plenty of valid data points they could analyse: PSN ID data, movement through Home-space itself, spending habits if any, network congestions in a shared 3D world and even simple collision data (very handy to know for VR to avoid nausea).  Home got such derision and sneering it was hard to see why Sony kept at it, unless it provided useful data for some other purpose. My guess is that that purpose is shared with Project Morpheus.  Someone or some company is eventually going to make the first commercial   global 'baby Matrix' and I think Sony want to be in with the best chance they can.  I don't think Facebook bought Oculus just because they could - they want FB users to 'walk' via Facebook   Oculus through a global VR world.  I think Sony have been giving a 'baby Matrix' more thought and work than Facebook: e.g. PS Move, 3D in general and Morpheus itself.  That task would be much better with actual 3D world usage data. It just looked like Home so none of us really noticed.        Thankfully it did no damage to [Children's Shoes](http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1333-memorable-budgets/1338-budget-1982/).     I reckon Sony got some data useful to Project Morpheus from it. It's point otherwise ...  I don't think we'll see a reincarnation of Home till Morpheus is out.   Hasn't seemed to be a race for a couple of weeks.  I reckon he's wanted to leave for a few months or so, and the 'sooner than expected' line was more parting shot than expression of regret.    It's brilliant game and I hope it does well so 'Day of the Tentacle' gets a similar makeover.  /HoagieForPS4   I wonder how reddit would survive their 'vision', or rather lack thereof.      fascinating         Indeed, it does seem more deliberate than accidental.   Yeah. I'd assumed there was some EU preference not to go the electricity route as telecom companies would have lost massive amounts of business - and lobbied accordingly.  It reminds me of debate over the Hydrogen fuel-cell car or the Electric Battery car - both have their plus points. But one already has infrastructure in every house in the country, so I'm guessing we'll end up with the other, Hydrogen, because lobbying.  I reckon fuel companies don't want people charging batteries with solar panels and the like because there's no money in that for them.   My guess was as a business measure in favour of ISPs. If we'd gone the ESB line route - everyone could have had standard speed internet practically overnight.  Every plug socket potentially becoming a network port - brilliant.   Great! I'm going to be walking around the garden looking for more now. And not that I'd need an excuse to go to France but that will do.  Cheers!   Thanks! Now I know how to tell the difference between Dragonflies   Damselflies.     In Ireland, resting on an onion stem.      And [Bleachbit](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/) for a final clean.   They're all here :  http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/29b7jh/cat_trying_to_catch_a_qtip/          This reminds me of the time ["the road running along side the British Embassy compound in Tehran was renamed after the hunger striker Bobby Sands"](http://www.thejournal.ie/iran-ireland-relations-1980s-1241672-Dec2013/)      CDfm and RorytheFaggot, if we could meet in the Dil bar and have a few.   I am a wuss or does that seem like a bit too much green?   Now I'm wondering if your username and drug-usage are related     Make sure to pilot it on all your staff worldwide for a year then, including yourself Larry.   I think this says more about E3 than No Man's Sky.   Many AAA ~~games~~ publishers seem to follow Hollywood (teasers, trailers, reveals ... ) rather than capitalising on games' unique opportunities with a Hollywood flair.   The AAA scene is hamster-wheeling on pre/se-quels.   So I'm waiting till games reach the bargain-bin as there's no rush to play re-skinned games anyway. Though these days that means little against pre-order sales.  I hope No Man's Sky is great and maybe it becomes the 'Forbidden Planet' of sci-fi gaming.  Yet for every 'reveal' of any game I see - I think of one of the first reddit comments I read:  Actual Gameplay Video or GTFO   The Tuna is always mine.  The Hound and Baby Dinosaurs Die Tonight.   It's been shite even before the WC.  Just more noticeable now, I think they gave up on it a year ago.  It needs a back to the drawing-board revision, even the colour scheme manages to look ancient now.   Using my amateur insect sleuthing, I reckon they are 'springtails' which like damp:  http://www.rentokil.ie/pest-guides/insects-and-spiders/insects-in-damp-conditions/springtail/index.html   Get rid of the damp and they'll go elsewhere as they need moisture to survive, and hoovering them up seems to be the best starting point. They don't like thyme oil or clove oil either apparently.   Try /r/whatsthisbug   If the USA is the grand example of federalisation, then I'll pass.  Plus, I think it would be an even greater corruption magnet than the EU institutions we already have.   The move will severely curtail emergency response times  Considering they hardly bother in my town, the move will make no difference at all.   Well I never, can't wait to try out 7D      Looks like a 'jumping spider' - one from [this](http://www.calvin.utvinternet.com/cjwp/writing/published/zebraspider.html) family I reckon.      portscans aren't choosy   Yeah, corked it a bit really.   Does the report on a minister's failure of duty not make this one a little special?   Wouldn't be the first wonder:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Curtin    I think many will stay too, and there has to be pan-EU agreement.  It would be great to see the educational advantage of a base in Ireland re-asserted above the clearly targeted loopholes.   It's no wonder the Quinns are challenging everything when the bar is this low.   True, but there's no need to make the front door-bell that easy to push.      Still covered, the Department of Finance can disappear any type of document you need.    Again, not a deal breaker (for example, TDs aren't constrained by the new Leinster House web-surfing rules)   the move will have to be signed off at the next Council session and countries will have until the end of next year to enshrine it in national law.  So if the prevailing view that we need to allow these loopholes for jobs is correct, then by the end of 2015 a lot of multinationals will start leaving and less will arrive.      There's buckets of precedent for that in Dil ireann - don't let it put you off.  You could be the new Stephen Donnelly, or he could be the old You.   Never stopped Cowen   I just heard it, I think it's great - though 'cynical noodle bunny' sounds better.   The narrative that Ireland presents internationally is that of the cute survivor of British colonisation. The reality is that the abused turned abuser a long time ago. Dissent is not welcome.  I wish that weren't true, but it's sadly so.   Or when it can out-spec an Odroid which is slightly cheaper   oh, Cake!    CD, you sucked them all up :)  Cheers!

It was too late after the first rub.   I got out of a fine because of this type of messing.  Got 80 fine, went to local Garda station told "you can't pay that here, go to the Post Office".  I went to the Post Office, and it wouldn't scan in - the barcode fading more each time a scan was attempted. Then the number was typed in manually, but the system glitched as it had partially processed one of the supposedly failed scans.  Nothing more to do in the Post Office, I went back to the Garda and explained and they said a new fixed fine notice would be sent out.  Then a new notice to say the fine had gone up because I hadn't paid the first one. I called to explain what had happened and yes a new notice would be sent.  Never happened.  The Garda I talked to didn't give a shit.   Just for visitors though, TDs are still on a behave-yourself basis.  That's worked so well before etc. etc.      Is it true that if the EU investigation into Apple's tax deals goes against Apple that the 'missing' tax has to given back to the Exchequer?  Sounds like there would be more than 2bn there.  Is that the background to all this? That there will be no help from the EU until corporate tax avoidance is changed?   The court case will be an eye-opener that's for sure, I can't imagine they have a hope. They went from a 5% share in Anglo to a 28% share over 3 years.  Plus the 'regulator' hated them enough to actually do his job and give the Quinn group a record 3.25 million fine for insurance shenanigans.

 That's true, although it is suggested that  bloodtypes omit certain markers which a mosquito can detect:  Blood-type markers are chemicals released by people of a specific blood type  so if someone with AB blood emitted a marker, it would be different than that released by B. One study found persons with Type O blood suffered more mosquito landings because of the odorant markers they emit than any other blood type, making their juices a hot commodity for blood banks, as well as Asian Tiger Mosquitoes, which carry West Nile Virus. Not only were Type Os more likely to be landed on, but the study found that for any blood type, people who secreted a chemical marker about their blood type through their skin (both blood type and secretor status are determined by genes) were bitten much more than non-secretors; 24 percent in the case of the Type Os. Other researchers estimate about 15 percent of the population, based on their genes, dont emit chemical markers of their blood type through their skin and saliva, so something else has to be calling the mosquitoes to them. http://scienceline.org/2007/09/ask-knight-mosquitoes/    The bowl should probably be heated to body temperature, to mimic the warmth of the human body.

 "Now that's what I call a sticky situation!"   Called it. Hit the Bricks. The whole "Me first" mentality was the opposite of *Playing like a Brown*. He has been consistently negative and he can get glad in the same pants he got mad in.  He can just do it somewhere else.   I didn't have a red one, all I could afford was a BIIIIG yellow one.   Nice try, *Johnny*.   Let's look at someone comparable to Gordon: Megatron. They have this figured out with Megatron:  *"If you were watching ESPN Sport Science last October, you saw what a freak of nature Calvin Johnson actually is. Between his 6'5" height and his 6'10" wingspan, he has an 8'8" standing reach. Add in a 45" vertical jump and you've got a guy that can cover over 4,000 cubic feet, all from a standing position. Add it up: Calvin covers an incredible area, more than an average two-car garage."*  Well Gordon is 3 inches shorter with a 36" jump and a 6'8" wingspan. I would put that somewhere closer to 3500 cubic feet total access to teh ball when thrown to him. He totally will have more chances to catch the ball than the 5'10" receiver corps.   ALGEBRAIC!  And Hoyer fucking rules. Today included. *Snoogins*   What's up with Johnny's scary little hand?   For the sake of argument would you say, perhaps, Browns?   Either way would be good.   Where did you find that picture?   I trust Farmer. Dumpeda-bump-bump-buM-bUM-BUM.   They have all the Twitter accounts of the teammates, reporters, and coaches that represent the Texans. That's a cool resource, especially for people new to the fan-base.   We might start getting to draft for depth and development......*mind blown*   Browns fan,  here. O'Brien is 6-2 in weather under 40 *EDIT: O'Brien just had to be different with his name spelling. Fixed*   Just ordered me a Haden Jersey. Also got a Cribbs jersey a few weeks ago, and my first jersey was a gift from a friend. A retooled Hillis jersey that my boy stenciled my last name on. He even made the stencil in the exact font of the Browns Font. Where are you buying it from?   Brown face mask is cool. Grey uniforms is so ugly.....so, so, ugly.  *EDIT: It's official color designation is "Seal Brown"?*     Please Gods, No. Please dont make our Uni's grey.    I think this is the most likely scenario.    Respectfully,  why is it so bad?    I'm so glad to read this! I have been saying the same thing for a while. WE are America's Team. There are so many people that don't like the Cowboys that calling them America's Team is completely inaccurate. Everyone in football is happier when the Browns do well.THAT should be the hallmark that garners such a nickname.    Boobs for Browns is an r/Browns institution. We should never talk bad about it, and we should promote it during every NFL subreddit members drive from here until forever.   Mike Freeman is an asshat. He hasnt been saying any of those things all season. I even got in a fight with him on twitter this summer about how damaging his type of journalism can be to the mentality of a team that is struggling. *rant over*   Frakkin' brilliant. Thank you SO MUCH!   I used to live in Atlanta. It's like going to the Panthers sub and finding out they are rooting for the Ravens to win.    It was a sketch that had a machine that made you smart. Someone goes into it and they reverse it to make the person stupid, and they come out as a Steelers fan. I have looked for 3 years and cant find it. This is the only place I can think that might be able to do so.   I was just commenting about how much nicer our header is than the Steelers, Bengals, and Ravens.    Holy shit, I know the redhead kneeling down in front of the dude in the purple shirt. I went to Highschool with her. I bet she knocks the fire out of people.   Yeah. I have always considered the Bengals to be like playing our brothers. Sometimes we hate each other, and sometimes we have mad respect, but at the end of the day I never throw your name in when I say Fuck the Steelers and Fuck the Ravens. One more time to go, boys!    1st place at game 10?!??!?!?! **WE DEY!!**   **MOTHERFUCKING N**    Wow. Browns are in there a bunch.       If you have a Hoyerection lasting more than 4 games, please enjoy it.    The completion to Hawkins that he made as he was getting destroyed by the Bucs D? That was outstanding.    That puts his total to 4 on the year in 8 appearances.    Lou Groza and Phil Dawson. The Toe, and The Other Toe. He is the second highest scorer in CLE history. The Automatic. *EDIT: Content*   Give that man a Dog Bone for his collar!   Today at 6pm Pacific Time, Pierre Claveloux Pete Pathfinder Davis was taken across the veil. He was surrounded by loved ones, and went peacefully in his bed. Today, on our most holy day, when the barrier between the Worlds was at its thinnest, and on the 35th anniversary of the founding of his lifes work, The Aquarian Tabernacle Church; our Grandmother Hekate, Patron Goddess of our Order came across and brought home with her one of her most devoted sons. Founder of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, Panegyria Magazine, Spiral Scouts, The Pagan Information Network, and Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary, Petes contribution to Wicca, and Pagan rights can never be overstated. From prison ministries, to Veterans rights, and his ability to standardize our faith through the Government, Petes legacy, and the freedoms enjoyed from his actions will be felt throughout the duration of Wicca on Earth.  Pete Pathfinder: Born on Ostara, 1937. Crossed into the Summerlands on Samhain, 2014.  Please hold your phone calls until Nov. 2nd and give the family and church time to grieve. If you would like to post your condolences for the time being, please go to: [The ATC Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ATCIntl)    At least someone really gets what it means to have to rely on Brandon Weedon.   I agree with "/u/tits" in the messages.   CC all day. Was totally safe.   Sorry! I used [Top Seller Jersey](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1066076)   http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0 initiative_id= SearchText=cleveland+browns+jersey   I totally wear an XXL. I have a 38in waist, and really broad shoulders,  and weigh in at 225lbs. Mine fits really well.  Not too big,  not too small. Goldilocks.    http://www.aliexpress.com/   I upset some folks by posting something from my twitter account earlier, about Joe Haden being my favorite #23 over Lebron. (which made some people get really upset. said it messed with the integrity of the sub to post from personal twitter accounts) Then they assured me the downvoting would end when I removed the post (which is a little like a reddit gestapo) that it was only because of the twitter association. So now I post this, and the downvoting continues. Browns fans use the down vote as a punishment, as well as an opinion. *shrug* It's okay. I'm stoked for my new jersey and I love the Browns :) *EDIT: As proven by the the post below about not wanting knock off jersey posts, even though every other post about people getting Browns gear at a good deal has been uproaringly upvoted*    Growing up in Kent, all the crime that came into town was from Akron. Yes, its a depressed and yucky place. I have lived in Atlanta (which is far more dangerous) and Seattle (way higher homeless population) and I do have a bruised opinion of Akron. It does not sway my opinion about LeBron, but this article on this Family Foundation is.   No, I do know what I'm talking about. "His mere presence is estimated to be worth $500 million a year" That's not for schools. That's private sector earnings. Some taxes might make it to the schools, but that's not the same.  I did find something about the Lebron Family Foundation that I will read up on. Thank you for making me dig deeper. I dont want to dislike him. I just havent seen anything that makes me feel differently. Maybe this will.    It's not his fault that they had them. He was 15. It's the responsibility of us all to make it easier for those coming up behind us. You say he does a ton for Akron. Tell me so I can change my opinion.    Everything is awesome. It is a little old, and there is some yellowing on the edges of the lettering, but it's a 2012. Every other thing about it is great. My only complaint is that Washington has some rule about not letting money be put into escrow when ordering from overseas, and so I had to get it mailed to Georgia, and then have them send it to me in WA. Totally buying a Haden jersey next.      Shitlord. Nice.    Your entitlement about policing the websites allowed to be x/posted from is killing me.   We should downvote the content, not the site. People use the downvote in this sub as a weapon. We just got in trouble for going to other subs and using the downvote as a weapon. So, I wont post any more from my twitter. I also wont agree with the outlook.   I'm not stunned.    It was all local media reports. St Vincent was not the school he was in district for. He got a scholarship to attend. And the school he was supposed to attend had an expose done on them where they found they were still using text books from the 50's and they showed these holes in the ceilings of the class rooms with black mold in them. Akron is a cesspool. I can understand him wanting to never help out the scummiest town I have ever been in, I just think it's wrong of him. He's part of that scum, even if he did float to the top. Kent for Life. *EDIT: Sorry I dont remember the exact reports from 15 years ago.*   Really? Because every post about Hoyers lack of skill reads JUST LIKE THAT to me. So weird.    I repeat from my "twitter post": There is no rule about posting from your twitter, facebook, tumblr, or anything else. Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct.    I never link to my twitter. Maybe twice in the history of being on reddit. I use twitter to talk to famous people who have twitter, because I can link my post right into their feed. I wanted to show that I had told both LeBron and Haden my feelings. There is no rule about posting from your twitter, facebook, tumblr, or anything else. Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct.   If that's how you want to hear what I said, then bully on you.     Also that /u/rsipp512 would rather hear about all the topics we cover day in and day out, than to hear anything new or an opinion that might be from a fans personal media. Unless it's his perspective, and his media, I'm sure. Himz an enforcer. So I am complying and posting the same thing. Just like everyone else all over the web. Hoyer v Manziel conjecture. 24/7    This is the problem. Browns fans refusing to hear what is right in front of them. Obviously we need way more posts about this to help you understand.   I disliked him before he went pro. I am from Kent, OH. I watched LeBron grow up on my local television networks. I constantly heard the reports about him getting Escalades paid for by the school he was being scholarshipped into, while the school he left was using books from the 1950's and kids were being removed with black mold sickness. I've never heard article one about him putting his money back into those school districts. Maybe if he used his money to help the people that he left behind, then I would have a change of heart. Coming back to CLE and promising a championship is like going to the sun and promising cotton candy. It's no given that it is going to happen. He stepped all over the people that manicured him and removed him from poverty, and now he is back, and It's all chill? I just need more from him. I need him to use his leg up to create a new standard for the kids coming from the same place he did. If he has done that, and I missed it, (I do live in Washington now) I am all about changing my tune. I just think he's kind of a selfish brat.   This is a reddit for all things Browns. My opinion about Haden falls under that category. I'll try to post about Hoyer conjecture in the future to keep things normal.   Lol.   I do not like LeBron. Hadens the only 23 for me.   Yeah! Downvotes for Joe Haden!    A typical overdose from cocaine: There is a membrane between your nasal cavity and your brain. This bit of flesh keeps your brain fluids in your head. Eventually,  its different for everybody, cocaine will eat through that lining, all the goo from your brain will fall out of your nose, and you'll die. You know in the movies where someone does a line and their nose starts bleeding uncontrollably and they die? That's pretty close.   Haden. Nice. upvote for you, sir.   You, **FIEND!!!!** *NOOOOOOOOoooooooooooOOOoooo!!!!* I'm upvoting you on principal.    I have called "Moving the Chains" on SiriusXM and told them this idea. They pretty much blew me off, but I still think that it's a good idea. I think bringing in as many of the old Browns players that want to mentor and work with the team as possible is a goodt idea. I realize some people cant teach, or coach, and that it is a totally different skill set than being a player. I also think it will bring the energy of "Play Life a Brown" further into fruition when these young players begin finding some new favorite players in the Browns of Old. Wanting to prove yourself in front of people you respect is a great motivator. *EDIT: And Thank You*   I dont know about your downvotes. I do know that it's equally important to consider WHEN you say something, as WHY you say something. That being said, McCoy  Weeden. You are correct. Upvote for you.   Considering two of those TD's involved GREAT hands, I'm glad to know all of our receivers are that clutch.   I would be all over Cribbs as an Assistant Special Teams Coach   I can get behind that, mostly.  I don't see him as a game manager, *EDIT: I think he's an outright good QB*,  but I think a sample size of a whole season will tell us a lot.    At what point does it become a well educated following?   Yes. This. This rings with all the truth. I feel like a grok it now. Thank you. *EDIT: Gold for you, sir. This has plagued me for too long*   I understand it has something to do with the long rebuild of the Browns, but where did it start and what are the details around it. I want to understand.   McCoy  Weeden   McCoy is SO MUCH better than Weeden.   *"The Cleveland Browns beat the lowly Oakland Raiders to move to 4-3, which in itself is a massive accomplishment.*  *That's not meant to crap on the Browns, but the coaching staff in Cleveland is doing an amazing job coaching up the talent on the roster. Brian Hoyer at quarterback, no Alex Mack, a rotating backfield, no Josh Gordon and yet they're competitive in a loaded AFC North. Let's get Mike Pettine and Kyle Shanahan on some Coach/Assistant Coach of the Year ballots.*  *The rest of the season won't be easy, given the schedule and talent issues, but I'm past betting against this team. ***The Browns are one of the NFL's grittiest teams***, and winning ugly, cold, muddy football games in November and December seems very realistic."*      Nice try, Johnny.   **A**   Im not acting like you hurt my feelings. Im pointing out that you are agressive. I reallynliked Colt McCoy, and if you looked at my messages from the game the other night, my friend was keeping me up to date on the game, because hes one of my favorite Browns QBs. No need to be grumpy.   I never minimized his health. Your anger is pushing you to make assumptions. I said his dad was the nail in the coffin. You are arguing that Colts injury is what made us cut him, and THAT seems highly unlikely that a concussion will cause a team to let you go. A raging parent that you wouldn't have to deal with had the person not been on your team? That makes sense. Oh, and [this from 2012.](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/05/03/report-brad-mccoys-comments-sealed-colts-fate-in-cleveland/) Blessings on you and Go Browns!   I'm sorry. It seems like you dont want to have a civil discussion. I am sorry that this is how people have treated you, and that you feel that it is okay to be so aggressive when you perceive that people are wrong. Is this how they treated you when you made a mistake as a child? I can imagine. Parents and adults can be really cruel. Lots of people have played through a concussion, and plenty of peoples parents havent come into the locker room like it was a Texas High School and yelled at the coaches. We have lawyers for that sort of thing in the pros. Again, I'm sorry for your need to be so mean, and Go Browns!   I saw him get knocked out, and then his dad came in and yelled at the staff about taking care of his boy, and then Colt stayed Benched, and then we traded him. I am all about learning more if there is more.   Awesome. I'm not wholly sold on the debunking, but I'm not wholly sold on the validation of existence, either. I havent had a chance to study about it because, obviously, I had the wrong name. Thank you!   She has food allergies and the kitchen has never taken them into consideration like I did, before. For 20 years she spent hundreds of dollars for a weekend and couldnt eat the food she had paid for.   Blew my mind.   I think Colt McCoy's daddy ruined his career in Cleveland.   OH! I see what you mean. I said I braised them with salt and pepper. Yes, I SEARED them with salt and pepper, then mirapoix, then braised them in Wine and Apple Juice. Thank you for pointing that out to me.    I was instructed to sear it in the pan, make a maripoix, and then re-add the meat and fill just about halfway up with liquid (wine and apple juice for this one), and then bake. Sorry if I was unclear!   On the entire weekend, for 120 people, I spent right around $2k, which was $2.5k less than the previous year.    RODS!! Yes. Thank you.     Everyone can celebrate with me! We had a blast and it was in part because of this wonderful sub! Thank you all, and Karma for all the wonderful encouragement!    Okay, First off I will disappoint everyone, but hopefully I will make up for it with the story. I didn't get pictures. I was so busy this weekend that I got 10 hours of sleep from Thursday to Sunday, and 5 of them came from Saturday to Sunday. I have [this picture](http://imgur.com/8GIvVbZ) that I took. It shows the concept, but I tried to upload it before the event, and my phone wouldn't let me. My menu was really simple. I'll tell you the entire production for the final nights feast.   We had what I named Harvest Feast Pork (not very original, but it went with the theme)  I took my trimmed, 2-3 inch cubed pieces of pork leg, and braised them with salt an pepper. Then I added used olive oil, and garlic instead of onion in my mirapoix (so celery, carrot, and garlic). To deglaze I used white wine (chardonnay) and apple juice. I then added a rosemary/parsley bouquet garni. I put it in at 350 for 4 hours. When the meat came out, I used corn starch as a thickener.  Earlier in the day, my morning crew had peeled, cored, and sliced into quarters, 5 bags of apples and pears. I then panned them, covered them in cinnamon, and made a slurry of apple juice, water, cinnamon, and sugar. I poured that over the top and set to cook it for 2 1/2 hours at 350. I also learned how to use convection ovens this weekend (that was cool) and I made near to 90 squash that we served in quarters. I had also made a "Hobbit Stew" earlier and put up in the freezer for the feast. It was a homemade Veggie stock (carrots, celery, leek, garlic, ginger, rosemary, thyme, parsley) and then I used it as the base for turnips, parsnips, rutabagas, yellow/purple/red potatoes, sweet potatoes, purple yams, and Asian yams which I served a ladle of to everyone. Then corn on the cob cooked in water with a little sugar and apple juice, as well as pretzel rolls were the sides. It was an amazing feast. We had pumpkin pie (store bought) to accompany everything and southern style sweet tea to beat the band.   We had 2 other dinners that were made in the same exact way except they were beef, and the bouquet garni was rosemary, and then thyme on the second one.  It was wonderful and I could never have done it without you. I will scour the pictures coming out from the event and see if anyone took pictures of their food. Since that is all instagram seems to be used for, I am hoping it is inevitable that I can find some. Thank you again and I am a life long follower of /r/cooking from here on out!     Yeah. My main goal is to find the video.   So you have the video?    Thank you for  all your help with my dilema. (huge chunks of meat needing to be cooked for many people) Someone literally cried because they had never had such good food in the 20 years they had been attending the event. Thank you /r/cooking, you rock.   They were called "Tubes" in the video, and they were caught on a Nat Geo documentary (I think) about base jumping into a giant hole in a jungle somewhere. They were caught on the video, but were unseen by the divers. Anyone?   I'm an everyday, off the internet witch, who does very little in the actual pagan community. I'm just out of my element, here. Sorry guys.    I just called to get Cable set up in my business, and the lady I talked to was a in Cleveland, so I of course said "Go Browns!" and she said "Hell yeah 'Go Browns'!". After an hour long call that was 40 minutes of Browns fandom, she gave me an extra 10$ off my package! "You're a Browns fan, so I'm going to do what I can to help you out". The world she is a-changin'. :)   Most pit bull breeds are smaller than a golden retriever.  None are big enough to be what you're describing.    AND you called me a twat. What is that? LOL. We call folks derogatory names in this sub? Or is that just how you roll? Is that how you "engage" folks?    You did exactly that, earlier. You crossed your arms, stuck out your tonge, and told me I had "unmitigated hubris". I'm not talking to the mods, I am talking to the person who doesnt know me who told me to take it to /r/nativeamericanspiritualists when they arent even PAGAN! I'm not gonna drop my d ^k on the table and tell you my lineage or my degrees, but I has 'em, Jack. I'm wondering why you are here? Why are you preying on /r/pagans? Do you have a lot of friends here? You get a lot of upvotes for telling pagans they should shoot, or run over Coyotes that they see?    /r/heathen says what? Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a peach. Seriously, though. Why are you here? To tell Pagans they are stupid? I'm totally engaging you now. I'm engaging you on the fact that you are a square hanging out with circles and yelling about our number of degrees. LOL   Wait a minute....You're a Heathen?!?!?! LOLOLOL You're whole argument is invalid. I thought some pagan was being a jerk to me and being an antagonist, now I see it's nothing more than a heathen, acting normal. /r/heathen kick you out? You dont understand us. I totally get it now. You are excused for your ignorance, but I do wonder why you're monopolizing /r/pagan? Seriously, did /r/heathens kick you out? Happy Samhain, sir. LOL    You're an antagonist.    The fact that I was raised Native American Spiritualist is enough for me. You win, though. This subreddit is not for me.   I find your lack of faith and your trash talk arrogant and off-putting. It's a bad look for r/pagans to take a post from someone who is like "I dont know if I'm pagan, but this was the only place I felt safe to share my magical experience" and then tell them not everything is magic, and it's probably a rabid coyote and not anything worth anything.     I think maybe you meant to be in r/skeptics. This is r/pagan. *EDIT: Also, Everything IS remarkable and significant. Life just rolls like that. MORE EDIT: It's important to live an examined life where you realize that the world creates itself in your image, everyday. I once read a great sentence: "Religion isn't just what you think about things, it's what you do about things, and how you do it". This is what it means to understand your spiritual path, and to understand that the universe is creating itself for you every moment.*     This was the correct place to post. Goddess speaks to us through her messengers. It takes living a deliberate life,  actively believing in the magic around you, to hear the messages of the divine.  Coyote is totally on the payroll and carries a strong message when you cross paths.    It plays on the fact that they are part of the Dawg Pound, and it plays on the idea of the "Ground and Pound" in MMA fighting. They just pound the hell out of everyone with their Ground game. And thank you :)   The Ground Pound   I personally was taught that every time you see an animal in such a manner, that it is deliberate. Maybe you need to focus on someone trying to trick you, or maybe Coyote is telling you to learn how to take a joke, or to be aware of your surroundings? It could also be telling you that you need to sing with those that are of your same kind. It DID lead you here. Just sayin'.   	116
 Just a rumor I guess.            and indiegogo?      I am not talking about validity here, just saying stats.   well, apparently only 53% of the voters think this way.   I think they would never win a major.      Do you have any stats on these QR codes? E.g. CTR, conversions, etc?   QR code is gone. It's hard to build a business out of it.                           what does that mean?                               A name of a character from a different video game.  that's interesting, never thought people would name characters this way.   what do you mean another video game? like use the name of another game to name your character?   I always use my online name.                           honestly, when you hear "every", it's usually false. I learned this from taking SAT/GRE exams.      Chessexplained recently made a comment in his video that he thinks chess960 will become more popular at the top level. I wonder how many people agree/disagree with him.      Yeah, these B2B/SaaS/Enterprise firms typically have good revenue that would support their valuations. But then again, Github does have a bit of a social flavour in it, so not sure if that has something to do with the 2B valuation.                        VdV was, at some point, a really talented player. But he is just another example of why talent alone doesn't do anything.   Agreed. Season 5 was better.   I think it's a great season. What do you all think?      If you subscribe to a database like PitchBook or CBInsights, you may find something.                           Ahh, didn't read this before.  	67

 a good fitness regimen came to me more through trial and error rather than a prescribed routine. I would have made sure to stay fed, hydrated, and incorporate more cardio. cannot emphasize enough how much that combination has worked   I get red wine headaches from cheap reds, and sometimes good malbecs and a few others. I believe that these are Red Wine Headaches and not specifically the same type of headache as my migraines because they happen regardless of how I prepare for drinking. Seems safe to assume that people who suffer from migraines would be more susceptible to RWHs.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wine_headache  For me, overly processed alcohol like cheap beer and cheap spirits are worse culprits, but I believe it's the alcohol itself rather than the other ingredients  	2
                                        I've written over 100 grant applications.  I used to call them term papers with a budget.  I don't know about Canada however.  Most agencies have their own guidelines and format that you can follow.  My experience is not recent, however, so I'm not sure where the RFPs (request for proposals) are posted these days.  Contact the agency that might cover the area you are interested in developing.  Ask them!   What's new?   Good comment.    I believe these businesses were paying higher wages when Clinton was President because there was not enough supply of low-wage workers.      She works for me.   It would be 50 years or more before another bill would be done.  Dems have been trying to do this since Roosevelt.   They have to do SOMETHING.  They don't know how to govern, but they need to fill the schedule.         What is it with these folks?  They are crazy, unprincipaled.         Democrats don't hate Obama.   They actually like him but are disappointed that he hasn't taken on the system more.         That's how it was then too.  Only Woodward and Bernstein were reporting on it, and even then, news was thin prior to the 72 election.  It only started coming out AFTER he was reelected.   Seriously, I have wondered about that for years.   I threw up in someone's car once.   I wanted to apologize the next day, but couldn't remember who was there.  Never found out, and no one every mentioned it to me.   I was watching c-span and was shocked to hear him quote something he must have heard from Fox News - and it was wrong!  If you are not going to use the constitution, at least use facts!   I knew someone who used to do it, and got a new car every year.  She was very methodical and followed up regularly with her clients.   It means its time to tax the rich.    I agree!      I didn't look at the article but worked as a employment counselor in a poor neighbors before. Only jobs at that time were mom and pop businesses, poor transportation, and the cost of bus fares and time it takes to getting anywhere.  I used to ask people their priority - close to home or higher hourly pay. Most preferred closer to home due to time.   I picked one up once decades ago.  He was carrying a large paper sack.  When he got out of the car, he reached in the bag and gave me a plastic baggie filled with grass.  I don't give strangers rides anymore, but it was a great memory.    I was taught in kinergarden to look both wars before I walk. People don't do that anymore. They feel like they own the road. It is scary nonetheless for everyone.   My grandfather worked for Great Northern Railroad for 50 years. And yikes, I was born in Seattle a year after this photo was taken...   This happened in Nevada too.  They didn't press charges against the company or the  employees.         We fought a war over state's rights too, and won. I keep hearing about state's rights. I'm cheating though. Didn't read the article.         So gross.   Let the public pay the salaries of employees?   I realized it, but it was too late to edit... I'm embarassed also.  Nothing worse than getting someone's name wrong.      Also, I remember the dirty look he gave Nancy Pelosi - Don't remember now if it was for illegal activities of GWB or the war, but it was searing, and I think caused her to change her answer.   If you don't have insurance, try health centers of Nevada. Located at Cambridge Comm Center. I haven't been there, but started a similar clinic years ago.   It is nonprofit, fed subsidized. They will accept insurance however. Very close to unlv.      Looks better than the door that I use as a top.   It is past time that we admit it:  The government subsidizes wages of large corporations through SNAP, medicaid and other forms of services.  We say it is for the poor, but it corporations paid a decent wage, then these services wouldn't be needed.         I would probably take the round the world cruise that takes a year or so and stops if every major port.   Don't you love how these legislatures care for their own people. Sounds like a voter registration opportunity to me.      Yes. I'm now 64 yrs old. Even though I have been married for over 40 yrs, I never had a friend with similar interests, including my spouse. Would like to plan, design and work on projects that could be fun and meaningful.  I have ideas at different times, but everyone is just busy doing their own thing and isn't interested.       I saw it a few years ago on tv.  Interesting.   I agree with that!      Now, if all these folks would register and ensure to vote.....   Actually, if they had recounted, Gore would have won Florida.  The Supreme Court stopped the vote.  Gore also had more votes nationwide, but lost due to delegate count (excluding Florida).    A can of tuna, a can of mushroom soup and cooked noodles topped with shreaded cheese and baked.   I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood by Eric Burton I believe, or maybe Still haven't found what I'm looking for by Bono.               My city had two bond issues one year on the ballot, one for schools and one for prisons.  I was shocked when the prison bond went through but schools failed. How short-sighted and sad.@   That's why they call it conservative Sundays regarding tv.   Wow.  I heard they liked beer.  I put some out and only one showed up.  Never heard about watermelon.   Didn't they get retroactive immunity for this once already?????   I think it was a tv show hosted by Alfred Hitchcock.  A boy grew mushrooms in his basement.   They ended up taking over his body.  Very scary.    Conspicuous consumption.   Thank you.   The head of the IRS is a republican appointed by Bush.  You could built a good conspiracy theory here!   I just wish it was more consumer oriented.      Take me wlth you.    Me too.    Zion is about 3 hrs out of Las Vegas.  The Zions Narrows is an 18 mile hike down the river.  While I've walked a ways up the river, the full hike is on my short list.  It is beautiful there.  They only allow so many people in the canyon however, so you need to make arrangements first with the Park.   Where is this?   If those 1.5 million residents vote, the state will turn blue.  It's heading that way anyway.   Fun.   Sick huh?   Desert Bloom.  Although there are photos of old Vegas including LVHS, I heard it wasn't filmed here.  And no one mentions Viva Las Vegas!      I hate to tell you, but most people want to work.  It's hard for a lot of people to work when it's not enough to pay their rent.   Not really. It just told them what they want to believe, even if wrong.      After a few years, I decided to get serious, and I got to be pretty good.  I practiced with set shots including spot shots, draw and follow.  The other key for me was to be able to see through three shots, so I played a lot of three-ball just trying to make three shots in a row.  If you can continually make three shots, you can run out.   That looks pretty good!  Wish I had one right now.   I feel the same way.     For those of you who like this, there is a facebook site: Las Vegas, The Good ol' days.  A lot of old timers put photos, film and other comments on the page.   NPR did a piece on this, and some of the songs were hilarious.  A bunch of people played the Rightious Bros "You've Lost that Loving Feeling" at their wedding!   Me too.   Also, public housing stopped being built and HUD started contracting out Section 8 housing to investors owning multiple houses.  I remember seeing a story in my town where a man was renting a house to his girlfriend, and HUD was paying the rent.   Not far enough,   The initial story showed a homeless guy being sent to Sacramento, CA.  In the follow-up story, it showed him now living with his sister in Sacramento which is a better option than staying in a mental health hospital.  He literally was sent to family.   Not really.   I know, a California for-profit hospital.   wow.   Yes, and state employees have taken about a 20% pay and benefit cut in the last 4 years, and it doesn't look like the legislature will do anything to help it in the next two years.  State employees were already lowest on the totem pole with city and county workers.   I watched Anthony Bourdain there last night on CNN. I've been dreaming about it all day.  Then I see your photos.  Great pics!   Good for this boy.  When I saw the article title, I was hoping it was the young boy was was abducted by the Chinese as he was identified as being the next Dali Lama.     Partly it's like crying wolf.  We're tired of hearing of their continual outrage over something - anything.  I think Obama's right on this one:  there is no there there.   The NAACP was singled out; I just didn't hear about it until this week.   You're right.  It drives me crazy.  I've talked with some of these folks.  They are entitled, it's the other ones who are scamming the system.  It's insane.   The intent was different too.  Nixon saw it as a way to get rid of the bureaucracy.   You make good points and I do worry about Dems a lot too.  But,  the parties are not comparable in craziness.     I would just tax the Walton family since they earn 40% of all income in a year in the US.  Taxes used to be 90% in the US in the 50's ; 83% in England in 1980.  If it keeps going the way it is, no one will have any income at all to shop at Wal-Mart.   Thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  I saw a book on c-span today that was addressing these very issues...http://www.truth-out.org/article/item/1388:gar-alperovitz-the-prehistory-of-the-next-possible-progressive-era This is a Truthout article on his book and thoughts about the subject.  He was talking today about coops, but he said long term we need to define the type of democracy we want.   No necessarily, but you you would have the freedom to find your purpose without having to worry about the necessities.     Exactly.  I don't think we have a choice.   There is an old town in Nevada also -  St. Thomas - that was covered during the filling of Lake Mead that is now being exposed.   Depressing huh?   That was what Cheney said.   When did you win your Nobel prize for economics?   It seems hopeless.   Good summation.   I can't believe she is still around and given credibility by the right.  I see her occassionally on C-Span.  Amazing.   You are not paying close enough attention.  I rarely hear Dems make the crazy type of statements that you hear 10 times a day from Republicans.  Check this article out that I just saw on reddit http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dz4tl or listen to Rachel on MSNBC.  Is she biased?  You bet.  But she can back her stuff up with facts.   I just made a comment on another article about thier craziness is that we need to treat them as a cult and de-program them.  Then I see this article....   We need to start treating them as a cult, and that they members need to be de-programed.   It's not too new.  It was proposed by Nixon.   I wish we could vote these guys out, but we can't seem to do it.    I like Bugliosi, but Thom Hartmann has a good book which makes a strong case for the mafia.      Close.  Charleston and Main.  I don't remember anyone swimming it it though!  Great photo.   I've never heard of this university.      Thank you for your thoughtful response.  We read too little of this.   This link needs to be made in the science subreddit.  People there might be as interested as us.   I wasn't making reference to you.   I'm at the same place you are.  It's tough to live like this.  I don't know how people do it.  We can't give up though.   Wow. Thanks for the post.

 No. The only two episodes that I know of that Gail the Snail is in are The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention and the last episodes of season 9, which is I think The Gang Squashes Their Beefs. She first appeared in season 5. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is in season 2 I think.   No that's The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is the one where Mac bangs Dennis' mom and then Dennis tries to sleep with all the moms to retaliate.   I have some personal favorites but I'm a die-hard fan and I tend to like even the ones that no one enjoys but these episodes are what I always hear from my friends. 1. The Gang Dances Their Asses Off 2. Dennis and Dee Go On Welfare 3. Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom   He does this thing where like, he doesn't exist. It's hilarious you have to be there to get it.

    I'm not certain. I'll see what I can find when I get home and I'll PM you the details   You could always move to Switzerland :P   Am I the only one bothered by the fact that the stanchions and lifelines are flat on the deck?   [A video taken of a Refueling at Sea (RAF) with the USCGC MUNRO (WHEC-724) and the JS Mash (AOE-425). Taken during the OOH Patrol of 2004/2005.](https://youtu.be/E4mLtm0Lu3I)      I'm here to offer knowledge about the US Coast Guard :)   This was taken during the deployment of Expeditionary Strike Group Five (ESG 5) in 2004         It's a train car... of beer.      That was fantastic!   lmao. I laughed harder at that than I should have.   So let it goooooo!!!!   Clearly not!    I know ours (USCG) harkens back to the days of the Revenue Cutter Service. I pulled this from [uscg.mil](http://www.uscg.mil):  The Revenue Marine and the Revenue Cutter Service , as it was known variously throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as cutters.  The term is English in origin and refers to a specific type of vessel, namely, "a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail." (Peter Kemp, editor, The Oxford Companion to Ships   the Sea; London: Oxford University Press, 1976; pp. 221-222.)   The Royal Navy's definition of a cutter was a small warship capable of carrying 8 to 12 cannons.***   By general usage, the term cutter came to define any vessel of Great Britain's Royal Customs Service and the term was adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine.  Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its largest vessels as cutters (today a cutter is any Coast Guard vessel over 65-feet in length).  And the little addition as denoted by "***":  ***BMC Joseph Noecker, USCG (Ret.) in an email to the Historian's Office, noted: ". . .cutters in the British man-of-war designations had 8 to 12 guns/cannon. . . Hull numbers [were] one way of calling a ship via radio.  Much the same as an aircrafts' tail number is used today.  By international agreement all U.S. radio call signs begin with A, K, N or W.

 But don't call it a "default."  Under Gov. Walker, Wisconsin went from a $760M surplus in 2013 to a $283M deficit this coming year.      Awesome, this was the explanation I was seeking.   Does the spherical or squared off ends indicate one type over another?   I see rectangular ones rounded ones with square ends, and tubular ones with square ends. The rectangular ones obviously carry dry goods but what about the other ones?   That's like saying brain surgeons are better than heart surgeons. Each of the racing sports are quite separate disciplines though they use much of the same principles. Rallye is fantastic and the drivers are challenged by very different conditions and have to interact with their navigator but they race against the clock. In F1, precision is key and the variation comes in having to adapt the best line to react to what the other drivers immediately around you are doing.   Whichever they race, it takes thousands of hours of practice in that discipline to be competitive. Mika Hakkinen has been racing on a track since he was a kid, starting with kart racing.   Hey, welcome to adulthood!   Aww, you're so C*_6_*H*_12_*O*_6_*.   Fair nuff.   I didn't start it. Read over the damn thread.  One thing my father taught me, and I'll teach you now:  Don't throw the first punch, but throw the second punch with everything you got.  Now, go be a man.   Hey fag, read this:  The minimum practical application range for salt is a pavement temperature of 15-20F and above.  You seriously are an idiot. Do you want the phone numbers for the Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado departments of transportation?  Christ, why do I put up with idiots?   Here's a google of ['road salt temperature'](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=road%20salt%20temperature). Read Google's answer. No DOT will dump tons of road salt at -6F just to watch it take hours and hours to turn it to slush which will re-freeze during the next precip.   If the high was only 0 Fahrenheit, salt can't be used because it's not effective. They use sand at that point.   Hydraulic fluid is used in control systems much like brake cables on your bicycle. Instead of cables, hydraulic fluid is used. When you push on the brakes in your car, the brake lines filled with hydraulic fluid transmits that pressure to the brake calipers at the wheel.  Hydraulic fluid can leak, causing you to lose pressure. Or you can get air bubbles in the hoses. Air is very compressible so it absorbs the pressure and makes the hydraulic system less effective. Hydraulic fluid also absorbs water. If enough is absorbed, the metal parts of the system begin to rust and can stick or bind.   Water is fairly transparent in the visible spectrum of light but it loves UV and absorbs lots of it. It absorbs UV at 10X visible wavelengths, if I recall. On a clear cold day there isn't as much water in the air absorbing the UV so more reaches the ground where it can get absorbed by the water on the surface. That water reaches a higher energy state and vaporizes.   Just because you have a 6 Mbps dsl speed on your copper line doesn't mean you are actually getting that. You are sharing the connection with your neighbors. Also, your download and upload speeds are very different. With a T1, you get the full 1.5Mbps, both up and down.  The price is high because typically a T1/PRI is leased to a customer who absolutely needs guaranteed capacity and reliability.   Cancer cells grow and divide rapidly. It takes a lot of fuel to do that. Cancer cells literally starve you, or rather they starve your good cells where the cancer is growing. If/when the cancer metastasizes and starts spreading, your body slowly shuts down as the cells that perform vital functions die. You don't die from cancer, you die from liver failure, heart failure, starvation, etc.   Coding a new crowd-sourced micro-loan website focused on clean water, skill building and giving matriarchs of sub-sahara african tribal families the economic opportunities to create sustainable small businesses. And doing it in Ruby on Rails.  Just kidding. I'm on reddit.   Lie detectors should probably be called truth detectors. They're better at detecting who is telling the truth than who is telling lies.   This is where economics textbooks let you down, my friend. L.L. Bean has been around for over 100 years. If they want to be around another 100 years then it's not good PR to raise your prices during massive winter storms.    Insurance companies are providing a service and taking on risk. Why shouldn't they be profitable? If insurance companies can be profitable while helping slow the rise of health care costs then isn't that good? They are private corporations that are competing against each other so hopefully they are being forced to constantly strive to provide better service at lower cost. They are also a force that helps control cost increases from pharmaceutical, medical equipment companies, doctors and hospitals that also want to be profitable. In my state there are also options from an ACA-marketplace insurance provider that is a non-profit. County health services are taxpayer funded and have no competition. They get the same budget regardless of how well they're meeting the needs of the community. I have a problem with that.   It's certainly a complex issue but what we were doing hasn't been working too well. The idea of the ACA has been around for a long time and I'm willing to see if it produces results.   When you reach 65 or older, medicare becomes available for you.   But it's not limited to life threatening care. It has become the defacto doctor's office visit for everything from colds to head lice and I suspect it is the same for your county's emergency room, regardless of their official policy. These costs are a big burden for hospitals. The ACA has already resulted more people now have insurance than at any other time that the statistic has been measured. This will directly correlate to fewer emergency room visits, more preventive care doctors office visits.   The ACA says that insurers can not use pre-existing conditions to determine whether you can be covered and the premium cost. They can use age and whether you are a smoker.    Premiums have been going up by a lot every single year. For example, between 2009 and 2010--this is prior to the ACA rollout--the national average increase was 6.5%.  Under the ACA the premium increases between 2014 and 2015 were net zero nationally. Some states saw increases, other states saw decreases.  Source: [National Conference of State Legislatures.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/health-insurance-premiums.aspx)   You benefit from the same totalitarian government which has mandated to health care providers that if you visit the emergency room, they must provide life-saving care to you regardless of your ability to pay. This is health care that is not free. In fact, it's quite expensive and somebody has to pay for it.  How do you feel about that mandate?   Like everything else, currency responds to supply and demand.    Tighter winding produces bulkier cable and uses more copper. Copper is very costly right now. Plus, to be truly Cat6, the installer needs to terminate with shielded connectors and use shielded patch panels, which are costly and time consuming.   The list is just how I think money should be allocated. I'd rather take $50 from the money spent on skis to buy a $75 pair of gloves instead of a $25 pair.  Growing up, my fingers were practically frostbitten on some days. Now that I have some disposable income, I splurge on gloves and I find that it helps me stay more comfortable so I can ski longer and get more enjoyment.    Because they want to be the next place where Microsoft and Comcast builds tech support call centers.   Batteries, motor and magnet in the handle.   It's not meant to be the order that you buy things, but the relative importance you should consider when allocating how much money to spend on each thing. Splurge on things at the top of the list, at the expense of things at the bottom.   Except that if you're in the states you can't buy a new Defender. The 20 year old used ones go for minimum $25K.   The Series I/II/III are in the direct lineage leading to the Defender 90/110.   Wow. I did not know this. When it is resurrected next year I'm sure it won't be the same.   Your skis respond to the input from your legs and feet. If your feet move around inside your boot, it can't properly control your skis. You'll be wasting a lot of energy trying to control skis that are wandering. On steeper runs, things happen faster and there's less room for mistakes. In bumps and crud it's absolutely critical that you can instantly adjust your skis to the varying terrain.   I don't disagree with you at all. I ride motorcycles, bike and ski, always with a helmet. A lot of people think helmets reduce concussions but there just isn't much evidence to support that. I think it's important people know the limitations of the helmet.   That's a football study regarding a certain design. That design may eventually make it into snow sports but I'm talking about the recent evidence on ski helmets that are in use today.  Here's one: The helmet does a very good job at protecting against skull lacerations and skull fractures, but it doesnt seem to have much effect on concussions or T.B.I.s, Shealy said, referring to traumatic brain injuries. Jasper Shealy, a professor emeritus at Rochester Institute of Technology, has been studying snow-sports-related injuries at Sugarbush resort in Vermont for more than 30 years.  From a recent [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/sports/on-slopes-rise-in-helmet-use-but-no-decline-in-brain-injuries.html).   That's pretty awesome DIY waterproofing   Where does grass fit on this list?   Yeah definitely, and I can't imagine skiing without one now. Helmets prevent a lot of kinds of head injuries but statistically they don't reduce the chance of concussions. :(   Patrollers still wear overalls but it seems to have fallen out of favor with everyone else.   Oh my hell.   A fitter can put some bolsters around your ankle area to get a tighter grip, or you can go with Intuition liners. That's really important! How the hell are you able to ski bumps if your heel is lifting in your boots???!!!!?   Part of enjoying what you do is feeling good when you're doing it. Foot complaints are probably #1 and it really holds people back from enjoying skiing. I think it's one of the reasons snowboarding has taken off. If you're starting out and know that you like skiing, invest in good boots that are appropriate for your level and get the liners fitted. You can even move some liners to new boots as you get better, as long as they aren't too compressed. Footbeds are also important if you have weird arches like I do.   I don't disagree with that. You should spend more than $20 on goggles but honestly I don't see (literally) much difference between $50 and $150 other than $150 buys you some sweet looking ones. I just put them below jacket because I think it's important to have a nice weatherproof shell with adjustable ventilation to handle lots of different changes in condition. But goggles could easily go above the shell.   Helmets don't do anything to prevent concussions. If you were going to get one you would have gotten one, helmet or not. It saved you from a nasty contusion, likely.   People's priorities are way off when it comes to where the money goes for ski equipment.   Common priorities:  1. Jacket/Pants 2. Goggles 3. Skis 4. Gloves 5. Boots  It should be:  1. Boots 2. Gloves 3. Skis 4. Jacket/Pants 5. Goggles  With shitty skis and great fitting boots you can still ski anything. With great skis and shitty fitting boots, you won't be able to ski anything more than blue.   If you're talking about dealerships, a lot of their customers are repeat buyers who have developed a trusted relationship. I can walk into my Ducati dealership and test ride a $25,000 motorcycle.   Exercise strengthens bones by placing more stress on them. Asians typically walk a lot more than Americans.   The first computers had a very small amount of code called a bootstrapper that looked for software from an input/output device such as a punch card reader and load that directly into memory and start performing the loaded instructions. Thus the operating system could be coded into those punch cards.   There are only a few species that we know of which are self-aware like humans. The common test is the mirror test, where an odorless colored dot is placed somewhere they can't see on themselves but can in a mirror. A self-aware animal will react differently in the presence of the dot than without it.  Dogs and cats don't show much signs of being self-aware and I suppose that extends to their shadows.   Where does pillow appear on Maszlow's hierarchy?   There are a lot of reasons for them to--air pollution, especially in-cabin pollution to name one--but it's government. There is no incentive for government bureaucrats to update their bus design requirements and huge disincentives not to. In other words, nobody in government has ever lost their job by maintaining the status quo, no matter how ineffective and inefficient it is.   I'm not sure it so much crappy design as a necessary design. I'd hate to have my shirt pocket get filled with ink. Perhaps it's an unsolvable design problem?   Assuming that it's your own fart, the anticipation of the coming aroma.   Cats. Pictures of cats.   I am a business owner. I had an employee tell me that he saw a friend with a flat tire on the freeway and pulled over to help her change it because he had my floor jack in his car (which he had borrowed from me a few months prior).

You can't make time stop but you can get pretty darn close by travelling at nearly the speed of light.   Most people know not to throw paper towels, tampons and pads into the toilet so it's not a big issue. These "flushable" wipes are marketed as being toilet-disposable. It's a godsend for parents. I'm guilty. Unfortunately, I now know they do not break down as easily as toilet paper. It's a major problem, especially in areas with older waste treatment facilities. I think you'll eventually see that term banned from their packaging unless the companies actually make them more degradable.      To get a sense of what is going to happen under extreme drought conditions, you can look at what is going on in Syria. In only 5 years of severe drought, from 2006 to 2011, millions of Syrians who subsist on farming lost close to 100% of their crops. This drove millions into the cities for work, creating social stress and unrest. Combine that with an oppressive regime and you get conditions that create groups like ISIS which has threatened the fragile region.

Yeah, hard to condense a book down to one paragraph. :)  The reason why I included all the other things is because Diamond's premise is that they were sequential events. There is a lot more as well, domestication of animals as a reliable source of protein was huge. A population density high enough for rapid sharing of innovations, abundant sources of fresh water and water routes for trade, etc. But of course other cultures had that too. Europe was unique in that all of those things occurred on one continent.   Jared Diamond wrote a fantastic book about this called "Guns, Germs and Steel."   Basically:  Europe was a wide continent (more latitude than longitude), which is important when you're dealing with climate and agriculture. As humans migrated across latitude they can bring the same seeds and make the same crops. This helped them succeed quickly. They made a lot of war, which led to a lot of innovation such as bronze and steel, maritime, etc. They endured a lot of disease and pestilence which allowed them to become fairly immune and carry disease to the Americas which wiped out the natives.   It came from a story about Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt. He was on a hunting trip and as was customary, chasers cornered and tied up a bear to a tree for Roosevelt to shoot. Roosevelt said it was unsportsmanlike and didn't shoot the bear. Word spread around and a toy company made a stuffed toy bear. It became a very popular toy because of the popularity of the story.   In addition to weight, The ice will deform the airfoil and will cause the wings to lose lift. The aircraft will stall.  All commercial passenger jets have deicing equipment to melt or break up the ice while in-flight.   So what did your President do when he understood the toll that violent fanaticism took on individual lives? He used that sentiment to start a war that destroyed a country which had absolutely nothing to do with that attack and he did it with all of the support of the American Congress and the citizens.  Perhaps the point is belabored to you but I doubt most Americans have any idea what is going on outside their own city, let alone the world. This memorialization is trivial. Aside from the rescue personnel, what did the rest of the 3,000 people do that day? They went to work. The fact that they had no control over when and how they died is not a reason to spend vast amounts of money, time and resources to memorialize them. These 3,000 deaths is just as tragic as all of the innocent deaths in Iraq that resulted from American imperialism--deaths that still happen daily. People in Iraq die while going to work, every day. They get blown up and they leave behind survivors who grieve just as much as you Americans. Does any American give a shit? Not a single synapse in the United States is wasted on such a thought. The only time American fuck would be given is if a dollar could be earned doing so. American aid? For every $100 sent to Iraq, $95 came back to the United States in the form of lucrative contracts. Murica! Fuck Yeah! Your politicians build these memorials that you can bow to so it's easier for them to fuck you up the ass.  Not only is this memorial trivial, it's dangerous. You Americans have a history of using such memorials to launch wars, not only in 2012 but you also had "Remember the Alamo," used to launch an imperial expansionist land-grab war against Mexico. The world doesn't trust America and there shall be no apology offered for that.  Lastly, the fact that you Americans want to memorialize people who merely went to the office is the sort of American exceptionalism that people elsewhere find particular disgust in. If you check the pinterest and twitter streams around the world I bet you'll find a lot of photos of foreigners at this memorial giving the ol' thumbs up.   It sounds like you suddenly realized the answer. Congratulations.   You've hit the question that is at the heart of the matter. Why is government needed as the foundation of capitalism? What is the weakness of capitalism that you need government to correct? If you answer that question then you have answered OP.   There are 300,000 to 1,000,000 additional victims of 9/11 in Iraq that the New York Times forgot about.   Yikes!   Metal doesn't fatigue and weaken unless flexed beyond a certain limit. If the aircraft is well designed and you don't fly through extreme storm conditions, it can fly a really long time with regular maintenance.   Bacteria will turn milk bad very quickly at room temps. Cheese and yogurt is "bad" milk that we humans love. We introduce certain bacteria that produce flavors we like. They consume the lactose sugars before the bad bacteria has a chance to, and they often create acidic environments that inhibit that bad bacteria in the first place.  Meringue is egg white. I believe that bacteria feed mostly on the yolk so by taking the yolk out, the meringue has a longer room temp life. Not sure on this.   Why have government?   it wasn't meant to be a comprehensive history textbook. It was meant to show that there is another side to the story. Growing up in the United States and studying within the public school curriculum up through high school, you won't ever see "the other side." Zinn obviously meant for his book to prod people to question rather than accept. That's the kind of growth that college also provides to young adults.   I surely hope you don't think hypothetical questions are irrelevant. Political philosophers throughout the written history of mankind have been discussing hypothetical and unreal forms of government. I'm sorry if you don't see the value in doing so.  Regardless, I was addressing "freedom therefore capitalism." My point is that you don't want the kind of pure capitalism that would appear in a completely free state. There are problems in pure capitalism that must be redressed through creating a regulated competitive market and governed by an authority to which we give power to punish. No regulatory body will be perfect because there will never be a set of regulations that are perfect. Regulations, by their nature, are restrictions of freedom which we grudgingly accept to varying degrees. They will hurt some and help others.  jefferey1313 accepts both premises--pure capitalism has problems, government regulations have problems--but could not accept the conclusion that the system isn't perfect. The only way he can do that is by believing that there is a set of perfect regulations that can be administered by a perfectly functional governing body.  TL;DR: Is capitalism problem-free? On one extreme, pure capitalism  isn't desired by most people. So we agree there are problems. Now it's just a matter of drawing the line to balance regulation and liberty.   And around in a circle we go. You conveniently want to avoid talking about true freedom in an unregulated capitalist market, then you say that such a thing would cure the patent issue. Are you trying to have it both ways?  Do you want regulated competition? That means government.  Do you want unregulated capitalism? That's freedom, my friend. But that also means that if you come up with a better mouse trap, somebody (somebody with, say, more capital) can copy it and put you out of business tomorrow.  My point is this.  Your conundrum illustrates this weakness of capitalism:  An unregulated market will foster unfair competition. Regulated competition will restrict capitalism.   I guess I got caught up on the "freedom" part.  Anyways, I think you can give more credit to some people, maybe not all, but at least some. There is a /r/TIL today that discussed how Albuterol--an old asthma drug--was repatented and now costs over $100 per inhaler. Before, it was $15.  People also have issues with corporate greed trumping civility. Enron is a good example. Their tactics of purchasing a small amount of electricity allocation then reselling it back to localities at astronomical prices when the system was maxxed out and there were rolling blackouts was considered to be the ultimate in greed. Their tactics forced the electricity utilities to cut power in the middle of summer, raise prices sky high, forcing some people to choose between dying from heat exposure or not eating.   Wealth is a great motivator. Nobody denies that. Bu there are also many examples of greedy, anti-social behavior due to capitalism.  	84

 well, the Union aren't doing so well. I could switch the captain choice. Who should I pick?   D:      Have economists explained the benefits and cons of the TPP? I really want to know since obviously most economists would say that TPP is a good thing economically.   I use Bing.   Viability of play and Greatness of the Art?  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Wrongful_Arrest   You can look in the conservative mindset and think "Why is this Kansas's Governor doing the thing for the benefit of conservatives?" and for what reason?   Just pretending to be a conservative   Thanks for the help! :D I didn't know how to do that as well.   I am assuming this will encourage people to attend private schools or get vouchers or go to charter schools to get "better" eduction, right? Also, it will prevent public unions from stealing taxpayer money?   Isn't this bribery?    I forgot to include imports of slave labor and natural resources, but mainly we produced our own texiles from cotton grown in the south and produced manufacturing up in the north.    You do realize the USA was a protectionist country up until WW2. The Republican Party used to support heavy tariffs and the Democratic Party used to support reduced tariffs. Our growth in capital resulted from the education system and innovation by Americans with some access to knowledge from European technology.    I think Konami might make that rule change sometime in the future to promote new dueling tactics. After all, GX characters followed that concept.    What are the economists thoughts on the trans pacific partnership?   Politics And ideologies can be ironic. Example: conservatives pro global trade yet nationalist. How?

Foreign Companies are growing the nations to serve their objective and sell them for the benefit of other countries. The goods produced aren't really used by the people in Africa themselves. They can use some of their wages to purchase some of the goods, but there isn't the full gains of trade. This method will take a long time for countries to actually develop into developed countries, but it still works. Hence, why the world's economy gets better each day throughout human history. It just depends on the rate of growth.   But... Protectionism is bad economic policy, right? According to simple economics, protectionism prevents competition, does not increase welfare, and doesn't improve the lives relative to when a country actually trades.   Roids   There is a video segment on Vice New's YouTube channel that looks into the pipeline industry's self regulation and the government's inability to regulate them.   Revenues will be increasing in the future due to the tax cuts ;)  Praise the Laffer Curve!   He isn't really overrated....   Clark, Davis, Barnes, Sturgis, or Lovejoy   You have 3 fusion sages and 3 poly? Fusion sage is basically an upstart.....   It is understandable from an economist point of view. Another interesting look is how free-trade functions between China and Hong Kong.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrkVDM5OYs4  There are similaritities between how they interact and how the US interacts with other countries.   I agree with the top point. Anything can cause a recession or depression, while policies are enacted in the extremes in a short period of time.   For the second point, Are you suggesting that current path of America's trade policy should continue without any reforms or changes?   America built an economy up until World War 2 with heavy tariffs, growing unions, and lots of exports.   You can argue on either end of the spectrum. It seems like the problem is the trade deficit. It is not protectionism vs free-trade. A little more protectionism could reduce the deficit and in return increase exports.   America was a protectionist country until World War 2. During that time, we built an incredible economy. Not saying alll free-trade and protectionism is bad, but some protectionism and some trade is good.    The whole irony is that while we debate whether burger flippers are worth $15, we seem to believe that manufacturing labor should be worth less than $1 because without it.....most of our goods would be more expensive.    Colorado's Defense does better when O'Neill and Moor are on the field.

Hm... I got Sam for this week..... but.... Should I also get Felipe?   I am glad that I captained Jacobson. lol   How exactly do we debunk the claims that free-trade always good for the economy from most economists?     roid cards if any :)   Oh the puns....   There is some evidence, but it is still a theory. This is economics. You can't go far to extreme on either end. Also it is possible to shift demand and supply to get some outcomes.   A fully automated society will probably need basic income.    The minimum wage is still a price floor though. You could raise it to $15 min wage and reduce the labor supply and it wouldn't really create a lot of deadweight loss of the demand is inelastic. demand for labor is inelastic when businesses have to take the market wage and can't automate as quickly.   Small Businesses will probably take the new labor market wage because they can't buy capital initially because it would be too expensive to automate.   Raising the minimum wage still doesn't address the issue of why companies are making so much money off of an uncompetitive markets. they will continue outsourcing and automating these jobs. They will do in a faster rate if we do raise it now.   Anarchy! Because minorities should always rebel on majority rules. No. You face off in a court system.   Wouldn't it makes sense to reduce outsourcing incentivized first and increase competition in the markets so companies don't get as much profit to automate as quickly. Since we have an increase in small businesses, those businesses can't buy capital as fast as big businesses. Also a reduction in the labor supply by reducing the amount of new immigrant labor and an increase in unionization would push up wages as well. These should all go into effect before the min wage actually increases.   It will eventually balance out. Once western conference players hit the transfer market, they will most likely go to eastern conference.   if all nations abolished trade barriers, would all the world prices be at equilibrium?   When are we going to debate the merits of this on the media?   I would go with Kamara, since Agudelo could sometimes not start, since Charlie Davis is a good sub at the moment.

A bonus is hat the main character isn't dominant so it is unique in its own way.   yes. if you haven't watched it, it is one of the best.   I say yes, if you are getting rid of him long term.    1 Car 2ds   2 Cards   Not exactly. In Canada and UK, they have first past the post system with many parties. It is just that power is centralized to Parliament with proportion and majority rules that encourages more parties, but there is still the spoiler effect.   Mostly due to the fact that we allowed politicians to accept free-trade deals with countries not on similar living standards as us.   My defense is Hernandez (NYCFC), Harrington, and Ramos. Midfielders are Ishizaki, Sam, Jacobson, and Finlay. Forwards are Arrieta, Villa, and Rivero. I am leaning on Ousted because it wouldn't make sense to have Arrieta and Deric starting.   Bench: Villarreal, Sjoberg   I say yes, if you have DGW players on your starting lineup. DGW players will probably make up the difference of -4.   Cardcar D   Nekroz is so weak.   Why would people captain defenders if one goal by the opposing team cause no clean sheets and defenders don't have manny opportunities to score goals?   Fluffals   Both have the same outcome, but I would say swinging strikes is better. Called strikes is basically a batter trying to get a ball or just confused by the pitch. swinging strikes are basically batter knowing where to hit but the pitch had some movement. Fouling balls for strikes is better than both.    Statistics are part of sports. All major sports teams use them.   Why do they have 2 performapals for vote? Are they trying to split the vote? DDD? The tcg has no support for it, so why do we need it? Beast eyes and Tiger are good for a vote.    Yugioh wouldn't be around much if people don't get access or have the chance to play decks. More competition = the better the community and support for the game as a whole.   The only viable way of using roids is mixing them with cybers, machinas, and rank 4s at the moment.    YES! ROID SUPPORT!   I would say that Montreal need a better goalkeeping than defenders. Though, the defense could be better.   Don't forget Shane O'Neill   That changes deck builds if people are unwilling to have 3 upstarts    Yet conservatives keep promoting that mass transit riders must pay more in fares to find the systems.   pot of greed   Imagine the traffic if all of those were shut down due to low funds.   Even small town USA needs the trains to deliver goods to other places and highways to get places.   Shouldn't John Boehner have found the money by now for transportation and the Highway Trust Fund? Reference: John Oliver :)   today's meta has so many cards on the field that I think mirror force outclasses dprison.   Why not? A strong military means a strong AMERICA!   Double standard much? :)   Royal magical library   Roids - young kids with toys   Since protection of national security is important, we should make it mandatory for all citizens to be in the army like how Switzerland does it. :)   Yes. By the way, I am left-leaning in politics.    Wouldn't the easiest solution be making college mandatory for all the citizens if it is so "important"?   if Rivero says he has some injury, then I guess morales. Though, morales could get some yellow or red card.... Ouch.....   I could try that because finlay might not start 2 games but it is worth the shot.   I wanted to transfer out Neagle because he price dropped by $0.1 and he hasn't produced as I wanted since the beginning of the season. Molino is also in the same category as Neagle. You recommend transferring in a good defender over a midfielder?    Starting:  Goalkeeper: Ousted  Defenders: Ramos(Orlando), Opara(SKC), Harrington (COL)  Midfielders: Ishizaki(LA), Jacobson(NYCFC), Neagle(SEA), Morales(VAN), Molino(Orlando)  Forwards: Villa(NYCFC), Rivero(VAN)  Bench: Deric, Arrieta, Villarreal, Bedell, Peay, Robinson    Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.    In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.    He leans more socialist than the rest because he wants a single-payer healthcare system.    Steve Grossman was the best candidate. he isn't martha and he isn't too socialist like Berwick.   Remember the section on the gas tax. The easiest solution is raising the gas tax but people are against it in its full concept because they want really cheap gas prices.   Because Baker and the State House Would have cut even more spending without raising any taxes to balance the budget.    the repeal of the auto tax increase basically decreased the MBTA's expected future revenues by a few % points and some millions.   The easiest fix would be raising the gas tax. It will #1 fund road repairs and other infrastructure needs. #2 discourage excessive driving, so more riders will ride the T for more revenues.    I usually go on Saturdays. :)   Well, Steve Clark, Parkhurst, Pogatetz, Grana, and Finlay have played mroe than 200 minutes, so they are safe bets. If I had to chose a player, it would be Finlay because he has done well last season. You could do Steve Clark, but people are hoping on Vancouevr attack to do well, so it might backfire.    We need more political parties ranging from the fringes to the moderates to the libertarians to the populists.    Hitters have been taking drugs since the beginning of baseball.    Imagine Montreal vs Toronto or Boston or New York?   I recommend getting qliphorts sooner or later because the prices are falling and have the potential to rebound if the meta still allows them to function.   If they are working under the table for cash, then they are "working" techically to live a life instead of soly relying on welfare. Of course, these are Americans working under the table, yet somehow illegal immigrants can't work under the table for cash.   You do realize that strikeout rates have increased, game time length has increased, less homeruns, less hits, etc has been happening since the past 2 decades. We had more runs/homeruns/hits per game and shorter game length 2+ decades ago, so something needs to be addressed.    The easiest option is to buy players from teams with DGW. They will score more points than the average, so their price should rise. Then, you can resell them in the next round.   	108
             http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/06/03/1508274112               Yeah, whenever I hear/see Irrawaddy I hear Kahn's chant.    Lol, not sure how "one" became "joke" but oh well.   And it's a King of the Hill reference.   Yay! I was worried no joke would get the reference...                                                                     Because it gives the reader the context as to why this is an important study?   If there weren't a concerted effort to push a false narrative that warming stopped, then a study showing otherwise wouldn't have any relevance.    A scientist should hope that people stop saying something that's incorrect.   Right? Or do you think they should be happy about misinformation and the repetition of debunked myths?   ...did you really just use the "it's cold where I am right now, therefore global warming isn't real" argument?     Yeah maybe just don't be a pedant.   I work with climate scientists on a daily basis. They use the terms interchangeably unless referring to specific issues.   And regardless, editors, not scientists, write headlines.     But then it appears as if someone's been quoted, not that it's just part of the article. Personal opinion isn't ever allowed, so I don't see why people would think it's that and not a quote from the story, which is standard practice...   Scientists shouldn't hope that false things aren't repeated?          Yeah, my fanboys are dedicated.                            It's not my opinion, it's the conclusion of the coverage, and it provides the context as to why the research is important.

It's so easy sometimes, so cheap....      As a fellow Asian, I imagined this to be more like "My blood type is B+, so you can imagine how pissed off my parents were when they found out."   Waited for Bert....   Nice try, Chris Brown.   So apparently complimenting girls makes you Socially Awesome now...   This is something a lot of parents should be doing all the time that my mother did for me: My mom is a very popular lady amongst her peers and at her workplace. So, whenever she would take me around her friends, family members I hadn't met yet, or people she ran into at the store, she'd always make sure I fully introduced myself and started even just some small talk with the person(s). Instead of "This is my son Michael" she'd turn to me and say "Michael, would you like to introduce yourself?" Really simple. I'd generally reply with "Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Michael. Shellani's son" to which her friends would usually laugh... haha. It's funny to think about now. But really, I see too many shy ass kids around as kids and as teenagers and adults I deal with every day. Could've benefitted from what I did.    Great title.   Okay well I'm glad you tried. A nice technique to try when speaking to GR (something you may already have tried) is stating at the end that this really upsets you because you really an innocently messed up then asking if there is anything more they could do for you. I'm sure they'll try to offer another solution, but alternatively I can't say I'd be terribly surprised with the amount of fake claims they receive. Just be genuine and innocent as possible when dealing with GR.

We have a pretty sophisticated system, but it requires a lot of upkeep and is rivaled by the system of Indiana Jones, which spaces their vehicles automatically, preventing backups. Second, because we are already going down for a year, we are taking this time to change the 30+ year old track. Same ride, better track/brake system. Third, we are extending the exit platform to accommodate more people/wheelchairs.  Fourth, we are improving show effects and in turn, replacing lost show effects such as potentially the return of the earthquake ending, or I have heard rumor that it may be much different... Fifth, behind the scenes stuff like adding phone systems to backstage areas and on stage areas that need them.  Hope this helped.   At least it wasn't Zach Braff     	41

 Maybe I have. But yeah it's a pointless question considering the movie isn't out yet   I have a feeling the performance will be great, but the movie will get 50/50 reviews. Plus the director isn't known for making Oscar bait films, and if Nightcrawler didn't nab him at least a nomination, i don't  see how this will.   Hirsch wasn't nominated for Into the Wild   Promiseland was very meh   Spot on    We've made quite a few moves improving our defense this off season, which is great, but the only problem is last year, while defense was a major concern, our offense was pretty abysmal. Obviously the team isn't going to be perfected in one off season, plus McCloughan still needs time to gather talent, but barring a breakout from RG3 (please!) were not going very far (which is expected already).      So what do you say to somebody you hate?   It's a perfectly made film, but an okay movie.   I don't know if this counts, but when Bruce Dern finally gets to drive the truck in Nebraska I got pretty emotional.   Mom's Spaghetti   THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING SAY SO!   ....huh well alright   I saw both and still wanted Keaton to win, I thought they were both great, but mostly wanted Keaton to win cause he was the only one not based on a real person   You got it   What the fuck does the Sound of music have to do with anything Oscar related last year.   Ummmm   Other way around bro   A movie that comes to mind is R.I.P.D, Bridges and Reynolds were pretty awful together even though I like both actors.   THE PRESIDENT SHALL NOT BE THE SHINIEST OF TWO TURDS   And, scene   Dolla*   I'm so happy for guys and for Brady. Hope your sub welcomes non-patriot fans to celebrate!   Russell's next completion is going to be to a Seahawk?    Russell's next completion is going to be to a Patriot   I'm interested what the QB situation is going to be. I don't just want RGIII to get the job without showing that he is indeed our best chance at winning. I think he's our best option right now, but if Cousins shows he's the superior option, let him play, if not Rg3 can prove himself.   Not his best, but still one of my favorites is The Aviator. Great performance by Leo and defiantly was of his more underrated gems.      *peanut butter and jealous   Lol......I don't get it  Edit: Fuck maybe I should read the title next time I'm in a thread   Andy Serkis was wayyy better in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Lord of the Rings than Dawn, this certainly wasn't the movie to win him the Oscar.   Huh I feel there is one more classic movie not on that list..... Speaking of which I could go for some orange juice right about now  	32
    I think we got them at wal-mart. The brand is Chuck-It. They last forever and are a smaller size so they fit in our small dogs mouths better. You can also get bigger ones. There awesome. They never seem to loose these ones out off all there other toys they have.   same here. My two Jacks each have one and they are the only ones still standing. This one is the same way, she will put the ball on any part of my body so she knows I can feel it. She likes to put it up against my lower back when I'm sitting because she knows it drives me crazy and I will keep throwing it. It amazes me how smart this breed is!   I'm so happy that she had a positive effect on your evening. They say having a pet (or in this case an adorable picture) can lower stress levels, blood pressure and related illnesses. I hope tomorrow goes smother for you! Deep breaths..            I actually posted a few picks of splatter from this in the Art Sub. and everyone was so fucking mean to me. Calling me an idiot, gay, my 2 year old can paint better than this. just mean shit. Thanks for the kind words.   your pretty close. I try to keep my good gear away from stuff like this so it dosnt get ruined.   Never took a video of that. I really should have but the snow is mostly gone where I live and Its back to being a regular bandit again anyways.

Its come a long way since these pics were taken. I just haven't seen him for awhile.         Thats a fuckin samsquamch   Maybe that has to do with what kind of opiates you use. I know different types have different itch levels (with me at least). May I ask what you use primarily?    That actually sounds like it would do the trick. You have a dog im guessing? or did your teeth itch too one night?   I broke my head cherry at a bed bath and beyond... There. I said it.   Mines called a bear claw. It puts rolling on the floor and itching your back on a corner to shame.   well, I was entertained.   Yea for sure. The jeweler that cut it off said to wait a few weeks until her finger is normal again. Then she can have it fixed and sized.    That's a great story. Sad she didn't get to wear a ring for so long. That's what my wife's ring is made out of, white gold. Damn that thing was expensive but I love her and I think its her all time favorite thing. She is sad she has to wait a few weeks for the swelling to go down before she can get it fixed and sized. She defiantly couldn't wait 40 years haha.    It is REALLY dull but its so dull that it is perfectly flat because its basically been sanded down overtime moving over mirrors. Even with new razors it leaves little streaks where the new razor isn't perfectly flat.      I shall name it... The bat razor. Making lines and fighting crimes.      Heres an update! We ended up going to the jewely store today. Got the ring cut off professionally and it can now be repaired and sized. [HERES](http://i.imgur.com/72R5CHd.jpg) a pic of the ring.

And one of her [FINGER](http://i.imgur.com/VeWTRWW.jpg)   Who does this 30 minute shipping? Amazon? Are you telling me you can buy stuff online and have it shipped to your house in under and hour? teach me! Tell me! I bet its expensive tho   Yea that's what were going to do. Unless the swelling doesn't go down in the next hour I will be taking her to the ER.   If they cut the ring off at the ER do you think the ring can still be sized and come out of it looking fine? or does it really screw it up. She has 3 expensive rings soldered together and She wont do anything that will screw up the ring permanently unlessl she was gonna loose a finger or something. Its not bad like that tho.    Well the swelling went down yesterday after we tried just pulling it off with dish soap. The swelling went down that night then tonight we tried the Floss trick and that almost worked but it made her finger swell up even worse. But we will take your advice tho. If it goes numb, looses feeling, or stays swelled we will go to the ER. Thanks for the help!   This is actually what caused her finger to swell like it is. We thought the trick looked like it would work awesome but didn't work that great. Now her finger is swelled like in the picture. Were gonna wait to do anything until the swelling goes down   We will go to the jewerly store tomorrow and see if they can do it first before I buy a cutter on amazon. Its not like this happens enough to need to own one. Thanks for the info tho!   This is what we will most likely end up doing. She needs it re-sized anyway. Her finger has feeling and is fine but thats the kind of advice I wanted. Thanks   she is not loosing feeling, we tried yesturday and it got swollen then too.    Yea no luck. Its swollen because we tried the trick with dental floss and it didnt work.        	46

 Turner Classic Movies screened Soylent Green last night, and I watched it on the DVR this morning. For anyone who has not seen it, it is a dystopian film made in 1973, starring Charlton Heston and in his final performance, Edward G. Robinson. The setting is New York City in 2042, a decaying megalopolis of 40 million impoverished inhabitants, who endure near starvation, heat waves, failing infrastructure and a corrupt leadership. They have so plundered and toxified the planet that the oceans plankton is dying. Those who believe in the Techno-cornucopia have often ridiculed the prophecy of this iconic film. While Manhattan may not resemble this scenario in the coming years, it does seem prescient of the Karachi or Kinshasa of the near future. As in the film, our desperate leaders are herding the worlds peasant farmers into such mega-slums, this being the most expedient means of boosting food production. Their concentration also enhances political control  a rural insurgency has great advantages over an urban one. A claim has emerged that only through intense urbanization can we lower the per capita ecological footprint of humanity, but this is just another cynical, ideological fraud.  And do remember: Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.    Back in 1995, Joel E. Cohen, a mathematical biologist, published How Many People Can the Earth Support?, a survey of the estimates for the global carrying capacity of humanity. I recall there were a couple of dozen estimates, ranging from one billion to a hundred billion inhabitants, but that median value was about six billion. That was close to the total population of that time, and it does appear that we have spent the intervening decades in overshoot and may see a dramatic crash in this century. As for the faring into space, I fear that opportunity may have past. I dug old paperback from out from a bookshelf, a 1989 reprint of Gerard K-ONeals The High Frontier, Human Colonies in Space. A physicist at Princeton, ONeal presented a pathway to a self-sustaining space civilization, his answer to the Limits to Growth paradigm. Though his blueprint seemed feasible with the technology of 1976, alas, we can no longer put a man on the moon, and several approaching deadlines may converge before we can recover that capability.   Sparrows peck at me, and I must respond. Information technology has cut deeps ruts in the American economy. IT is essential for the management of long supply chains, and as much as Amazon, Walmart is dependent upon it. Both have driven price destruction in consumer goods and driven the manufacture of such offshore. In a lengthy conflict with China, we would have to surrender for lack of underpants. Yes, high sparrow, I am another hard luck, Enemy of the Future. Allow me a few questions, so you might edify my aging brain. What is your measure of efficiency? For the overall economy, the great, promised gains in productivity have yet to appear, and a lower price may sloughed off greater costs to the community or environment  for the definition of an externality, see the entire nation of China. We once viewed gypsy cabbing or renting a spare bedroom to a stranger as acts of financial desperation, rather than a quest for efficiency, and for all of their cost destruction, how many of these digitizing companies are showing a commensurate profit? What is unskilled labor? The current claim is that managerial and professional classes will feel the most impact from automation and digitization (and do you consider all entertainers to be unskilled?), with janitors, manicurists and dog walkers spared into the more distant, robotic future. Trainable labor  in your Utopia, will no one require training? Yes, information (buzzword) is in infinite supply, which only means that most of that buzzing confusion has no value. Who designed this economy, or does it evolve, and what discrepancies have economists ever resolved?  My real concern is that we are accelerating the obsolescence of tangible things in this grubbing quest for digital efficiency. In a world where all resources are diminishing (sorry, even a terabyte of information may not fill an empty stomach), constructs of bricks and mortar, or flesh and blood, may not be so easy to replace once they have been discarded.     I must agree. The article quotes from David Roberts recent Vox piece (The awful truth) that slowing the accumulation of greenhouse gases would require an utterly unprecedented level of global mobilization and coordination, sustained over decades. Well, the present global leadership can only coordinate on a single project, one they have diligently pursued for decades  to engineer a complete collapse of the financial system. That approaching failure offers a dim and slim pathway to human survival. Any financial collapse will lead to sharp fall in trade, employment and perceived wealth. Should the plutocratic elites fail to restore a quick prosperity, their flocks of citizen-consumers may stampede and trample them under. A long and violent period of chaos could permit a novel form of government to arise and assume the keys to power. However egalitarian or inclusive, this must be a militant and totalitarian movement, capable of doing whatever is necessary to kick hapless humanity along the hard path to survival. Please, can anyone offer a more peaceful, democratic and voluntary solution to our existential crisis?     Is there a point at which creative destruction becomes simply destructive? Joseph Schumpeter theorized in times when technological advances could deliver great gains in quality-of-life to the broadest population. Much of this accelerating digital disruption seems only the churn the economy without any significant social gains. Does Uber raise the earning potential of cabbies? Has the public gained a better access to dependable, hired transportation? Those questions are unresolved, with the only certainty being that Uber is transferring the grossly inflated value of taxicab medallions to speculative price of its traded stock. Schumpeter mused on creative destruction while most of the physical resources of this planet remained in a potential state  those opportunities are closing at an exponential rate. As we continue to shutter factories, vacate shopping malls, and expose the skill sets of swathes of the working population to a near instantaneous devaluation, how much irreplaceable capital, both fixed and human, are we destroying in pursuit of digital disruption?   I agree with shroom. It appears that socialism has been the pathway to the most radical form of capitalism, that is, state builds means of production (always as great social cost), then the neo-capitalist ruling class assumes personal ownership. This has occurred in all Communist countries, in other developing countries, and in developed countries (UK is good example). Marxism has been stood on its head!   Perhaps the most convincing marker for the beginning of the Anthropocene will be a lengthy postponement in the return of the glaciers. Over the past 900,000, wide spread glaciations have occurred in a fairly regular cycle: Over its current Ice Age, the Northern Hemisphere typically has a sheath of ice for 100,000 years, with intervals of melting that can be as brief as ten millennia. We would expect this present interglacial to be nearing its end, in the absence of the greenhouse warming our civilizations have produced. The paleo-climatologist William Ruddiman proposed there is evidence that we have already done so.   For the lay public, he presented his hypothesis in a short 2005 book titled Plows, Plagues and Petroleum. He drew attention to the correlation between the historic rise in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane, respectively, by the cutting and burning of forests for agriculture and the domestication of rice, (the flooded paddies produce significant methane). Under the Plow, the Earth remained relatively warm into medieval times.  The article under comment cites the Orbis spike, a significant drop in atmospheric carbon seen after 1492. This resulted from the regrowth of forests in the Western Hemispheric, following the collapse of the Indigenous civilizations from Old World diseases. Ruddiman made the same attribution, but coupled it to the prior devastation visited on Eurasian civilizations by the Black Death  there too, forests retook idled croplands and pastures. By lowering the concentration of greenhouse gasses, Ruddiman contended these Plagues fostered a lowering of global temperatures, the Little Ice Age. Evidence of a nascent glaciation appeared in the region of Hudson Bay.  Finally, Petroleum arrived, and warming abruptly resumed. Ruddiman expected that we would burn all readily accessible fossil fuels, which could abort the return of the Ice until the nadir of the Milankovich orbital cycles. The impact on the geological record will be indisputable. Of course, if that occurs, we should not expect the survival of geologists to note it.   	7
 Then watch netflix and cuddle with your dog! And don't say you are a burden. You are not a burden. You are good enough. You don't owe anyone anything. You can get groceries or job hunt when you feel up to it but you are going through a really rough time and you are completely justified in just taking a time out. Does someone with an awful fever say they are a burden when they are lying at home? No. Depression and anxiety are mental diseases. Therefore if you are suffering from them, you are no more being a "burden" than you would be if you had the flu or a broken leg.   You have to understand that it's not your fault that this has happened to you and you should NEVER feel guilty about not doing mundane tasks because you feel this way. It doesn't matter what anyone else says you should do. Concentrate on the over-riding problem at hand rather than tasks like shopping or job hunting which take an infinitely less priority than your well-being.    I think you need to take a day off just to relax. Hide under some blankets and watch a tv show/film that you like, meditate, take a hot bath, just do anything that you know will relax you. When your fiance gets home tell him how you've been feeling and ask him to be with you. You don't have to talk about it or anything but I think you could use the company. It's rough being alone at times like this. I hope I've made you feel at least a little bit better. :)    No problem. What do you like doing to relax? Any tv shows or books you're into at the moment?   And tell me how it goes.   That's okay. If you can, go grab a big glass of water and drink all of it. After that, fill it again and come back to the computer. You should absolutely call your parents if you feel terrible. The fact that they are on vacation shouldn't stop you from doing that. If they knew you were feeling bad they would want you to tell them.    Do you have any friends or family you could call right now to talk to and tell them how you feel? If you keep stuff like this bottled up to yourself it can literally drive you insane and it doesn't need to be that difficult. It feels so good to talk about it. Literally call someone who you know will listen, and just let it out. Cry if you need to. Get someone to come round and just open up. If you feel comfortable, talk to your fiance but if not thats fine. If you have no one to talk to, I'm not going anywhere.   Okay. Firstly, you have to understand that the state you are in right now is not permanent. You haven't slipped in to a point of no return where you can never feel good again because that simply isn't how depression and anxiety work. This is merely a phase and you will get through it. Its really good that you have already tried to conquer these issues by seeing a psychiatrist so well done! I can't imagine how tough it has been for you this past week but it is going to be okay! have you told your psychiatrist about how you've been feeling recently and is there a way you can get in to contact with them now?   It's more than likely that you are just suffering from anxiety. Feeling disorientated and things like that are text book symptoms of becoming over-stressed. Have you ever been to a doctor to talk about how you feel? Are you on meds or anything?   That really sucks man :( Im sorry to hear about all that stuff. But first things first. Things like your house being dirty do not matter at the moment. Discard any worry about things like that. Prioritise your mental well-being. So have you felt dizzy for a while or is this a recent thing?   Kali. That's a really nice name. So whats the problem? Why are you feeling so down at the moment?    Hey! Thanks so much for responding to me. I really wanna talk to you. I wanna make you feel better. My names Isaac, what's yours?   	11
 Being the object of desire.   Peggle   Plants vs Zombies   When discussing religion with someone, and being told I was going to hell for being an atheist, the person followed up with "I wish I didn't believe that."   Depends if said ex boyfriend still has feelings for said girl.    I personally would never think negatively about it. Hell, if anything, it'd be a turn on for me. All these guys wanting a girl, and I'm the only one who has a chance with her.   God bless America!!!   You couldn't pay me to blow that off.   Guardians of the Galaxy   I know the djs name.

I'll bet the subtitles were straightened out during a library update.   Interesting.  I wonder if a forced rescan of your library would sort it all out.      "Plex Media Scanner.exe" --scan --refresh   With Filebot, use the "-get-subtitles" switch with the "-lang" switch. Also use "-type srt" if you are using SubRip subtitles. Filebot will use the medianame you search against, and append ".lang.srt" to the end of the subtitle file it downloads.  Here are the basics for the command-line:      filebot.exe -get-subtitles "medianame" --lang eng --output srt   ...it was a quote from Chappelle's Show.   And you know what the most dope thing about "skeet" is? White people don't know what it means yet. When they figure it out, they're going to be like, "My God, what have we done?"   "seizure" is interchangeable with involuntary convulsions or spasming.  under these circumstances, a form of a seizure is exactly what is happening.   More like casualties of jrjr, amirite?   Nor for me.  No reportable issues over the last 24 hours.   So weird, as I am seeing the opposite on other clients (instead of seeing the 3-letter sub language, its only seeing a 2-letter sub language).  I can't imagine wtf is going on, but its hella annoying.  AFAIK, the SubRip format (.srt) uses 3-letter language codes.  Its unofficial, but a generally observed practice.  When I download subs (with Filebot for example), the subs are named with a 3-letter language code.   /r/shitImissed   I couldnt say.  I've always used 3-letter language designations.  Which client are you using?  I've had 2/3 letter issues with certain Plex clients before.   I thought that subtitles use the ISO 3-letter standard.  .en = .eng   This is how most scrapers handle specials; in "Season[ ?]00".   This reminds me of a Die Hard movie plot.

I hope this is current.   That the radar gun was capable of accurately measuring his car at that speed.  Some people think that a radar gun is inaccurate over certain speeds and/or there is something special about *their car at high speeds* that will cause inaccuracies.   this informs me of very little useful information.   The speed.  Its much much safer to perform a speed test of this magnitude on a professional track of some sort:  very long straight, with higher quality grading (flatness).   As soon as I saw it, I got some heavy 80's flashbacks.  * Still acid after all these years... *   porque no los dos?   Yea, I get that.  But its a tire that is performing the uppercut here.  Sagat's move is "Taigaa Appaakatto".  Japanese for tire is "taiya".   Yea, I cant deny that may have been a part of the same for me with too much expectation buildup.  But then ago, there is always substance lost when you throw in multiple good/bad guys without significant character development.  Its the achilles heal of these kinds of movies.         WOOSH   Thats very interesting if the bug turns out to be Florida-specific.  Maybe a word should go out to all Florida subscribers.   interesting.  which state are being billed from?   As per the youtube description, this is a part of the *Directors Cut* commentary track.   I updated my post with additional references to explain.  'Taiya Appaakatto' is Japanese for 'Tire Uppercut'.  Its a play on words of Sagat's "Taigaa Appaakatto" (Tiger Uppercut).   No.  This is a play on Sagat's "Taigaa Appaakatto" (Tiger Uppercut).   "Taiya" is how the Japanese say "tire".    ---- references:  1. http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Tiger_Uppercut 1. https://www.google.com/search? q=how+to+say+tire+in+japanese   I'm guessing a bug bite spooked it?

 I've noticed a lot of posts along the lines of "Don't be this guy" and a post of a member of the master race being a jerk/keeping peasants from ascending.  I think we should get a post flair for this as it seems to be becoming more and more prevalent.  Anyone agree with me?.   And what's the oldest one still in use?   Nothing wastes water like american fat-asses!    No.   Now I'm slightly cleaner.   Lets play a game. Do this against someone threatening you. And see how many holes you can get and how many limbs you can lose.   Well, you gotta make a "byeah"-ing sound. You really have go "byeah" from deep in your byeah.   Shhhhh. Don't tell him.

This is what I got.  http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Warping  Hoo boy, the ability to warp the powers of most super heroes would mean I could simply make them into normal humans. I believe this power would also let me increase my own strength; meaning i'd probably just make myself incredibly strong and make my enemies weaker than myself. I imagine it'd be a bit like a soul suck ability.  http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Interface_Creation  This is pretty boring. I'm not sure if i'd use it in a battle honestly. It may be useful to give myself some sort of HUD. An optical overlay with stuff like a tracking system would be useful for mid-combat.  http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Multi_Strike  This would be pretty fun. Finish off my opponents this way. If I were to decrease my enemies strength and raise my own then this would probably be my way of manually fighting them. I'd not be able to resist shouting "Ahtatatatata" while I did it though.  I that with the first power alone I could oneshot beings like superman. Against god-like beings it may be more difficult but presumably I could use my powers on them too.   Anal.   /r/whowouldwin    that was a nice koshi-guruma at 2:30.   Budget.   [ITT](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/762/617/649.gif)   I just don't see what you mean. If you need an example of early story telling look up ZORK, The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, Adventure, Day of thr tentacle, or any other early text based game. Many of them came out before the NES era.  Or look at the sierra games, they also focused quite a bit on story and many came out before the first super mario bros.  All I'm saying is that story has always been a major part of gaming.   And which game suddenly started caring about story that all other games before it lacked?   That's an excellent point. I suppose I should change my answer to include whatever was the first game to include saving to whatever they used when such a game came out.  But the reason I picked legend of zelda and battery saving as my example was because it's semi-well known that zelda introduced battery saving and was more relate-ible for most people in the thread.   Battery saving. Before they put batteries in cartridges it was impossible to save any data and you had to use something like a password system. With the introduction the first legend of zelda all that changed. It saved your progress and meant games could go from one repetitive task capable of repeating infinitely and meant for a single round to be over in one sitting to large, epic games.  Do you think stuff like skyrim, deus ex, civ, or bioshock could exist without saving?   I don't mean martial arts that grant super speed, strength, sense, Etc. But rather are there any martial arts that use pressure points as their main way of combat? I know many martial arts use pressure points but only at the more advanced level and as more of a side to the main technique. But are there any martial arts that use pressure point almost exclusively?   Oh shit! sorry man. This is why I shouldn't assume stuff.   The real way to do this is VM one of the older windows versions and then run it in that.   What's it like? Not having killed six million jews?   Funfact: This was me learning of the new rules.

 He's said he's going to graduate in June and no information has come to light refuting that, so at this point yeah.    Except he's graduating in June.

There was an understanding that Josh would not be welcomed back to the team, so they spent that time trying to work it out. This is how it eventually got worked out.   It's not the organization's fault, but their response was "Screw you for relapsing, you can't play." It was not at all an assessment of his ability to play. It was Arte saying "You will not play for us anymore."   How long do you think it would take him to put out each serialized part? Gotta be like at least 9 months.   I see what you're saying, absolutely. I just view it as a telescoping serialization, rather than the end of serialization. Although I buy your argument.   As a whole, you could look at the increasing popularity of series of novels as the next step in serialization. Where before we split up the same (long) book into parts, now we break up the same long series into novels.  In terms of a serialized novel, it'd have to be long enough to support the serialization, but I could imagine a scenario in which it works. I could definitely imagine something like the next Song of Ice and Fire book being serialized to great acclaim, if GRRM decided he wanted to (which there's no way in hell he will).   Extended spring training is considered an insult, compared to a rehab stint in the minors. At least, that's how Hamilton took it. In his eyes he's been ready to play.   Angels refused to let him play. He wanted to play.   Baseball players get paid to play. You pay them varying amounts based on the level you hope they produce at, but they get paid to play.   I disagree that Netflix and Hulu means the end of serialization. I'd argue the exact opposite. Netflix IS the new serialization. Look at how they release all their original content: a season at a time. Which people watch in rapid succession and then wait eagerly for the next one.  That's serialization.   *Infinite Jest* did that for me   [Tongariro by Milorad Pejic.](https://www.guernicamag.com/poetry/tongariro/)  Wish he was more widely available in English.   Haha I did, don't worry. You didn't say anything substantively different, unless you mean it's your opinion that Arte shouldn't be involved in player transactions. Which doesn't change the fact that that's not at all what happened here, and it's foolish to pretend like it did.    Angels weren't going to get anything for Hamilton because everyone knew how badly Arte wanted him gone. We had absolutely no leverage.   Arte is the only reason we signed Hamilton, and he's the only reason we traded him for nothing. Arte and his ego.  So no, we can't leave Arte up in the owner's box. This conversation begins and ends with him.   He didn't want to go to extended spring training. I haven't heard about him refusing to go on a rehab assignment in the minors..source?   He worked his ass off, it didn't work out. He definitely could've been a productive member of our team this year. Worth the money? Almost assuredly not. But we ran him out of town cuz our feelings got hurt that he wasn't performing.   I particularly enjoy the part of all this where Angels fans like to pretend Hamilton wasn't hurt all last year.  Never been so ashamed to be an Angels fan in my life. Our organization treated him horribly.   Major Major Major Major is amazing.   *Tiny Beautiful Things* really pulled me out of a bad time.   I'm really excited for *Slade House* by David Mitchell. Wasn't expecting new work from him so quickly.   Wilde was an arrogant asshat for much of his life, but you should check out *De Profundis*. He wrote it after he'd been brought low by life, and it's an incredible read.   http://upword.com/wilde/de_profundis.html   His BABIP was high in part because he was crushing the ball, but yeah, it was gonna come down. I mean the dude was hitting well over .400, it would've been bananas if he didn't.   Beginning of last season, before he injured his thumb, he was looking really really good.   This. This this this this. This is honestly the lowest point of Angels fandom for me, ever.   Not novels strictly speaking, but a lot of Hemingway's short fiction and nonfiction is really good. *Death in the Afternoon*, *A Moveable Feast* (although you could argue that this is fictionalized) are both really good in my opinion.   "The time seems simpler than today, but mostly because the past always seems simpler when its wars are done." -*The Boys of Summer* by Roger Kahn  Oh I could do this all day.   In that vein, I find his nonfiction to be wonderful. *A Man Without A Country* and *Palm Sunday* are both great, quick, whimsical reads.   Basically Fitzgerald's stuff that's not Gatsby   That was after this: http://m.mlb.com/video/v33537087/cwslaa-trout-ties-game-with-grand-slam-off-sale  Yes I was just looking for a reason to watch it again.   That was the second thing I realized.   So stoked to watch him play this year. Oklahoma can be really really good.   Hahaha I was about to text this to you and then I read the username.   I think it was a risk we needed to take. This was Howie's last year under contract, and we'd made it clear that we weren't going to resign him. Heaney, on the other hand, is a high-ceiling starting pitching prospect, which is by far the weakest position in the organization. He broke camp in AAA, but he will be in the majors before too long if he keeps progressing. We just have options in the rotation for the first time in a long time, which is awesome for us.  Howie was a fan favorite, and it sucked to see him go, but Heaney has a chance to be a key rotation cog for years. With Weaver and Wilson starting to be on the way out, Heaney will get a shot.   I wish I knew. We've had some terrible BABIP and RISP luck, but the offense will come around. But the middle of our bullpen has been awful, and our rotation has been very, very meh. We just got back Richards from his knee injury, so hopefully he can adjust and settle in. Shoemaker had his first bad start in forever on Monday, and now he's on the bereavement list. Wilson has shown flashes of pretty good and really bad. Weaver had his first solid outing of the year last night, but the bullpen took it and set it on fire.  Basically, I think we'll be fine if we can get the pen sorted out. We have most of what was a really good bullpen last year, and I think our rotation can surprise people. Just not clicking yet. We tend to do this in April. Last year was our best April in awhile, and we finished the month at .500.   Their salaries are very much lower than what rookies make in other leagues, but with the bonuses, the money is there, and for a larger pool of players than in the other sports. Good on you for waiting to research to respond though, there's always things that we don't know and that's a good look.  The Harris poll methodology is a good representation of the current state of affairs, but no one under age 30 was polled. Where the NBA is making big gains is in the younger demographics. Those will take awhile to show up throughout the rest of the population, but in terms of predictors of future success, being popular with the under-30 demographic is a pretty strong one.  And the Bleacher Report thing doesn't have anything that shows a decline in popularity. It's just a think piece about what that dude thinks is wrong with today's NBA.   You mean lowest   Bryce Dejean-Jones was kinda bad last year.   Well let's pick apart just a couple of the things you said wrong.  Baseball is the only professional sport in America where you can make millions of dollars directly out of high school. High school kids get drafted in the top of the first round and sign for multimillion dollar bonuses often. Of the first 74 players picked last year, 2 didn't sign (including the number 1 overall pick, cuz he turned down a $5 million bonus after it was reduced from $6.5 million as a result of his physical); so out of the 72 that did, only 9 did not receive a 7 figure bonus. And the lowest of the bonuses was $546,100. So it's actually the quickest "get rich quick sport".  NBA popularity has not fallen off the table; it's rapidly rising in popularity. I really have no idea where you're drawing that conclusion from. Baseball is still more popular, but the NBA is coming.     1984.   It was decently hard hit. Still close to him. Not a bad play, just not showing off any spectacular range.   Into the Wild shows both sides in an honest way. Which is why I think that book causes so much controversy between people who come down on one side or the other. It's like, nah man, the wonder of these things here is the tension between them.   Downvote the man all you want, he's right. That ball was not very far away.   Brendan Ryan was the best.      Jon Krakauer is awesome. He really drives at the intersection between modern humanity and nature in a lot of his writing I think.  John Muir's writing is incredible too. *My First Summer in the Sierras* in particular comes to mind.   Glad someone said this. Book is infuriating.   Yeah I feel like the only one out there! The weird thing about it is that I'm a really generous reader usually (I don't dislike much). I feel like I seriously just had to have missed the entire thing haha.   *To Kill A Mockingbird* for me. That book just never came alive to me, I really don't know what it was. I will eventually give it another shot and see if I was just in a bad mood when I initially read it.   Roster struggling last year? We had the best record in baseball.  Look I want us to win as much as the next guy. But deep breaths. It's been 13 games. Not even 10% of the season.   That commitment is conditional; the consequences of breaking that commitment are that he doesn't get a scholarship to attend Buffalo and play basketball there anymore. That's it. That's all. End of story.   Lol that's a false comparison. Evans is doing nothing that many other players whose coaches left are doing. I agree that he hasn't necessarily handled it the best by tweeting about it, but no one in this situation has.  The precedent in this extremely-precedented situation is to block conference opponents and out-of-conference rivals, if any. That is the de-facto reasonable limitation, as determined by **the rest of the country**. By blocking more than that, you are being unreasonable, by definition. Especially considering the schools you blocked are his best options, and the places he is most likely to transfer to: where the coach he considers a father figure now works, and the two schools closest to his home.  I'd have preferred if Hurley stayed at Buffalo; I was excited to see what you guys could do with him going forward. But it happened, and acting like this in the aftermath is childish.    It's gotta be particularly egregious. That slide is akin to a dude realizing right after he did it that it was not the right play. Gets a yellow all the time.   This was my thought. I didn't realize no one knew who he was   Takeout slide was intentional, but not the injury, which is what you're mad about.   That was a yellow card slide, not a red.   Yost was quoting/paraphrasing Herrera when he said that. Yost says that's what Herrera was saying in the post-ejection shenanigans while he was pointing at his head. Yost wasn't offering that as his own thoughts on the matter.    I stand corrected in saying that he was there because of Hurley. However, Hurley did coach the two seasons he played for you, and he has referred to him publicly as a father figure.  Just because the rules allow you to do it doesn't mean it's fair at all. I'm having a hard time grasping the idea that someone actually believes that because the NCAA says it's okay, there's obviously nothing wrong with it.  He implied that, but until he has some evidence, that's all he's doing.  I know, I'm glad they lifted the blocks. Cuz it's inane to think that you should be able to control someone else's life in this manner. Sadly, the only reason they lifted the blocks is because they realized how bad it looks, not because they actually feel they were in the wrong.   The comments on that youtube video...like I know it's youtube comments but I still can't fathom those responses.   See the assumption there is that you control the player, and it's faulty as hell. The player does not have to do what you want him to. You are not "handing [Hurley] our second best player". Evans gets to decide what's best for him, not you. You do not control him, and it's petty, immature, and flat out wrong to try and block him from pursuing what he feels is his next best step. Chances are, he was only at Buffalo because of Hurley anyway. So when he leaves, you just get to control him? Bullshit.   Nah cuz the Angels hat only has the A on it. The A's hat has the AS that you need to start ASSHAT. If the A's and Angels switched (woo let's do that yes!), it would spell ASHAST   No. This was already a silly situation before that happened. Lawrie was out of line, made a dangerous slide, and got beaned for it. It happens, Lawrie was fine with it, tried to apologize for it (but did or didn't depending on who you believe). It should've been done there.  It's making a big deal out of Cain getting hit in the foot that started the merry go round again.   I get that you guys are angry about getting hit by so many pitches, but it's really, really not about you. There seems to be this weird narrative that everyone is beaning you because they don't respect you. That's just not true. There is no concerted effort by the rest of the league to bean your team.  I'm not saying you can't be angry; you should be frustrated. It's been terrible luck. But y'all need to realize that no one cares if you feel disrespected, 'cause that's something that's entirely in your own heads. What people do care about, though, is throwing high-90s fastballs behind people's heads.   Thanks for sharing the link   I found a lot of really interesting parallels between *On The Road* and *Fight Club*, which I know sounds like the most obnoxious combo of all time to a lot of you. I'd read both before, was revisiting, and in conversation with each other you can pick up on a lot of subtext that tends to fly below the radar.   Those kids are just as much at risk now.   Also, Alan Lightman would be a good person to check out.   Anything by Oliver Sacks. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* is a good place to start.   He was definitively out. You can see the glove hit Castellanos' foot.   I'd donate.   I feel the same way about being active during the day. Just started an office job and not sure I'm cut out for it. Thanks!   He's technically not disagreeing there haha. If anything he's agreeing.   Yeah I'm fine with the way it went down. Winslow is obviously amazing, and I wouldn't have had a problem with his inclusion, but there is a case to be made for leaving him off. Obviously to the voters, it was a compelling one.   Echoes of the 2011 ALCS   Where is Finnegan in that mix? The pen?   How'd you get into lifting freight? What do you think of it?   Seriously, I do this all the time.  Best find would have to be Kenzaburo Oe *Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness* because I'd never have expected to be able to find that book anywhere in San Diego, let alone at the Goodwill.  Either that, or the time I found an Environmental Ethics textbook I'd used in one of my courses a couple years back, bought for a dollar, then took to the campus bookstore and resold for 30 haha.   The day that happens, you be sure and let me know.   Race consciousness is different from racial discrimination. But that's something a lot of America doesn't understand at the moment.   Far be it from me. Statistics show that this team only wins World Series Championships when we suck in April. So I'm on the short-term Tank Train   Yankees do the same thing by getting a bunch of lefty mashers to take advantage of the short porch in right. Angels do the same thing by getting a bunch of fly ball pitchers whose stuff will play well in big old Angels Stadium.   We've won 2 out of 3 series lol, we just happened to get swept in the one we lost.   Also, Joyce 2-for-3 with 2 BBs..that's more like it.   Ah gotcha. Good to know   Didn't realize the game was only 7 innings long. They do that at lower levels?   Hits with RISP? I don't know what to do with this   Congrats to both of you! /u/stuckinthepow too. It's a big deal to finish   When Hector's not walking people he's a whole nother animal   I love Thoreau, but I think that quote is just indicative of how this isn't some new phenomenon; people have been saying the same thing in slightly different terms forever.   Seemed like he was getting quite a few downvotes before the edit.   Yeah, his edit is kinda obnoxious, but he doesn't deserve to be downvoted off his original comment IMO.      I would think your word would be "Father", but I guess not haha  	92
 Yeah sorry once again that was not clear. The "you" was in reference to Reddit admins and have no morality was in reference  to their policies on censoring in how ironic it was that the ceo of reddit would give coon town a pass because they don't brigade but support the banning of FPH.   I'm really sorry if you misconstrued my post as an attack on you, i did not remotely mean it to be directed at you, it was horribly worded but if you continue to be a disrespectful individual i will be very clear so you will understand when i am directing vitriol at you. I suggest you calm down before you get more upset in this conversation turns from misunderstanding to a extremely negative exchange. Have a nice day.    Sorry i was being rhetorical in reference to Reddit and it's moderators/admins being idiots. In the pedophile reference was to a front page post about Germany providing therapy to pedophiles in how the entire comment section was a bunch of pity post saying how pedo's were not bad people and got a bad rep in some other crap, basically a circle jerk of pedo supporters. In no i was not referring to you personally stating this, i was referring to how the new ceo of reddit officially gave them a pass.      Alright can you point me to some of these NGO's?  Well Kurdistan is not in existence yet, we're effectively referring to Iraqi Kurdistan and only Iraqi Kurdistan. You can't declare them as the only representatives of the Kurdish people, theirs PKK,PDKI,PUK,Gorran Movement,Yekiti,azadi,pyd etc all of which have their own various ideals.  Even bloody KIU is pretty moderate in their views to an Islamic kurdistan. True but theirs a much better chance of him getting released then in say Iran, Gaza or the gulf. Listen i understand the Kurd's are not perfect, neither is america but they're open to dialogue and change. There are progressive elements that can bring about this change.    Ha i think it balances it out. Besides if we're going into all the f'ed up crap Christians did to jews throughout the centuries their would not be enough payback in the world. Lets just keep it simple and forgive.    Starwars republic commando, say what you will about consoles but that was one of the most graphically beautiful games i have ever played. One of the best looking in that generation and funnest game play experience i ever had. Nothing beat taking over a confederate ship and firing upon another with the hacked cannons while fighting off super battle-droids. PLUS I MUST FIND SEV!!!   Welp  either people are blind or the comments maybe collapse after being deleted? hold on let me try in screenshot something for you.    Not just sample bias i'm aware theirs even a sizable number of kurds fighting for isis. I believe the commander who laid siege to kobani was a kurd, but i'm an american my view is effeminately colored by my own personal experiences and a generally held view by most Zionist and supporters of Israel along with the news stories and other tidbits i hear coming from kurds.   But i'm more then willing to hear more information concerning them. Not going to lie i have a romanticized opinion of the kurds, it's hard not to like the underdog perspective. I read the yousef post, you have allot of links i will try to read more of them later(also no offense but i'm not exactly a fan of al jazeera, while some of their articles are pretty informative the bias kills, granted all media is bias so better to read between the lines other people might reject them just for being al jazeera )  While i disagree with them for arresting the guy heavily he is not being executed. In honestly that's my criteria when it comes to rather or not a country is really embracing of democratic ideals. I know that it's horrid to arrest someone for their religious beliefs or not holding anyway but compared to other examples of those who blasphemy islam i think this is a pretty moderate approach that hopefully will be utterly reverse with more people writing in.   Also to be clear i mean't the kurdish people, not the government or the political parties, the kurds are in a transition phase so their government may not be the best or even ok i believe in the people theirs a higher chance at secularism then other parts of the region.     Aww they screwed up then. Allot of east Jerusalem Arabs did the same hoping that when Palestine came into being they would just be able take up that citizenship. I read a story as the peace process has stalled a number of east Jerusalemites have begun taking up a offer by israel to become citizens, in part to make sure if they leave Jerusalem they won't lose residency.   If abbas and netanyahu can ever get their heads out of their collective ass and get some kind of plan to restart talks, it would be hilarious if abbass seeds israel full ownership of jerusalem. It would be like the people waiting for dukenukem for all those years just to be dissapointed but hopefully it works out. Splitting a city between 2 countries is a recipe for war.    Nah i get you. I'm a fan of rommel, but too many people confuse nazi with regular while trying to dispel the myth that every German was a nazi. It's always funny when someone tries to post a thoughtful comment about how not all nazi's hated jews or tried to exterminate them when that was their sole purpose, but yeah i'm in the same boat.  It's hard because either you come off sounding like you're excusing the nazi party or trying to justify it.    Indeed that's why he is paying it forward to other Christians.    20% of israel is actually arab and all have citizenship. Not sure about the Armenians though, but i believe so i'm just taking this off the top of my head but i remember kanye west and kim kardashian baptizing their daughter in a Armenian church so their population must be sizable. If so they probably have citizenship but i will look into it, ask some of my Jewish friends.  Edit: syriac's interesting... god there was something i read awhile back about Christians in Israel moving away from the Arab identity to become something else but i can't remember the name they decided on but the orthodox church in Israel made it official. Is their like something negative associated with being Assyrian like their is with arab in israel? the Assyrians i've met are pretty prideful.    I know the Kurd's are religious, yes it's a generalized statement but from the kurds i have talked to and met, many of them hold progressive views. While they of course have their own issues and stigma's compared to other parts of the region they're very secular. Another group of note would of course be turks but they're too nationalistic even in the face of bad leadership.      interesting factoid, in yeah i've heard of the Assyrian quarter before. Always amazed where people end up, like the circassians being in israel. Have you got any numbers on how many Assyrians are left?    Nazi refers almost exclusively to those being card holding members of the nazi political party and held ideological views similar to that of hitler. regular germans were not nazi's, while i'm sure like with mussolini their were/are a few germans who probably remiss fondly about how Hitler made the trains run on time they would still not be considered apart  of the nazi party or a Nazi, you should differentiate. Many Germans would take this extremely offensive.     I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.  He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them also, the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.  Also he is repaying a debt to those Christians who saved his life when he was a child. He's paying it forward     I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.

He's paying it forward.     This is uplifting not /r/worldnews  If you want to go on rants go to /r/rants have fun. This has nothing to do with your hatred of Israel.    Thanks for the clarifications. I always assumed due to the ruins and the simple fact that most assyrians still lived in syria that it was just the remnant of their former empire in their heartland much like turkey would be the remnant of the ottoman empire.   Edit: was not blaming this on arabs, i assumed that arabs who are the majority, since most islamized people in the middle-east are arab or self identify as arab even if they're actually berber like libyans still consider themselves arab. Also are we referring to just homeland? because i referring to all their territory historically.    I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.  He is not a super hero, he's not saying he does not give a fuck but he just can't help them all and stretching himself out would only negatively effect those he can actually help. Alawites have syria protecting them, assad is an alawite and shia have southern iraq. Christians have no allies and no friends coming to help them, no rescue.    It did actually. The prophet (PBUH) was actually married to a christian woman and that was his first wife.    Indeed. Good news though they have a assyrian channel on public broadcasting in chicago, i watch it sometimes.    No such thing as brave and rebellious nazi's you're referring to either the Wehrmacht(regular army of germany) or regular germans who were not members of the nazi party.     Not exactly. Assyrians are an ethnic group deriving from the ancient assyrian empire which controlled all of iraq, syria,lebanon and other parts of the region. Syria is basically the homeland of assyrians, i believe syria derives from Assyrian. Most syrians are muslim arabs who arrived during the islamic crusades. Assyrians have been there since the beginning but they're now a minority.    Bethel thank you, i really don't think people understand this, he's helping those being most persecuted right now. He has to keep them limited and focused.    Yeah i avoid them. Their like SRS mixed with circle jerk. But they stick to their own caves and i stick to the front page so never  the two shall meet.   Yeah the mods are doing good. Just scroll down, click on hidden comments and you will see plenty of deleted ones.    Unfortunately we have children on the thread and that's why we cannot have nice things yousef.    Once again this man is focusing on helping christians who personally helped him. I'm sure on the ground he does not have people sorting christians and non christians into seperate lines in then leaving them behind, he's simply focused on providing the most help he can while at the same time repaying those who saved his life, christians in the region are a minority much like jews were in europe, he cannot save all the muslims, trying to would be beyond his means.  It's like this, if you were living in ww2 in you knew where a death camp was, would you grab a gun and try to liberate it or help the little jewish girl you saw wandering the streets. He has recognized his limits and is focusing on doing as much good as he can with the resources he has, this is the same reason why i don't jump on the us when people say they could of bombed German rail lines to stop the trains delivering jews. I'm not in this mans shoes, we do not know what issues he's facing so we should withhold judgement.    Indeed. Maybe we should plug up that /r/gameofthrones leak?   So off topic anybody seen the movie pay it forward?    Israel secular democratic statehood which provides  humanitarian relief to even their enemies, admits the family of terrorist organizations like hamas and fatah into their territory for treatment as recently as last year. Has caused less casualties in 40 years of war with a entire region then the us and most western powers in one decade of a invasion with a third world country, saved beta israelites(ethiopian jews) throughout the 80's and 90's. Provides humanitarian relief to the world being the first in Haiti after the earth quake, helps African governments suffering from Islamic guerrilla's.  Is the only country where Arab citizens can and do vote frequently, has a supreme court, has a arab supreme court justice, Israeli Arab parties make up a third of their government. Their free speech laws are so supportive that press like haaretz that criticizes the Israeli government and organizations like btselem are frequently cited by Israeli detractors. Israel is the leading country in tech,medical and social media innovations frequently dubbed the silicon valley of the middle-east.   In i believe was one of the first countries to apply practical military technologies to defensive purposes such as with the iron dome missile defense shield But besides that i guess you can state it as a negative, all those poor children that have been killed, the genocide, apartheid and horrid starvation that cause those obesity rates which put gazans/west banks in the top ten of most obese people in the world. But eh i'm just a Zionist shill....    He's actually a german. Who has lived in england i'm assuming his whole life since that's where the kinder-transports ended up.   Replace the word debt with duty or obligation. Or just recognize debt unlike how we view something as a mandatory thing that we must pay back regardless of how we feel, the way it is stated in the article is more of a personal choice or moral code. I don't want to whittle this down to religion but theirs a tenet in the Jewish faith that states:  "Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.  Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9; Yerushalmi Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 37a."  had to google this. Despite my name religion is not my strong-suit ha but i have always found this very uplifting. I believe the Koran also has a similar passage.     Yeah the mods are here now. Scroll down to all the deleted comments. Their were a atleast a dozen or more mentioning Jewish stereotypes like all of them being bankers, making jokes about how jews never pay back debts because the're cheap or greedy etc or just one off random attacks on the man saying he is anti-muslim because he is focused on helping Christians first in some really transparent attempts to justify writing negative statements. Normally i'm all for Reddit being critical of people but i read the article a few times in jesus outside of the guy being Jewish theirs nothing to criticize the man for.  If you really feel so strongly that he(a man who is actually doing something for the people) is not doing enough they could easily find a few charities who donate and help with the refugee situation.    lolz sorry was trying to be a little humorous failed. Let me delete tha.t    Alright to all the people who are hating on this man or believing he is an islamophobe for not helping Christians either you're not reading the article or clearly taking his words out of context to purposefully attack this man. He is helping christians because it was Quakers and other christian denominations like them who funded the kinder-transports( imagine underground railroad for jews that helped thousands of Jewish children escape Nazi Germany and who later adopted the children helping raise many of them who were to become orphans as hitler's final solution became implemented) which he was extremely fortunate to have been on.  I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.  He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them along with christian's. the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.    He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians.

For years I was raised a christian, told about how heaven awaits. Neuroplastisity is my guess as to why the feeling of death is still exciting and is something i'm looking forward to after life. I know logically now that after death the chances are it's non-existence but as a habit the idea of heaven waiting for me as a reward is still there. It's sad really because of this I feel like I can't value life. Only sometimes do I intuitively understand; yes after this it's non existence ,very tragic; live your life to the fullest!. I wish those moments occurred more often. The idea of heaven or some sort of excitement for the mystery of post life won't get out of my head! :( :/   websites   Once me and a friend saw a ball of flies consisting of around 4 flies; rolling around very fast, about the speed of a bowling ball. This was at school.  Several other occasions i've encountered strange things like someone throwing a pen across the classroom and it lands in someones pocket.  I used to have a tennis ball and whenever i would get lost somehow we would re-unite over and over again. (very strange reminds me of quantum entanglement or something)  I had a paper aeroplane that I threw off a balcony and it turned around and went somewhere on the hotel roof. I said to my sister "It will return to me just like my tennis ball watch" Few minutes latter we wear a 'tang' and the plane is in the barbeque that was on the balcony.  other things: rolling a die with the same number, getting strange streaks in probability games like tactics arena I had a 1% chance of hitting an enemy that would make the difference between winning and losing, I decided to take the shot and I got it.   i hope it's possible :/ i'll keep a look out   It's really a tough situation and I want to get to an improved state.

This 53 day streak is my first streak over 7 days and I have a feeling that the saran wrap may be a contributing factor. I fear that the saran wrap could be a negative contributing factor to me getting such a high streak because I don't feel "super powers". I've been flat lining the whole time as well, no urges at all.

Special savings accounts give you a ton of more interest if you make one deposit and no withdrawals for that month. (it's a condition for those types of accounts)  ------------------------------------   I spent days doing the math trying to figure out if I would lose more or gain more if I transferred money from the special account to the term deposit since the rate is higher on the term deposit but you violate the special account rule where you can't make a withdrawal for the month.   -----------------  Today I spent ages talking with an employee, we finally did the complex maths and I was about to come to my decision of transferring it at the expense of about $200 worth of extra interest (I would lose $200 very bad idea) because of violating the withdrawal rule.  Suddenly clarity in my mind.  --------------------------------------  If I transfer money from special account 1 to my term deposit I will not get extra interest on special account 1 for that month.  I can transfer all of the remaining money from special account 1 to special account 2 which will then give me extra interest for that month thus saving my ass from flushing $200 down the toilet.  -------------------------------------  A simple solution to such a complex situation.

 This is a question that greatly interests me (specifically, nitrogen loading during dives)!  Hopefully I can give you an adequate answer, as I only recently started to dive into the appropriate literature.   All vertebrates have a reflex known as the diving response which conserves oxygen stores but it is more developed in diving air-breathing vertebrates (whales, seals, turtles, penguins, etc.).  This reflex is manifested as peripheral vasoconstriction (reduced blood flow to muscles) and bradycardia (reduced heart-rate).  Also, deeper- and longer-diving species have an increased body mass, decreased relative lung size, increased blood volume, and increased myoglobin (oxygen-binding protein found in muscle tissue) concentration, suggesting these are dive-related adaptations.

Thanks!  I've been considering going that route and I'm glad to hear it seems to be beneficial.   I'm interested in lifting, but haven't done so since I did it a few times for sports my freshman year of high school (7 years ago), so I have no idea how to even get into it (routine, technique, etc.).  Do you guys have any suggestions?  I've been going to the RPAC and doing cardio stuff 2-3 times a week for about a year, but I'd love to do something else!   Also, there are at least two distinct grey whale populations in the North Pacific.  They both feed around Alaska in the warmer months, but when it's gets colder, one group moves down to Baja and the other moves toward Japan to breed. Since this one (or two?) was found in Baja, I don't think it's mother ever went close enough to Fukushima to be affected by the radiation leak.   I saw an interview with one of the helicopter pilots a couple years ago in which he said it's against maritime law for aircraft to drop things onto ships.  I imagine that would apply to drones as well.   I've heard that 70% of the money SeaWorld makes comes directly from the captivity of orcas, so that would be an interesting question to look in to - whether or not they could afford their rescue and rehab programs without the orcas.  Even so, is the good that SeaWorld does outweighed by the problems associated with captivity?  Would people care more/less and provide more/less money to conservation if there was no SeaWorld?  It's hard to say either way.   Actually, [the United States hasn't whaled since 1927.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_the_United_States)  There was a huge uproar from locals when SeaWorld caught orcas in 1976 in Puget Sound (note, 50 years after the end of industrial whaling), so much so that the [state of Washington made it illegal to capture whales in their waters.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/cron.html)   However, I will give you that the capture of orcas in the 1960s and 1970s did change national public perception of orcas - prior to that, they were feared (much like great white sharks) and were even used as target practice by the navy.  Another thing is that these whales are not domesticated.  In fact, I would argue there are not enough captive whales to ever have domesticated population.  The wild whales that were caught were not caught because of their personalities, they were caught solely because they were the smallest.  Domestication takes many generations, much more than the 1-3 generation whales that are currently in captivity.  And the fact that orcas are much more intelligent than any domesticated animals, rivaling human cognition, now makes the prospect that much more difficult.  Also, SeaWorld has an orca in it's collection that was taken from the wild in 2010.  She is currently at a park in the Canary Islands called Loro Parque, but all the whales there are considered loans from SeaWorld.  Saying SeaWorld dedicates themselves to education, research, and conservation is also a stretch.  They provide a lot of misinformation or complete falsities about ocras, in particular (you can find videos on YouTube of the staff saying things to people that the people know are false).  They do have a research branch and do fund projects, and they also provide their orcas for research on general anatomy and physiology, but a majority of their research is based on animal husbandry.  They also participate in strandings and other animal rescues, but that's about the extent of their conservation efforts.  SeaWorld is a business, so they're dedicated to making money, which is perfectly acceptable to me and I have no issue with that.  They care about keeping the animals they have healthy, getting more animals (either through breeding or through animals that they rescue), and getting people in the door.  Most people go the SeaWorld for excitement, which is why you see more rides there than you do interactive climate models.  Now, there are a ton of issues associated with releasing the whales, which I [answer in detail here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/marinebiology/comments/1thxi6/marine_biologists_of_reddit_could_sea_worlds/ce8cq7s)  Another wrinkle I didn't mention before is that a majority of the whales have worn out teeth that have been drilled out and need to be flushed regularly to avoid infection - so that would also cause an issue with release.  I do think that people who go to SeaWorld enjoy the anthropomorphic relationship presented during the shows.  However, I don't think that people change their lifestyle habits in order to reduce their impact on wild orcas.  People go to SeaWorld to feel good, not really to think about the uncertain future of some of most beautiful and intelligent species on Earth.  There is no easy (or probably best) answer to where to go as a society in terms of captivity for large, intelligent animals, but I'm glad that we are having the discussion.   Very interesting and multifaceted question.  I will try to hit the major points of it and will use a comment I wrote about a similar question I answered about a week ago to broaden it.  I'm also going to try to correct some misconceptions you write, but please try not to take them with any hard feelings!   there are two sides to every story  This is correct, and as an avid supporter of the movie Blackfish, I feel it is important to note that it is an activist film.  I've studied the captivity issue for about as long as the director of the movie has, but unfortunately some of the information is presented in a biased or false manner.  For example, the scientist that studies the whales around Puget Sound said that a wild orca whale has never harmed a person, but wikipedia [has a list of what could be considered attacks, including one on a surfer that was extremely severe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans)  Also the movie doesn't explain that, Tilly was caught with another young whale, and both were kept in a giant tank in a hangar-like building in Europe and trained there through punishment before he could be moved to Canada.  I believe I read this in the book, [Death at SeaWrold by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/), but I which the movie would have talked about this more because I believe this early trauma was just as important as that he received at Sealand of the Pacific.  It may direct some of the public hatred away from the captive parks themselves, but I think it would make the movie feel less biased.  Although I think the backlash the captive industry is receiving is justified, I had a sour taste in my mouth from these two instances in the film the first time I watched it.  If you are interested in the topic of captivity, I would suggest you look into Death at SeaWorld, as well as the documentary, [A Fall From Freedom](http://vimeo.com/40600148), and the Frontline special, [A Whale of a Business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fZ2dMdtu8)   He now sits in a seperated tank and is cordoned off from everyone else  According to SeaWorld, he was kept alone because he was afraid of the tanks that had the new safety floors installed, but they have been trying to acclimate him to them.  I don't know if this is true or not since I haven't been there in about a decade, but I hope the trainers wouldn't let him be isolated for something he did almost 4 years ago.   starving the animals of food to perform so that they can be fed  They don't starve the animals at SeaWorld since they need the animals to be healthy.  They do something they call positive reinforcement.  Essentially, the whales do something the trainers like and the whales get something they like.  The whales get fed outside of shows (I've seen this myself), but it wouldn't surprise me (as stated in Blackfish) if the meals are cut before important shows to make the whales more likely to perform.  I've been at shows where one or two of the whales aren't interested in performing, so I know that the whales don't feel it's completely necessary for their survival that they go through with every single performance.  This is my own personal opinion, but I would equate the shows with a set of weights in a prison yard - it's mostly something to keep the whales somewhat occupied during their barren, under-stimulated existences.   why can't we just end the captivity and performing of these wild animals? I understand that it is a huge revenue stream  You answered your own question.  SeaWorld is a huge business, which is why these animals are still performing.  If people didn't go to see cetaceans in captivity, the captive industry would grind to a halt.  However, this would lead to the discussion of what to do with the animals, which is actually very complicated.  I'd say that it would be impossible to release all of the captive killer whales (not to mention the other captive marine mammals) and expect them all to survive.  I think the whales that were born in the wild would have an easier time adjusting back to that kind of lifestyle than would the captive-born whales that had never experienced a natural environment. I'm sure you could train all of them to hunt though, at least enough to get by.  Also, the price would be astronomical.  Keiko was a challenge and he was 1 whale, I can't imagine funding and organize the release of the almost 30 orca owned by SeaWorld (or the 54 total in captivity worldwide).  What would be even more challenging would be to determine where to release captive-born whales (34 of the 54 worldwide). SeaWorld's wild whales came from 2 different parts of the world - the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and the North Atlantic (Iceland). They have also recently been getting sperm from an orca named Kshamenk, who resides at Mundo Marino and was captured off the coast of Argentina. Orca have very distinct cultures, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, there are 4 distinct "cultures" - Northern Residents, Southern Residents, Transients, and Offshores - that rarely interact and never interbreed. These "cultures" each have their own unique forms of communication, known as dialects. The North Atlantic population is less studied than the Pacific Northwest population, but I assume there are also distinct "cultures" in that population.  Keiko was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod. I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation. Springer, a Southern Resident whale in the Pacific Northwest who was orphaned and rehabilitated in a sea pen, was adopted by her aunt's pod, so it's possible that a whale like Lolita at the Miami Seaquarium could be taken in by a pod if she were released, since she was captured from a Southern Resident pod. Back to the captive-born whales. Many of them are genetic mixtures of Pacific Northwest, North Atlantic, and now Southern Atlantic whales. This means that it's possible wild whales could reject them based on morphology alone. Not to mention how incestual the genetic lines are in the SeaWorld whales, which makes it difficult to decide how to define what a family group is amongst the captive whales and how to divide them between release locations.  I would be interested in finding out how the whales communicate at the parks now. If the captive-born ones seem to be using a dialect similar to any one particular group that was passed down to them by the older wild-caught whales, maybe they could be released in the area where that dialect originates. That's assuming that the whales haven't come up with their own crude captive (possibly even park-specific) dialect(s). If they did that, you could make the case of releasing them all together in one spot, but that probably wouldn't be the best idea since some of the captive whales seem to show high levels of aggression towards one another. Also, there probably aren't many places that have a local ecology that could handle such an influx of apex predators. Plus, the released whales would probably act like Keiko and seek out human interaction, which would be especially bad for them if they were to congregate in a high-traffic, highly populated area.    Why can't we just release them back into the wild and if people want to see them go on Whale Watching tours, visit a national park, or just go out to that animal's natural habitat and observe them being them, rather than performing some mundane trick for your enjoyment.  These are much better options in my opinion, but are not perfect.  Whale watching can be rather hit-or-miss when it comes to seeing the whales or dolphins you want to see, and you rarely (if ever) get as close to the animals as you do in captive facilities.  Captivity gives the public this sense of bonding with the animals, even though it's completely fabricated and unrealistic.  Visiting natural habitats also has it's problems.  For example, there is an issue with the amount of pollution in the Galapagos Islands (which are considered a nature reserve) from the sheer number of tourists that visit the area annually.  I'm hoping that as technology improves, we'll have things like simulators or maybe ROVs or something awesome that hasn't even been thought of yet that can bring more people the joys of the natural world around us without imposing the problems of more people on the wilderness.    But anyway, in terms of captivity, I think the best route for us to take is to focus on the young, recently captured whales, like Morgan from the Netherlands who was captured in 2010, Narnia from Russia who was captured in 2012, or the 7 whales captured in Russia in September and October of 2013.  If any whales were able to be successfully released, it would most likely be these whales.  Let me know if you're interested in more information on this subject, I'd be more than happy to either elaborate or provide you with some direction on where to look!  I'd apologize for the wall of text, but this topic is a passion of mine and I think it needs to be explained as thoroughly as possible!   Possibly.  I think the whales that were born in the wild would have an easier time adjusting back to that kind of lifestyle than would the captive-born whales that had never experienced a natural environment.

Keiko (Free Willy) was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod.  I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation.  Springer, a Southern Resident whale in the Pacific Northwest who was orphaned and rehabilitated in a sea pen, was adopted by her aunt's pod, so it's possible that a whale like Lolita at the Miami Seaquarium could be taken in by a pod if she were released, since she was captured from a Southern Resident pod.  Back to the captive-born whales.  Many of them are genetic mixtures of Pacific Northwest, North Atlantic, and now Southern Atlantic whales.  This means that it's possible wild whales could reject them based on morphology alone.  Not to mention how incestual the genetic lines are in the SeaWorld whales, which makes it difficult to decide how to define what a family group is amongst the captive whales and how to divide them between release locations.  I would be interested in finding out how the whales communicate at the parks now.  If the captive-born ones seem to be using a dialect similar to any one particular group that was passed down to them by the older wild-caught whales, maybe they could be released in the area where that dialect originates.  That's assuming that the whales haven't come up with their own crude captive (possibly even park-specific) dialect(s).  If they did that, you could make the case of releasing them all together in one spot, but that probably wouldn't be the best idea since some of the captive whales seem to show high levels of aggression towards one another.  Also, there probably aren't many places that have a local ecology that could handle such an influx of apex predators.  Plus, the released whales would probably act like Keiko and seek out human interaction, which would be especially bad for them if they were to congregate in a high-traffic, highly populated area.  So, if by survive you mean not die immediately of starvation then probably, but if you mean live like a normal wild whale then the answer is almost definitely not.   Very true.  I'm not sure how to find these financing figures, but it would be interesting to see how for-profit zoos and aqauriums compare to SeaWorld.  	12
 Thank you, that is incredibly helpful. I am going to try to arrange a meeting right now.   He was trying to force me to stay past my clock out time, when I am in a good mood I will volunteer time to help clean up and do more work, they will have me burn off the overtime later as a result. If he had actually asked me, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal.   Thank you for the response, luckily there were a few people around, including my fellow IMS co-worker, so I should be covered as far as witnesses go.  	3
 hahaha!  yup, nothing like a kick to the dick.  a friend of mine goes to that college now and i really want to find that prof to tell him the whole story, it really bothers me.   i didn't want it to be the focus of the story or paint transgender folk as creepy or wrong, but it was what it was. well, i didn't learn a single thing because i go down by the river still all the time.  haven't had a single problem.  not going to live in fear because of one random weirdo.  	2
 It's not the case for everyone who died.  That's the entire point  You can't apply your blanket means of proof to everyone who dies.   You won't have to pay lawyer fees.  /r/borrow   Check the laws in your State, eviction is usually a lengthy process.   I recommend talking to your landlord  Did you check out payday loans?    It's a privately owned website   They get to decide.   His proof is unreasonable.  I have life long friends whom I am in no photographs.  People I work with every day, no pictures.  Neighbours I've lived beside for ten years and with whom I socialize, no pictures!  Most 40 year old men don't go around taking pictures of friends, colleagues and neighbours.   No one is censoring that vile material, it's still there.   It's a shitty neighborhood, no question.  Dangerous?  I wouldn't say that, but not safe either.   Why wouldn't they want them up front?   It'll be quite straightforward.     I have cousins and friends with whom I have no photos.  Hell, I've a cousin I haven't seen in 30 years.     I thought salvia was that drug people do...once?   Redditors get the Reddit they deserve.   If all the assholes and trolls fucked off to voat, mission accomplished.   Pics of dead kids = vile.  Pics of happy puppies = not vile   ...and if one of them is dead.  What then?     You're never allowed to complain about being downvoted for the sin of respectfully disagreeing with popular sentiment.    	16
 Yeah, I don't really deserves to be whitewashed into a 'worst episode ever' hole. at least it took some dramatic risks.   I *Think* the general trend is that the more sci-fi guys REALLY hated it and the more 'broad strokes' kind of guys liked it. I *think*.   well I *liked* it.   Still doesn't change the fact she cloned big boss multiple times without him asking, after specifically saying it was against her moral code in mgs3, creating the rift that ended up driving the patriots apart, as well as drive gray fox crazy enough to kill her. She could well be 'forced into it by zero' or something, but I think that's less interesting than having her do it of her own volition. Her betrayal probably struck Big boss the hardest. He'd expect EVA or ocelot or zero to betray him, they're spies after all, but the kind hearted medic who was obsessed with movies?   Ideally, I think he should only appear in some sort of 1970's style flashback sequence. Para medic would probably be a better fit for having an actual confrontation with Big boss, seeing as she was essentially snakes best friend, and a lot of people's favorite character in 3, and she's pretty much the most morally bankrupt member of the patriots.   All the patriots in the same room. Think of the tension of Para-medic, sigint, zero, snake, ocelot and EVA being together.   Heck yeah I'm interested!   It's got a lot to do with how homogenized main male leads are, the only real roles troy baker and Nolan north can't do are the more 'japanese' style leads. (generally the higher pitched voices and stuff) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'd personally like to see more variety in main characters in the games industry than 'white, middle aged male' or 'British white middle aged male'    Are you using a +15 weapon? I manages to kill him in 5 hits with the BSS +15. Alternatively, two hand a weapon, attack once and back off whenever he attempts an attack. (unless he does a butt stomp, keep close for that attack) The only easier boss for me was pinwheel.  Oh, and if you want to level up, go to the painted world and kill the phalanx, and if you want to skip the fight entirely, feed 30 humanity to quelaags sister.   Yep, and unlike Kaathe of Fraamt, velka doesn't dick you around, she just gives you supplies and help to carry out the job.   There's actually three main forces manipulating the CU in the game: Fraamt, Kaathe, and Velka. Velka's goal is just to get you to kill the Gods, probably with the occult weapons she basically hands you, and she's the only one who ALWAYS succeeds at her goal.   The stray demon is all about dodging and mobility. Two hand your weapon, run up, attack, and then back off when he does the power wave. He's been the hardest boss so far for me too.   Yeah, There's also some pretty cool metric remixes on the deluxe version of the 'fantasies' album, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-gVPGULgw)   Xenoblade chronicles did that.In fact, It's about climbing from one giant dead machine god to the other, evil giant dead machine god.   Don't worry bout it man!   Yeah, that song got me into metric [pretty much all their songs are that good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtd8ArvH_s)   Uh, I dunno, those spandex are pretty intimidating...   Gah, was I the only one who thought this episode was a great time to re-introduce the [Raston warrior robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQVtmYfLtk) AKA the silver ranger AKA crap ultraman? I mean, It would be better than the spider demon we got.   but there's a new one, and I remember reading about it being a 'buddy' rank on this reddit   Weren't 'buddy' ranks shown on the analyzer though?   Well, like a lot of hollywood films, ASM had a whole bundle of writers and rewrites, the most direct culprit of all the 'crap parts' in modern movies is Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman though.   Have you been to the painted world or undead asylum? You get a tonne of stuff and levels from there if you're having trouble   You can go wherever now. Go to the dukes archives if you want to do DLC, go to new londo if you want to +15 weapons, and go to the catacombs if you want the easiest time.   I was in the same boat a couple days ago, but instead of solaire I summoned a giantdad. I took down smough first too!   Young fatman.   TBH, after mgs2's story, you can't really blame people.   It's because TPP is based on Moby dick, which, as you probably know, is all about DICKS, hence the title, and the part where it describes how you can turn a whale dick into a coat or whatever. Therefore, TPP is all about the D, hence DD,or 'double dickin', and quiet being a 'naked sniper' because she's chico and something something reasons.   He's just doing it to throw us off the scent, hence why a dog was just introduced, he's saying "You'll have to sniff out the fact that quiet is chico" The dogs eyepatch represents the communities blindness to the fact that quiet is Chico, whilst the other eye represents the true fans who KNOW she's chico. The dog is also called DD, and what do you think quietes breast size is? Coincidence? UNLIKELY!   Couldn't kaz function identically to big boss as seen in the trailers, I mean, he has a missing arm too, so all the prostetics could be used no?      There's actually a weapon XI in the comics, so he's not even an original character!   SO I'm assuming you got platinum this recently to get into the bloodborne Alpha? If not, congratulations! You're now eligible for the bloodborne alpha!    If I remember correctly, that room was found, but the trigger wasn't discovered until revealed by the devs. I also think that the code for AA was a lot more complicated than the code for Dark souls.   Not really, a month's usually when marketing campaigns start up   Yeah, that's the joke, zoey was semi referencing the multiversity 'DC worlds' chart.   I thin the real question is where do captain carrot and the amazing zoo crew com into this? They've been out of continuity for so long, they need a comeback.   Hey man, I'm also on my first playthrough, lvl 44 and in in exactly the same place. I might PM you, although I won't be able to do mic chat or anything.   It could be a version of her warped by the space-time continuum, or something like that. Still, as I said, it seems unlikely that the writers will add existential dread into the show.   well there isn't really any evidence for that theory other than a couple lines of dialogue. You have to go through a lot of logical loops to think a kid would reasonably act like that.   So my theory for the 'monster' of this episode is that it's actually some sort of time distorted version of Clara. Think about it. She's been scattered through time, every time, every place the doctor goes or thinks about going. We've already seen it go wrong with dalek!Clara, don't you think a universal constant obsessed with the Doctor would create some, y'know issues for the universe.  However, I doubt we'll ever get a real reveal. My above theory is too dark and grand for them to follow through, but it's neat to think about!   Hey, I'm playing the game for the first time and I happened to sparta kick a guy off the stairs in that area. How long ago did it happen for you?   Yeah, platinum games is japanese, but the makers of dead rising are canadian I think.   Actually, this game was made by western devs, just published at capcom.   oh really? I don't know much about TRPG's, but I assumed it was simple because it can be adapted so easily. Guess not.   I was just thinking this. I think the only one people haven't suggested yet is GURPS, which facilitates these sort of 'simple, generic TRPG' games found on yogsquest.   It might be GURPS, or at least, that seems most facilitating to 'generic space fantasy'   Yeah, but it was published by DC, so it's a DC graphic novel, the original intent of the book doesn't come into it. If you want to be **really** anal, you can also point out that their was a question/watchmen crossover, so watchmen still is technically in DC comics 'mainline continuity'.   But it was **published** by DC.   I literally did this 5 minutes ago. I was super excited and then I realized why I don't play horror games.   You should really get the HD collection if you liked 4. MGS2 is really weird and peace walker is pretty arcadey but MGS3 is a big candidate for the best stealth game and story ever made.    everybody has a different favorite zelda game, mainly because they're meant to be games you play in your early teens. This squabbling happens on every thread on every forum, nobody will every define the 'best' zelda game because it doesn't exist.   I'm pretty sure a lot of the female POWS are good at intel, it's just intel units are some of the easiest to grind in the game, and there aren't that many B-A rank POWS, so you tend to ignore the fairly decent female intel units the game spawns in the mid game.   Or you can just be any other hero in the marvel universe that's more powerful than taskmaster, I love im', but man is that guy a punching bag.   Action movies are meant to be about aberrant cases, they're not meant to be about mediocre tales filled with mediocre people.   Well the writer of that movie did Just direct the summers biggest blockbuster so it's pretty justified.   Yep, I'm looking forward to the inevitable moon knight movie.   The problem lies with the properties that FOX and SONY basically accidentally bought. Deadpool, galactus, the skrulls and various other characters that first appeared in fantastic 4,x-men or spiderman were bought by fluke, and now marvel's run out of every A-lister other than ms Marvel.   The problem lies with the properties that FOX and SONY basically accidentally bought. Deadpool, galactus, the skrulls and various other characters that first appeared in fantastic 4,x-men or spiderman were bought by fluke, and now marvel's run out of every A-lister other than ms Marvel.   On the other hand, if Marvel had the X-men rights a deadpool movie would have been made years ago.      Hey man have you ever thought of doing Civ V videos? Maybe commentary over yogscast ones? Because you have a real knack for it.   Although pixar have yet to produce a really good movie since 2010, which is a pretty big problem for the company.   That first APC is the first boss you face, so is the most memorable and likely capture. Therefore, since it always produces alligator he's the most memorable soldier, and the most likely that EVERY player has other than the only other unique, Kojima. Since Kojima was already in GZ, hopefully some of the peace walker codenames come back, such as alligator and thresher shark.   I thought Alligator was the first one to always drop out of the APC though? maybe that's why, he's pretty much the most 'canon' soldier you find in the field other than kojima   I think you misspelled Thresher shark.   Hey, do you mind pointing me to the where the alligator meme came from? I've seen it referenced multiple times on the subreddit and tv tropes, but after google searching I've yet to see the origins of Alligator being the most famous MSF soldier.   Although, to be fair it was originally Donald Blake becoming Thor, so it does have a bit of precedence.   I get where your coming from, I truly do, and I HOPE Ant man is a good or great film, and that Edgar Wrights vision carries over,however, I think the complaints are way more justified than you make them out to be.   1) Joss whedon is in no way comparable to Reed. Joss Whedon worked on the scripts for X-men, Toy story and the x-men comics. He also wrote and directed multiple Emmy award winning shows that had directorially strong moments. ('Hush' comes to mind) He also made Serenity, which, commercial success or not, was one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the past decade. It's dumb to have doubts about Joss Whedon, it's not to have doubts about Peyton Reed, whose made multiple Bad, mediocre, and more importantly generically directed movies.   2) Favreau also made multiple great movies, I don't get why people keep bringing Elf up, It was a great Christmas movie. Alan Taylor directed episodes of the most critically acclaimed fantasy TV show of all time.The Russo's are slightly more comparable but didn't take over from an amazing Action director like, say, Tarantino.   3) I think the most valid comparison is actually another studio. Darren Aranofsky was originally set to direct the wolverine. But got replaced at the last minute due to 'directorial differences.' You can logically apply all the same arguments to FOX, they hadn't gotten it wrong yet, (x-men 3 and origins wolverine are comparable to the incredible hulk and Iron man 2) James Marigold has directed stuff before etc. etc. posthumously, don't you think people saying Aranofsky would've done a better job were correct? This stuff has precedence, it's not completely out of leftfield.   Small aside: Edgar's work is hardly obscure stuff, ESPECIALLY as we have to compare it to British films rather than American films. The cornetto trilogy has been hugely critically successful, and was one of the most commercially successful franchises in British cinema. Even Scott pilgrim didn't lose money and became a cult hit on DVD.   In conclusion. The Edgar Wright fiasco is way more rational that going "wah wah, Gal Godot is too skinny"   How are they changing the character? Thor isn't literally changing genders, he's just temporarily become de-powered, whilst someone else takes up the mantel. He's not even leaving the comic! Completely changing the character is like when in the 80's Thor became a frog and solved animal problems for 6 issues, and that is seen by many as the greatest Thor story ever told.   Comics are about non static characters, 12 come out every year after all, so they **have** to change things up to keep interest up. The harry potter comparison doesn't really work, but actually did happen. In the last two Harry potter books, J.K Rowling not only killed Dumbledore, but set the last book entirely outside of Hogwarts, because good characters grow and change and face adversity, rather than remain static.   Whilst I agree with you over the fanboys being fanboys stuff, there's a significant difference between complaining about Joss Whedon (who had already directed two great films, serenity and cabin in the woods) and worrying about Ant man now that Wright's left. Edgar Wright is probably the best action comedy director or the last decade. It's reasonable to assume that Peyton Reed will not fill his directorial shoes, it's am similar situation to the Star trek 3 Roberto Orci thing: There's actual evidence that those people will do a worse job.   Why? What is so upsetting about a temporary change during a story arc? It's just whining about writers wanting to tell any sort of interesting narrative. If beta Ray bill or frog Thor were introduced today, people would be up in arms, despite those being two of the best Thor stories.   It's because apparently fanboys can't fathom an actor and a character looking different. It's pretty objectifying behavior honestly, and I'm SERIOUSLY surprised nobodies complained about Dwayne Johnson playing Shazam when the character is white.   I bought it on Itunes, can I get in on this sweet deal or do I have to use methods other than Itunes to listen in?   The cycle is being repeated with the Gal Godot/ Jesse Eisenberg stuff, lambasting people for hypothetical performances. The worst part is that the asshole fanboy always gets to say the last word. If Gal Godot is great, they'll either say 'well she put in a surprisingly competent performance' or they turn up their noses and say 'well, Gal godot did an ok performance but such and such would've been better IMO' but if Gal Godot does a bad performance, fanboys get to say 'see, I was right all along, my fatalistic attitude happened to align somewhat with reality, aren't I the BEST?'   Deadpool's really popular actually. He's been in a tonne of games (MVC, marvel ultimate alliance, was a main character in that marvel MMO, was a main character in lego marvel, had his own game that was popular with lets players) been featured in a couple of cartoons and is generally incredibly popular in the under 30/ geek market. He's also one of the bestselling marvel characters, and is prominent in the marvel universe (he's basically the new wolverine, popping up in other peoples comics. I'd definitely say he's the most popular marvel hero with no movie, and if FOX didn't get the rights by fluke, marvel would have made a deadpool movie already.   Actually, deadpool is probably the most popular marvel character without a movie. He's definitely A-list and has been in a lot of videogames/cartoons.   Funnily enough, I just got the game and, despite the fact I was attempting to fight the Taurus demon at level 9 as a thief, the ascent never bothered me at all, and I had to do it 6-8 times because I was apparently underleveled for the demon. Eventually beat it by going human for the first time and requesting assistance (but not before having to kick a PVP guy off a cliff, again at level 9) what a game!   A triple A studio that closed a a year later...   So I'm just notifying those unaware right now, but r/games currently has two fairly enlightening threads about the yogscast right now. One talks of the recent Totalbiscuit video outlining problems with the yogscasts new business model    (http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2arhv6/totalbiscuit_outlines_a_number_of_issues_with_the/)   and another talks of the apparent abandonment of the yogventures game   (http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2apng1/yogscast_cheat_backers_for_567000_on/)  I realize that this is essentially a link to other reddit posts, but since this is a subreddit dedicated entirely to the yogscast, I think it's important that you're kept notified of the 'current affairs' so to speak. Lewis has also been VERY active on this, so if you have any queries about yogventures or the promos, now might be the best time to say them.   Interesting thing about the movie is how it was heavily influenced by the fandom, and in particular fanfiction. Elements like Charlotte and sakuya/kyoko shipping are big in the fandom, as are 'happy endings' so I highly reccomend checking out the madoka magica entry on TV tropes to catch all the nods.   Hey, if the EU is non canon doesn't that technically mean that they can 'reveal' Boba fett in empire was a girl again?   Eh, It's debatable. It BECOMES part of the narrative, but you can really easily not watch it if you think Ep 12 was the perfect ending. Part of the magic of rebellion is that ep 12 essentially left no loose ends, so it makes you feel like a bastard for requesting a arbitrary (and deliberately) contrived 'continuation' of the story, despite the fact it's over.   I would actually say to only watch rebellion if you want more madoka magica content. It's a better film if you approach it with the mentality that you're actively watching to get more content with the characters, rather than assuming it's part of the pre-existing narrative. Rebellion also makes more sense if you read Madoka magica's TV tropes page (after watching the main series) because rebellion also makes lots of references to the fandom.    I first heard it from an n64 OOC preview. Death mountain was THE scaleable mountain.   Hey, If you like KLK, and want to get more into anime, particularly anime with strong female characters, I recommend you do what I did and watch Madoka magica and Black lagoon. Both have really incredible characters, visuals, narratives and action. Seriously, Madoka magica is 4 hours long yet is my favourite TV show of all time.   Actually, the recent deadpool series has had some pretty heavy moments. The negative aspects of deadpool mainly come from the Daniel way run.   I think Squirrel girl has little fucks to give about anything black bolt can do to her.   Wow. why are you on a film subreddit if you're so ignorant about film in general?   Nope, not true. People don't talk about *a fantastic fear of everything* people don't talk about *how to lose friends and alienate people.* nobody was going to see Ant man for Paul Rudd alone, people were hyped about Wright and his fantastic direction. Being dismissive of a good director is being dismissive of film as a craft by Proxy.   Shaun of the Dead is not a 'niche' film. It was one of the most successful British films of the decade and is seen as iconic by tonnes of directors, from Tarantino to Romero. It is not niche if it's always brought up in discussion with 28 days later, the walking dead etc. as part of the 'new wave of zombie media.   YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole! and YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole! And YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole....      Will magical girl shows ever be the same after revolutionary girl Utena?   I never said she was well know outside of comics circles hence the remark about C/D list heroes, frankly, I'm surprised you haven't heard of her, given that you've heard of world war hulk/ Electra (who is pretty b/c-list in comic terms) I don't know why you assumed that I wasn't talking about A-list in comic book terms when you specifically indicated you were talking in comic book terms by bring up World war Hulk.   I would say so, Electra has been dead for decades, the fantastic four haven't really been relevant to the big teamups/ they're not really a flagship, and Black widow isn't necessarily 'heroic' although all those characters barring electra are A-list anyway, so it doesn't really matter. Ms. Marvel is a big deal, and she'll become a bigger deal when she gets her own movie.   In my mind, 'list' standing is defined by relevance to the actual universe/cross pollination. Carol Danvers is a primary member of the Avengers, Marvel's premier superhero team,and has been for ages therefore, I posit that she's A-list. I would also argue that her DC equivalent, wonder-woman, has never been a massively popular character amongst fans, at least when compared to say, Batman, wolverine or deadpool, yet is branded A-list.   She was in world war Hulk with spider-man and stuff, a lot of superheroes were defeated off panel in that mini. Going by that logic ghost rider, who actually BEAT hulk in a fight would be A-list. She's been on the avengers for the past 30 years, and she's widely viewed as the most notable female marvel superhero outside of the x-men, she's A-list.   A couple of months ago, Peter parker had been dead for a year with Doctor Octopus controlling his body a *lot* of wierd stuff happens in comics   She's A-list in comic terms, but pretty C/D-list in terms of cartoon appearances and the like. Comic's operate on different levels to other media in terms of recognizable characters, for example, probably the most popular marvel hero for fans is actually deadpool.   Actually, now there are two Ms Marvels, Carol Danvers has been pretty relevant to marvel since the 80's, (she has been on the avengers for ages, making her A-list in comic book terms) but recently, she became captain marvel and the ms marvel mantle passed on to a new girl, who's comic has only reached issue 4. She's notable for being the most mainstream Muslim superhero, and that comic may also potentially get adapted.   I'll replace Paul Rudd.   Yeah, that was meant to be Bill, but it's difficult to say how much focus was intended given that that sequence had an entirely different production team. Perhaps the 4-hour cut goes into more detail, what with it having an extended anime sequence.   Actually, Iron man has a pretty decent array of technological/magical villains, but because most of the tech villains overlap with captain america and magic hasn't been established in the MCU yet, you're left with a lot of rivals (that were done pretty poorly)    aren't they making that movie? It's called the expendabelles?   	104
 Damn that was a good holiday.   My niece was born this year and she was named Elsa.   I wouldn't say its great.But its not that bad.  	3
 If that person is a rhesus monkey and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul should be honest about that.   The Roswell UFO crash was used as a smokescreen by the government to cover up the fact that Area 51 is a testing ground for experimental aircraft.            You mean the color gray or the colour grey?   Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with the Kingdom of England. Feodor declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir Jerome Bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by Feodor's father.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feodor_I_of_Russia  An early "Free Trade" advocate.   Saying he came in second sounds a lot better than saying he got 10 of 319 possible votes.             Have you heard the song "Brown Sugar" by the Rolling Stones?         There is no such thing as "Reverse Discrimination", yes sometime black, hispanic or asian people discriminate against white people, but that is simply discrimination, not "Reverse Discrimination". The opposite of discrimination would be when someone doesn't discriminate against anyone. There is no such thing as reverse racism or reverse prejudice either. Using terms like "reverse discrimination" supports the racist myth that only white people can discriminate or be prejudice.     I'll just leave [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6hRDS3LvQQ) here.      Why is it "cute" when women say things like this, but if a guy said this to a female office holder, he'd be a sexist pig?   If a big name Hollywood actor said something like this to a female politician, it would be sexual harassment.    Considering Obama has only ran for national office twice, no one outside of Illinois has voted for him four times.    You realize that the lowest the decidit was under Bush was his first year, right? and the highest was his last, right?       Did he say anything about bringing the deficit down to a six year low?                It isn't unions that are stealing workers pay, it's chief executives who take home $1,000 for every $1 dollar earned by their average worker and donating ten times that average worker's salary to some union-busting political PACs.   I guess this would mean something if all our leaders had been Roosevelts, Kennedys or Bushs, but Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton and Obama kinda fuck this up a bit don't they?     Depends, are we Black?   If a "Democratic columnist" and a "senior fellow at the Brookings Institution" can be considered leading Democrats, can we call Rush and the Koch brothers leaders of the GOP?   Less than half of Americans believe President Barack Obama has expanded the power of the presidency too much, according to a new Reason-Rupe poll and 30 percent responded not enough.

When did the WMD's become **THE** reason we take military action against someone? A Country can be a threat without WMD's. According to this Conor Friedersdorf's logic we were right to ignore the killing fields of  Cambodia and the Armenian and Rwandan Genocides because none of those countries had WMD's either.             I believe ISIS will be emboldened by members of the media publicly pronouncing that they believe the U.S. President feels ambivalent about the decency of America.

Is the Washington Times, the one reporting that "Chicago crime rate drops as concealed carry applications surge" not a part of the "mass media"?   What I never see explained in these type of stories is how common burglars and carjackers know that there has been an increase in the amount of concealed carry permits being issued and therefore a greater chance that their potential victim may be armed, do they go down to the sheriff's office and ask? And if the lowest rungs of the criminal element aren't aware that there are more people with guns, then how is it a deterrent?       And only now do you realize, legos swing both ways.

 Thank you Mongo and Nadelus for your contributions and insights. I think people are judging Robocop 2014 too harshly on it being a remake for two reasons:  nostalgia and the "ickiness" of the term "remake".   In fact - I think we agree in that this Robocop stays true to the "soul" of the original in that it takes a great premise of Frankenstein/Man/Machine and also injects commentary of America.  Verhoeven with glorious hyperbole and Padilha with political conscience (both of them satire).  Verhoeven presents an America of 80's excess.  Padilha includes one that is 00's "dark and gritty".    I think Verhoeven's works better because of less studio interference - but we don't live in a MUST LOVE/MUST HATE all caps paradigm.           	4
 No, those all exist.  Unless you mean one sub that combines them, which probably also exists.   "Allahu Akbar, you bitches!"  Just to watch Republican heads explode.   It's also got Prowlers on deck, so probably pre-2015.   No, a lack of precipitation is why California is in drought.  No policy causes that.    until the Emancipation Proclamation, the American Civil War had nothing directly to do with slavery.  The declarations of secession of various Confederate states, as well as statements by the leaders of the Confederacy, strongly prove otherwise.    Did anyone else get Desert Storm trading cards when they were a kid?   I have almost the entire Topps set somewhere around here.

"Lifeblood" implies possession of a heart.   That is, maybe at Herculaneum or Pompeii, more modern archaeology uncovers something like "first editions" of the works of the more famous Greek and Roman philosophers or historians, and it's been found that the transcribed versions that became famous again in the Renaissance were not the same.

Wow, a mind-reader.  Why are you wasting time on reddit when you could be using your powers of telepathy for greater good?   Anyone know of the evolution of the use of the word "discovered"?  I'm reading the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, and he uses the word in the sense of *revealing* by a party, rather than *finding out*.  That is, someone letting others in on a secret is referred to as "discovered to them," or "he discovered that fact" meaning he told someone else.    covering them would clearly produce massive ratings, and yet they have remained silent.  Yeah, we haven't heard anything about any of those.  Not at great length, endlessly, over and over.   So ... you can prove he said it?   "Excuse me sir, is this a god dam?"   1. No.  2.

The First Amendment blocks the government from imposing consequences on you as a result of your speech.  No, it doesn't.   You can be punished for inciting panic, hate speech, slander, libel, etc.    Should a government institution have the leeway to break off association with someone due to the content of their speech?  ... yes.  The answer is yes.  Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequence.    We all know what this is about nonetheless.   We do?

I don't care to or need to list any similarities in the agreement,  That's what I thought.    not once looking at the similarities.   Because there aren't any.  Go ahead, go ahead and point out all the similarities between the agreement at Munich and the one with Iran.  List them.  Show us.  Actually prove something.  You can't, of course.    You can try to differentiate the difference between Obama placating Iran and Chamberlain placating Nazis all you want.   Yes, I can differentiate, because they are *completely different* - Iran doesn't gain any territory, no one else gives up any territory without even having a say, Iran isn't a first-rate power that threatens to conquer its neighbors.  You, on the other hand, have no argument.  You have no substance. You have no point.    Obama is doing nothing but pulling a Neville Chamberlain.   Thanks for proving your ignorance about what happened in 1938.  It has absolutely no parallels with the current situation.    And it's good to you because Obama  ... is being a responsible world leader and dealing with problems through even-handed diplomacy instead of Friedman-esque "Suck on this!" bullshit.  and Iraq war,  Yes, it's nice to have a President who doesn't push for stupid shit that destabilizes the entire region.  and Palin.  ... continues to be a moron, and a star of the Republican party.

Him and Fela stand in front of it and talk about it.  I'd say that qualifies.    And we're throwing it away.  No, we're replacing an old ship with newer ships.

The *de Gaulle* is actually notorious for having been built poorly, at least in parts.  For example, you generally want the flight deck of an aircraft carrier to be long enough to operate the aircraft you plan to deploy on it.  Also, you usually don't want the propellers to fall off.   You happen to know what supply ship that is in the background?   "Turbulent Skies" by  T. A. Heppenheimer goes into the basics, and I'd recommend it simply as a great history of (American) commercial aviation up until the late '90s.   Look at the graphic.   No, the Israelis were spying on the U.S. for Republicans, most of whom may as well renounce their American citizenship in favor of Israeli citizenship at this point.   I'd be fine with adding the *Izumo*s, but not the *Hyuga*s, as I haven't seen any sign their decks could withstand the heat from any STOVL aircraft.  I mean, if you're going to include the *Thai*-tanic, and the Italian and Spanish jump-jet carriers, you may as well include the *America*.   No, I was definitely speechless when that ended.   The U.S. has 10 aircraft carriers, not 20.  The *Wasps* and *Americas* are functionally light carriers, as they can carry a full load of AV-8Bs or F-35s when needed, and will usually carry at least a half-dozen or so.   God Save the Quenn!  I also wouldn't mind seeing this updated to separate the Nimitz/Fords, and the Americas/Wasps, which really shouldn't be grouped like this.   Placing them both centerline - one in front of the VLS and one behind, or both behind and superfiring - would do the same, while not resulting in one turret masking the other.

She also compared his career to the rag that the goat was eating saying "why do you even want it so badly". To me it just seemed so anti-himym advice.  I don't really like Ted's answer though saying "that's the plan". It's not just the plan to him it's what he loves doing and I wish he had said that instead   Ambulence rides are like 6 grand though aren't they? Unless I'm dying of anaphylactic shock I'll just drive myself   I guess it could be a little ironic since in one episode Lily tells him it's a made up word   Patton is also rated PG from what I remember. I've never heard so many swear words in my life   In Mother Russia fedora tips you   I think that was the first time, and Barney does it in a later episode as well   My possible theory is that it's them pronouncing her name wrong, to me Scherb(o)tsky sounds much more correct and I don't think Robin ever pronounces it with an A sound   I have the green hemp shoes and the soles wore through in like 3 months, which is unusual for adidas I don't know what happened but I was sad   Trains are crazy. Not to be the physics nerd here but the amount of mass a train has even with little speed it still exerts an insane amount of force   I thought it was cool, but I guess it was more cool actually being there      I can look more like Kurt Cobain!   Kinda looked like that! Also sorry for the terrible quality   Preferably the SEM for this situation      My friend said it great, in LoTR they made every single orc, the most copy pasteable thing imaginable, to look different and therefore awesome   Sorry for the late reply but yeah like the other person said it's just not likely, especially if they were both goth to your point   That is very cool. It's also super foggy right now so fitting   Been to WI a few times my self, on a scale of amazing to orgasmic how great is frozen custard?   You forgot this /   Wasn't Lily a goth chick from high school all the way through freshman year of college? Not saying it couldn't happen but to me it seems a bit of a clash, I guess it's for a joke though   The booster and the cars with the metal bottoms not that plastic. Gives them way more momentum   It's really no wonder Ted is hung up on Robin forever. They live together and Robin basically puts him in a state of perpetual jealousy, or rather they put each other in that state. Sure ex's can be friends but not like that   It definitely has some of my fav episodes: sexless inkeeper, playbook, last cigarette, girls vs. suits, etc. I thought it was good as well   In WA it's like 9.50 now so very different across states   Never done Greyhound but Megabus is definitely the way to go. It was comfier than my plane ride   Aint nothing like a Liz Lemon party cuz a Liz Lemon party is mandatory  edit:thanks for the fix it's been awhile   The amount of history and lore that came from this is actually amazing. In those few weeks books were written, memes were created, and much time was wasted typing "up" or "down"   I played Slime volleyball with my roomate last month ha. I still got it   Hans Gruber, international bandit   Had you said blinds I would've been freaked out      No but his mom is always a special   This would be more creepy if he wasn't so loveable    We can build one in Tacoma. Oh wait..   Terrorists last word's are "begosh"      I believe there's a song about this   I thought it was kinda funny. Maybe I'm just missing the show more than I thought though   True. I think a big reason I'm making a bigger deal of it is because I've hung out with OG katelin a couple times this semester ( in college) so probably remembering it more than usual   It does seem to be pretty common. Thanks   That is very true, I think you're right   She's my friend's girl's friend and we may all go on this double date thing this Friday. Is it weird that she has the same name? Well I know it's weird but more like is this a deal breaker? ---     Also I've met like 5 girls with this name in the last year so I've pretty much given up on trying to meet a girl with a different name  TL;DR Thanks guys    The girl I may take out on a date has the same name as my last. Weird?   Didn't expect to cry today but umm.. okay. :(   Am I doing this right?   Not asking this girl out because I was leaving for college like 5 months later. Shoulda gone through with it   Marshal is decent looking ( I think? I'm a guy) and a lawyer. Plus funk band  Lily is pretty hot, kindergarten teacher, and hot dog eating champ   I find tinsel distracting   He also betted Marshal off   Is that Spokane, Washington? I always wondered b/c I live by Spokane and it's a big city but didn't really think anyone outside of WA would know about it   Well she had very recently moved to NY at that time so yeah guessing they were friends but not yet really good friends yet    I'm hardly an expert on this but I believe this is why you will suddenly get the urge to poop. Your internal sphincter will get a signal and relax enough for it to exit   And just to mention the external one is voluntary but there's an internal sphincter that is smooth muscle and beyond conscious control   I suppose but how about when the majority of people worked in factories, or the Great Depression where people barely even had jobs. Then they worked at least 40 hrs a week and barely got paid for it   I always have at least 2 lab tests on Dead Week. Makes it a serious time crunch   I keep seeing this on Reddit but really what generation had this luxury? It's pretty much been hard work for America right from the beginning      Well apparently OPs other repost 5 hrs ago wasn't successful enough so he brought out the big reposting guns   If you're thinking about Owen I like using there computers alot more than Holland Terrell. the seats are way comfier and they are always open   Local bounty hunter. Doin the King's dirty work   Started selling Kirby vacuums. I did quit only like 2 weeks in b/c I knowingly went in to it thinking it was a scam but it still was a bad experience   Immunology. Not only is the material very expansive and detailed, the professor is also insanely hard. The tests are 100 points except for the final which is 200 and they are very tricky mult. choice and lots of in-depth application short answer questions. It's a very interesting class but damn it's difficult   Usually really happy/fun but occasionally mellow/down. Sort of depends on what I was thinking about that day   My biggest complaint was that it had the worst search function of all time   That's the worst part. Slutty graphic tee's for junior high schoolers   I know when Ted was in Barney's dressing room Lily comes in asking for Ted that Robin needs him. I can't remember if she said best man or not though   You would have to say Thank you for browsing random   The depression under your nose is known as the Philtrum   Where do the hoes go??   How bout when people out of state drive on our roads? Do they then have to pay?   Sort of like the Styx concert    And Spike learns you can't fix everything by kicking it   The year I owned a Ruckus was the best of my life. I owned those open roads. 30 mph at a time   My day always starts off with 3 eggs in a breakfast burrito with Pepper jack. Best breakfast ever   I'll have to see. Usually nurses and the like love me because my veins pop out a lot   That would be an impressive resume if she could actually do all those things   Same here! Although last time I donated I got really faint and my arm hurt for days. It also took a really long time, like I saw people come and go in the time I donated. I should try again though.    I tried it last Halloween. I don't really like sugary drinks but it definitely tasted like a tootsie roll   That's just ResNet (happened in Stephenson). With deadweek here I'm sure you can expect more of it in the next 2 weeks   Sports games + Finals   The style reminds me of a TF2 character   Except what's in those what appear to be locked drawers at the bottom?   I've noticed in my travels that if you are anything more East than like Chicago people will assume D.C., but for us Seattelites most people around here assume the state   Like Pepperoni only sexy   Hey, Reel Big Fish and Streetlight Manifesto will always be on my ipod   I feel like skinny jeans will always be a thing. At least for me I have pretty skinny legs so they are just better fitting   Who told you to put the balm on?   I just chug water before going to bed. Works every time   Boot up the computer and ask /r/askreddit what to do   Live in Seattle and work in a pharmacy. Either in a hospital there or at a retail place   For one turn off your phone, even one text can get your mind distracted for minutes. Also (IMO) studying can be a lot like working out. It's hard to focus at home with so many distractions and going to the library to study is the equivalent of going to a gym   Best of Van Halen. Panama is such a kick ass song   Don't feel bad about driving slow, especially down hills. It is much more manageable even if you start to slide   In WA it's half that.. but I'm sure it's quite different in NY   And why did I continue to watch it till the end?    It's just too much money for what you get  Definitely this.  I walk everywhere nowadays and these kinds of shoes just don't hold up anymore. I still buy them though.. Good insoles are important though   Ochem lab. Most people did not take the "slowly pour" instructions seriously with conc. H2SO4 and the vials basically erupted when people poured the stuff in. One person got serious burns on their arm   There are a lot of houses on Greek row that could potentially be awesome if they weren't so run down   /r/beertrade   the other half is in Iceland. According to pics anyways...   Brings back the horrible memories of after-school care in the lunch room for me   Hot water plus a cold beer and some alone time. At least for me   I love how you drew the fracture in with it. Good anatomy!   I don't know who you are but that's blasphemy   I've pretty much always hated Lily. But yeah the worst part is the writers acting like her actions are justified. She always does terrible things and at the end of the episode they try to spin it on some way that makes it alright. And yet, hardly anything she does is right.   blues Brothers will always be my favorite movie. It's hilarious, its got blues music throughout, and more talented actors then you can shake a stick at   And why does Irfanview not have 1366x768 as a default picture resize option? Or Gimp2 as well..  	110
 Michael from vSauce, is that you?   It might not sound like much to you, but instead think about 999,999 playstation 4's.    I just wish they still had the service for $7.99 a month.   There is actually a way. It is very simple now because apple removed DRM from all of their songs about 2 years ago. All you have to do now is plug in your android to the computer, find where your itunes songs are stored on your computer (if they arent downloaded, download them first) and just click and drag to the music file of your android device. Album art and metadata comes with each file as well.   How do the cars park/drive off (second picture)?   That FPS Master controller, it actually seems like it would help.   I am learning this program by myself. But i have a question. [Here is the image im trying to reproduce in cad](http://i458.photobucket.com/albums/qq304/gwidas2000/steeringbush1kk9.jpg)  I made the 54 line, but how do i make the 36 line perfectly centered in between the 54 line? I'm going to add the circles later after i get the lines made.

The only downside is that it expires in 3 years. studica.com sells perpetual licenses (they never expire) for design suite and entertainment suite ($22,000 combined) for $500.  	8
 Alright, I'm back. There are even more comments now! I've been sitting here in shock since last night. I couldn't even sleep. I read over my precious comments again and again because I couldn't believe it! After all that's happened, how could I? I'm still not sure whether I should trust what I'm seeing, nothing makes sense...but thank you so much. I really needed these replies. I don't feel so alone now. Anyway, herzdonit, I was thinking I would try to at least explore the forest, maybe I could find a path through one of the lower mountains. Kaizack, funny you say that, first thing I did was try to get my IP through command line. I did a ping but the results were....I'll save that for the update. Right now I'm too shaken to talk about some of what I've uncovered. Please don't leave me. I don't know the right info to give you to help you find me, my mind is too fuzzy. Please don't leave. Please.   I haven't so far, but it's getting harder. I keep finding it in more and more places. Sometimes I wonder if it's spreading. I'm so glad I'm getting through. If this isn't real, I don't even care. It's so good to be talking again.   Oh god, is this real! Oh thank you thank you THANK YOU! Please don't go!  Please, I just really need someone to talk to. I need to know this isn't a trick. I'm so scared and you're finally here. Someone can hear me! I'm sorry, this might be too much for me right now. I'll be back after I'm done realizing this is real. So please stick around.   **[part 2](http://redd.it/3e0do2)**   nbsp;  I'm hoping this works. God damnit, I'm fucking praying this works. It hasn't the last hundred times but maybe this will be the one that gets a response. I don't know how many more places I can post this. I feel like theres nowhere left to shout my message.    According to this computer, nobody has responded on any other site I visit, not just to me but to anything. Nothing ever gets updated, I don't see new statuses on Facebook, and I'm starting to wonder if this computer is even connected to anything at all.   nbsp;  If this does work, here's the first thing I need anyone who sees this to read: **FIND ME.** *Please.*    nbsp;  I cant really help you with this because there's nobody around to tell me where I am, but please try anyway. I haven't seen anyone since I got here and I haven't found any other ways to make contact. The phones are broken, the radios are weird...I happened upon this computer a few days ago and it seems like my only chance of getting out of this place.    Sadly I can't give you so much as a hint as to the name of this place, I haven't found any signs that say anything about a location. I'd tell you my name if that could help but first I need a response. I need to make sure I can trust whoever's on the other end, I hope you can understand.   Maybe a backstory is enough for now? I'll start with the last thing I remember before waking up here:   I was excitedly preparing for a month long vacation from work to a pretty nice resort spot in Jamaica. I had a bunch of unused PTO, I was knee deep in code at work and I figured I needed a break. Hell, my coworkers were begging me to take time off. Apparently I looked exceptionally tired. As a web developer working for at least 30 different clients from a particularly small web firm, Id have to agree with them. The work was indeed exhausting. There's nothing too interesting about all this, but it's what led to the following events so I'm not sparing any details. I can't afford to, ya know?   I had just finished packing my car, my neighbors were ready to start collecting my mail, and I was about to head to the airport for my much needed R R when I remembered I wanted to take a decongestant so my ears wouldn't pop on the plane. I headed to the tidy kitchen in my lonely little house in the suburbs. Everything was spotless and as it should be which gave me comfort knowing it would be this way on my return. It was nice knowing I could just leave everything behind for awhile without worry. I needed a change of pace.   nbsp;  At least thats how I felt *back then.*   nbsp;  I grabbed a pill from my medicine cabinet. As a frequent allergy sufferer, I'd done this hundreds of times before so I wasn't paying attention as I popped the pill and chased it with a glass of water....god, why wasn't I paying attention?   I looked in the pill bottle as I was closing it and noticed the pills were the wrong color. What? They were supposed to be pink but these ones were white. They had never been white. Someone had been in my house and switched the pills...   Panic came over me instantly, I knew I had to act fast but I was stuck in that moment where you don't know what comes first. My heart was racing as I made up my mind. After a few moments of jumbled thought, I finally ran to the sink to make myself throw up.   nbsp;  but then my heart stopped racing. Then the panic went away.   nbsp;  I couldn't even reach up to my mouth to stick a finger down my throat. I closed my eyes and my face began to feel like cotton. My knees buckled and I collapsed. Moments before I blacked out entirely I could feel something grabbing my legs and pulling me across the floor.   I awoke with a pounding in my head and the kind of dry throat where swallowing seemed to make it worse. The fear returned as if I had just been in my kitchen minutes ago, but the change in my surroundings told me it must have been much longer. I was in a broken spring bed with quilted blankets. There were dusty knick knacks and old furniture scattered about the bedroom and the walls were made of unfinished wood. It all reminded me of my grandparents cabin in the forest back home.    I creaked my aching bones out of the bed that was holding me. It felt like I hadn't moved in days. I made my way to the bedroom door, hoping to find a sink somewhere in this old place. I was so thirsty.   Upon exiting, I had to catch myself by grabbing hold of the doorframe. This was the second floor of a cabin that had been torn in half. The staircase and walls in front of me were completely gone, leaving a giant opening to the world outside. Everything else was in shambles. It looked like a tornado must have hit here.   I gazed out at the horizon. I was at the top of a small hill, surrounded by thick forest. There were tall mountains on all sides of this tiny valley, trapping the forest like a prison cell. At the bottom of the hill, following a clean paved road was a town. Early on, I was reassured by the sight of civilization.   I jumped down from the crumbling hallway onto a couch covered in cabin debris. The small bit of good news I found here was a sink at the back of the kitchen directly behind the couch, now completely exposed by the lack of separating walls.   The rusty faucet knob creaked as I turned it. I expected crisp, cool mountain water but instead a thick black sludge came oozing out. useless.   Instead of wasting my strength here, it was time I headed to the town below in search of water and hopefully an idea of where I was. After escaping the wreckage, it was nice to find solid footing even if it was unfamiliar ground. The walk down the road was almost pleasant, if not a little eery. It was quiet. Absurdly quiet. The leaves didn't rustle, there wasnt an animal in sight to make chirps or squeaks. The clouds were dark and heavy, but there was no rain, no wind. There was no change, everything seemed stagnant.   There was a gas station at the top edge of town along my descent. A sign across the entrance said shop quickly which puzzled me, but I was far more distracted by what I realized next. There was nobody filling up the cars parked by the fuel stations. There was nobody inside buying sodas or cigarettes. I walked up to the window of the station and there wasnt even anyone manning the register.   The door was unlocked. Hellllooooo?! I shouted as I grabbed some snacks and drinks from the shelves. I was met with no response, so I left some money on the counter and made a swift exit. Oh right, I used money from my wallet. This lead me to realize my captor had left me with my wallet, id, credit cards, and everything else I had on my person. What was going on here? What did they want from me?   The bottled water was stale but it felt good on my throat. I kept walking into town as I munched on some nearly expired potato chips. The buildings around me were old and poorly kept, full of broken windows and dented street signs. Street lamps had toppled over and cars were crashed into each other everywhere. Perhaps it was from the storm that destroyed that cabin on the hill. Maybe it was something else. I wouldnt know until I found someone with answers.   Yet there was no one to find! Everywhere I looked was empty. I thought I saw a shadow of someone in a window once but when I looked back they were gone. Later I thought I saw someone again but it was just a mannequin in a shop display. Its head was missing and in its place was that same black sludge from the faucet earlier, dripping slowly down its neck.    The more I looked, the more I noticed this sludge on random things across town. It was wiped on signs and billboards, fire hydrants, counter tops and registers in shops, and an old phone box on a street corner.   A phone box? That meant a payphone! Here was a chance to finally call someone! I wish I had remembered to put my cell phone in my pocket before the kidnapping but I was too panicked to remember. This was just as good though, or at least I thought at the time. I put a coin in the slot and waited for a tone.   Now remember how I said the phones were broken? Well broken isnt exactly the word. Something much stranger was happening. Its one of several reasons I want to leave this place immediately. There was a dial tone after the coin had fallen into place but I hadnt pressed any of the numbers. There was a sound of connecting to the other line and everything after that I could hardly explain, but Ill try.    I was only listening with one ear but the sound was somehow binaural. It was all around me like surround sound, but the quality was still that of an old payphone which was a new and chilling sensation. I heard loud wind and thunder, windows crashing and muffled screaming as people ran by. I instinctively darted around trying to avoid the sounds like they were real. I was afraid something was going to break through the glass box I was in. There was the sound of a car running into the broken streetlamp in front of me and I heard the metal bending as if it was falling over for the first time.   Suddenly, just as it had started, everything stopped and I was left with the buzzing sound of silence. The air around me felt electrified and hot. After a moment of reprieve, I heard the thing behind me.    nbsp;  **That moaning.**   nbsp;  Ill never forget the sound. I could almost feel its vibrations on the back of my neck.   nbsp;  I slammed the receiver down and closed the payphone door behind me. I wasnt going to use another phone in this town as long as I was trapped here. I hurried down the street in front of me. then I passed down another. and another.    nbsp;  and another.    nbsp;  It was all the same! There was nothing! There was no one! All the exits from the town lead into dense forest followed by mountains that I couldnt possibly climb without gear. I was trapped here with nobody around to help me. I broke down and cried pathetically and without restraint. Why was this happening to me?! What had I done to deserve this? If they didnt want my money, what did they want from me?!   Then I heard it. Through my sobs was a voice talking in one of the buildings. FINALLY! Someone to talk to. There was someone here that could help me! I dashed inside the building where the sound was coming from. It looked to be an old radio station. There were big bold letters spelling out RMR behind the secretarys desk. The front door was removed from its hinges and missing, along with all the other doors inside.    I could hear a man speaking casually to someone on one of the floors upstairs, I was so relieved. I ran up the stairs like a child on Christmas morning, careful to avoid the chunks of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling. It was once I reached the sixth floor that I knew I was close to the source. I walked past the open rooms until I saw where the sound was coming from.   In the third room on the left from the stairs was the station control room. There was an old record spinning on a vintage record player next to a dusty microphone above all the station controls. The record was making that snapping, crinkling sound that old records do. The man speaking on the record must have been a disc jockey from an old 50s radio show. I had caught him in the middle of a news bulletin as I walked into the room.    Heres the word from the bird, looks like a storm tonight, and its gonna be a doozy. To all you paper shakers and big daddys playing back seat bingo out at the passion pit, dont be a wet rag and get yourselves home. Heres a little something to help you lay a patch. Play that number, Suzy!    Just as he finished his sentence the record cut out to the most shrill high pitched sound Id ever heard. It was so loud it sounded like it was coming from inside my head. Then it switched over to radio static mixed with a gurgling sound like someone was shouting underwater. The sound hurt me to my core, I could feel it inside me, invading my brain. I grabbed the record player and threw it against the wall and watched it smash into dozens of pieces. What the fuck was happening here?! I felt like I was losing my mind! I flipped the radio controls hoping to reach someone.   Is anyone there? Can you read me? Hello hello! I must have flipped every switch in there but it was no use. There was no response. Nothing. **Then there was a knock.** It came from out in the hall. After the phone and the radio I became suspicious of pursuing any more sounds, but what choice did I have? If I waited here in this town long enough I would die. The food would expire, I would run out of clean water, and that would be it. I didnt have the luxury of just hiding away and I certainly wouldnt make it in the forest. I wish Id paid more attention in Boy Scouts.   **Another knock.** I was terrified, but I slowly inched my way out into the hall. I went past three more open rooms and found the source. this was the only room in the whole building that had a door. Next to it was a small desk with a drawer. The knocking continued.   is anyone there? **There was another knock.** Hold on, Im going to open the door. I jiggled the handle. No good, it was locked. I shifted to the table and opened the drawer. As I expected there was a key. Actually there were six keys. I wondered what the other five were for. I grabbed the first and slid the key into place. There was a click and the door unlocked.   nbsp;  Okay, Im coming in. I said with a shaky voice. I opened the door and there was another knock.    nbsp;  In front of me was another door.    nbsp;  Now I understood what the other keys were for. Whatever was behind here needed to be kept hidden. It needed to be kept restrained. So much so that one door wouldnt be enough. I was trembling as I reached for another key. I knew it was stupid but I didnt know what else to do. Whatever brought me to this town couldnt be behind this door. You cant lock it from the inside. That means its still out here so Im in just as much danger. I unlocked another door.   nbsp;  **Another knock.**   nbsp;  The knocks were getting louder, whatever it was seemed to be growing impatient. I reached for another key and unlocked another door. Please, stop knocking. Im going to open the doors okay? Im coming in. but it continued.   I unlocked another door and the knocking stopped. Now it was slamming itself into the door with full force. Boom! I could almost hear the door cracking on the other side. I didnt know if I should continue at this point because the thing inside was getting aggressive. then again, maybe they needed help just like me. Maybe if we could work together we might be able to get out of here. I caved and let myself unlock another door. BANG! It slammed again.   Then there was just one key. One more door. The booming was so rapid and the door looked as if it was breathing each time the thing rammed into it. I was so scared but I wasnt going to give up. BOOM! Another crash into the door. Curiosity was taking over me and I had to know what was waiting on the other side. BANG! Another slam against the wood. I grabbed the key from the drawer and slowly clicked it into place.   The banging stopped. The knocking stopped. It was silent. I slowly turned the metal handle, with no idea what might be on the other side. Whatever it was, it needed six doors just to be contained. There isnt a thing alive that needs that much restraint. My brain was screaming at me to turn around and leave but Id already committed. I was about to see what was inside.   nbsp;  I swung the door open.   nbsp;  The room inside was caked in dust. there was black and white checkered tile flooring and no windows to be seen. Above were fluorescent lights that flickered, struggling to stay lit. It looked like nobody had stepped foot in here for years. I was tense and proceeded cautiously. There was nobody inside. There was nothing here. No tables or chairs, completely empty. I started to sigh in relief when I heard something. It was the whir of a computer turning on. In the center of this otherwise empty room was an old beige computer. It booted up with the classic windows 95 sound, although very offkey, like the internal sound card was broken far beyond repair.   I was still pretty terrified, but at least now I had a computer. Albeit an old one. I saw an internet cable running out of the back, the monitor was functional, things were looking up a little.   I sat down in front of it. I really wish there had been a desk but it was just sitting alone in the middle of this dusty floor. That might explain why the sound was off and the colors were wonky. The dust had probably been getting into all the circuits over the years, I was lucky it even booted up at all.   It loaded the windows 95 user interface with only one icon on the desktop. No My Computer, no recycle bin. Just Netscape Navigator directly in the center of the screen. I double clicked it. The dial up window appeared, but instead of boxes for my information or a place to put in the ip address, etc. it had a single button that said connect?   It was weird that the button had a question mark. It was almost like it was asking me a question instead of giving me an option. I clicked it and waited. Suddenly the old dial up tone started but it sounded completely wrong. Later I managed to search youtube from this computer so I could provide you with an example of what it sounded like because if you hear it youll understand why this doesnt just seem like a broken sound card. Youll know why Im so afraid and why I want to be found.   nbsp;  Trust me though, what youre about to hear isnt nearly as terrifying as what I heard, its just the closest I could find:   nbsp;  **[Dial Up sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LjQ6a773EM)**   nbsp;  Its been a few days now since finding the computer. Nothing too strange has really happened since then. I keep finding more black sludge around town as Ive been exploring peoples homes for food and water. The sludge seems to appear most commonly on the front doors of homes, but also on many of the beds where I assume people slept. I moved a mattress that didnt have any sludge into this computer room so I could be nearby in case I get any replies. Im still not sure if Im connected but I seem to have access to everything on the internet so well wait and see.   So if anyone is out there and youre able to read this, please let me know. Im screaming across the web for help because Im very scared and very lonely! The clouds outside are getting darker every day and I still dont know where the person who took me here is, or what was knocking on those doors. If anything new happens or if I come across anything on this computer, Ill be sure to post an update. Bye for now   nbsp;  EDIT: Something definitely happened. Here's  [part 2](http://redd.it/3e0do2)   No. What? No! They do get a free pass. Not one of us is actually giving them a fair reason to put forth effort into this. I'm more than grateful that they even sent out an update in June to say they can't meet the deadline because that's more than you can expect from most fan projects. I've seen so many projects die and usually you don't see any posts at all for years at a time. This is like royal treatment comparatively. Without compensation of some kind, anything they do is already more than we deserve.  EDIT: this was a reply to someone saying that these developers don't deserve a free pass just because they're doing it for free. I believe that comment was deleted but I still want to make this point.  	5
 What'cha gon'd do wit all dat gold?  All dat gold inside your...fold?   So perfectly looped.  Seamless.   This is terribly inefficient.    Keep swallowing alcohol until your brain erases the memory of such a horrific incident.   Possibly government survey reasons.  Or oversight.   YEAH, BUT YOU STILL CAN'T EXPLAIN THE TIDES!!!!   I know Machida lost one of those fights bad.  Like I think the first one was when Bones tried to murder him.  Not sure about the second one.  Maybe that was the decision loss to Phil?   Oh my god.  What if Jones seriously gets poked in the eye by some retarded fan who hates him or something?   Double cock block!   Yeah, but let's see what it looks like with the Dick Motta years.  "Dick Motta! Yeah we got him!" "Jason and Jimmy!  Yeah we got em!"  "Jamal Mashburn! Yeah we got him!"   meta triggered   Constitutional rights violated all over the map, and you think his comment is a joke?   Let's not forget the CEO's extremely cringey "Every man must care for his own soul" post after the fappening fiasco.  He didn't have the balls to just say that he didn't like the bad publicity (which would be completely understandable), but he had to go an make a moral argument, which was weakened by the fact that he allowed the sub to remain for as long as he did, enjoying the benefits of the increased site traffic.   Of course it has   Oh boy, someone's in trouble now!   ahh yes, who can forget /r/cutefemalecorpses   Lol, the admins were definitely not quick on the ban.  They let that shit slide as long as they were getting clicks and ad revenue, but once Anderson Cooper did his story, and that one guy (violet something?) was doxxed, they swept in on their fake moral high horse.   Type in "boobies"   Sell it to Hollywood for further inaccuracies.            I want a Jagr sitcom   Could we please get a British referee?   That would have to be marketed by the greatest geniuses of our time.  Like, Hawking level marketers.   Here is a breakdown from urser /u/twewy  [Dude, that opener + combo was a work of art. Right feint, left ready, sees the guard go up, shoves the left in there, follows it up a combo to make sure he can't afford to put his guard down, right hook, left hook, right uppercut, left -- just kidding! Right hook. Change it up, make your opponent frustrated and impatient. Tattoo man wants to look, he wants to peek, you don't take six hits blind with nothing to show for it. Ben waits for the peek, and shoves another left in there, this time an uppercut, following with an opportune right hook to take advantage of the weakened guard as it moves inward, over compensating for the uppercut that was just received. Tattoo man realizes his mistake, and solidifies his guard again -- but wait, we've seen this pattern before! You don't win fights in a ball guarding all day! Ben's been building this guy up. Tattoo man hasn't gotten a single SWING out, let alone a solid hit. Ben knows he'll want to make a move soon, so he pauses, just for half a second. Where previously he had driven half a dozen punches in to make sure no room was given, he waits this time. Ben knows the timing perfectly. Tattoo man takes the bait, there, the guard is dropping, right arm is swinging back, this is going to be big, but fatally slow to start! Ben's faster, he already sees how this will play out. Duck and weave, quick left disrupts the knock out haymaker, veers it off course, and the motion he's practiced thousands of times puts him under now-wild right. Tattoo man hits air, can't adjust his momentum, he's vulnerable, he's open! Bam, right hook straight into the jaw, lights out. Insurance left misses, target's already down. TL;DR Ben's a cold-hearted, calculating bastard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2xzs0z/how_acting_tough_can_get_you_knocked_out_in_20/cp50xkj)   Hit the lawyer.         Thank you.

 "Come play with us" :D what is the name of that hotel?! :)   Ha, ha I hated frozen. My twin absolutely loved it so all I ever heard was let it go and it just made me hate the film, also my niece watches it on repeat. I can't escape the evil!! :p   It's amazing to think that life is being created right now. I know we've never met but we don't have to its just a great thing that you, a stranger over the internet - - to me anyway, is going to have a kid and you can watch them grow and be there for them. Congratulations again   I enjoyed that film, it was nice to watch. I also really liked the message :)   I think mulan is mine to. She is such a strong character and I love how she manages to break few  of what's expected of her so she can be happy.   I love the lion king I remember the first time I ever watched it. What a great movie.   Oh I love Aladdin!! I love how Aladdin and Jasmine both have troubles yet they fix each other's, he gives her a sense of freedom and she gives him the freedom to live comfortably (no more poverty). Plus they both love each other which is great.   Well I'm taking part in /r/nofap so I could handle the masterbation part, I'm pretty young so I haven't had sex yet but as long as I could still have kids I would take the money but I would donate a lot of it since money doesn't buy happiness, I would however leave enough for me and my family to lead a comfortable life.      Come back here when your child is born and let us all know if you have a boy or a girl :) (if you want too :) )   Ha, ha :D    Thats good, hopefully things will only get better for you.   That's terrible, I'm sorry you felt the need to do that. I hope everything's ok now?   That's great to hear! I'm sorry about your husband but at least things are good now :)   You're welcome, everyone's important, even if they don't know it.   Your welcome :)   Like I've said to a few people already I'm sorry you felt that you had to do it in the first place but know that there are people that care about you. I hope everything turns out ok.   I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but if you need someone to talk to I'm here.    I hope things do/did get better for you, I hope you got/get the help you deserve and I can tell, from that one sentence you love your parents. They love you too and if you ever need any help ask them. Things can change in an instant and they might be the ones to make that change. I hope things are good for you now and if they aren't I hope they get better.   I'm sorry that you felt like you had to do it in the first place and I hope that things in your life take a turn for the better.   I don't know what you've went through that made you feel like death was the only way out but you have people that love and care for you deeply. Please if you ever come close to it again, ask them for help. It might seem difficult, whatever is happening to you but you can beat it.   You might not be religious but you'll be in my prayers. I'm not qualified in anyway but if you ever need anyone to talk to my pm box is always open. You don't even have to say your name but one talk can change everything.   It's nice to hear that things are better for you. Hopefully you won't have to go through anything like that again. I hope things keep getting better and better for you.   I'm happy to hear that, stay strong.    I'm sorry you went through it to begin with, I hope things get better for you. You shouldn't have to adapt. You might not be religious but I'll say a prayer for you today.   Don't blame yourself. Maybe some help would've stopped it from happening but from what you said it sounds like stuff was already really messed up for him.   I hope everything's ok for you now.    How are things for you now?   I'm sorry that you had to go through whatever you went through to begin with but at least you're here now.   God bless, congratulations on becoming a dad. I hope you two have a smooth pregnancy and you have a happy, healthy boy or girl :)   Same sex school? That's too bad you should try going into a nearby town.   Ha, ha I get that with the amiibos :)   Well I guess to start you should buy a starter pack. I take it you're getting 2.0? If you are then I reccomend either the avengers starter pack or the merida and stitch toy box pack. Then you can buy other characters.   You probably already know this but you can get power discs which give you new toys, paints etc and some are rare so there's a lot to trade and collect.   You can buy characters from the first game and they work just fine on 2.0 but don't buy any playsets from the first one since they don't work on 2.0  Most stores that sell characters do deals on them. For example the ASDA (I'm in Scotland) near me sells 2 for 15 and they sell packs like the girl power pack which gives you violet, rapunzel and vanellope for 13, so look out for deals and also check eBay and Amazon etc. Some characters there are overpriced, like Elsa for example in store she costs 10, online she costs between 20-50. You can get really good deals online though, for example you can get some older characters for 3 when they normally cost 10.   If you have any questions just ask.   Thanks :)   Hey sorry I'm all out, I've given them all away :(   Your welcome :)   Sorry I'm all out now but I'll make another post when I get new characters   Hi, I'm going to give you the code :)   Hey I'll message you maleificent :)      Scotland - I find family very important, even though I argue with my brothers and sisters I love them more than life itself.    Can you link them please?   I really want aladdins flying carpet and I'm willing to give 5 power discs for it.   Hey, don't mention it, I don't use them since I don't play it on ios or pc so I may as well give them to people who can get some use out of them. Like I said though I might not be able to find them all but if I fin maleificent or venom they're yours :)   Here's hopping. They're pretty good at delivering what people want. A lot of people wanted Aladdin and Jasmine and we got them.   Awesome!! :D   It would be great to have star wars imagine the possibilities, we could make our own star wars worlds!!   Hey I've edited the post, can you give it a read since so many people want stitch and merida I'm going to pick someone at random.  Yeah that's what I bought when I got the game   Hey I've edited the post, can you give it a read since so many people want stitch and merida I'm going to pick someone at random.

Hey I've edited the post, can you give it a read since so many people want stitch and merida I'm going to pick someone at random.    I love Alice!! Have you ever played Alice: madness returns?   Is it normal for parents to freak out like that where you live? Don't worry you're not in any trouble she's over reacting. I'm from Scotland and whenever I start dating my parents just say things like   "Ooooh do you kiss her?"  And stuff like that in joking voices, I've only had two girlfriends but they're really cool about it, I mean they joke about it and stuff but when they've met them they've been great, friendly and not at all embarassing. Plus they only do those joke voices for a few days.   Anyway good luck keep us posted.   I think a fuppa is a weird way of saying pubes? If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.    I agree they already have a ton of gravity falls themed items so we should be able to act as some characters.   Oh he'd be great   No problem, hope you enjoy it :)   I know me too but I wish they would ad  more story, I know a lot of kids play it but it's mainly older people so they could make some more stories for the playsets. I would love to see Alice.   No problem :)   Yeah no problem, it also comes with rapunzel :)   Ok no problem :)   No problem :)   Hey no problem I'll message you now :)   Ok no problem, I'll message you now :)   I would love to see Mulan, lilo, maybe in some shape aeriel they could make underwater worlds which could let normal characters have breath metres and let characters like aeriel, or nemo explore under the sea.    Hey, I'd love to help out but I have a three week study period comming up soon so I will only be able to write once or twice a week, is that ok?   I might have to find a couple but here, in my hand I have:   * ~~vanellope, rapunzel and violet (one card, only takes one of your codes away so you can pick another)~~  * ~~Aladdin~~  * ~~Jasmine~~  * ~~Falcon~~  * ~~Maleificent~~  * ~~Gamora/Star Lord~~  * ~~Merida/Stitch~~  I have more and I'll add them when I find them :)   EDIT 1: I'm glad I've been able to give some away, I've crossed out the ones I've given away. I was going to do this on a first come first serve bases but since so many people want stitch and merida I'll pick someone at random tonight. When I find them I should have maleificent, venom, hulk, gamora and around 4 more but I can't promise those ones since I'm not exactly sure where I've sat them but if I find them during the week I'll make a new post. I hope the codes I've given away so far are being enjoyed, I'll keep you all posted :)  Edit 2: I've given away every code I can find now, sorry if you never got one. I hope you all enjoy the codes that I've given. If I find any more I'll make a new post, sorry again if you never got one.   I have both, they really are great games. I did enjoy the playsets but to be  honest the missions are fun but not amazing. You can unlock some awesome things and do some really cool stuff but some times they are pretty repetitive. I think the incredibles, lone ranger and toy story playsets were the best and you can get most pretty cheap on Amazon. For the second one the playsets give some awesome maps like New York city.  I suggest you buy 2.0 since you can pretty much buy everything from 1.0 for the toy box with game currency (sparks), don't worry you don't pay for them you collect them. Plus the characters from 1.0 and the power discs can all be used in 2.0. Some of the best characters in my opinion are:   Violet (incredibles) she can go invisible and has some nice moves and force fields   Maleificent - when you get her wings she is amazing, her magic is strong but slightly slow which is a disadvantage but she is a great character   Stitch - he can't fly which is too bad because I've become so used to that but he can climb on walls, roll around in a ball and he is just an awesome character   Vanellope - she is unique because she can glitch around she says some funny stuff but I might be bias since I loved the movie   Alladin and Jasmine - both can jump pretty high, both look great and have decent voice acting, both have good projectile attacks and alladin can get a second costume if you buy the power disc   Merida - definitely bias here but I'm scottish like her which makes me absolutely love her    Spiderman - I love his web swinging and wall climbing   Dash - his running is fun but a bit hard to control sometimes  Elsa - she can freeze enemies and is surprisingly strong   I like basically every character except for the cars so I could go on for ever but a few honourable mentions go to   Mrs incredible  Rapunzel  Gamora  Tinkerbell  Iron man  And hulk      Oh that makes a lot of sense, thank you I've been wondering about this for a while now.      I drink a lot of milk   ***F***ight ***A***gainst ***P***orn ***Z***ombies   Right now it's 20.14   I don't know if it'll be your thing but check out clean bandit, their songs: real love and rather be are both very good. They're not trance music but it's worth a listen.   Awesome!! I wouldn't call that doodling though. You have real talent.    Who is he?   Actually we now know who he was, he turned out to be a polish man.   1).  I kind of hope he does but I'm happy that they never took away ricks hand.  2). I agree  it could be a while but I'm excited for when we finally do.  3). I loved Carol and Daryl going to get Beth but the premier an  midseason finale were both amazing.      Thanks this actually helps. The main reasons I want to do it are that I love history and I would love to be able to inspire people, get to know them and like you said see them learn.    I suggest you wear black or grey dress trousers and a white shirt (maybe a tie) and some leather shoes.      Thank you I'll go there now.   Here everyone is paid the same. For example a male doctor would be paid the same as a female doctor and a male chef would be paid the same as a female chef, presuming of course they were at the same level in their career.    Wow sorry about your brother.    Here there are equal amounts of all teachers to be honest. Say for example there were five English teachers then there would be five-ish (although some subjects might need a few more if a lot of students tend to take it like biology and chemistry) for maths, Spanish, history, modern studies, music etc.       Actually they were always very anti-semetic. The people who created the KKK were bitter that the south had lost the civil war and that the slaves had been freed. So they made their robes and tried to scare recently freed slaves by telling them that they were the ghosts of dead generals from the war. As time went on they gained and lost popularity but they were at their height of power in the 1920's. Kkk parades were a common sight and they had thousands of members over the US. There was one incident in a small town, I can't remember the name right now, where almost every white man was a member of the klan and as such they could commit any form of racial crime without consequences since even law men had become members, this made life hell For pretty much anyone that wasn't a white Christian.   Do you enjoy what you do? I love history (I'm 15) and I've aced every test. I'm seriously considering going to university and training to become a history teacher. I have a few questions, if you could answer any I'd be so grateful:   * Do you enjoy it?   * What grades do you need to get into a university? (I know every one is different but what did you take? Also I'm in Scotland, UK so that will likely make a difference).   * Have you ever had a student that you truely liked (inspired you/you inspired them) or one that you just hated?   Anything else you could tell me about your job would be great!! thank you   Do you enjoy what you do? I love history (I'm 15) and I've aced every test.

Edging is when you fap but don't orgasm but people on here who say they edge also say it normally leads to them having to reset their counter.   Hi, I'm 15 too!! :) (almost 16) and I've had a few good streaks but I left for a while and I came back yesterday. For me it made me more active (which was weird since I'm an indoor gamer type person), I felt more confident, procrastinated less and I'm just happier in general. Again I was a bit socially awkward. After I stopped I swore to myself that I would keep doing these things and so far I have. Even though it was hard I've forced myself to only game at weekends cause it was taking up too much of my time and study during weekdays, also I go out with my friends a lot more now, I used to only go out once in a blue moon. It is difficult and I don't know if we "need" a sexual release but going without one was fine with me (even though it was hard at times). If you do happen to fap don't get down on yourself, just learn from it and start again. Also if you decide that you don't want to do nofap just don't watch porn. Seriously if you think about it, its just filmed prostitution and you're watching other people have sex, finally read some of the horror stories on here, some guys watched so much porn that they ended up with erectile dysfunction. Good luck in your decision.   Oh I should mention thay I think it's total crap but my sister keeps saying it's not a porno and I want to settle an argument.   Post on /r/books   Yeah we have a different education system.   Thanks that's actually a big help.   Oh I like that I hope the op picks that one.   Hi, I'm from Scotland and I will be going into fifth year after the summer. When I leave School I want to go to university and train to become a history teacher and I was wondering what qualifications I would need to do this. I understand that I'd need history, maths, English etc. I'm doing fairly well in all of my subjects, besides maths. In all of them I am NAT 5 but in maths I'm NAT 4. Will this be enough to get me into a university to train since history doesn't really require maths. So basically I'm asking:  * What qualifications do I need  And  * Is a NAT 4 award in maths enough or do I need to continue it?  Please help, anything is appreciated.   They said 1 though :(   Kim Kardashian!!   Yeah I have halo. I'll send you my gamertag but I won't be online till at least Saturday or Friday because I have exams all week.   I normally put sugar on it and oh my god!! Try it chocolate porridge is amazing!!!   Do you put anything on it like salt, sugar or maple syrup and have you ever tried chocolate porridge?   Here it's 7.30pm exactly and I'm dreaming of it :)   Mmmm I actually can't wait till tomorrow now, I really want porridge.   I normally always eat cereal with a glass of milk or orange juice. If not that then I have porridge or a piece and sausage or egg and toast or a fry up. Most commonly cereal or porridge though. Oh and I live in Scotland.   Aaaw even though the surprise was ruined your having another kid!! :D Good for both of you, congratulations.   Well yeah but I mean like simple physical pain. Obviously crying if you seriously injure yourself is different.   Depends. If you cry when you get physically hurt e.g falling it's a sign of weakness. Cry emotionally e.g after the death of a loved one and it's a sign of humanity, love and strength.   I don't get it. It's just a picture of a door   I don't care about al Gore and who he influenced I make up my own decisions and I understand the science behind.      I'm nit American I only know who al Gore is through reddit. That guy has done nothing to influence me.   I never heard that it would happen in any of those years. It's just a fact maybe if you wouldn't be so ignorant and researched the science behind it you would understand.   It's hardly bullshit.   Humans simply because it would be better for the entire world. Wings = less planes = Less CO emissions = healthier earth. (I know the  should be down the bottom but I'm on my tablet and can't put it there).    Like Pac man, flappy bird, racing games and tons more.   Teacher, life guard or gynecologist.  	119
    how did you find this?   apathy?   HAHAHAHA         Its going to be slow   They would literally remove all impetus I have for using third-party apps if they made it easier to input events into the calendar.  Apps like Fantastical do a MARVELOUS job with this and I don't see whats so complicated about going ahead and doing it in house. Is such a thing patented?   If you're not sure what I mean, look here: https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone   Notes is meant to be basic...no one told you to toss evernote...but for most people this will do   Only because I'm going to IMMEDIATELY start using it.                         is this before or after killing a platoon of people?      Racism isn't limited to nooses and the N-word            I mean, even the Reminders app took a hit now because I needed an easy check-list, not just hand-deleting lists  I can't imagine CLEAR sticking around much longer either.    Evernote just died.  I probably won't need any of these task apps I just downloaded either   iOS 9 was huge   the cop tossed her around WHEN SHE WAS WALKING AWAY  His feelings got hurt and he had to make an example. He's trash    (Fucking Osama was in Langley!!)  Theres no proof of this.    You know what? I don't even care.                the only people who ran were the ones he pulled a gun on   A wannabe zimmerman   Not even pepper spray   Theres only 3 cops. You expect them to harass EVERYONE?   Precisely. She WAS leaving and the cop just had to make an example out of someone.    He's the ranking officer too   Go to hell   You're armed with a baton, taser, and gun...   You go straight for the gun.      This guy was the ranking officer on the scene too. Just insane.   which one?   http://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/texas-police-officer-suspended-after-pulling-weapon-on-teens?  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CG6qsXNUkAA6V5q.jpg   Read the story dumbass  These kids were invited to the pool party and all had passes.   Everyone detained was black   Definitely a gun. That yellow thing that stayed on his belt was the taser   which is why no one who wasn't black wasn't arrested or detained?      http://i.imgur.com/ES8iXzI.gif   i'm interested to see this being true or not because according to this twitter account https://twitter.com/k1dmars it was HIS party and he lives in the area.    Eh...military plays by different rules   inexcusable behavior by the cops   When he pulled the gun out around 3:10...wow  No excuse for that. None.     I needed this.    MARTA was supposed to go down past Griffin         its still cool to me that this is even possible.   Still hungry by noon   Look at MARTA and tell me NIMBY isn't a problem                  OK. So where are the suspects?   Pakistan, ladies and gentlemen       Well how many would you expect?    When we evolved the genes necessary to speak complex language, that was just protein creation at the base of it  Yeah, you don't understand genes   it IS legal though   Great Episode   This is these people's proudest day of their kids and you can't think of anything better than than threatening them under the law for a joyous outburst.  I wish there was a hell for you to go to for even REMOTELY suggesting any use of law enforcement.  You're the worst type of person.   Its a goddamn graduation.  Go to hell      People hate Obama, but the good thing is that you know he's smart enough to never even think this would be a remotely good thing to say. He's not an idiot.    I've experienced this in the lab personally (am a male)            Turns out metadata is good for something   Look on his Youtube channel. He is a KNOWN troll:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVUWVqBhcBe3jMK0eYjG-wg   Its as christian as the followers want to make it.   Its not my money         Just asking people not to cheer.  People always cheer at ceremonies. Bringing the law into this is flatout insanity.   That principal needs his ass kicked.    Prison?  I'm not religious by any stretch, but none of this is illegal.   Jesus prefers seabass over salmon   Is he really?   I mean what about everyone in the congregation who gives him that money?    What always never made sense to me was why he never went for a lesser or used jet   I'm in the wrong business      To even involve the legal system is bullshit and you know it.    ARREST warrants?  Man get the hell out of here. I hope a cop beats you for chewing gum.       I guess you weren't alive during the New Deal         This is UNREAL   Shipping is next.

I read the whole WIRED story, the DPR assassination transcripts, and watched the documentary.  He really tried to kill those people.   or you could type it before hand then paste it                        That isn't proof of a biological link in the manner you've stated.       First of all, you imply that sexuality and gender identity are choices:  They are not.   Has this been *demonstrably* proven??   DAFUQ?!      Why A.Q. Khan is alive, i'll never know.   Or not...  It could be an effort to change the perception leaving the country in the media.  I mean, suppression of NK's abilities works well in maintaining the narrative.

There's a system in place (no matter how imperfect) to affect change in our society. He flagrantly disregarded it (and made a rather handsome profit at the same time).  Sooooooo how do you feel about Snowden and/or Manning?    LIFE.   Remember that.

I see what you did there   Redman still being scolded at 40 years old.  Its so hard to like this guy.       even if its a private organization?   What was actually illegal here?

 Hey, thanks for the answer! I guess with hindsight I should have added that I know what you are saying, and I am proud that people like you exist. My post could be used as a good proxy to see how many investors here are ACTUALLY investors like Graham explained in II.  My analysis reports that I do for the companies I research are around/above 2000 words, and the formula is just a footnote in my analysis. My analysis is completely based on the analysis put forward in II, and I would want to reassure you I do not depend on this formula; usually, by the time I reach it, I already have a constructive opinion of the value of the company anyways.   However, I would be very interested indeed on building this formula properly, and would love it if you could help me.  Thanks again for the answer and link though, maybe even more helpful than what I expected. Have a good day! :)   Hey r/investing! This is a simple question from a simple person. In the formula (for those unaware:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham_formula), one of the key elements is the "growth rate".  My question is, what exactly is this growth rate of? Revenue? Earnings? Something else?  My second question links to the first one. Where does one find / How does one predict the growth rate in the next 7 to 10 years?  Thank you very much for the help!    From my recent trip to Hong Kong.      If I did mistakes, please tell me so :p   For those that are not aware of the video game Civilization 5: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V  For more details on each ideology: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Ideology_%28Civ5%29  Order is similar to communism Freedom is similar to democracy Autocratic is similar dictatorship/Fascism      I completely agree. I just seem to think the same thing in half the posts and here you are writing it. If it makes you fell any better, people did this in the 1920s too, only the technology got faster. That's why I humbly believe personal finances ought to be a subject taught in high schools with proper exams. But maybe I'm wrong.   I wonder what you think when you write this.   What do YOU, ladies and gentlemen, think about GE right now?   Thank you 3   http://www.zonu.com/images/0X0/2009-12-21-11431/Holy-Roman-Empire-1789.png   =  http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/disgusted-oh-god-l.png   Thanks. I did do some mistakes however :(   I agree with you. I think the word "empire" is very broad, just like "country". Is a colonial empire, like the British, the same as a 'grand' empire like the Roman, Persian, Ottoman or Mughal empires? Certainly not. But I also believe there is a third type of empire, lets call them 'tsunami empires' (because 1) sounds cool and 2) I think its a good analogy).   In my humble opinion, I believe the 'tsunami empires' ought to also be considered equals like the ones above. Napoleon, Alexander and Genghis Khan all created real empires that invaded enormous territories, with legacies resonating throughout history.   I agree with your post, the French empire was extremely different from the Roman Empire (and others), but I believe it still was one, the same way Russia and the Vatican are both countries, even though arguably with slight differences.  Do all of these empires even hold one common similarity? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#All_empires_at_their_greatest_extent  PS. Napoleon did win wars. Out of the 7 coalitions, France won the first 5. Each of them was a separate war, with interluding times of peace, and each of them not started by France.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-19  He also did hold on to the conquests. The empire itself was governed in a very efficient way, and unlike Ottoman Empire, where its regions broke away from it, Napoleons empire fell apart due to foreign invasion. Example: After the first coalition, France established puppet states "sister republics". In the second coalition (war), the allies attempted to take away France's conquests; conquests Napoleon successfully held - winning the war of the second coalition.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Second_Coalition http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Republic  Hope I managed to counter-argue in an efficient and unbiased manner. However, being french, I might be biased :P   Thanks. First post 3   Drew this while playing ETW (turns are long)  First map: Pre-Napoleonic Europe Second map: The rise of the French empire till its zenith in 1812. Each colour corresponds for the coalition wars. Third map: Europe at the France's zenith.   Feel free to comment, criticize and complain, I would want to know any feedback.  PS. Imagine how easy it would be to "name every country in europe" in 1812 :p      Over powered. Invade Mughal too easily. No real enemies after that.   I believe u/Elos's response has been very well written as well as thought through. The blame of the war is on all nations, and arguing for the blame of a specific country can be easily done as all of them were guilty of many things, which I assume you know.  However, as Elos and (I assume) everyone else agrees, the guilt is not spread evenly. When analysing the start of the war, the "gunpowder" and the "spark" are two different multitudes of factors, and analysing only one or the other is a disservice to the actual events.  The "spark" can be clearly blamed on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which Elos elaborately explained. But the blame is also on Russia, with its incompetent Tsar and government. Germany too is to blame for supporting A-H's aggressive foreign policy. But the narrative 'assassination = war' is simply put: wrong, as Elos again explained. To add to that, it took over a month between the assassination and the start of the war. The Archduke was a moderate, and was deeply unpopular in the A-H elite. It was, again as Elos said, the ultimatum that commenced the war.  The blame for the "powder" can be blamed on even more nations, throughout history  (I mean, one can blame the Louis XIV for being a douche, which resulted in the kings being douches, which resulted in the French revolution, which resulted in Europe attacking France which resulted in Napoleon invading Europe, which resulted in the unity of Germany, which resulted in Austria being weak, which resulted in them becoming allies, which resuted in WW1, which resulted in WW2, which resulted in the Cold War, which resulted in the space race, which...) but generally speaking, Germany has contributed to the most "powder". Not as much as the treaty of Versailles imposed, but did contribute the most.   An example. The IS attempted mass conversion, and according to some, genocide of the Yezidi people (the brown area between Iraq and Syria). Presently, the vast majority of the Yezidi have fled to nearby Turkey, Kurds, or other areas of Iraq/Syria. This may be interesting to you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinjar_massacre.  This is just an example, and as u/Tollaneer and others would explain, the IS is attempting 'religious cleansing'.   The US had a larger population. But the size of the economy is not all. There's a time lag for economic power to translate into cultural, political, military, technological power.  Assume China's economy becomes larger than that of the US (it is in PPP). It will take decades for the US to lose its military, political, etc. dominant position.  Even though the US was larger, technological innovations still happened in the EU3. Germany had still the largest army, France arguably best medicine, UK most political clout, etc.  Hope this helped.   For those who don't know, Paris, Lyon, French Guyana and Martinique didn't participate because they merged the department and region, and therefore will participate only in the region.  Marseilles, even though larger than Lyon, is not when only Marseilles proper is considered, which is why it is not with Paris and Lyon in the "big league of cities". Greater Marseilles is spread out across departmental borders.  Source: Parisian   Wtf happened to botswana   Every time it passed. Because I repeal it every time. :)   Hey r/civ!  Im sure this question could be interesting for many of you. By best I mean most historically accurate, large, fun to play with. Thanks in advance!  	25
 I have that cup....and the entire set!!  Cute hedgehog, too! :-)   Seeing how it's KU's colors. Yours fits rather well.    Never knew this form of art existed. It's amazing and beautiful!    I was so excited when I bought my new phone and failed to read through the details. From now on, I won't be talked in to purchasing it. I might actually point out how much of a scam it is to the store employee.   Mailed my phone to Cell Phone Repair (CPR) store. Hopefully the estimate won't be too much. It of course broke AFTER I got back from the city that has the store. Unfortunately, I do not want to make that 1.5 hr drive again. A sh*t load of construction + college students = a bad time.   It's a Google Nexus 5. :-)   The answer is yes, but more so no.   Via a close-friend who is a former Orthodox Jew.   Shmuley Boteach is such a schmuck. He just wants to sell Orthodox Judaism in a way that looks hip and cool and to make Orthodox Judaism seem less like...Orthodox Judaism. What he doesn't say is that you have to ritually wash your hands before and after sex, the man has to recite certain psalms before entering the woman, and that it is *best* to be covered with a sheet or blanket, which means that you kind of have to do it in missionary otherwise a sheet will slip off, and why would you do it a different way if you could do it the *better* way? The man also has to wear his kippah during sex. Now, Shmuley isn't Chassidic, but we were Lubavitch, which means the woman has to keep her hair covered during sex. Oh, and sure, the "niddah" period during the period and for an additional week leads to lust, but don't you sometimes want to hug each other? You can't share the same bed during that time? The woman can't even SIT on the man's bed during that time so as to not arouse him. You cannot pass things directly to each other and you have to put something on the table when you sit together to serve as a reminder that you cannot touch or pass things to each other. You cannot even pass a baby to each other. Sure, *sets it next to my hand on counter*, then I pick it up.  Edit: forgot a few words.   The answer is yes, but more so no.

Edit: replaced a few words    There comes a point when smoking too much can revert your problems with PTSD. I had that happen and had to stop smoking.   Husband yelling at wife for never doing anything right. Wife gets up, crying, and leaves. Husband and daughter remain at table. Husband then decides to call and yell at his wife.   I sat there trying not to notice, but they were seated directly across from our table and in my line of view. My Dad asked why I didn't speak up and say something, I was the only one at the table who heard the commotion; I didn't want to piss off the Husband and receive an unnecessary bitching. Felt so sorry for their daughter. Unfortunately she might be used to it.  This was at a fancy restaurant in Plano, TX.     That's what I worry about happening.    I agree. But furthering an understanding and appreciation in art, at a young age, wouldn't be a bad thing.    TL;DR - too much THC with no experience is likely to make you sick.   Does not necessarily mean the brownies/cookies were laced with other drugs.    She makes an excellent point, aside from the modern critique.   She makes an excellent point, aside from her modern art critique.   Through 23andMe I started to question whether the individual I came to know as my Dad was in fact my biological father. Turns out I was right. I never brought it up to my parents because we were going through enough stress at the time.   Mid-August, my Mom finally came clean with the information. She was legally responsible in telling us (as stated in court documents) and withheld this information from us for over a decade. The documents permitted her to release the information once we (myself and my siblings - two older brothers) reached 18 years of age. I am the youngest and now 27. I laughed when my Mom brought out the legal papers. She asked why and I told her I had figured it out months ago. She was upset I never mentioned it to her, and I wish I hadn't waited.   I know who he is, know where he lives. I even know and have is phone number. I've called at least once a day for the past few weeks, but no one answers and the call goes straight to voice mail. I wonder if they have caller ID and decide not to answer (so I often call with an unknown number) or his wife deletes my number (which is screwed up seeing how she's a licensed psychologist - yes, I've done my research). Either way, I have had no luck.  One thing I really find unnerving is ~~that~~ the fact I always wish I had a sister. Turns out I have two older half-sisters and one half-brother. I had a third older half-sister but she passed away in 1983. My middle name was in honor of her.   Would it be wrong for ~~my~~ me to leave a message on their answering machine or messaging him over Facebook? I want to meet him. Based on what my Mom has shared, we have a lot in common; and what I have discovered through my own research.  As a kid, I always brought up ideas and concepts that my Mom thought were stupid and I finally understand why - it's something he would have thought or been in favor of doing.   I saw him once, but didn't know who he was. I was 18 years-old and out to eat at Panera with my Mom. After bringing the food back to the table I told her that a table of older men kept staring at me. I do not recall her reply, but once they left the restaurant, she informed me it was him.    10-15 minutes and small lawn vs. paying someone $50/week to mow.   I've had this happen several times. You stand no chance of finding it because they wash off during a car wash and fall down through the drain. Do what /u/SCUDSMcKenzie suggests and buy a new one.    I disagree. Went to this location twice and felt even worse after leaving. That's when I decided to pay the price and see Gina.  Give this place a try since it's cheap, but know there are better options in Lawrence.    I highly suggest Gina! Went to her for over a year to treat vertigo problems. Unlike Ad Astra, she's certified through the state. Last I heard, Ad Astra was not.    For pricing, she might accept your insurance or provide some sort of payment options. You'll have to discuss that with her.      Their company runs ~~though~~ through Etsy (sorry Etsy) and has thousands of good reviews. They must be lies I tell you....LIES!!!!!!    Fortunately, on behalf of the company, I have chosen to omit their name.   edit: punctuation    She must not have wanted to admit to poor service by her company, so she decided the 'God + Babies = Whatever point she had in mind.'    Touch mi amigo.   Her comment undermines the whole point of "God".   No worries about taking it personally. I found it so unprofessional that I decided it was worth sharing.  It's surprising (and sad) to see that the email isn't written in a professional manner; never mind the religious-based information.   Edit: I added a semicolon.    Unfortunately she's one of the people in charge of the company.  edit: word   Here was my review for the product:  Ordered this product OVER A MONTH AGO and have yet to receive it. Have also contacted the company TWICE and no one has replied.   Here was my review for the product:  Ordered this product OVER A MONTH AGO and have yet to receive it. Have also contacted the company TWICE and no one has replied.        They must be been on their way to something else....Not sure what if it wasn't the chase. As the OP stated, the fire was already taken care of.  With all the new inexperienced drivers in town, I was expecting a crash. Too many darn one-way roads....   Wondered what all that noise was about. I live near 6th street and heard a lot of law enforcement drive by.       Our cat does all of those. It means she wants treats. Luckily for her she's adorable and we always fall for it.    I always have the two during my morning routine of breakfast and Star Trek. :-)   I drink this most mornings and often without feeling tired before hand. As soon as I finish drinking it, I feel like I could sleep a few hours. This even happens after drinking English Morning Tea. I stopped drinking the tea for a while because it started making me sick, even with a full stomach.   Perhaps I have a different reaction to caffeine. Either way, it is quite annoying.  edit: Removed a word.   Thanks for the tip. We actually use all three, depending on which we choose to buy when we restock after running out. I'll definitely choose one of the two next time!      My parents hid the fact we were all adopted by our Dad because our biological father wasn't married to our Mom and we would have been a burden to his family (wealthy and prominent in the community). He paid our child support but I never knew of him - in being more than just a past relationship with our Mom.  I found this out last Sunday. I'm 27, have two older siblings, and am now aware that I have four half-siblings.          Luckily it's located right up beside the house. So a lawn mower didn't find it, but our dogs sure did. For now we're trying to make sure they leave the bunnies alone. Unfortunately there are a lot of hunting dogs in the neighborhood.          Really? Visited KState and KU for a journalism conference back in high school. I always liked KU after my first trip to Lawrence.   We'll make it seem like we're not killing you ever-so-slowly by giving you this amazing view as you eat. Enjoy suckers!!!!   Please tell me they left honeycomb in at least one jar.       Article about the restaurant:  http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/#!/content/1.2722538            Book: 'The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread'   I bake French Bread instead of buying sandwich bread and I've baked English Muffins, too. Still trying to decide on what to make next, but I'll definitely enjoy it no matter what it is! :-)   English Muffins: http://imgur.com/a/lJaEj     Yes, that is the book -   'The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread'   I bake French Bread instead of buying sandwich bread and I've baked English Muffins, too. Still trying to decide on what to make next, but I'll definitely enjoy it no matter what it is! :-)   English Muffins: http://imgur.com/a/lJaEj        Thank you and they taste great!       Forgot to include Burrito King. Great deals, delicious food, and open until 3am.       Half moon   Taking a picture wasn't easy because the moon would move out of view within a few minutes. Plus lining the camera up with the viewfinder made it even more difficult.   Equipment:  SkyQuest 8" scope and 25mm  Orion Sirius plossl    Equipment:   SkyQuest 8" scope and 25mm  Orion Sirius plossl    Sorry for the wait , but I'll ask when I see him later this afternoon!   Yes it is!!! It's a half moon! Can't wait to take a picture of a full moon.    Recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Banana-Sour-Cream-Bread         Have you cut open a tube afterwards to see if there's anything left? I get the feeling that some makeup might be stuck to the sides of the tube.   Either way, that's a great idea. Thanks for sharing!    Did you even read the story? His wife did everything possible to not get him deported; but even that didn't work. Now he's banned from entering the US, returning to the life he had lived for 20 years, for 10 years. Sorry, but that's f*cked up. There are more than enough illegal immigrants who could be deported, not someone who has made a life for himself and someone else.    Should have posted this yesterday but anyway here's the container.   http://www.imgur.com/dl8yQXV.jpeg     Welcome! :-)   Great opportunity to make a ring! That is if you know how to weld...   Unfortunately that wouldn't work. The container isn't the type where you can do that. For now, it's stored in a zip loc bag and should last me close to a month.    Or for people who suffer from amnesia.   Not sure which types would benefit the most by using a cell phone, but it's the thought that counts.  edit: typos and such   Might try using a sharp pair of scissors and cut off the end. Or a steak knife. They'll cut through just about anything as long as they're sharp.    Haha, I posted the picture on /r/pics (they weren't friendly so I deleted the post) and someone thought the same thing!    I've never tried that, but I wouldn't be surprised. Also, cutting the container(s) open might not be as easy.    I deleted the post but I have it stored in a zip-loc bag. Hopefully that will work. :-/   That's a great idea!!! I'll see if I can find any later this week!    The container looks flat due to how I held it so I could show what was left. Luckily the sides fold in and it will keep that from happening.    Plan to store it in a zip-loc bag. Hopefully that will keep it from drying out.       Not to mention it's flat and boring (except in the NE).  Plan to move to Southern California, with my boyfriend, within the next year and say sayonara to Kansas.   The Koch brothers will definitely keep it all to themselves.       Everyone should definitely buy The Forest. Killing cannibals has never been so much fun.    Thank you! I've missed fishing. My step-dad sold my fishing gear once I moved out and off to college. Spending that day at the lake (more so reservoir) with my boyfriend and his dad was so much fun! We've decided to turn it into a weekly adventure (have 7-8 locations to choose from).  Bama as in Alabama? Sounds more exciting that KS...haha.       That I cannot answer. Today was the second time I've gone fishing in over a decade. Someone else might be able to answer your question. :-)   In KS (at least where we live) you're allowed 5/ day.   Also caught a Catfish and a Perch. My boyfriend caught a Drum fish; never heard of that one before today.         Disney Stores.....  If not, they're located in most malls.  They sell clothes, toys, music, movies and other Disney trinkets.  The one I went to has a small theater area playing nothing but Frozen.      You're kidding, right?    Stay out of Disney Stores. They have that video and song playing nonstop.   Remember when you had to have a college email address to sign up for Facebook? Those were the days.   I'll admit their outfits are nice and all, but I love the dress of the lady at the 3rd link in your list. Even after looking through all the competing dresses, it still remained my top choice.

 I want to build up leg strength so I feel the stress of running less on the knee joints.      yea we all did, it's on the internet   Wealth worship   Yea for real   Kill Bill, any scene.   Constantine, when a perfect circle song plays in that club.     That weird sphere of water was amazing.   The Stranger by Albert Camus   Mysteries of Pittsburgh by Michael Chabon. Made him famous.   Thank you, Wolf Hall sounds like what I want.   Any books told through the eyes of a right hand man? It could be about crime, kingdoms, politics, anything.    People aren't as interested in dinosaurs anymore. I'm with you on that. JW wont pass $300 million in America. $800 worldwide total.   Nah. T shirt selling is the laziest form of entrepreneurship. American Apparel is the one making money here   Not unless you live in a Nielsen home!  Unknown to many, but ratings are actually based on sample sizes, basically a small amount of Americans supposedly representing the larger population have boxes in their home that document viewing habits. If you don't have this box, or report by telephone, nothing you watch at home counts.   Booooooo   I'm watching Armageddon right now and its just really long montage so far. First came the "Destruction montage" then the "exposition montage" the "recruiting montage" and now the "training montage".   I'm going to turn my tv off    I would   AC was a job I was hoping to get. Air traffic in the civilian world is something that is never going to stop, so jobs always available.   Superbowl half time show when Katy sang 'Fireworks' everybody I was with just started quoting 'The Interview' it was kinda annoying   Definitely. Song only exist because of that movie basically   Neverwhwre by Neil Gaiman. Best book he has written. London underground, fantasy elements.   It doesn't. Back in 1999 did you have Netflix? Or any on demand service? The industry is different now.   Fuck inflation in regards to box office. All effect it has is negated by the fact that there were less movies and less ways to watch movies back in the day. Saying that Gone With The Wind would have grossed $1 billion in today's dollars is wrong because it only broke records back in the day cause it played for years and it was one of very few movies available to watch.   I'm watching Horns right now, the Joe Hill novel adaption, and the Pixies "Where is my mind" just came on. It completely took me out of the movie because of how well it ended Fight Club.   What songs should never be used again?   Honestly I finished it today and would like some of my time back. The first 400 pages were great but the last third was a chore.   I love immersing myself into the mad men world at least once a year. Seen every season at least three times. Show gets better everytime.    Go for it dude. I realized three years after graduating high school that I wanted to do it, so I did. Now I'm just waiting to ship out. I wish i would have straight after high school though.   Yup. Escapism is beautiful because it doesn't matter who you are when you read something, you can be a rich man or a poor man but the book is the book. All it needs is to be read.   If anything why not just go for a non clearance requiring job?    Wouldnt the college loan be the largest issue?   That's so fucking cool that I expect Hollywood to copy this video in a movie soon.   What type of job would you like, and what type of base would you like?   This one isn't by Justin Lin, its by James Wan the Saw director.   You know in the movies when the bad guy plays games with the good guy? (Die Hard With a Vengeance, Skyfall, Dark Knight) any good books like this?   I've looked into that and what I've read shows that the program is mostly for nukes, I'm not going in as nuke.   I'm going to be starting up my active duty enlisted contract in three months. I have an associates degree currently and was wondering if after I serve my four years I can use my G.I Bill to do two more years of college, get my Bachelors, and then apply for OCS?   I'm going Navy enlisted, but I'd go officer in any branch. I'm 22 years old, so i'd be 26 at seperation, and 28 at bachelors graduation.   I'm going to be starting up my active duty enlisted contract in three months. I have an associates degree currently and was wondering if after I serve my four years I can use my G.I Bill to do two more years of college, get my Bachelors, and then apply for OCS?   The books doubled in page count after PoA.    They change the title in other regions?   And Harry Potter of course. Fantastic series.   Shit, can you even stomach the plane ride to Great Lakes?   Daddy I want a pony!!   Both of those are my favorites.   Can you explain this concept to me as if I was a five year old?   Shit, come to think of it, never have read a Compton book.   Currently taking a meteorology class and I realize that its a very interestingnsubject . Any fiction out there that deals with weather? Maybe hard conditions, or the stir of meteorologists? Thank you.   I dont know and i dont care. The Sun also Rises was the best book I read last year. Farewell to arms was tragically great as well   Because he saved soldiers from his side   I second your suggestion. Might still be on sale at bn.com for $2.99   Nope, R rated Cody Banks looking film with an unknown actor as the protag.  Definite bomb. Dredd numbers for sure.   A prophet      Part of the reason? Its most of the reason. Most effective ad campaign I've ever seen. The trailer itself felt like a short film.   That's weird  I graduated at 18 and in summer months and they never said anything about it.   So when it bombs they're gonna blame the rating instead of the everything else.   I hate fantasy epics or "true" epics, like LOTR, Mummy films, Seventh Son, Troy, Hercules, Kingdom of Heaven.   When most of the people that die are random soldiers its hard to care.   "well if you insist Fox"   No one ever told me about how intensely absurd the minds inner monologue is during psychedelics.   I felt as if my thoughts weren't my own, and its really hard to describe past that.   Fuck YES!  I love when entertainment makes me feel.      It wouldn't be a reality show, it would be a scripted workplace comedy, like The Office or Parks and Rec.   I'd be willing to receive one of those copies  	62

 |Riposte.   This is definitely Krieger before ISIS hired him on. Beardless of course   The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. A pretty straightforward story line with the most complex stream of consciousness flow ever. Its a total mind marathon.   	3
 Also just continueing with the whole foreign workers part.  The death count of  the workers building the new stadiums is already over 1000.   hydro_flames anapchat   hydro_flames   I really like the new youtube streaming channel but will games still be saved on twitch? I would like to see things like Eurotruck where there is copyrighted music saved to both Youtube and Twitch.On Twitch copyrighted music is much more lenient and then  people on mobile can still watch non music edition on Youtube .  	4
 Thanks for the downvotes.    Maybe, or maybe it was the frank and to the point response of someone with a clouded and biased perspective. Did you read the link?    People are charged and convicted for everything and anything, left and right. We currently have more people incarcerated in the US than any other country in human history.   You're obviously biased. This type of reluctance to prosecute is universal in cases involving the police. In states that require a grand jury indictment, the prosecutor purposefully includes evidence that casts doubt on the guilt of the offending police. A prosecutor would never, ever, in a million years, do this in a grand jury hearing involving a nonLEO. Prosecutors rely heavily on police departments to bring charges against offenders. They're part of the same team. They're not going to hold the police accountable anymore than they'd hold themselves accountable. They already have judges, prosecutors, grand juries, and the entire system on their side with everything they do, no matter how depraved. They don't need you on this sub sucking them off.  I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. These men recklessly killed an innocent child. If we're to have any faith in our criminal justice system or the rule of law in this county, it's imperative that they are tried and convicted.    Eternal life after death is not the same as someone coming back to life after dying.  Tell that to the hundreds of millions of true believers.   It's really not my fault that you couldn't tell a clear joke.  I explicitly asked you if you were joking. It's your fault that you assured me that you were "Not at all.".      I'm not saying any of this.   Atheism is not an organized belief system by any definition. If you're a Christian, you're still an atheist in the fact that you do not believe in Thor, Kali, or any one of the other millions of gods that mankind has imagined throughout history.   There is undeniably a Christian majority in the US, and I just described how they vote. Don't like it? Fine, but that doesn't make it less true.    There are those who honestly believe that they will granted eternal life upon their death. Don't test the levels of ridiculousness that others can reach when it comes to their belief systems.   And again, I straight up asked you before pursuing my point. You had the opportunity to make it clear that you were joking. I can't think of any better context than that.    Did you remove the offending link? Maybe put in an edit explaining as much? I'm not going anywhere near those links without some type of assurance.    Really? So when they vote for candidates who demonize the poor, minorities, and immigrants they're considering the scripture? When they vote against healthcare reform they're considering the scripture?    That all depends on what one considers a state's right to be.    [It's Supply Side Jesus!] (https://youtu.be/Gc-LJ_3VbUA)    So you're arguing that what is perceived to be a failure or incompetence within the system should restore faith in said system? And what exactly do you mean by failing to execute people? My state executes inmates quite regularly.    Then you should have said as much when I asked you if you were being sarcastic. [Sarcasm does not translate well when conversing with strangers over the internet.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)    How about plain old fucking innocent?  [Cameron Todd Willingham (January 9, 1968  February 17, 2004) was an American man who was convicted of murdering his three young children by arson at the family home in Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham#Post-execution_attention)    But, yet murder rates are unaffected. Is it possible that yours is a bullshit and/or meaningless statistic?    Am I joking?   What's semi-permanent about death?   For instance, hair dye is labeled "semi-permanent" because you can cut the dyed hair and eventually your hair will grow out as your natural color.   Have I missed something about executions? Is there some process by which the state can restore life when it finds that it's made a "mistake".    Yeah, at least I'd know and at least I'd be comfortable in the fact that my animals and therefore food was treated humanely and allowed to live a healthy life.    You must have figured out some way of restoring life to the innocent people who have been and will continue to be unjustly executed.    It's not just private prisons. The whole justice system is biased as in relies on the proceeds from keeping people in  the system in order to cover payrolls and other costs.    Ah, the human tax that supports the justice system. The number or percentage of innocent folks that must be unjustly incarcerated or executed in order to have a "just society". The argument that causes brain cancer.    The difference is that people were writing about Khan and his doings during the period in which he was alive. In order for it to be an apt comparison, there would have to be no writing about him at all until after his death (which also wasn't recorded).   I'm not interested in musings and whatnot. I'd like hard evidence like someone who wasn't illiterate having actually spoken to the man and recording his experience, or maybe some secondary sources like certification or tax records.    So you've discovered a way to restore life to a man or woman who has been unjustly executed?    So murderers can take lives, but they shouldn't have their lives taken away from them?  Maybe you should read the last line again. You seem confused.   Nobody should have the right to legally murder someone, taking away one's greatest freedom - to live.  Murder is always wrong and the government shouldn't be murdering people.      Being put to death is semi-permanent,  Is this sarcasm?    I have a question. Where was god in SC, when nine of his followers were worshipping HIM in his own house?    Personally, I wouldn't be as worried about organic as much as I am about them being able to move around outside and being properly processed. If I had enough property outside of town i wouod already have a coop.    I'm going to catch that dog just so I can give it tap water.    Yeah but just because he was written about until after his death doesn't mean he didn't exist.   You're not wrong, but that's still not evidence of his existence, which is what I was talking about. Personally I don't care if he existed or not being that I'm not a believer. I just don't cotton to "historical facts" which have no objective evidence supporting them.   Pretty sure that same logic would need to be applied to genghis khan if we're being consistent.  Is this true? Did no one write about Genghis Khan while he was alive? I'm going to look that up. But undeniably there are countless cases of evidence of his existence including the DNA of his descendants.   Edit: On second thought your claim about Genghis Khan is obviously bullshit. The man who began a campaign to conquer the world was written about extensively by enemies and allies.       Got it. I imagine it's possible that one might locate a local farmer as a source of feed at a more reasonable rate, but otherwise, I can see how it would be difficult to provide organic feed all of the time.    Like I said, dipshit, I'm thirty-four. You're not insulting me. You're just making mlre of an ass of your cop apologist self. Go somewhere that people can stand the presence of a kid killer's apologist. Like I said PnS is perfect for you.    Go to PnS. There are plenty of steroid shriveled police balls for you to suck on over there. They'll be happy to take your things from you and rape your loved ones, which apparently is what you want. So go fuck yourself.    This is who you have patrolling your communities armed to the teeth.    Sometimes ~~people~~ police do bad things that there simply are not criminal charges for.   FTFY.     Oh, okay so now you're suggesting that protocol when dealing with a **potential** gunman is to speed as close as possible and shoot without even really looking at the suspect first. I wasn't aware that the police were being trained to operate as death squads.   I will not "chill it". I'm not fourteen, I'm thirty-four. This is a clear case of two officers, on video recklessly shooting a child, and letting him die in the grass and snow. If you want to defend these monsters go to PnS. You'll be greeted with open arms by the other murderers and robbers. I'm sure they'll even let you buy them a beer or wash their cruisers.    That's all very convenient for these officers, when we have teenagers serving life sentences for being involved in a burglary where one of their accomplices was shot by the homeowner. It seems to me that 85% to 95% of the time, the prosecutor gets the charges and the convictions they want. When the police kill a child in cold blood; "It's too difficult."   No first I said "fuck you" and described you as a "bootlicker" and as scum, then you called me an asshole to which I responded in kind.   There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say.   How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge.     You're a complete dipshit. The fact that you're even mentioning risk assessment here illustrates how biased you are. The police did not assess the risk involved in this situation. Risk assessment doesn't include positioning oneself as close as possible without first assessing the risk.   You need to understand things dont work like they do in movies.   Right. Tell that to these two gung-ho Dirty Harry wannabes. Don't tell me that. I'm the one arguing that police should follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone involved.   You're a police apologist and you're here defending the indefensible. Will you be singing the same song when the police kill someone you love? You make me sick.    I think the evidence speaks for itself. The police abandoned protocol, recklessly sped as close to the suspect as physically possible, and proceeded to shot him multiple times. They then failed to render aid and treated his child sister like a violent criminal. There are plenty of charges that would be appropriate as well as the charge of murder. They're scum for what they did. You're* scum for defending them.    There are* other laws that could apply here. Criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, accomplice to murder before and after the fact. If the DA figures out a way to avoid charging them, it's not going to be because of a lack of things to charge them with.    Ohio is an open carry state. So it wouldn't necessarily have been illegal even if the gun was real. The police could have pulled up to the curb and used their PA to order the boy to drop the weapon and get on the gound. Instead they flew in as close as possible to surprise him and began shooting him before the car even came to a complete stop. They then refused to render aid to him as he lay gasping on the ground. They manhandled and handcuffed his younger sister and threw her in a police cruiser.   Everything about this case is fucked. Both of the officers involved should be stripped naked and publicly flogged before being thrown in prison for the rest of their lives. They're scum for their murderous insolence. You're scum for defending them.    Well, in this case he wouldn't have been killed. The kid wasn't even holding the air pistol. They just murdered him because they wanted to kill a black guy. They have to be held accountable.    You're the asshole defending two ruthless murderers. As you may be able to tell from my comments here, I think your opinion is shit and could not care less about* what you think of me. Your lack of judgment on this very obvious brutal murder makes it clear that you have nothing useful to say.    Yes they're criminals. They murdered a twelve-year-old boy in cold blood. This isn't rocket science. Or do you feel safe with these jack booted thugs patrolling the neighborhood your kids play in?    Fuck that. They obviously didn't follow the rules to the point of recklessness and someone got killed. They deserve to be tried. If you can't get that through your thick scull then there are plenty of other subs that would love to hear your valueless opinion.    Fuck you. Those cops executed that kid. This is one of the most egregious examples of police brutality, but what do you know, along comes bootlicker here to defend the murderous thugs. We have every right as tax paying citizens to demand that the police follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone around.    Yes I have. Oddly, no one had to die.    Does that include cases where the officer knowingly puts himself in that situation? Ohio is an open carry state. There's no excuse for what they did here.    You charge them both for not following procedure, ignoring the law and the safety of the community, and murdering a twelve year old boy.   Edit: I'd like to point out that   Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.  Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.  So OP is at the very least, being disingenuous about there not being a legal basis for criminal charges in this case. This is one of the reasons why it favors the police to drag these things out as long as possible. People forget the facts and the narrative can be skewed in the court of public opinion.     It's not misleading. There still isn't any justice for Tamir Rice and his loved ones.    Latest? This happened long before Freddie Gray was murdered.       That's very true. Historians generally agree that there was a man named Yeshua. It doesn't mean that there's solid evidence. I've heard this argument hundreds of times, but I've never seen any convincing evidence. No one wrote about him during the period he would have been alive.    Yep. Most of the racists left the Democratic party after the Civil Rights movement.    Came here to say that Captain D's is far superior. Fuck Long John Silvers.    Yeah, fuck best buy!    Sounds like an interesting and depressing class.    Yeah. It kind of illustrates how meaningless that award is, doesn't it.    East Cape Girardeau is barely even a town. It's more like a couple of trailer parks and a strip club.   Edit: typo.    There's much more to it than that. Read The Trial of Henry Kissingser. The guy's a fucking scumbag.    *mortar shell   No, Hard Candy is about a young girl who resorts to vigilante justice against the child predators who killed her friend.    Can you explain. My grandma raised chickens until all of her kids grew and moved out. I don't remember anything about it being expensive and sure cleaning chickens is work, but I wouldn't say it's the worst thing in the world. If it was expensive I can't imagine my grandparents would have had anything to do with it.    Not necessarily. You do have the option of raising your own chickens for meat and eggs.    Fuck everything about this. Sounds like another department that should be disbanded.    This shouldn't have been deleted. This isn't exclusively political.    That's sad. They can't properly celebrate murder with a memorial to the victim around.    How the hell does shipping meat thousands of miles away for processing and then returning it save any money?    You're a drooling idiot.    It may have something to do with the municipality. Walmart gets a lot of money for development and tax breaks from. local communities. I imagine that that some cities want to see a certain number of positions in return for their investments.    Employers have every right to prohibit their employees from even using tobacco products. You don't have to be a police officer. You can choose to find work in a different industry.    No, your job should prohibit you from using steroids and most mind altering chemicals.    Summary execution.    Right, without the government there would be multiple providers. Except that's not true at all. Without government there would be one provider still and we would not have the internet.      What the hell are you talking about?    No, it's definitely [corporatism] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism) responsible here.   Statism is such a broad term* it would almost seem like it was created for the Republican party. It wasn't. It refers to this:  statism  See definition inOxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary  Syllabification:statism  Pronunciation:/stdizm/  Definition ofstatismin English:  noun  A political system in which the state hassubstantial centralizedcontrol over social and economic affairs:theriseofauthoritarianstatism   Word Origin and History forstatism  n.  c.1600,inreferencetochurch-statematters;1919astheoppositeofindividualism;fromstate(n.)+-ism.  We don't have that in this country. We have many industries that aren't properly regulated in this and many other areas. We've allowed the ruling class to rule both the economy and the political process.    I like what you have to say. I see no reason why a combination of software and hardware can't do better than 80%. That's a disturbing number considering that there are laser corrective machines that basically correct ones vision to 20/20.   Yeah let me rephrase that.    You're talking about laser surgery. We were talking about laser diagnostics.    I would prefer it never had any public funding. I don't care what stupid people do **in their homes and churches** as long as they pay their taxes.   Edit:added bold text.    Violence always begets violence.   I would argue that fascist policies and horrific circumstances have put religious fundamentalists, who are sometimes also rapists, in power in Afghanistan . I don't know enough about Afghanistan to form the most well rounded argument. If I had to chance a guess about the current political, social, or economic situation there, I would start with the total war that has occurred there in the last forty years or so. Then i would move on to the intermittent and half-assed efforts (if even that) at rebuilding and supporting those people you hate. This dipshittery comes from mostly people you think are superior, they were the major parties from the beginning to our current untenable situation.   [Afghanistan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Afghanistan) has a long and beautiful history that is both multicultural and worth learning about. What has happened there is truly horrific. But, it's easy to knock a place and a people because of its current situation.   I mean the best time to assess the United States and it's cultural developments would have been in the last third of the Civil War, right?   Edit:Fixed the link.    I have it in my android keyboard. It depends on your platform. Gee, [LMGTFY.] (https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100402193438AA42qqB)    I dunno, you tell me.    The visual information that comes from your eyes is more fucked up than you think. It's not that we have too many receptors in the middle of the eye, or even the fact that we have an [actual blind spot in the middle of each eye] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)). As far as I understand it, it's the complexity of the eye's shape, the photo receptors, and how they interrelate to the brain. We unfortunately possess much of the same eye structure of that of a fish. Of course light works differently underwater* and so does pressure.    Explain to me OP, how this is more of a failure of the president than it is the legislature. Each time a reasonable bill is presented to properly fund any amount of reform, the GOP dominated legislature slashes and trims it* into ineffectualism. It's convenient to attack the president, but a little research will reveal to you that the bill he supported was defeated and replaced with a joke that provides one tenth of the funding as was intended.    Antitrust!? That's socialism!!    We have and continue to do so. The depth of that problem is abysmal.    Corporatism in action.    I wouldn't either, but I certainly wouldn't blame Islam solely for their fucked up behavior and beliefs, anymore than I would blame my mother and her religion for the ku klux klan.    No one is perfect. Hitchens was antitheistic. Islam is an easy target. In some locations Islam is the major religious threat to rationalism and secular society. But, in mine for example, Southeast Missouri, Christianity threatens secularism and rational decision making.    How do you figure?    This kind of shit is why I'm in other threads arguing against blanket incarceration.    If you feel it did then I'm satisfied.    You should know about [Poe's Law.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)  I have no love for any religion but I like people and I have a few friends who are Muslim. Seem like regular guys to me. They appreciate the secular aspect of our government and treat me, an atheist, with the same respect and dignity as anyone else.    I think I understand what you're getting at, though I disagree with the analogy of eating dogs as there are valid arguments against that, I think I agree with you.   Really, I am glad they're offended. I'm offended each time a child is taught about hell and how they and everyone they love is going there if they fail to live up to "god's will". I'm offended by their often successful attempts to push religious indoctrination into science class or any other aspect of public education. I'm offended by the mutilation that was perpetrated on me and  the other **billions of defenseless children**. I'm offended by their attempts to subvert our secular government. I'm offended by their lack of humanity, tolerance, and compassion.   If they choose to be offended by two adults who love each other and want to make it official, then shame on them. They're only showing their own asses. History will not be kind.    I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in an appropriate facility in this case. Maybe you should read through the thread a bit before commenting.   Edit: Since you so cowardly deleted the comment I'll ask your question again and answer it.   OP: "I don't disagree" is vague, do you think that this ruling might have been correct?   I do.   I'm not a Swede. I'm not one of the Swedish caseworkers, judges, lawyers, or jurors involved in this case. I dont know this young man who was a minor child when he committed this heinous crime. I don't know his background, his medical history, or what types of horrors or abuses he was exposed to in Somalia. I don't think that you fit any of these qualifications either. But, now that you're asking me questions again, I'll repeat myself:  Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another?   Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda?   You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.    I've never worn contacts and probably never will. I don't mind glasses, as long as I can get a prescription as often as I need. I'm seem to be in need of a new pair as lines are starting to slant a bit. I don't understand the allure of contacts. I can't stand touching my eyes and eye infections are terrible.    I'm an American. Criticizing the government is what we do. How is it hypocritical to criticize my own government when it is known to be draconian in the implementation of its laws? How is it hypocrisy to appreciate another country who is taking a different approach. Maybe you're confused about the definition of hypocrisy:  hypocrisy  hpkrs/  noun  the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.  synonyms:dissimulation,false virtue,cant,posturing,affectation,speciousness,empty talk,insincerity,falseness,deceit,dishonesty,mendacity,pretense,duplicity;More  That should clear up any confusion that you're experiencing.    I'm assuming that you've only read the two posts that you've responded to. Shame on you. I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in some sort of youth correctional facility. But either way, it's not our decision to make.   I have a couple of questions for you? Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.    Cool, thanks.    I dunno. Ask /u/abortionaut. He seems to be all for it. I'm sure he'd take a page or two from the works of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich.    I'm not sure what you're getting at. I personally think this kid should have to do a couple of years in juvenile or some kind of Center for youth offenders. But it's not my decision to make.   What happened to that girl is terrible and the offender needs to be dealt with. I'm assuming you're an American by your vengeful attitude and you posting this shitty article that mentions Anders Breivik as if he was somehow relevant to this case. Perhaps you can put your thirst for blood aside and consider the long term consequences of incarceration and what goals are ultimately meant to be achieved.    Fine points. I agree that education needs to be the foundation if we're going to effect any real change in the US. More needs to be done to eliminate the root causes of poverty itself, which are manifold. I know a lot of conservatives like to cite welfare programs as creating a culture of dependency, but I think that's disingenuous.   We have for several decades, fostered a very lucrative black market for several plants and compounds that we know will always command a certain level of demand. Instead of allowing criminal individuals and organizations to profit from these markets we should decriminalize, legalize, and heavily regulate even the most illicit substances. (It's ironic that the federal government still views cannabis as one of the most dangerous compounds known to mankind) A good example of the effects of sufficient regulation and taxation would be the [trend of teen smoking] (http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/substance-abuse/tobacco/trends.html) over the last forty years or so.   I know this may sound simplistic initially, but it can be done. And yes, I'm talking about the legalization and heavy regulation of stuff like heroin and meth. You may or may not know that in much of the country we already give addicts methadone and other analogues to heroin in very strict and supervised environments. Methadone is not demonstrably safer or less addictive than pharmaceutical heroin. Hell, methamphetamine is a prescribable medication under US law, and we prescribe Adderall and other amphetamines to children (which I do not advocate. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of our draconian drug laws)   If all of these things were reasonably and inexpensively obtainable under rationally controlled and supervised conditions, it would render black markets unprofitable. In the meanwhile, we can actually address the problems by requiring counseling and offering treatment to addicts. Dismantling the drug cartels and offering a safe and controlled environment for addicts takes them out of their comfort zones. I can't imagine many people saying to themselves "I've never had it so, I'd like to go down to the clinic and try some heroin or crack". But, I'd prefer that if they felt that strongly about it, they had access to a clinic with mandatory counseling and safe conditions rather than being fodder for pimps and other types of undesirables in flop houses and whatnot. Prohibiting drugs puts drugs in the hands of criminals. I hear this argument in regards to gun legislation all of the time but rarely do I hear a rational proposition for dealing with our country's drug problems.      I'm not sure what you're getting at, but what does race have to do with this?    I don't disagree, but there was no murder in this case.    Where in the text does it say that we have an inalienable right to own and bear assault rifles or even pistols?  We have a Supreme Court to interpret the text of the constitution. I'm not accusing you personally of this, but I think it's odd how some find it convenient to forget the way the system works when they're faced with a ruling that they disagree with.   All of this hullabaloo about gay marriage is extremely odd to me considering how it literally affects no one but LGBT people and their immediate families. This has absolutely no effect on Christians, their churches, or their closely held beliefs.    Let's hope she finds a better job in a substantially less hateful environment.    We do. And we have a longstanding court defined by that document to interpret those rights. They've ruled some fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered in the protections enumerated by the constitution.    Christian conservatives and other prolifers.    He* grew up in New Madrid, MO. That's just down the road from here. My grandparents lived there for a time when I was young.    It seems kinda sad. I know they were violent criminals, but I didn't realize that they would be denied a proper grave this way. Not that I'm saying it's wrong. It's just surprising.    I've experienced some of that. The last time I got a new prescription, I hadn't been wearing glasses for a few months because they were broken. When I received the new pair my tablet appeared to be a slight trapezoid instead of perfect rectangle for a couple of weeks. I had to be careful going up and down stairs. Thanks for the info, Doc.    Nor should marriage lose its privileged state. The sanctions and privileges afforded to married couples are there to support social stability, family planning, and child rearing. I can't think of a single reason these things shouldn't be available to gay couples as well as straight couples. It's good for families.    If it's an issue of a personal inalienable right, which the right to marry the person of choice certainly is, it's not up to the state whether it should be allowed or not.    Marriage is a legal term. It's been one for quite some time.    No you're right /u/abortionaut. We should look at statistics on crime and race, ignore all other socioeconomic factors at play, round up the offending ethnicities, and put them in camps and deport them. /s  Edit:grammar    I'm glad it offends him. He like everyone else, needs to learn that we as Americans do not have a right to not be offended by things, and especially not the freedom of others.    Which is right up Rand Paul's alley.    That's nonsense. Race doesn't make a person more likely to commit crimes.    So they give out that information to visitors?    I have astigmatism and slight nearsightedness and it seems like they can never get my glasses right. I put up with it and just wear them. My wife is the same way. Would I be better off just asking for this procedure? Is it expensive?    Looking back at your comments, I'm curious as to why you chose to focus on that study while ignoring the definition of recidivism provided at the top of the page in question.   Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that resulted in rearrest, reconviction or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release.  Is it because this very relevant definition hurts your argument, and the study works as a fantastic distraction from that fact?    Who said anything about giving anyone a pass? I'm saying that it's wrong to suggest that someone is a criminal because of their religious background. Not that it's okay to assume* that everyone who is religious is a criminal or to give anyone a pass. I guess I could link to the strawman Wikipedia article here if I wanted to be a condescending jerk.    Did you even read the article?    Excellent article. Priceless photo of Trump.    What's conservative or short sighted about opposing an ideology that is inherently anti-women and anti-gay?   You mean like Christianity?      Are you suggesting that there is racial profiling being perpetuated against white folks?    It's not exactly accurate. It isn't a person's race that makes them commit crimes.    Interesting post. I was surprised to learn that these graves don't even have names on their markers. I understand the purpose in burying them in this manner, but shouldn't the families still allowed to locate and visit their deceased loved ones?    I don't disagree that culture is part of it. But it's difficult to tackle the problems presented by cultural backgrounds without first addressing poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors. It's not like one can strip a person of their cultural background nor should they. There are absolutely aspects of some cultures that are harmful to women and other minorities. It's a difficult problem to address. I guess the idea is that once a person or group is appropriately educated and raised from poverty, these other issues should take care of themselves. I don't disagree that there is a certain amount of assimilation that can and should be expected from immigrants entering a country.    It's not relevant as I am an American and have every right to expect to have a say in the functions of my Democratic Republic. I'm not saying that you can't have an opinion about Sweden. I'm saying that it's unqualified and valueless so don't expect anyone to listen to it or care. You have no authority there. Not even a vote.   You have no reason to label me a hypocrite.   And I will continue to live in the US and vote in every election cycle, thank you very much.    Why would I be arguing about Saudi Arabia? How is that relevant to this discussion?   I'm comforted by* the fact that you have no authority on* any of these topics and cannot enact your draconian will upon others.   You didn't address the fact that here in the US, we frequently toss juvenile offenders into adult prisons where they are habitually beaten, raped and otherwise abused for much of their adult lives. I'm assuming that this fact doesn't bother you.   Please don't talk to me about morality or what is just.    This "man" was a 17 year old juvenile offender.    Again, you're missing the point. Without a control group, like people who received community service and probation, such research only shows part of the pictures.   Also this study has no effect on the definition of the term. An offender doesn't have to have spent time in prison in order to be considered a repeat offender. That's just obvious.    It may not be common knowledge, but those suffering from mental illness are statistically no more likely than the general population to commit acts of violence. The truth is that* the mentally ill are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault.   I don't think anyone would argue that this crime is excused by whatever psychological issues he may be experiencing, but there's no question that such things should be considered during sentencing.    That's one study. Not all research on recidivism would only follow exprisoners. That would be a mistake as there would be nothing to compare the recidivism rates of prisoners vs other types of punishment.    recidivism   \ri-si-d-vi-zm\noun  :a tendency to relapse into a previous condition or mode of behavior;especially:relapse into criminal behavio   http://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/pages/welcome.aspx  It's generally used to describe a return to criminal behavior. Obviously we shouldn't be returning people to prison who haven't done anything wrong, right?    I am American and I firmly believe our system is worse than backward. It's completely counterproductive and criminal in and of itself. Our penal system has a long track record of making criminals more depraved and incapable or rehabilitation.   Sure just punishment is warranted, but you could hardly argue that throwing juveniles into adult prison to be abused, beaten, and raped to be "just punishment" without some serious cognitive dissonance. What's the point in punishing offenders in a way that denies their humanity and violates our own? It doesn't change the past, and the end result is an offender who's more fucked up psychologically and less capable of functioning and participating in society.    The duty is to all of society, not only the immediate victim. Yes prison is usually necessary in the case of rape. I wouldn't argue with that point. I will argue that's it's not your place or mine to decide what judges, juries, and lawyers should do with a juvenile offender in their own sovereign state. If Sweden prefers the focuses of their criminal justice system to be on providing aid to victims, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism  then that's their right.    If anything, recidivism rates should be higher in a system where only the most serious criminals end up in prison in the first place.   I'm not convinced that Sweden has such a system. This offender was a juvenile under their legal definition. For better or worse this is why he avoided prison time. And why would they be higher? Recidivism is about reoffending not about returning to prison.    If you're not willing to rely on facts or provide any sources, why do you insist on being involved in this discussion?    You're assuming so much with your statements. First and foremost, you're assuming that you have the knowledge, understanding, and authority to be making decisions about what should be done to this juvenile offender in a foreign country. Because he's an immigrant you're assuming that he's not a citizen.   I don't disagree that a sexual offender deserves prison time. But I don't assume to be qualified or justified in telling a foreign sovereign state how to handle its internal affairs.    I don't disagree that there should be a focus on protecting the innocent. But it's not up to you or I to decide whether this juvenile offender is likely to reoffend or not. What are they going to keep him in prison for the rest of his life? That doesn't seem appropriate or necessary.   Also, your comment violates rule 2 in the sidebar which I politely invite you to read.    From the way I understand it, Breivik will most likely be in prison for the rest of his life. That 21 year sentence is the "punishment" for his crimes, but the way his sentence works is that the state can choose to keep him behind bars if he's deemed to still be a threat to society.   Edit: It's worth pointing out that Breivik and his crimes were in Norway.   	142

Or heck, [just three years back to this guy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) Because that's the end game of your ideology.    Donetsk isn't even playing in Donetsk right now. There's been quite an exodus from the Ukranian League since the separatism.    immigrant savages shithole countries if these immigrant savages don't like how things run over there, they can fuck off back to their pitiful, sand-covered shithole. uneducated, barbaric savages.  Bigoted xenophobe confirmed. Attitudes like yours are repulsive and in many ways are more of a recruiting tool than any takfiri website.    Cahill may be on international duty a lot, and if you guys play with two strikers he might be needed.    He's remarked quite publicly that he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with Jurgen. Plus, they are both two former forwards with big egos.    I can't see Jurgen being okay with a move to Qatar, or even Greece, the one time haven of Eddie Johnson and Freddy Adu. Even Russia these days is probably unfriendly to American citizens, let alone those who play for the national team.    Qatar? Greece? Ukraine?   Who would mess with any of those countries for soccer right now?    Ba dum tish   This was actually a legit reason for RBNY to back out.    Meanwhile, Ethan Finlay was not called into the U.S. camp. A little hope for you guys.    This is the best thing to do. While spreading cartoons may make you feel like such a great Free Speech Warrior^TM , these websites are the main recruiting and propaganda tool for these groups. One of the reasons that journalists are executed by them is that they don't see the point when they put out their own videos.    Two years ago, [Petke] made a birthday video for my seven year old son wishing him a happy birthday and telling him to keep practicing playing soccer and maybe one day, he would play for him, Ader recalls. Talk about youth development! To have the coach who the kids watch every game say something like that  it really changed his life. Now he is nine and playing soccer everyday, five days a week. I know that role model was key part of it. I am forever grateful to that and for that.   Why did they fire Petke again?    To be fair, Mix hasn't exactly been acting coherent on Twitter lately.    Don't the Red Bulls have a discovery claim on him?   Some of the teams pay their players, which is why it's semipro.    The trapped migrant workers aren't lucky enough to live in houses. They have shantytowns, tenements and trailers. These would be the middle-class, somewhat better off white collar and service workers.       Monkey logic, indeed.    **Submission Statement:**  The article by Teju Cole looks at some of the underlying issues behind the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including the magazine's history of provocation on ethnic, religious and racial lines. It also points out double standards on the deaths of innocents in other places, as well as on free speech itself.            Contrary to outsiders view of Israeli society Israelis actually don't particularly like military campaigns because it means calling on the reserves.   Does not compute with what you just said.    In the first few games called up under Klinsmann, he played really well. Assisted on two goals in two different games against Mexico. Perhaps Klinsmann thinks he can still build on that.    Set up the goal in Klinsmann's first game in charge, set up the goal in our first victory in Mexico... yup pretty good track record.  Of the three players involved in that first goal (**EDIT**: changed from game) under Klinsmann (Agudelo, Shea and Rogers), only Shea is left standing, oddly.    Andrew Wooten is an American who is playing far better in the 2.Bundesliga.    Maybe he's going with a five man backline and wants D-Mid type CBs.    What's wrong with him playing for Canada? We've stolen quite a few already (looks like Akindele too) from them, so if they get one or two to switch from the U.S., I'm not going to stress.    Why is it that every military campaign has something like 80-90 percent approval among the Israeli public?    Nobody ever really had anything bad to say about him from that team.    [You didn't know he got hair plugs?](http://i31.tinypic.com/x575dv.jpg)   Believe it a not, Muslim is actually a first name too. So he can go by that. He already has a beard.    Grant Wahl, the source of this thread, is part of the American press....   Israel likes to schedule their military campaigns near elections. It helps with votes.    Kind of sad to read this, looking back.   They all have players' unions that have fought like hell to get decent treatment for the athletes, and also give them legal recourse in the event there are disagreements.    Brek Shea's one good season got him doing Adidas commercials.   And how could you say [Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqO1fcU5hk4) isn't marketable?    The better question is, why aren't any of the other 18 teams doing so (excluding the Diskerud and Shea situations?   Before his disastrous move to Stoke and subsequent injury, Edu was ahead of Beckerman on the USMNT depth chart.    Who wants to bet the season ticket holders will be cherrypicked?    Switch the two. You have to take Chief Charisma into account after all.    He's the UK Muslim version of Fred Phelps.    In our bubbles near major cities, we don't see it, but in middle America and the south, and in conservative areas, FOX is the news network of choice. That's a lot of people.    If foreign clubs can pay more, MLS academies could lose their best talent.    There's nothing in our holy book to back up terrorism.    even?   In order to be a fan of American soccer, don't you have to like soccer played in America?    She wants the E   J and J Security would be perfect for this.    They won't take the Gaxaly route? Phew, I thought that it said they won't take the Galaxy route. That would be stupid, considering the Galaxy has a nice balance of young talent and foreign stars.    At a time when Klinsmann is apparently recommending that young players go overseas, this does not bode well for the league keeping the talent developed in its academies.    Why not Berry and Valdes? Austin is still there, right?    No, that's Dafoe.    Visit where? Flair up!   With Switzerland.     Source: Had to look at cat dicks in a lab   Sure you did.    This was our buried friend before Zack Ryder.    Start with two through four in that order, and don't limit yourself when it comes to Islamic scholars. Sunni, Shia, etc. all should be explored. You'll have some issues if you don't know Arabic and Farsi for this, as translated works aren't as widespread as they should be.    However, most of the world's Muslims don't speak these languages (part of the reason is a lack of education), yet they still understand many concepts both basic and not so basic. Most of the world's extremists either haven't read up or have merely seen the most extreme of sources.  After you've learned a bit from scholars and scripture, you'll be able to get a better picture of what's wrong with extremists. At least I hope so.    That is some of the most severe right wing propaganda that I have ever read. You're taking some kind social media activism as some kind of organized campaign by the radical left, when really it's slacktivism at worst and legitimate activism as best. Your hatred seems to be directed at "social justice," as well as any sort of left leaning ideology.   They work hand in glove with race-baiters and use ridiculous theories to convince the uneducated that somehow someone else is responsible for their lot in life. They promote debunked Marxist and Communist economics and politics as solutions for the 'injustice' of our society. They erroneously believe confiscation and redistribution of wealth by the government (with special groups like themselves getting a cut) will solve critical fundamental flaws actually caused by poor quality education and the effective dissolution of families, particularly in the black community. And they use every opportunity to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, usually by playing the race card. Assault, defamation, harassment, innuendo, libel and lies, rumor, slander, threats and violence are their tools of the trade - manipulation of the uneducated masses to accede to their wishes (money and power) is their goal.  My God, it's like I'm reading a tea-party manifesto.    SJW, race-baiters, and environmentalists are really nothing more than shakedown artists. They vampire ludicrous amounts of resources but contribute nothing positive to society, and are deserving of all the derision and ridicule they get, IMHO.  Yeah, I'm going to just call you a far-right extremist. That's enough internet for me today.    You're completely wrong. The majority of Muslims don't act like animals. Just look at the UK, where most Muslims are fine. France has five million Muslims, the most in Europe, and this is the first terrorist attack of its kind.   I'm just glad I live in the United States. At least the bigots don't make like difficult for us here, and we tend to be successful. In Europe, we're shoved into ghettos and poverty.    What's wrong with that?    I think the term's use as an insult is idiotic. The irony of someone campaigning for the internet would be a "warrior" coupled with the fact that they are doing so for a good cause (social justice) and the fact that some people think that's worthy of derision.    I've seen dozens of names both cultural and religious, from both Pakistanis, Arabs, Iranians, Afghans, etc. Perhaps it's just where you're at.    My whole argument is that Islam teaches NOT to kill people just for having different opinions. This isn't berating, this is arguing. I apologize if you think that's what it is. I don't know if I can convince you of that. Perhaps I can't, but I had to try. Please don't hold prejudice or violence in your heart against Islam. Muslims are full of flaws, but the ones responsible for the attack went beyond the bounds of Islam. That's all that I wanted to say.    No, you misunderstand. "The entire religion" doesn't subscribe to one belief because there's no central authority. His ideas are perfectly valid, and I agree. But there's a written tradition from one of the Prophet's descendants: "Don't judge the religion by its followers. Judge the followers by the religion."     why issue fatwas on everything disagreeable  This doesn't make sense. Avoid rulings on controversial topics?    It just basically said making the cartoons depicting his face or insulting him isn't allowed. It didn't come with any kind of penalty.    TIL my religion is apparently defined by polls.    There's no central leadership in Islam. So that's not valid.    Ironically, they are killing Muslims.   Reading a few news articles doesn't mean you know my religion.    You haven't met that many Muslims, have you?   Beliefs based on faith are not irrational, saying stuff like that pisses off the majority of people of faith, normal or extreme, Muslim, Christian or whatever.    Ah yes, even when we condemn it, we're lying! I don't care what you think. I know very well what Islam teaches, having been raised in it, and I and most other Muslims know this is wrong, and you don't get to tell me what I "actually" believe.   Hey, you used to have Red Bulls flair...   That's a myth. Muslims speak out against such things all the time but it never gets coverage. http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/muslim_voices_against_extremism_and_terrorism_part_i_fatwas/   His name is Anjem Chaudary, not Armen, and he's basically the Fred Phelps of UK Muslims. He doesn't enjoy much support and every legitimate Muslim organization has condemned him.    [Citation needed]  Here's the actual truth. There are many stories of the Prophet Muhammad's patience.  Here are just a couple: http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Articles.asp?ref=IC1209-5257  If it's condemnation of terrorism you're looking for: http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/muslim_voices_against_extremism_and_terrorism_2/     I'm not sure what you are trying to say.

You'll have a slightly less incompetent front office.      Oh god he's thanking Vergara. THAT MONSTER   This again?   Stop trying to make Adu to NASL/USL happen.   IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.      NYCFC making a good decision and RBNY making a bad one? What is this, 2013?   Haha, that means RSL isn't global!         If I was Clint Irwin I'd be worried. This is a much safer replacement move than the completely insane Joe Nasco experiment of last year. Irwin still hasn't done anything in my opinion to lose the job, which leads me to believe Mastroeni just doesn't like him for some reason.    "Someone" happens to be Eric Heyl, a staff writer for Trib Total Media.       He had an acclaimed role in Milk as Harvey Milk's partner.   That Big Red freshness lets you chew it.   We've never had a foreign face be WWE champion save for Canadians, and I think Vince's bias is a big part of that if not the sole reason.    X-PAC SUCKS!   Am I the only one who thought last week's crowd was pretty good?    You forgot to plant a "will" in there. Maple you'll do better in the future.    Criticism of racism that gets buried.

None of these groups have ever participated in massive terrorist bombings or even attacks targeting civilians.    For reference, Faylis are a minority tribe of Kurds that happen to be Shi'a, too.    Why the heck would you go to China if you have no interest in the culture? Does he really like his job or something?       That's not what I meant. Cherundolo had a solid but not spectacular career for Hannover and the USMNT. I'd be happy if Yedlin merely reached that level, but to be honest that is the minimum I expect from him.   And the USMNT is pretty deep at RB. Fabian Johnson, Geoff Cameron and Timmy Chandler can all play there. Yedlin may end up being a marquee right midfielder or winger.   	199
 From your comments below, you are asking if there is an advantage to applying to the same institution for graduate school that you attend as an undergraduate?  Sorry if I'm getting that wrong.  In some fields, the answer is no.  You are encouraged to go to a new institution for graduate school, and to still another for a postdoc or other subsequent academic job.  This allows you to be exposed to new ideas and philosophies.  However, I don't know about math specifically, so it would be a good idea to ask your academic advisor.   That is really cool!  I think there's some research showing that bees can also retain memories of positive/negative odors through metamorphosis.  I guess another thing this reminds me of is that as part of their efforts to read aloud to us, my parents (especially my dad) read some biographies of great scientists, and other science-related books; I can remember him reading us *Microbe Hunters* when I was in kindergarten.  I didn't necessarily understand all (or even much) of books like that when I was that young, but it meant I was already engaging with descriptions of how science works, what an experiment is, etc.  There are some really wonderful childrens' and adult science books out there.  I think part of what I remember fondly is how actively involved my parents were when reading aloud to us.  They would articulate questions that came to their minds about what they were reading, we would look up words together if one of us asked what they meant, things like that.   Also a summary of this research was already posted today.   Bees don't actually make honey for their young, they make it for adult bee consumption during the winter.  They do produce substances to feed to larvae, including royal jelly, in glands inside their heads.  Otherwise, good question!  Some birds perform premastication, chewing up food and regurgitating it for babies.  Not sure if this is what you have in mind though.      I have used Yurbuds for the last couple of years for running, and I love them.  I don't use them for much else, which I think has helped preserve them.  They have kind of weird shape to fit into your ears, and it takes a few times to learn how to put them in, but I find them comfortable, they allow in some ambient noise so that you can stay aware of traffic, and I haven't had any issues with cord failure or corrosion.  I can't advise about devices, since I sync music to my shuffle, but you might try putting whatever you use into a snack-sized Ziplock bag.  I've carried my phone or a shuffle in the rain in a zipped bag, and they stayed dry.   Those are good points.  I guess I was trying to suggest either catch-and-release for bugs (with enough time in between those two to try to figure out what you've caught, maybe do some natural history observations on where it was found, what it does in the time when you have it, where you released it.)  Keeping a field journal of what neat stuff you see and catch would be great.  I don't see a need for a kid (as opposed to a taxonomist) to kill and pin insects when we can now pretty easily take a few fun pictures and then let them go.  For keeping and rearing, I was thinking mainly of insects, actually.  I guess a good rule is, keep something as long as you can care for it appropriately.  If you can find a Monarch caterpillar, rear it to emergence as a butterfly, and then release it, you might very well be doing the Monarch population a favor!  My family caught common frogs, toads, and a couple of garter snakes, and kept them happy and healthy for years.  Wild turtles, chipmunks, ducks, etc. are probably harder to care for, will be unhappy if confined, and are better off left in the wild.  But observing these guys from afar, IDing them with a field guide, making notes on their behavior, are all good science/natural history experience.  Figuring out this distinction, when is okay or not okay to touch, is also probably a good life lesson.  Killing animals is a reality of life and research . . . if you did want to start dealing with that idea, you could do an earthworm dissection.  There are also companies from which you can order a properly preserved fish or frog.  I would wait until an age where your daughter could do this kind of thing in a meaningful way, by identifying organs and relating their structure to what they do, making drawings of what she sees, so it's a respectful use of the animal.   "When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, you almost never make it. And even if you do it's a hollow victory. In order to sustain the victory you have to prove yourself again and again in some other way, and again and again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone will find out. That's never the way." *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*   Are Calvin and Hobbes in a wagon or sled at the top of a hill?   Insect collection gear; nothing fancy is really needed (mesh net, small plastic containers for collecting, a few mesh and/or plastic cages should all be pretty affordable.)  Some books to help ID insects and other animals.  Especially in a rural area, there should be lots of opportunities to catch and rear small critters.  A kid can learn a lot about science and responsibility by figuring out how to keep things alive for a few days or weeks.  There are also some neat citizen science projects out there where people report animals they've seen to help monitor threatened species.   Actually, there are some ways that epigenetic modifications can be examined via DNA sequence (eg, bisulfite sequencing), so this area might be an opportunity to make predictions more accurate in the future by providing a record of environmental influences, rather than making these efforts futile.   This is a really complex task; we are still in the process of learning what functions proteins perform, what genes code for those proteins, how variations in gene sequence and other DNA sequence affect gene expression and protein function, etc.  However, this is something that forensic scientists, geneticists, and others have been working on in humans and a few other animals, with some success: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129613.600-genetic-mugshot-recreates-faces-from-nothing-but-dna.html#.VZMA8kZdq2U  In agricultural research, researchers are also working on predicting certain traits of interest from DNA sequence alone, such as milk production in cows, yield or stress tolerance in crop plants, etc.   Adding a bit of specificity after checking my facts.  Right now for humans, we can predict skin tone pretty well, and a few other traits with some accuracy (hair and eye color, hair texture, height, facial structure as above) but far from perfectly. As I said above, these areas are actively improving.  Reference: "Forensic DNA Phenotyping: Predicting human appearance from crime scene material for investigative purposes."  So, right now, probably not for most organisms, or sort of for humans.  In the future (10-20 years) probably much better, at least for humans and organisms "of interest".   That is the most fun sounding strength training I've ever heard of.      It might be a little harder with no affiliation.  Knowledge and ideas are always good currency in academia, though.  Enthusiasm alone might not be enough, but knowledgeable enthusiasm has a much better shot.  For the PIs you've identified, look up their prior published work on their websites or at the library, wherever you need to go to get access.  Read it and think about it.  Read some related work, or relate their work to what you already know from your undergraduate courses.  When you contact them, write a succinct first letter and not a show-offy one, but use your reading to articulate to them why you find their work interesting, and how you see your own intellectual interests and goals fitting with it.  If you have any good connections to faculty from your undergraduate institution, and still feel comfortable contacting them for advice, it might be worth letting them know of your current interests and what schools/PIs you are considering.  Even if they are in a different field, they might have some social connection to one or more of the people you're considering.  They might be able to give guidance on how to get in touch with those people.   One reason in addition to those already mentioned is the way that tendons attach muscle to bone.  Where the tendons interface with muscle and bone, there is usually not a clear boundary; there is a region where those two tissue types blend with each other in a complex way.  If the tendon tears away from the bone during injury, which happens really often when certain types of tendons are injured, this interface can't be healed back to the way it was.  The tendon can be re-attached surgically, but that complex interface can't be duplicated.  Instead of regrowing the original tendon, scar tissue forms in that area, which is less flexible and weaker than the original tissue.  This scar tissue is more likely to snap than to bear the same range of motion and force that the original tissue could stand.  	16
 Though she'd been gone for several months, I still felt my wife's presence around me at all times. Perhaps I was imagining things. The loss of a loved one can have a weird effect on a person. Regardless of how much of a skeptic you were, you find yourself humoring thoughts you never would have considered before. You start seeing signs everywhere, no matter how small. It happened to me after my wife died. I believed she came back to comfort me in my time of need.  It started with little things: signs that could have easily been dismissed. I'd notice static on the radio, misplaced objects, chairs not pushed in all the way, etc. Some nights, I could even feel her crawling next to me in bed. These were all things that would make any sane person roll their eyes at you or give you a look of pity, like they know your grief is causing you to see what you want to see. Part of me understood that, but at the same time, I wanted so badly for my wife to be haunting me. I didn't have any concrete proof. That is, not until the night the dishes washed themselves.  My wife always hated doing the dishes. It was her least favorite chore. Most nights, I was the one who took care of washing up, though I often left the dishes overnight to soak. From time to time, my wife would surprise me by taking care of the job before I got home. I'd walk in to a squeaky clean counter and a little note with I love you written in a large heart. The small gesture always brought a smile to my face, and I made extra sure to repay my wife in kind.  One night, a few months after my wife passed, I walked through the front door. The house smelled like lime.  "I'm home!", I shouted.  It's hard to break the habit. To this day, I still greet her when I come home. As expected, there was no reply. I made my way to the dining room to drop off my things. That's when I spotted the dishes neatly stacked in their rightful places. There was a note on the counter with the same message my wife always left me. A flood of emotions washed over me. I was happy and sad at the same time. Holding the note to my face, I cried. There was no denying it now: my wife's spirit was watching over me.  It kept happening over the course of the next few weeks. Each time, the note would become damp with my tears. It was so comforting to feel close to my wife again.  One day, I had a nasty flu. I called in sick from work, and took some cold medicine to help me rest. It knocked me straight out, and I spent most of the day passed-out on my bed. By the time I awoke, I could hear clanging noises coming from the kitchen. My heart skipped a beat. I knew it had to be my wife's spirit. Still a little drowsy, I bounced out of bed and made a beeline for the kitchen, wondering if I would be able to talk to her. I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around her ethereal form and tell her how much I loved her. As I rounded the corner, I saw a solid figure in the kitchen.  It wasn't my wife.  "Who the fu-", I started, starring at the scene in shock.  An old man with a thick grey beard and tattered clothes turned towards me as I spoke. He yelped, dropping the bowl in his hands. Before I could even react, he bolted towards the front door and escaped, leaving me frozen in shock. I approached the counter, only to find my wife's note waiting there for me, heart and all. It had been him all along. The realization filled me with disgust, anger, and deep sorrow. It was like losing my wife all over again. I honestly thought she'd come back for me. I took so much comfort in knowing her spirit was with me, and that man had snuffed out all hope of reuniting with her.  The very same day, I had the locks changed. Whoever the man was, I wanted to make sure he'd never get inside my home again.   This evening, I came home to find a note on the counter and dishes clean and stacked. I don't know how he's getting in, but it's scaring the shit out of meespecially since I'm over at my mom's house for the night.   xD   And that is exactly why I haven't read it yet. Waiting for a nice, quiet moment where I can read it all in one go.   I definitely want to read it when I get the chance. Everyone speaks so highly of it.   I haven't actually read it yet (shame on me!), but everyone constantly refers to [The Spire in the Woods] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nyt4a/the_spire_in_the_woods/) as being an amazing story, so I would say it counts as a classic.   Unless you're claiming the person in question is burning up a hugely-populated area, you should be OK.   It kind of depends on what you mean by "somewhat believable".  I.e. Chicago was obliterated by an unknown military presence. It's believable in the sense that it *could* happen, but it wouldn't work on NoSleep because, well, obviously Chicago is fine.  My cat turned into a parrot and started pecking my parent's eyes out. Not super-believeable, but it only affects you and your little nucleus, so who's to say it didn't actually happen. That premise would, in theory, be OK.   I think the problem is that twists have turned into a gimmickwhen the intention is really just to end a story with a bang. Kind of how horror movies always have the psychokiller stand up right before the credits roll.   If done right, they'll leave the reader wanting more. Problem is that a lot of those twists are reused constantly.   PSYCH. I AM A PINEAPPLE. I WAS A PINEAPPLE ALL ALONG. You thought I was a person?! NOPE. YOU JUST GOT THE OPINION OF A TROPICAL FRUIT.   *Scratch scratch scratch*   Y'know, I was afraid that would make the twist too obvious. Looking at it now, it really doesn't. Saying "his" could be taken both ways.  *Edited because of the typo demons.   It should only frighten you if you have something negative to say which isn't constructive criticism. Otherwise, the person who is secretly the writer will probably just think it's funny. After all, who wouldn't want to know someone else is talking about their story?   I think it looks really cool. Kudos to you, o labyrinth-dweller.   I know someone who can take care of that for ya. :)   It's a little-known fact that the act of scratching releases dopamine into your system. This means that every time you scratch an itch, you're not just relieving a discomfort: you're making yourself feel better. It's no surprise, then, that some people can take it a little too far.   nbsp;  Craig had an awful itch that needed to be scratched. His short fingernails desperately dug along flesh, hoping to alleviate the horrid sensation tinkling inside of him.   nbsp;  *Scratch scratch scratch.*   nbsp;  Aaaah, it felt so good.   nbsp;  *Scratch scratch scratch.*   nbsp;  He broke the skin. Blood began to trickle out, but his fingers had not yet reached the spot nagging him.   nbsp;  *Scratch scratch scratch.*   nbsp;  Dopamine seeped into his system, filling him with a pleasant sense of relief, though not enough to stop him quite yet.   nbsp;  *Scratch scratch scratch.*   nbsp;  No, he couldn't stop, not even after he made it through all layers of skin, and to the muscle tissue: the itch ran deeper.   nbsp;  *Scratch scratch scratch.*   nbsp;  He could see something white just outside of his reach. There was no going back now. The itch was so strong. He needed to scratch that white form hiding under the muscles.   nbsp;  *Scratch scratch scratch.*   nbsp;  His fingertips finally reached the femur's bony surface. The itch was gone, and Craig let out a sigh of relief. It felt so good. He had all the pleasure of scratching an itch, without any of the pain.   nbsp;  Just as Craig thought he was finally done, he felt another itch right behind the eye. His bound victim thrashed and screamed in panic as Craig's bloody finger approached his face. He couldn't help it: it was an itch he needed scratching.   My grandma died when I was quite young. Though I was in preschool when she passed, I still distinctively remember the summers spent at her home. When I was sick, she'd sit me on her lap and sing me a peaceful lullaby. When it got too hot, we'd make fresh lemonade. On cloudless nights, we'd sneak out of the house and sit by the creek that ran through the property, looking down at the Milky Ways reflection in the water's surface. We'd spend hours by the creek, day and night, dipping our feet and watching the fish swim by. Grandma loved that creek, as well as the forest beyond its south bank.   nbsp;  Visiting my grandparents' home in the country was the highlight of my summer, which is why I was so upset the year my parents didn't take me. I didn't understand it back then: my parents, not wanting to traumatize me, simply told me my grandma had gone away. My first thought was that I had done something wrong to make grandma leave. Bawling my eyes out, I tugged on my mom's shirt, promising I'd be a good little girl, and begged her to take me to grandma. She hugged me tightly, ran a hand through my hair, and told me it wasnt my fault.   nbsp;  The next summer, I returned to my grandparents' rural home for a memorial service. It was only when I saw the modest tombstone that I realized grandma wasn't coming back. By then, I had somewhat grasped the concept of death, albeit in childlike fashion: grandma was in heaven, living in the clouds. I asked my mom if we could plant a tree in grandma's memory. I pictured that tree growing and growing, bean stock-style, until it reached the sky itself. I would climb it, and reunite with her. My mother turned to grandpa.   nbsp;  "What do you think, dad?", she asked.   nbsp;  Grandma had always wanted to be buried on the very property where she grew up. After she died, it seemed only fitting to lay her to rest by the creek that she loved so dearly. We couldn't exactly plant a tree in the yard without grandpa's approval. Fortunately, my grandfather's solemn frown turned into a broad smile. He knelt down in front of me, and placed a hand on my shoulder.   nbsp;  "I think that's a wonderful idea, honey. What kind of tree should we plant?", replied grandpa.   nbsp;  I knew exactly what grandma would have wanted. Of all the trees lining the forest on the other side of the creek, there was one she loved most of all. Without missing a beat, I answered.   nbsp;  "A willow tree!", I chirped excitedly.   nbsp;  I'm not sure whether we went to the tree nursery that same day, or a few weeks later, but we eventually purchased a willow sprout. We made a big celebration out of it. Grandpa let me break ground with a tiny plastic shovel, while mom and dad prepared a picnic. We sat under or rather, next to the twig-sized tree, and shared stories about grandma all afternoon.   nbsp;  "You picked a good, strong willow. Grandma would be proud.", grandpa whispered to me, as we were packing up.   nbsp;  I was overjoyed that I had not only contributed something useful, but that I had planted the tree that would eventually let me see grandma again. I couldn't wait for it to grow taller than the stars in the sky.   nbsp;  Year after year, I returned to the countryside to spend time with my grandpa. I watched as my willow tree grew bigger, never forgetting my secret plan. Now, I'm not sure how long a willow tree usually takes to grow, but I remember being impressed every time I visited: it always seemed much taller than when I had last seen it. In the span of about five years, it blossomed from a measly little sprout, to a glorious full-sized tree. On stormy nights, I could hear the wind blowing through its growing branches, producing an otherworldly howl. It was the sweetest sound I had ever heard, bringing pleasant chills to my core. It was the kind of "creepy" sound that one would normally be afraid of, but not me. No, I loved it. I wished for wind and storms so I could hear the haunting weeps of my willow tree.   nbsp;  A few years ago, my grandfather died of heart failure. His house and property went to my mother. My parents, being city folk themselves, didn't fancy moving away to the countryside. When they offered me the home, I gleefully accepted. The commute to work was long, but the peace and tranquility made it well worth my time. I loved to sit on the patio to watch storms on the horizon, take walks in the valley, and sit under my willow tree that guarded grandmas grave by the splendid creek.   nbsp;  My favorite time of year was Autumn, when the world turned burgundy and orange. My willow tree stood out from the rest of the landscape, its leafs turning into yellowish shades that reminded me of hay. The crisp October air felt refreshing after the long, humid summer, and Fall showers were a welcomed relief from hours of watering the plants outside my home. Autumn felt like a new beginning, like someone repainting an old canvas to breathe life into it.   nbsp;  One evening, I decided to bake a traditional apple pie in the rustic wood-burning oven. The sky had turned black in anticipation of another storm. Leafs were flying around all over the place and wind howled at my window like a siren call for weary sailors. A loose branch snapped against the side of the house, drawing my attention outside. I noticed a hooded man limping his way towards my home. Stumbling, he made his way to my front porch. I opened the door.   nbsp;  "Are you okay, sir?", I asked, in a concerned tone of voice.   nbsp;  "C-can Iccome inside?", he requested weakly.   nbsp;  I nodded and beckoned him in. The man, using the outer wall for support, slowly made his way towards me. He looked in very poor shape, and I decided I'd offer him a slice of pie and a place to sleep. It didn't come to that, however. As soon as he walked through the threshold, the man's hand shot up, and he grabbed my ponytail. I could see blood along his bony arms. I wasnt sure whether it was his or someone elses. With his other hand, he gripped my arm so tightly that it left finger-shaped bruises. He yanked me outside, into the cold night air. I started screaming like a banshee, but on such a windy night, there was no way anyone would hear me. Besides, I was miles away from another soul.   nbsp;  No matter how hard I fought, I couldn't break free from the stranger. Adrenaline flooded my veins, and I hoped that it would be enough to shift the balance of power back in my favor. Alas, no matter how much I kicked and punched, the stranger was stronger than I was. He dragged me all the way to my willow tree, like a barbaric cave man. He pushed me against its trunk, pinning me to it.   nbsp;  "TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES!", he screamed at me.   nbsp;  Sobbing profusely, I defiantly shook my head. When I refused, he struck me hard on the cheek with one hand, and ripped my skirt with the other. A gust of wind blew his hood back, but my eyes were so full of tears that I could not make out his features. Fearing for my life, I shakily began undoing my shirt. My fingertips felt numb, and I could barely manage to undo the first button on my blouse. I must have taken too long, because the man growled angrily, and reared his arm up for another slap. My cheek was still stinging from the first blow. I winced, shut my eyes tightly, and braced myself for a second hit.   nbsp;  *CRACK! THUD!*   nbsp;  I shrieked as I heard the sound, and it took me a few moments to figure out that I had been spared. Opening my eyes, I found the man at my feet, with a large laceration along his temple. Blood gushed out of him at a sickeningly quick pace. I looked around, trying to get my bearings.   nbsp;  A heavy gust sent a large broken branch rolling towards me. There was something unnatural about its shape: it was thick on one end, ballooned in the middle, and narrowed back down at the other end. It looked like a snake that had just swallowed its prey. With the tip of my foot, I turned it over. There, I saw a fossilized skull encased under a layer of bark. My attackers blood could be seen along its rock-hard jawline.   nbsp;  The roots of the willow tree, seeking the nearest source of water, had eaten my grandma, which rested between it and the creek. In the end, I got the reunion I so desperately wanted. Wind howled once more through the branches, and I finally recognized the lullaby that grandma used to sing to me.   Way to go Suspense!! I am throwing virtual confetti your way. : D   They ask permission first, and link to our social media sites. Don't worry, there's nothing shady going on.   I hit the "New" tab and check out a couple of recently-uploaded stories. I also check out what my favorite authors and/or buddies have posted and read those.      But I mostly like to listen to the narrations...   A poster of kittens above the bed should do the trick.  Except, you might wake up one night and their evil little eyes will be leering over you. Wuahahahaha.   I, for one, try to include a Rodriguez Jackson Lemieux in every single one of my stories.   As a wise person once said: "Write what you know."  I think having stories from other parts of the world would be awesome. I definitely look forward to reading yours. : ) It could also be refreshing since different cultures have differing views on horror.   Guess you...*reap* what you sew. HAHAHAHAHA.  Loved the story.   PLEASE DON'T HURT ME HERE HAVE A CARROT.   It's not the comments that require a 10 minute wait time, it's the posts. I.e. If you post a story on NoSleep, and immediately head over to ShowerThoughts to post something there, the system will refuse it. It's not a NoSleep thing, it's a Reddit thing.  (Also: if someone else in your home has an account and posts something, you'll have to wait 10 minutes before you can post yours, if you're connected using the same router.)   It was replaced by a gladiator-style battle this month. I'm not goin' to spoil it for ya, but I will say Grind is one ferocious contender. I still have tooth marks.   For years, I've been workin' at a pawnshop in a seedy part of town. I see all types of weirdoes here: peeping toms, drug addicts, wannabe thugs, and even known criminals. It's not hard to tell who's sellin' stolen shit to make a quick buck, but it aint my place to judge. No, I just buy an sell. Technically, I gotta hold new inventory for a month before sellin' it, in case stuff gets reported stolen. Let the cops sort through that shit, though: I've never seen one brave nough to come round these parts anyways.   nbsp;  Ted, my favorite customer, was different from the usual scumbags. Cleanly groomed, sharply-dressed, and polite, he was the polar opposite of the trash that usually came through the squeaky alleyway door.   nbsp;  First time he visited, he looked frazzled, and I thought was gonna piss himself in fear. I assumed he was some tourist who took a wrong turn or somethin'. In actuality, he was doin' the pawnshop circuit around town, tryin' to find rare daggers and swords. I sold him a couple nice pieces, an he rewarded me with an unexpected tip.   nbsp;  Ted returned every couple of weeks. He'd sharpen those daggers and to buy a few new ones. I was surprised by how fast he kept dullin' his blades. Figured he was practicin' on fruit or wood. One day, I asked him about it, fully expectin' he'd give me a lame-ass answer, like he roleplayed as a ninja or somethin'. Ted looked me dead in the eyes, and, without a hint of deceit or emotion, answered:   nbsp;  "Nothing dulls a blade faster than human flesh."   That's just the way I like it.   You're only as happy as your saddest mod, so keep your mods happy by being nice and polite to them, because they work very hard.   needed to enjoy eachandeverybyte.  I took far more enjoyment out of that pun than I probably should have.  Creepy story, man.   I never wanted to be "that guy". You know, the controlling, overbearing, and crazy jealous dude who always worries his girl's going to cheat on him? You see them on talk shows admitting to installing tracking software on their girlfriends' phones, following them around town, and isolating them from their friends and families. I didn't think I had it in me: I'm a nice, normal guy. Shana; however, brought out a bad side of me. I don't know what it was about her. She was special. She was the love of my life, and I could see myself settling down with her. At the same time, I was so paranoid that she'd cheat and leave me, that I tookdrastic measures. To put it simply, I invented a twin brother, and I had him seduce her. I mean, if she was going to cheat on me, it might as well be with me, right?   nbsp;  Shana and I met at a pub about half a year ago. When I saw her across the room, I swear I could almost hear a choir of angels singing above her. A pick-up line at the ready, I shyly walked over to introduce myself. Her smile temporarily made me forget how to speak, and I barely managed to produce a squawking sound. She laughed lightly, making my anxiety wash away like chalk in the rain. We talked for a bit, exchanged numbers, and eventually went on a few dates. Shana was perfect: sexy, sweet, loving, ambitious, and spunky.   nbsp;  It wasn't long before Shana moved in with me. I think that's when things started taking a turn for the worst. It was fine for the first couple of days, until I started noticing her flirting with other men behind my back, and coming home late almost every night. Every time she allegedly had to work late, I was left pacing up and down our apartment, imagining her canoodling some scumbag. I sometimes drove by her work, but I never had the balls to go in and confirm my suspicions.   nbsp;  Eventually, I decided to sit Shana down and have a long, serious talk. And by that, I mean I fabricated an elaborate lie. I told her about my twin brother, Eric. Naturally she wanted to know why I hadn't told her about him before. Faking tears, I explained that he'd been in and out of jail. She seemed to like bad boys, so I knew that'd spark her interest. I told her a sob story about how my mom had cut him out of our family photos, how everyone thought he was a bad egg, and how I wanted to protect her from him. She consoled me, but I could see a twinkle of excitement in her eyes. My trap was set.   nbsp;  One night, I put on a leather jacket, applied hair gel, and went out searching for Shana. I "coincidentally" bumped into her at the park where she liked to jog. I puffed my chest out proudly, taking on Eric's confident stance, and half-heartedly apologized for ramming into her. Using a slightly deeper voice and different mannerisms, I acted as though we had never met. She lit up, immediately guessing that I was my made-up twin brother. She seemed to like how bold and fearless Eric was, so I put the moves on her right then and there. She fell head over heels for me. With that, she and 'Eric' started dating in secret.   nbsp;  Eric was the kind of guy that I had always wanted to be: slick, smooth, and assertive. He was an adrenaline junkie, and never afraid to speak his mind. He wore clothes I'd never be caught dead in: plenty of leather, tight t-shirts, rocker bracelets. He was a living, breathing stereotype, and playing his role made me feel alive. I was a quiet guy who liked to stay at home and read, but he liked to party and do crazy shit.   nbsp;  I discovered a new side of Shana thanks to Eric, and fell in love with her all over again. It was funny to see how different our regular dates were compared to the ones with Eric. Shana was more adventurous and exciting than I could have ever imagined. As Eric, we did awesome stuff together: we went skydiving, we rented motorcycles, we went to concerts, and we tried a bunch of kinky stuff in bed.   nbsp;  Knowing I was satisfying both Shana's sense of adventure, and her quieter, intellectual side, I was finally able to let go of my worries and paranoia. I had Shana all to myself, and it was fantastic. Life was great, and I bought a ring so I could propose to her on our anniversary this weekend. She'd probably break things off with Eric once we got engaged, so I made a commitment to myself to try and be a little more like Eric from now on.   nbsp;  Last night, all my plans went up in smoke. Shana was working late, but she and Eric didn't have a date scheduled, so I assumed she was actually working for once. It was nice out, so I decided to pass the time by taking a nice little stroll around town. As I walked by the large windows of a quaint Italian restaurant, my world came crashing down around me: Shana was playing tonsil-hockey with another man. I watched from the street as the dark-haired stranger ran his hands up and down her back. A mix of despair and anger twirled around in my gut. Had I not been enough for her? Had Eric not been enough?! I had given her everything she could have wanted. What she couldn't do with me, she did with Eric. There was no reason for her to go outside our relationships. I had invested so much time, and STILL she was cheating on me. But that wasn't even the most disturbing part   nbsp;  The man's eyes turned towards me as he was making out with my girl. Shana, who had her back to the window, was obscuring his face. Very slowly, he pulled away from my woman, and tilted his head towards me. A devious smirk stretched over his lips as he looked towards me. His cold and amused eyes were proclaiming victory over me. I felt my knees buckle at the incomprehensible sight before me: it was Eric.   Just don't tap on our windows. We writers are an easily startled breed.   If you're on a Mac, you can hit **ctrl-option-command 8** to invert colors. (And again to switch back.) The comments will be readable, too.   I don't know of any quick shortcuts to do it on a Windows PC, though. You kind of have to go the long way and mess with the accessibility settings. Might just want to download an add-on to your browser that lets you do it.   I take comments with a grain of salt. I've seen a few disturbing ones on my stories, but I just shrug them off. Some people are just trying to be funny and are hoping their comments will get them upvotes. Others just want to say something disturbing for the shits and giggles. Don't worry too much about it.   You can post in the third person, as long as there's a reason why the protagonist isn't the one telling the story. For example, a coworker retelling an account of what happened to his colleague prior to his death, or someone sharing a story their grandparents have told them.   Looks exactly like this thing: http://img.symworks.com/l_mr_potato_brush.jpg  Parents put it in my stocking one Christmas.   Duuudeeee, I LOVE it! :D!!   Maybe leave a little pile of berries and wheat on the ground as a peace offering? "Sorry I killed one of your kind. Here's food.", y'know?   Actuallymaybe they're not trying to get their revenge. They're supposed to be lucky. Maybe they're there to give ya'll advanced notice so you can save yourselves.   A suspicious line on my income tax report.  I.e. Total net value of your left lung.   Fantastic interview and interesting questions/answers. Deadnspread, you're one classy dude.   My potato brush is a potato with googly eyes on it. (Seriously.)   Keep up the awesome work, Yara. I enjoy your narrations very much! : )   Even if you write the most original thought on the planet, someone's going to find something to compare it to. Write from your heart (or fingertips, whichever works best) and you're good to go.  Also: WELCOME TO THE FAMILY. :D   You have to have three lines between each paragraph, and insert the code for non-breaking spaces (as identified in your comment) in the middle line. That should work.  (I don't believe it works in the comment section, though.)   Like the others said, the limit is 40 000 characters.  While there's no magic formula for post length, I've personally found that an average of 1 500 words is fairly good. It's long enough to tell a story, but not so long that you get a bunch of people groaning "tl;dr" at you.  If you're breaking your story down into multiple parts, make sure your parts are about the same length, otherwise it may get flagged and deleted.   Holy pepperoni pizza! That looks like some kind of swamp monster. Creepy!   You mean to tell me you DON'T have a festive, winter-specific tie?!   It was all me, then. ; D   My evil twin brother wrote that line..? : )   On the side, near the stomach area. Of course the dress covered her up. I didn't want that disgusting thing showing.   I always post from the same account. There's no rule against it.   It was supposed to be **my** special day. Everything was going to be perfect. Preparations were made, a hotel conference room was reserved, and hundreds of my Facebook followers were invited. I'd even gotten a custom-made dress for the occasion. Everything was going off without a hitch, but then, my sister ruined my life.   nbsp;  It started during the father-daughter dance. There we were, gliding across the ballroom like ice skaters. All eyes were on me, as my beautiful gown fluttered at my feet. Suddenly, my sister started shrieking. Dad obviously hadn't medicated her enough. While everyone tried to figure out what had made the noise, the attention whore tore a hole in the side of my dress with her bare teeth. I felt a sharp pain as she convulsed and thrashed. Had she somehow bitten me!?   nbsp;  My party guests were on-edge, all because of that selfish little bitch. She couldn't even let me have ONE freaking day to myself. She then started foaming at the mouth and mumbling incoherently. What a freaking drama queen! Her disgusting sausage-like fingers grabbed a glass off a nearby table and threw it at the crowd.   nbsp;  By then, my friends were running scared. They shrieked in horror, drowning out the unholy noises coming from my sister's deformed mouth. A disgusting green liquid came gushing out of her lips, staining my beautiful golden dress.   nbsp;  Once the party was officially ruined, her head dropped, she went quiet, and turned blue.   nbsp;  I'm going in for surgery tomorrow to have her remains removed from my side before she starts to putrefy. I've been carrying around her useless malformed half-body 16 years too long.   I'm not sure...was yours covered in sacrificial blood..?   Naturally! It'd be a crime not to.   That's OK. Last year, I bought the entire series on DVD and watched all 52 episodes of it in a single week.   Hahaha that made my day!   She's not as bad as Wufei...but that's not sayin' much.   Relena Mothertruckin' Peacecraft.   I'll be Fernando, the hapless spy who gets in way over his head when he stumbles upon a vault full of abnormal artefacts.   AWW YEAH!! Another RPer in the house! I spent a good 13-14 years RPing in a server based off the .hack// series. I closed it down last year and survived off of x-men-based RP, until I started writing short stories.   Fiddlesticks and fudgebuckets!   "I DON'T CARE IF THE STUPID COUPON EXPIRED. I WANT MY 25 CENTS OFF!!!", shouted a wrinkly old hag.   nbsp;  Craig glanced over at a fellow cashier for some much-needed sympathy. He'd been dealing with unruly customers all day, and this lady was no exception. Why she was making a fuss about a box of cereal was beyond him.   nbsp;  "Mam, we can't accept an expired coupon...", he tried to explain, sounding desperate.   nbsp;  His hands were tied. He'd been told by the managers that he'd be fired if he accepted invalid coupons. His boss was strict, and, like the customers, showered him with verbal abuse if he caved into their demands. Still, after another ten minutes passed with the customer howling like a banshee, he had to call for a manager to handle the situation.   nbsp;  The big boss came down from his comfortable office overlooking the rows of cash registers. He put on a big, fake smile as he approached the customer. He apologized to her and offered to not only accept the coupon, but give her the product for free. He did this all the time, just to make the cashiers look like the bad guys, while he walked off as a hero.   nbsp;  Suddenly, Craig felt something on his shoulder. The customer faded away, and he found himself on the other side of the counter, holding an expired coupon. His throat was coarse, as though he'd been yelling, and his hands were balled into fists. The cashier, Theodore, smiled.   nbsp;  "Thank you for shopping at Food Mart. Have a wonderful day.", he said, hoping Craig had learned his lesson.   Well I know the words, but I can't really speak them to you.   Well, fiddlesticks and fudgesicles!   Oh my gosh. That's pretty much the best idea ever.   This is *math* we're talking about. I'm going to need stick figures drawn by sharpie on a whiteboard to understand.   I try to, but I find myself horrendous at explaining my stories out loud, and end up stumbling over my words and making them sound like the lamest thing ever. So now, I just tell my loved ones once I post stuff and give 'em a link.   Say what..?   Maybe it should be a Writing Prompt. HA.   In life, everything ebbs and flows. What's popular today won't be in a few months.  I wasn't around back when NoSleep first started, but I have been making my way through the NoSleep Podcast archives, listening to the stories from 'back then'. From what I can tell, even today, there are wonderful stories crafted by incredibly talented writers.  Things will keep changing, but there will always be great quality stories for people to read. Whether they're long series or shorter posts...they make people happy, and that's what counts the most in my book.   ...damn.   Darn. Maybe I'll have to take a crack at it.   I hope you write it...and I hope it goes viral.   PIGEOONS EVERYWHEEEREE!!!! EVERY STORY! EVERYWHERE!!!   **Manen's List of Top Ten Most Overused Words**  * A  * The  * In  * Wide  * Smile  * Constitutional law degree  * Olives  * Pigeons  * Pissed myself  * Space heater   Crud. Why didn't I think of that?   People are thrilled that spring is just around the corner. My colleagues are already shedding their coats, removing their winter tires, and talking about the day where theyll finally be able to wear shorts and sandals. Some are buying seeds for their gardens, others are making summer plans to visit the cottage. The days are getting longer as the sun coats the north hemisphere with warm rays of light. Its only normal for people to be happy.   nbsp;  Not me, though. I hate spring. I hate it with every fibre of my being. You could even say that I'm terrified of it. Thats because I know the truth: I know whats hiding in the snow banks. I know what will happen when they thaw. Every day, they get lower and lower. The snow melts and streams of water leak into the street like blood from an open wound. In my nightmares, I can see dozens of hands reaching out from their snowy graves. I can imagine the agonized looks on their bluish faces. My heart pounds hard against my chest every time I walk by a snow bank, and I wonder how many of them are hidden within.   nbsp;  As birds begin their migration home, I grow ever more anxious. I lay awake at night, thinking about what will happen when they find the bodies. I just hope I didn't leave any evidence behind.   Awesome!  	77
 this is a funny little moment from one of our attempts to record Civ 5. Enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Mwqikocn8   This is a video I took of a friend and me trying to slay a Krayt Dragon in SWG. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOId160QDzM   This is the 8 part of my Skyrim let's play. Enjoy :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bt-xxVbyaY  	3
 I really enjoyed this game up until the last few rounds. Then it's a repetitive motion to bash the leader because players may only win at the beginning of their turn, not the end. This draws out an extra 30 minutes. Obviously this matters less in a 2 player game.  If it wasn't for this mechanic for game end, I'm pretty sure it would be a top-250 game on bgg.   Pretty solid week for me:  **Roll for the Galaxy** - really enjoyed this. It flows much smoother than Race for the Galaxy as you don't need to stare at your hand often to decide which cards to keep and which to play.  **Spyfall** - quite fun after you know the majority of the available locations. Love it when people come up with creative questions.  **Witness** - mildly amusing light logic game that takes 10 minutes.   **Cyclades** - very cool bidding+area control game that becomes intense in the last few rounds of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this.  **Lords of Xidit** - I really wanted to enjoy this more but I just can't stand it when people are AP over a simple game.  **Orleans** - my second play. Still enjoyed this but I have a feeling every time the ending of the game would be the same.  **Brass** - messed up some rules in the beginning but we eventually got it right. Very brain-burning but satisfying at the same time. Came close second, if only I chose the right railroads to build, argh!   Most games do it by dice. Some games, e.g. **Impulse**, resolves battles by flipping the top cards on the deck.    Games where   1. Players are rewarded for planning ahead (**Terra Mystica**, **Agricola**)  2. Information is mostly open - even if you get backstabbed or blocked by other players, it should be foreseeable.  3. Replayable. Mostly comes with randomised setup.    4. No randomised outcome generator, so every immediate outcome from a decision should be mostly predictable.  5. Feeling of progress within a game. You start out slow on resources and abilities, but you get multiple upgrades during the game.  Basically, I like a game if on my way home I think to myself, damn I should have done this and this instead of that, I was such an idiot!    This is neat! Instead of tracking total points, wouldn't it make more sense to score by average position?   Did you play in a pub in London? If yes I probably played with you and it was a great game! In my game I was the first to build a metropolis but then spent way too much money and effort defending it, eventually losing my second island. I will try to be sneakier next time.   **Galaxy Trucker** - 1st half of the game: build your own spaceship in a limited time by grabbing tiles. 2nd half of the game: travel through space, getting hit by meteors, fighting off aliens, transporting goods for $. It's pretty light, chaotic, and fun. However, unlike FTL, you don't get to make too many decisions in battles/upgrading ships/recruiting crew.   Don't think of it as food production. Think of it as a discount for feeding at the end of each round until the end of the game.   I go to London on Board too, and I find that it's easier to bond with gamers with similar tastes than convert a friend to a gamer.  I prefer playing with gamers for several reasons:  1. Personal preference for games. Some interactive games (e.g. **Avalon**) probably work better when you play with friends and I'm personally not a big fan of those.  2. More opportunities to try out new games when playing with a group of gamers.  3. More opportunities to play at a competitive level (e.g. tournaments) with a group of gamers.   They are all great choices based on your criteria.   **Glory to Rome** is an excellent game, but I highly doubt you can find a copy for less than $25.  I'm certain you'll enjoy **Race for the Galaxy** and **Star Realms** as you liked **San Juan** and **Dominion**. Just be aware that you directly attack each other in **Star Realms** in case that's an issue. Also, you can try out **Race for the Galaxy** for free on boardgamearena first.   Let's give this a go! /u/boardgamerecommender test_subject2751   I'm not sure whether it's worth it to back the kickstarted version and wait 8 months, or just buy a copy now.   Speaking from my own experience, you will like the game if you enjoy:   1. Pool and engine building; a main difference from other "pool-builders" is that you start off by drawing 4 tokens each round, but this ability could be upgraded to a max of 8.   2. Indirect conflict only (race on the map, buying a building someone else wants, buying the last token etc);   3. Feld games, i.e. not thematic, multiple ways to get victory points; and   4. Games that are not too unforgiving. Had a bad draw? You can place say, one token to a building that requires 2 tokens. You don't activate the building this turn, but it increases your chances to fill in the remaining token later for a big turn later on.    Awesome week! Tried some new games:  **Sheriff of Nottingham** - A game about smuggling goods, detecting lies, and making deals. This has become my favourite bluffing + negotiation game! There's even some euro-y elements to it. Best to play with friends.  **Archipelago** - A semi-cooperative resource management game with a brilliant market system. The 4 newbies (including me of course) were really selfish and didn't care about resolving crisis on round 3....so the rebel counter jumped from 4 to 34. The host of the game (traitor) won by the end of round 4.   **Imperial Settlers** - I enjoyed the engine building and chain combo bits of the game but was slightly disappointed as I didn't think it lived up to its hype. First half of the game is very non-interactive. Then near the end it felt like the winner just goes to whoever was lucky enough to draw the most over powered cards from the faction deck.  **Orleans** - I had a blast playing this new bag building Euro! Everything starts out slow (1-2 actions in a round) then with careful planning you'll be getting 3-4 actions and it felt so satisfying.  Definitely hoping to play this more.  Games I've played before: **Terra Mystica**, **Mage Knight**, **Splendor** x3, **Galaxy Trucker**, **Biblios**   Probably not a common gripe but only my own for **Lords of Waterdeep**. I find the initial 2 quests+lords randomly dealt to a player involving too much luck. I usually go with card drafting for the initial 2 quests, then deal 2 keep 1 for lords.   **Splendor**. It takes about 30 seconds to setup, and 1 minute to learn the rules. Note that it is almost an abstract game with minimal social interaction, which is very different from the games that you currently play.   **Ingenious** is quite similar to Quirkle. Most of Knizia's games are abstract math games, examples include **Ra**, **Lost Cities** and **Kingdoms**.   Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards you for specialising, so focus on one-two main scoring elements. Also, remember to use rubies at the right time, e.g. getting a tunnel before building a mine/animal right before breeding/using a high level dwarf etc. Sometimes it even takes opponents by surprise.  Not sure about the balance in weapons in a 3p game, as you said, it's powerful if only one does it. If two do it, the other person can easily build a strong farm+animal engine very easily. It's usually well balanced in a 4p game.  	17

    That's Divisadero street in the Marina   Kate Upton's tits   Worst.Laugh.Ever   Naxxos is awesome. Have you listened to any Klingande? The sexiest sax music there is! I'm seeing them in about a month in San Francisco, I'm really pumped.   Fair weather fandom at it's finest right there!   He always would play in the parking lots before games at Candlestick. We would always smoke him out and give him a hard time for being an A's fan haha.      What are Sam Feldt's best tropical house songs?   What are Thomas Jack's best tropical house songs?   We need Anonymous to track down these fucks and I will gladly tie them to my car and drag them for miles. Fuck these fucking fucks!   Kygo, super tropical DJ from Norway.   Human Centipede   Hooooooodooorrrr   Hodor   I'm really sorry to hear that. I wish him all the best.   Least you're getting your weed from an incredible actor   What's red and frothing and crawls up a woman's leg?  A homesick abortion   This same theory applies to most unpopular kids who join a frat in college in order to be "cool" in the eyes of their peers.   I had to tell them I was suspended for 2 weeks from 8th grade because a classmate snitched on me for having weed at school. Snitches get stitches!   Louie Anderson/ Roseanne Barr   I opened the comments to say that same exact thing hahah. You beat me to it. Well done!   48 feet long? Holy shit!   Duuuude, that would be hilarious.   Haha!   Now now fellas. Asdyc, what is your favorite dinosaur?   It's not about wrong or right, it's all a matter of opinion. Interested to hear what dinosaur you think is the most badass.   Those things are like the hyenas of the dinosaur world.   What about the Gigantosauras?   Hahaha the Megalodon must have been frightening beyond comprehension for everything else in the ocean!   Pterodactyls were absolute death from above!   What that real?   What was the fiercest dinosaur in your opinion?   That was an awesome link. I didn't even know about the Gigantosauras. That dinosaur sounds fierce as hell!   Mammoths were pretty huge! You wouldn't want to catch their horns.   What was the most badass dinosaur in your opinion?   Haha dodo birds!   That's one huge bird! I bet it had some serious talons.   I was watching Cosmos tonight and it made me wonder what was the most interesting/badass animal to ever inhabit Earth?

That's a tough break...   Haha sounds like you guys didn't like the kid  	50
 That is very true. And I bet everyone who thinks they were raised well will find things wrong with the way other people were raised. I guess it's just the apparent reliance on technology that scares me. I feel that I was raised very well, and hope to raise my future children the same way, but I think it's pretty hard to royally screw up a child, so long as you still treat them like a human being.   Up vote for cats with human names. Mine are Kate and Bill, next girl (unless a ginger, who will be named after one of the Weasley ladies) will be Tallulah, three L's and an H.   We've had our fair share of ferals back home, he looks like he can take care of himself. Hopefully he can get into a TNR program, but he looks like he's seen some shit.   At older ages, it's ok, but I've seen many people hand an iPad to their two year old because they didn't want to deal with actual parenting.  Then again, I may be old school. I wasn't allowed to play video games at all growing up (I played Mario kart for the first time when I was 18), and that probably skewed my views. If I ever uttered the words "I'm bored," I was immediately put to work cleaning or working in the garden. Hell, I spent every summer from age 7 to 15 at a garden camp, and it was amazing until I was put in a junior counselor position (for some reason, everyone assumes girls love small children, who I happen to hate more than most things).   I'm terrified when I see parents these days just give their kids a smartphone to be entertained. I ran around in the yard, wrestled with the dogs, read books, asked my dad if I could help cook, and did all sorts of fun things that stimulated me more than candy crush ever could.  Then again, I was homeschooled 2nd-6th grade, and did ballet, so there was always a science project or a new step to practice, too.   Idk about German, but gendered nouns often don't make any sense. In French, the word for vagina is masculine.   Wine glasses, IME, are just for breaking on your kitchen floor. Lost my last one a month ago, and my vacuum is so shitty that I still get to pick pieces of broken glass out of my feet afye lunch every day.   That glass thing hasn't had an atm for at least a year.   In my experience, old animals know when it's time and will wander, as if to keep the ones who love them from seeing the body. We had a Cocker Spaniel growing up, and right around his 17th birthday, he just wandered off and we never saw him again. That was actually a lot easier for me (I was 13/14) than when we put down our other dog when I was 16. Cody the spaniel was my sister's dog, Buddha was my baby brother (he was only a year younger than me).  I already get very sad thinking about the day I will need to put my cats down, but they are both young still.   I've been wanting to get friends to go to brunch, cuz there's a place in town that has cheap mimosa pitchers, but no one is awake.   I've only met a couple niche celebrities (Julie Kent would occasionally visit my ballet studio growing up, a family friend has juggled for Cirque de Soleil, and anyone who grows up in Bloomington, Indiana has at least seen John Mellencamp [ps, he's a jerk]), but even those I've had a hard time keeping it together.  It's good to hear about famous people acting like what they are -- regular people who happen to be famous. And good on you for treating him as that, besides the photo op that must get annoying.   There's this store in San Francisco that literally only has infused oils, vinegar, and spices. I got a bottle of salad dressing that was lemon evoo and chili-fig balsamic last time I was out there. One of the best things I've ever tasted.   I went with Dead Poets Society, which if course made me sob anyway, but his first scene. "We are food for worms, lads. One day, we are all going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die." That bluntness has helped me through the hard times, oddly.   He may go to a new home at some point, because my dad is allergic and barely tolerates the one who adopted us several years ago, but I hope this little Nugget can stay around. I'd take him in, but my landlord is already iffy about me having two.   Thanks do the quick reply! I will probably just go to the drugstore to get a cheap pair of nylons for stuffing, cuz I want it to be overstuffed, and will be using scrap yarn, so will probably need to use dc or hdc to make sure I have enough.      I've decided to take a short break from my frantic afghan making (3.5 left to do before Xmas, at least two before graduation in May) to make myself a foot cushion.  I have terrible knees and ankles (seeing an orthopedist in a month or so to find out what's really wrong), and when I spend a day working on a project, it's those joints that hurt more than my wrists.  I'm just gonna wing the pattern, but I've never made anything stuffed before. Do I need to make sure that the stitch are especially tight so the filling won't leak out? Could I stuff it in some pantyhose and then into the pillow? One of my cats is notorious for ripping the stuffing out of any toy and trying to eat it, so I'd like to find a way to minimize that.  TL;DR: making my first stuffed object, how can I make sure the stuffing will stay inside?   This is terrifying! I finally finished a blanket for a friend that was supposed to be done for graduation (early May), so I'm gonna have to ship it from Indiana to Seattle/Tacoma when she moves out there in a week or so, and I was planning on using one of those USPS flat rate boxes. I guess I'll wait to buy the yarn for my next project so I can ship it with UPS or FedEx and feel more secure.   Is there any type of shelter? My town has a battered women's shelter,  and every year I use my Christmas scraps to make hats and scarves do the kids who live there.  Many animal shelters will also accept blankets and cat baskets. Look up the snuggles project.   I understand this in posts where you can't see the whole project. Recent posts that just show a baby or pet wrapped up in a blanket so you can't see what the FO looks like annoy me, but afghans or other projects that happen to have a cat in the picture are fine. For my last post, I couldn't keep my kitty off the blanket, and used her to show the scale.   Imma add this to my many reasons to move to Andorra.   Bobby pins don't do jack in my hair, but I buy them all the time.   I'd take it as a compliment, but I'm a very strange young woman. I pride myself on the fact that I'm a 21-year-old grandma (my chocolate chip cookies have been grandma level since I was 14), and grandmas are awesome (except that awkwardly racist one that some people have).  You have a skill that is becoming lost among the younger generations, so you're keeping a great craft alive.   I'd ask her. Burgundy is gorgeous, but isn't really maroon. Unless it's a surprise, maybe you could try to take her shopping with you. Or your uncle, or someone who knows her taste well. I took my mom with me to make sure the colors for my sister's afghan would be nice.  EDIT: and I plan on asking my sister for advice for my mom's.    Late to the game, but this organization was recommended by a person in the stitch n bitch I'm starting on my campus once classes start. If I weren't trying to cram three and a half afghans by Christmas, I'd join in as well.   I just finished every season of HIMYM that's on Netflix. Thankfully I had already seen the end, else I'd have to find it elsewhere online.  Afhghans and Netflix are perfect for each other.   I'm gonna head over to the liquor store when I can work up the heart to move the napping cat in my lap.   How can you get striping tape to stick like that? I've only tried once, with a liberal application of top coat, but the tape peeled off in 45 minutes.    My ghetto apartment doesn't even have a roll, so it has to go on the awkwardly covered radiator next to the toilet.  And somehow I'm happy living here for three years.   I strictly follow the 2:1 ratio, but I've heard other people say that simply cover in the rice with an inch of water also works. A lot of recipes say not to peek, ever, but it really isn't that finicky.   Try making it a few times in small batches and it'll become second nature.   Cooking rice on the stove has some big scary stigma, but I do it at least weekly, and it's done by the time I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get ready. Fluff, put it in the fridge, fried rice for dinner every night.   Perfect brioche take 8 hours, minimum, and if you can master a 4-strand braided circle, you will win at life (or so I've been told when I do this).  My recipe is from a book called "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie," although I will always add a pinch or two of nutmeg.  Home made croissants are also impressive, and take more than 8 hours to make properly. And once you learn how to make that dough, you can make pain au chocolat, or beautiful fruit turnovers, or pretty much anything that requires puff pastry. I'm a girl, so I can vouch that saying "yeah, I made this from scratch" will get me wet, when it comes to puff pastry.    I used two strands throughout.  Basic pattern:  Chain 32 with two strands of the starting color (in this case, green or white)  Dc 14 rows  Tie off one of the strands and switch to the other color.  Dc 14 rows.   Repeat.  Make the same strips, starting with a solid of the other color, sew then together.  This one is throw sized, shown on a couch with a very small kitty (Kate is only around 7 pounds,  even though she's almost 16 months old, just like my other baby, Bill).      This is why I always keep the lid down. Otherwise the cats wouldn't drink any other water, and my apartment is ghetto enough for the toilet to inly flush half the time.   And doing that thing cats do where they repeatedly poke your face the second you start stirring at all. Assholes. Adorable, lovable assholes.   I usually carry my groceries back in my backpack, and they both jump in the second it's opened.   That happened to me even during Freshman year of college, when I was blessed with never having hangovers. Now I just make sure to get a water after every drink or two, or chase with water if I make the (always horrible, terrible, no good, very bad) life choice to take shots.   Drunk me left a pair of glasses at a rando's house.   Sugar pie baby cat/ you know I love you/ I can't help myself/ I just love to snuggle you.   I won't have a projector or anything, but I carry my laptop with me to class anyway, so that would probably help.   That is a great idea! Last night, I just realized that I don't really know how to explain these things because they're second nature to me now. Maybe I could even show some of these videos from my laptop, since it will be after class anyway.   These aren't really classes, more getting people together to work on a common hobby. Some people have just expressed an interest in learning. It will be taking place in a lounge in the dorm where I used to live, and many people seem to be especially interested in philanthropic projects (hats for kids at the local battered women's shelter, project linus, etc). Some people already know how, and some will also be knitting (which is not my forte at all), so I may have some help there.   I don't go to mine often, just because I need to spend money on food more than nice yarn, but I know most of the women who work there are bistitchual.  I'll probably go there tomorrow, since I've got some things to do in town, anyway.   Maybe next time I go to the yarn store, I can ask the ladies there how they teach. Most of them are knitters, though. I'm not against knitting, I just vastly prefer crochet.   So, I've decided to start a stitch n bitch group on my campus in the fall, and have said that I will teach people the basic stitches (ch, sc, dc, etc.), but just realized that I'm not sure how to go about that.  I know I will start with simple projects, like scarves, wrist warmers, and hats in the round after a while, but I'm not sure how to describe how one does the simple stitches. I know I get confused reading patterns, and I've been crocheting for over a decade.   Without saying things like "insert hook, yarn over, pull through, yarn over, pull through both loops," how would you describe a sc? I'm guessing these people to be complete newbs, with no experience, and I don't think I can go around the circle teaching everyone separately.   Nudge. Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge nudge nudge. Nudge. Now your cup is on the floor.   Oh, I've lived here my whole life, almost 22 years. Back home, we've had some trees go down and almost hit the house, but we have a basement that's practically a bomb shelter.  My apartment is just old and ghetto with shitty windows. Last September, when we had that warning, I brought the cat I had then down to the laundry  room because I'm a wimp, especially when it comes to the safety of my babies.   Now I'm afraid about leaving my cats in my apartment near campus while I have lunch with the family in the far far west side. May just need to be a playdate.    And feeling sexy doesn't have anything to do with wanting to have sex/make babies. I often put on a full face just to go buy eggs and watch Netflix all day. I like to feel awesome, and sometimes that means I have to put in the extra effort to look awesome.   I only braid it when I'm making a big (2+ batch) loaf for a party and want to impress. Otherwise, loaf pans are fine because the buttery, eggy, fatty deliciousness of brioche is more important than presentation.   Since /u/3rdcoastwonder is a coach, I'm guessing he means something like surprise race runs. Going into practice, you warm up as you normally would, then do a time trial or two for the races you usually swim. Practice pools are usually warmer than race pools.   Had a professor once who noticed that a lot of the class was out sick for two weeks. He told us to take a strong shot or two of bourbon for each cup of lemon tea.  I took his class the next two semesters in a row.   Where do you find this? I can get Harpoon craft cider, which also tastes like aj, but I love me some cider.   Still less than three inches deep.   Sweet! Thanks, that sounds perfect, then. And as I said, freezing those thick fries/chips is incredibly easy, so I think I will be set. Thank you again!   Can you safely freeze fish? I figured it would lose too much, texture wise, but being encased in batter would keep it more moist.  My friends say I'm the queen of freezing (I regularly buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze individual portions), but I'm never sure about fish.  As background, I'm in Indiana, so most of the fish I get has either already been frozen and rethawed (bacteria if I freeze it again?) or really expensive.    Some of the fish stick recipes I've seen have you cook the sticks all the way, then only use the oven to reheat them. Maybe that could work for the batter, too?  I would just buy a bunch of fish and go to town trying to find a way, but I'm a college kid on a budget.   I've been told I'm really weird for this, but I even like to snack on it raw. Maybe dip it into a mix of plain Greek yogurt and various seasonings (garlic/onion powder, chili powder, etc.) like you would dip any other vegetables.   I have been going through the most intense fish and chips craving recently, but I don't want to keep ordering out (there's only one place in town that will deliver them, and very few that serve them to begin with).  I've found recipes for making things like fish sticks, but that doesn't have the delicious batter.  Could I flash fry the battered fish, like you would pre fry the chips, and then heat them up in the oven? I would love to make a big batch to save.  Tl;dr: is there any way to freeze a properly battered fish to have fish and chips on deck?   My ginge boy likes to use the shower. He's learned several phrases, but "I'm mad at you" is not one.   This is what snapchat is for.   When I was still getting over a dislocated knee, I still worked cute sundresses with my sneakers and huge, ugly knee brace. Not too bad, since I needed it, but I was given some serious shade by the more "fashion forward" girls on campus.  EDIT: I also had some trouble shaving my legs during the recovery process, so by the time the winter from hell was over, I looked like a bear.   I recently gained a lot of weight. I was a size six for as long as I could remember, then had some serious joint issues, so I couldn't work out at all without feeling like death for days after. I was just able to go shopping last week, and it hurt realizing that I was up to a 14. I'm tall, and it doesn't feel as bad as other things that have happened in my life, but vanity sizing like this angers me.   Like I said, it was the first time I dabbed. My tolerance was high enough to be able to drive after smoking a joint, I had no idea how much higher I would get.   Another way to make us size-14's feel bad about ourselves.   Kitty looks just like my big boy Guillaume!    Makes me remember the first time I dabbed. Did three in a row, not thinking. Had to drive an hour and a half to pick up my mom from the airport an hour later. Worst. Idea. Ever.   Chemicals, yes. Everything in the world is composed of chemicals. Air? H2O. But chemicals that cause cancer, unlikely.    Yup. In my town, you can find a shitty chillum for $10. I've smoked out of cans, plastic bottle bongs/steam rollers, hasn't killed me yet. Edit: phone autocorrect   Yeah, I originally thought it was /r/beer for some random thing.   More short stories should be, though. We only read Huckleberry Finn, and I think this and the War Prayer are equal, if not better, social commentary that is still relevant today.   The War Prayer is amazing, as well.   Yeah, I can only watch it every few months cuz it puts me in such a bad place for days, even stone cold sober.    Mine seem to listen to me more when I'm speaking French. Somehow, they'll always stop whatever they're doing at "tu sais mieux que ca," but never at "you know better."   Haha, mine always rub on my legs right after I get out of the shower, them give me a dirty look for getting them wet. CATS!   Like everyone else has said, get Smithville if you can. Comcast, on top of being pure monopolistic evil, will fuck you over every have they get. My neighbors can only get AT T, I can only get Comcast. Last time I tried to call, I was put on hold for 45 minutes before my call was disconnected.    Mine was more than a week. A friend's  5 days before Halloween, mine the next day, Halloween, bff's on the 2nd..... then another two a week later.  Hooray for confirmed Valentine's Day babies.   My neighbor registered his Chihuahua as a service dog for his "separation anxiety."   Haha, before I moved and had a bathtub shower, my Kate would do the same. She'd sometimes even sit on the far side of the tub and just stare.   Exactly. And good home made bread doesn't have a great shelf life. I make brioche for myself about once a month and have to eat it in two days if I want it to be good, and it takes a shit load of eggs and butter.   She specified these colors. I was initially doing a houndstooth pattern, but realized it was gonna take way too long. This one is already almost two months late, since it was supposed to be for her graduation, but each strip only takes about a day.      Holy frick, those earrings tho! The makeup is also gorgeous, but I can't get over your earrings.    Hell yeah, I'll try to stop by! You're really close to my place, and I love yard sales   Surprised at how much I dislike Guinness. The Asahi tasted like your generic big brewery stuff, somewhere between Bud and Hamm's cola. The Midwestern Pale Ale is perfect for people like me, who generally don't like things that are super hoppy.   Got a mix-a-six with Baltika #9 (a favorite), Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat, Upland Wheat Ale, Guineas (which I've somehow never tried), Bell's Midwestern Pale Ale, and something foreign, Asahi "super dry" with a bunch of stuff in maybe Japanese, far from any language I speak.       And the picture in that pattern is the exact same one as the post....   Only? Of course I clicked the link and started hyperventilating.    Like others have said, the Morgan-Monroe park, Brown County forest, and  McCormicks Creek are great. I also suggest the hiking trails around Lake Griffey, and (if it's available for you) Merengo Cave or Spring Mill state park.   You can swim in Lake Lemmon? I've tried so many times to find a place that isn't for boats, but never found one. And I've lived here my whole life   On top of the fact that Quebecois is one of the ugliest versions of French. Sorry not sorry to you Quebecois people.   I don't see how voice commands are better. I remember soending a few days with my grandmother last month, and she kept trying to find out the scores from White Sox games, and it was always faster for me to just type "white sox scores from (date)" because her phone took too long to figure out what she was saying.   Might have had a bit to do with her Wisconsin accent, but still.   Even though it's summer (at least where I am), I'd suggest a soup. I'm not sure if the exact recipe, but my mother makes a great soup with kale, leeks, wild rice, and turkey.  My tip is to find meats at the store that are super in sale (for me it's usually because their sell by date is the next day), portion the chops into bags, and freeze. I can make one package of frozen chicken breasts (usually around $4) and two packages of pasta (~$2 each) last a week when I have veggies, butter/oil, spices, and a dozen eggs (~$3 here).   I like lemon tea with a bunch of honey. The lemon clears things up, the honey makes it stick around longer.   Are you on the south side? A few of my friends there have seen bikes go missing/have theirs get stolen   Don't be ashamed or whatever. I'm a bi girl, and while I can see how genitalia is hot in the moment, it looks fuckin' weird out of context.   Like everyone else has said, so sorry for your loss, but it happens to most people, and it does get better.  We had to put my dog down when he was 15 and I was 16. He had terrible arthritis, so would just lie around all day, then get seizures because he couldn't get up to eat. The last six months or so, I made sure to snuggle up in him as much as I possibly could. That was 5 years ago, and I still get sad sometimes thinking about him, but it gets better.   I can't comment on Little Blue's, but I got both of mine done by Giacomo at Skinquake and he's amazing. Mine are both simple, but look up his portfolio.   Yeah, my family always called them one-eyed egyptians. Not sure where that came from, but that's what we always called them   Mulberries are in season, and it's been a tradition for me to pick a bunch and make things with them.  The obvious choices for these wonderful things are pies, cobblers, scones, muffins, and other baked goods.  But I challenge you all who can get to them to make something savory with these berries.  Last year, I made a bunch of spicy Asian inspired dishes with the 2+ pounds of mulberries my friends and I picked.  Idk if challenges are actually ok, sorry if they aren't, but try, kids! Spicy berry pasta is one of my favorite things, so try it out.   After reading through that website (thank you!), I think I will try to get to know this kitty for a bit.  Where I grew up, there were a lot of ferals and strays, so I've learned the difference. The cat my parents currently have was a stray that took more than a year to get close to us.  This cat has only been out during the day, and has come fairly close to me. I think she's a stray, not feral, from my experience. I did call the shelter to ask what I should do, but I will wait a bit before taking her there.  I will continue to leave food out, as she seems quite skinny, and see if she becomes more used to my presence.    They don't have to be, although most people I know have done it. This cat may be, but that's a big reason why I want to get it to the shelter.   I just saw it again, and s/he looks fairly mangy close up.  My local shelter is luckily a no-kill, and I just want to find out if it's microchipped. There's some possibility, if it isn't and would be compatible, I'd bring it into my home, but I already have two. S/he seem quite skittish, probably because s/he's been outside for a while.  I am going to call my shelter to see about anything else I should do.   Hello! I've been seeing a tuxedo cat with no tail wandering around my apartment for a few weeks now.  S/he seems to be an adult, probably 18 months or older, black with a white stomach and face, with no tail.  I don't think anyone would let their cat roam around outside in this area (Fess and Atwater) because there's way too many cars and streets, so I'm thinking it may be lost or a stray.  If you know anyone who is missing a cat with this description, please let me know. I'm planning on asking around, and if none of my neighbors know whose it is, I will try to lure it near so I can get it to the shelter.  Update: upon closer inspection, s/he seems a little raggedy, but definitely not feral. I will be working to gain his/her trust for a while, to see if s/he truly can be socialized. It looks like s/he has been out for quite a while, but still hmu if you know anyone who has lost a similar cat.   There's been a tuxedo with no tail wandering around my neighborhood for a few weeks now. S/he looks fairly well taken care of, like s/he may have been a housecat, but I'm in an area surrounded by apartments, near streets, so I don't think anyone would let their cat be an outsider.  Should I leave out some food to lure her/him near so I can take her/him to the shelter? Once I can think everyone will be awake, I'm gonna go around and ask about it, but I feel so sad thinking that this beautiful cat isn't being taken care of.   Prescription goggle exist, but I doubt you'd wanna put them on every time you toke.   I decide if something is appropriate based on whether or not you can see this mole I have on my chest.... specific for me, but it's a good guide for how low-cut I can go.  	109
 People have said religion, but the problem goes far beyond the scope of religion. Its oppression, created by their leaders and social structure not Islam and economic disadvantage and the lack of education due to the lack of a good economy to support a knowledge base.   People are drawn to ISIS because they believe that by joining ISIS they'll escape oppression in turn leading to a more comfortable live. THEY ARE SO WRONG. ISIS does everything that's against Islam. In Islam you'll go to hell for persecuting other religions, especially Christianity and Judaism, to which Islam shares so much with. One of the main Islamic celebrations is from God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac which is in Christianity.  Also Muslims believe is Jesus.  So it makes no sense to persecute these "unbelievers". ISIS will survive by oppression. These ISIS members think they'll be free from their current tyrannical despots but they are just feeding another tyrannical despot.   In Islam men and women are equal in any social structure. However, people will not know this unless they're educated, in the sense of religion and the regular schooling, SIS is not going to be willing to provide education that is free of censorship. These ISIS subjects will never know what real Islam is. The Islam they'll know is the version that best fits the needs of ISIS.   Like the Al Qa'ida, they'll garner a bad reputation for the Muslims living abroad in the West (read reddit comments below for proof). They'll do this so the Westerners are racist and stereotypical towards the Muslims in turn the oppressed joins/ understands ISIS's cause.   The best course of action for the Western countries is not only to bomb these fuckers, but to spread what the real Islam says via radio and TV broadcasts. I assure you that most of ISIS's members are uneducated and thus they are easily deceived by ISIS's Imams because they have always been told to trust like you would trust a man in an uniform than the guy with chinos and a t shirt on.    Well you see at my age my brain isn't as sharp as it used to be    So you studied?    Me denying your guesses about my reddit username   Plant sperm need many claritens    Had a guy refer to it as cancer   Your face   Corn syrup is even worst!    And what does Israel have to offer?    Nice try!    Money isn't really the issue. The real issue is that we have lost the principles that America was founded upon. We have lost our right to privacy. We have laws like the patriot act where existing laws can be sidelined in the name of national security. Money can always be earned but our rights as citizens are gone-- possibly forever. All we can do now is make sure that those laws that violate the Principles which America was founded on gets repealed and that is the only way we can avenge the deaths of our soldiers who died to protect our freedom.     Procrastination and Impatience   Procrastinating   Yeah...um that's a gift that you should embrace!    Its like he won!?   You're like television   How are they not sued?    Fuck you Nestl we are in a drought get your water from somewhere else!   They also own the seatle mariners    Well it's yellow   I feel like that these quotes were taken out of context   Keep adding to it guys   You guys have it worst ha!   War crimes? And already happens   You don't matter but you're full of matter. Lighten up!    Can you do it to your self and upload a gif?    ;)   Damn   What euro laws allow cars from other countries to drive in Europe?    Picture!!!!   Acoustic is so much better   I'm full of wisdom actually   You sir are taking this very lightly   Two 6th graders at my school got caught having sex in the bathroom   Yeah seriously wtf stay open on Sundays atleast at night   It requires special powers and some gene mutations   Yeah parents of reddit just how?    Just wait till you see my roll royce   This is just politics countering Chinese economical advances in Africa   Just go to Asia people   The whole time I was all like Faulkner wrote this. That Gyllenhall skillz    Also, there are people who don't vaccinate their kids.  That is so scary, like if one of those fuckers get some disease we are all fucked, there goes our heard immunity.   If you are anti vaccine, just know that not vaccinating your kid could kill another vaccinated kid or HUNDREDS of other people.     Imma buy and hoard helium :)   R u sure ;)   As long as they don't have access to mineral resources we should be fine... oh wait Africa and the south China sea   You're like the Jewish Putin   Feeling kind?    Incubating bacteria is the worst   What if our brains are wired to this just so that we have immunity?    I think the other guy was on Viagra or something   Look like you inked your pants   OK all I need is your account details    Yeah you gon have to pay up for this promotional campaign y'all got goin' on   I'll give you five dollars and some bees   What they don't get is the fact that when employees aren't showing people where things are customers aren't spending money   Best Korea for sure   I had a guy argue with me that the US was not at war atm cause we never declared war. Like screw your technicalities...   No Oxford is favourite and Webster is favorite   By oxford or webster? They are both great IMO   Skillz to pay the billz!    Which universities offer this?    Because it's not my reddit name    I'll go buy a lake    Doesn't hurt to try   The op of dickbutt should have copyrighted it   What did it look like?    Yep!   They need education they do everything that's against Islam to begin with   It feels like it doesn't work very well   So does that mean that the population with sickle cell mutation might die out or am I really horribly so far off that this planet has decided to banish me from Earth?    This is something the Taliban would totally say   Does ISIS know that one can't prosper through oppression?    Ahem...   Or your first born    OK good bye!   What seat is that?    Early life crisis right there   But but but...   That was his god damn point   Dude even muslims don't like Saudi Arabia! If it weren't an important place for Islam then no Muslim would give two shits about them  Edit: Spelling correction  	80
                This advice will take you straight to rank 1:  You can take the enemy straight to the mid core. As long as your top and bot are being narced by a tank and a healerrespectively.   He reminds me of Kerrigan with stronger 1v1 and weaker ults. Insane duelist but very awkward in a team fight.  Basically, he's going to kill you, unless something kills him first.                                                                              The dude took her 45% Iowa lead to 19% in 2 months, has received donations from 5 times as many people as Hillary, and can't find a venue large enough to hold all of his supporters. And yeah, she's got more money but he's running a much leaner, grass roots campaign. Really the only thing she has on him is billionaires, and with the type of campaign that he's running, that might not even be much of an issue.  Don't count him out yet.   How fast do your private police and firemen respond, and what does your premium cost?   As an American, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren seem like two great politicians and a breath of fresh air.      I wish there were more candidates with his integrity.  FTFY. We need more people like him on both/all sides of the isle.   Thanks for posting this!  I think [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016) might be a better link for primary election dates, though. Unless I'm mistaken, the one you linked only hast the dates from 2012.   For the people, *by* the people.   The fact that you think that a few lines in The Old Testament account for "everything that God says", while disregarding practically everything that Jesus says, tells me that I probably shouldn't even be responding to you...   I'd imagine that's why he's running in the primary...   What would you say those faults are? What makes him the "least awful" as opposed to "the best"?   He's technically a "democratic socialist". It's probably more fair to say that he's a populist more than a socialist.  It's kind of nuanced, so if you want to know what he believes, this interview covers his positions really well:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo   People are excited about a good, honest man with a real shot of becoming president.  That doesn't really happen all that often.    He's obviously going to raise taxes like crazy to pay for these ridiculous programs - he just hasn't been pushed to admit it yet.  He "admits" it constantly. If you've ever heard him speak, he repeatedly says he's going to raise taxes on super rich to help the 99%.  His response to pretty much anything he's ever been asked is one of the following:  * We need to raise taxes on the rich. * If you want to know Hillary's position on that, don't ask me, ask her.  [Observe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo)   Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders.   This is the first time that I've considered a write-in as well. I always wondered what the point was. Now I know.   I agree, and your username is awesome.      Is the issue the "Republicans for Bernie - Republicans for Bernie"? Honestly just a copy and paste mistake, but I'd like to know for when I repost it.   Only if you disagree with him. This interview gives you some good insight into his positions:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo   That's probably why nobody's saying that.                               EDIT: Ugh, give your $3.99 to Bernie. No one should be giving anyone gold on this subreddit, donate it to the campaign instead and tell the OP a "hey I donated $3.99 on your behalf."  hey I donated $10.00 on your behalf ;)  I wasn't the one that gilded you, just to be clear.    Please. The House isn't switching before the 2020 census, when districts get redrawn, at the earliest. The Senate, if the candidate has some coat tails, can flip.  That's fair.                                             Or the best.   If enough people show up to elect Bernie, they'll almost definitely also put a congress that'll work with him in place. The reason that the people are much more liberal than the government is that old people vote and young people don't. But Bernie definitely has enough young people fired up that they'd actually show up on election day.   Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders.      /r/gogopgo   /r/gogopgo   Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders.   Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders.   Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders.   Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders.                                 Welcome! Very glad to have you aboard.  Mind sharing your feelings on why you switched? I'm particularly interested to hear which issues were most significant for you, and why you feel Bernie's stance on them is a better fit for you (and America).  Thanks.   Agreed on all points. I wish Sanders would be more vocal about it, though. I wonder if he's trying to show campaign platform restraint by not running on too many things. It's the only reason I can think of why he's not speaking out for more for legalization.   Depends on your perspective. Here's [my opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3brr5m/bernie_sanders_is_an_american_politician_who_has/csp4ek0).    You seriously think that less than 1% of the public would quit working, if they were able to make as much or more than they do now but without working?  I think exactly that, yes.   I disagree. I'm rather confident that 99% of the population would agree that $12k per year is not enough, and would work towards more.      Believe it or not, paying people to do nothing is a large and immediate disincentive.  If someone guaranteed you a paycheck of $1,000 per month, you wouldn't quit your job and do nothing, and neither would 99% of the rest of the population.                                 Yeah, for this to work in the US it'd have to be something like $800 to $1,500 per month, similar to [what they're trying in The Netherlands](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/07/01/3676097/utrecht-universal-basic-income/).   It's a good thing basic income doesn't disincentivize productivity, then. In fact, it's been shown to increase productivity.   You can still advertise your meeting. Just duplicate the /r/Dayton post in this sub (and don't ask for upvotes).   Worked for me. Got the same message and restarted twice. I got in on the third try.  Thanks for posting this. I wouldn't have tried the restarts otherwise. Oh and BoE is the map. Bonus!                        Yeah, I found them incredibly mundane as well.   I think it's an official thing.                                                                        That looks fantastic! Nicely done.   I was about 20 minutes into a game yesterday before realizing that I didn't have Prog Rock. They moved it and I just looked at the icon, not the text.  On the plus side, I had plenty of mana!    It's funny how the ragers always are the worst players on a team, without exception.  FTFY               They're supposedly re-editing it to be chronological. I'll probably give it another try then, but I gotta say, I am not looking forward to it.   He just keeps outdoing himself. #FeelTheBern                                 That's odd. Why would they go straight from 3 to 5? That'd be like making an Indiana Jones 5...  If anyone needs me, I'll be in denial.   I'm like 10 episodes in. I just can't stomach anymore. It stretched everything out way too long, it wasn't funny, and it wasn't Arrested Development.  If 10 of 15 episodes isn't enough to get an idea of the season, I guess I'm just missing out.   This interview sums it up rather nicely:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo   Integrity. It costs.   It is a good thing when the norm of your profession is to use/abuse it for personal gain, not to mention that it's a lot easier to represent people when you understand the lives that they lead.   Ha, I totally didn't notice that. Good catch.   Here's a great interview:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo  Or if you just want to get pumped, here's 3 minutes of moving remarks:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ   Thank you for posting this. I think it's very important. Bernie is running a positive campaign, and I think we, as a sub, should emulate that.   Yeah, wish I could go :(      It's actually very significant.  It shows that in a time when people consider politicians to be greedy and entirely self serving, Sanders hasn't used very powerful position for personal gain. By politician standards (especially by senator standards), he's downright poor.  It also shows that while most politicians are very much out of touch with the lives of ordinary people, Bernie's modest lifestyle shows that he knows exactly what the lives of his constituents are really like.  Looking at all of his extremely populist positions, it's obvious that he's for the people, but this demonstrates that he is also *of* the people.   Oh, I was looking [here](http://www.heroesnexus.com/heroes/26-brightwing). Must not be updated.      I can't make this one, but I think it's wise to keep the date as is. We can add another one at a later date if there's enough interest.   I can't make it on the 11th (family plans) but I'd definitely be interested in future meetups.  Thanks for organizing this!   West Chester here. I'd be interested!                  Me too. I went digging for it after I saw that he reported $200k in income this year. I thought for sure he'd have at least a few million to his name, since he's been a senator for so long. Nope. Practically poor in politician terms.  The guy is not only for the people, he's *of* the people.      I haven't played the new BW yet. How do you give an ally spell shield?   Also, let us toggle the mount on and off on the play screen, too, so we can get a better idea what our skin/tint/mount combo looks like.   Yeah, though I get that impression just listening to the guy speak. He's nothing short of incredible.   Add an extra space between each one if you want them on individual lines. Or use bullet points.  Thanks for adding this!   I don't think it's ridiculous to get excited the possibility that a great man with unchanging convictions who cares about and prioritizes the needs of the people becoming the president of the united states.  I don't find anything ridiculous about that at all.   I think he's got a real chance, especially because cries like this have lessened dramatically. Just a few weeks ago you'd hear "He's amazing but he'll never win!" dozens of times per day. This is only the second time that I've heard it in probably over a week.  Overcoming that was a really major hurdle, and he got past it pretty quickly. He's flying up in the polls (they look better every day), he's getting insane turnouts at his rallies, he's raising good amounts of money (from people, not corporations or SuperPACs), and most importantly, he's clearly the best person for the job.  I think we're actually going to win this thing. And by "we" I mean America.   2,577 Chicago Police Hours Spent on Cannabis Arrests Just in the Last 30 Wasted  Much better.   He uses them every match. Or do you think he could look like a ridiculous, whimsical owl without them?   Only the government. The American people are actually much more liberal than the government, but old people vote and young people don't, so we end up with representatives that are significantly more conservative than those they're (supposed to be) representing.  	200

 Shit. I thought I posted ymm.2004 Chrysler Sebring   Yeah. That is a hard thing to deal with.   Just give it a try. It's easy....well once you get past cursing at an inanimate object.   Or Blu-ray player that is Wi-Fi enabled   Could you name some of those fields of work? This is a new topic for me.   Thanks for the reply. My brother Paul loves corn (or he at least loves saying it.) So yeah...I assumed you were him for obvious reasons.   I agree with the tipping thing. If you live in USA and you don't receive absolute terrible service, tip something. Even bad (not absolute terrible) service deserves 7%. If you don't tip because you can't afford it, then you can't afford to go out. The other things in your comment are things I do not care to have an opinion on.   I wrote a comment about this once before. I don't feel like retrieving it so either you can accept that or go look at my comments.   I love to work. I'd work 24 hours a day if it were humanly possible. I believe everyone should work (getting paid obviously) every spare minute. I had 2 full time jobs (40 hours a week each) and I wasn't getting enough work. People laugh at me and think it's weird but I can't help it.   Paul?   Sleepless in Mississippi   This one is less a "life hack" and more just using available technology to my advantage. I use my Samsung Wi-Fi connected smart tv to stream my digital media from my pc. No need to burn dvds or connect extra devices via USB (phone, USB drive, portable hdd, or other such devices.) I just obtain media and enjoy. ;-)   Do the same with Pringles. Same concept.   Damn. Of course. I really need to get on that going back into the Army thing I've been meaning to do. They'll pay for my education.   I did that on an application for a job yesterday. While being interviewed. Yes, I was being interviewed *before* I completed my application. I'm that good http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Luvmv-Bpryw   Those were my only purpose for going to kfc   Personally, I found their imitation of the big Mac to be better. Quite an improvement.   Rice krispies treats cereal is still here. MS, U.S.   That almost reminds me of those elf cookies that are elf shaped with fudge in the middle. I sadly can eat the whole container in  an hour   I can't seem to get my wife to understand this.   I agree with you on that. That's fact for a lot of things. If you pay $5 for x item and replace it 3 times a year. You just spent $15 plus tax and the gas to make multiple trips to the store or shipping fees on the internet on the "cheaper" product. If you go ahead and buy the $20 version of the same product, you'll save more on the long run. I spend more on my tv, computer, hdmi cables, car parts, etc because they'll last significantly longer and usually have protection plans.   That ridiculous neck wear? Or so I believe that's what it is from the way it's worn out here.   How and where? Where do I sign up?   I agree. This link explains a lot. http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/07/what-does-a-gigabyte-of-internet-service-really-cost-a-look-at-the-worst-case-scenario/   Arrr motherfuckin rrrrr   I think that may be my problem...   Ummm.... it's impossible to lie on the internet duh. Which brings me to the topic of my million dollar super computer that I solely use for offline checkers.   I stopped the DVD when he was killed. I refuse to watch any further. My wife still watches.   1. If you truly want something you'll work hard for it. If you don't feel like working for it, you don't want/need it. 2. Take pride in what you do, regardless of what that may be. Even if it seems "menial". Have a great deal of self respect when doing it. The only person's opinion (that matters) about you doing a "menial" job, is yours. 3. When you're young and see adults being successful, don't expect to just become a successful adult. Don't get discouraged just because you aren't filling those shoes. That/those adult(s) didn't start that way. Hard work was a big part of it. Quitting because you didn't get there quick enough is pathetic.   6'3, blonde hair, blue eyes, deep voice, and just overall attractive. Also, my Irish alcohol tolerance.   I can grow a grand, thick, full beard. My problem is it feels like copper wire. I have this theory that if I were to pull enough hairs out I could wire my car with high powered speakers.   So that explains it...   Same here. Is pretty convenient when some asshole decides to hit and run.   Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet.   Mine is like that but more like 7.5 to 8 inches when fully erect.   This is quite the usual occurrence for me. Everyone thinks it's magic. I just tell them it's simple really. When they ask for further details, I give them the details and they roll their eyes and decide they didn't want to know. I might just adopt the "it's magic" line.   I was driving my car as usual this morning without any issues. I went around town and didn't have any problems. I came back to my apartment and drove to the apartment's dumpsters to clean my car out. When I went to leave the dumpsters and get back on the road, I started to back out and my car suddenly stopped like something was behind the tires. I got out of my car and checked thoroughly behind each tire. Nothing was in my way do I tried again. No luck. I drove forward at an angle and tried again. Still nothing. I kept changing angles and still nothing. I finally got away from the dumpster and parked by my apartment. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong but I'm getting no where. It also stops suddenly if I put it in neutral. In neutral, my car should start to go in reverse due to the slope in the parking spaces here. If anyone could give feedback I'd really appreciate it.

It also stops suddenly if I put it in neutral. In neutral, my car should start to go in reverse due to the slope in the parking spaces here. If anyone could give feedback I'd really appreciate it.  The engine is 2.4L 4cyl DOHC 16V SMPI Transmission: 4  speed automatic.   Always Teste Ed Bassmaster. YouTube it   Let me get a job appy.   Or Marijuana: *cough* *choke* (in a restrained voice) "That's good grass"   Marijuana: ... pass it on.   Justin?   As my previous comment. I feel your pain. I'm also a guy in this situation.   This doesn't work with my wife. For as long as I've known her she always has been quiet when I legitimately ask her what's wrong. I've never told her shit like "you're being too emotional" etc. Edit: Also, she is the one that makes me feel like my concerns aren't rational or logical. Like how I feel about something isn't significant enough.   I'm experiencing the same thing but with my wife next to me.   There are a lot of repeat comments here. I would bring a handful of coins dated post 1994. Before anyone mentions fake coins. There are people whose job it is to verify coins and there legitimacy of said coins.   I love Forrest Gump and the shawshank redemption. I've never seen pulp fiction. Though if I were to watch a third movie from that year, I'd go for the lion king.   Middle school for me was the same 6th 7th and 8th. That wouldn't have been such a bad paper to write.   Okay. Fair enough. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I just know this sub is the only one that seemed appropriate enough.   Why such harsh words?   I usually can edit my posts but... reference the last bit of the topic. 4 am so on... Shoes are simple swap out for the desired pair and either hide old shoes under rack or in the box and pot the box under many boxes especially boxes of expensive shoes. These are purchased less often = more time to make the shoes "yours". Make them look used enough. Also, if your Wal-Mart employs careless people, bonus. Have two pairs of jeans, one wrapped inside the other. Change into one pair, wrap old jeans in the other new ones. Hide like with the shoes. Put on a jacket/hoodie after removing the tags but do it around zero cameras. Walk around like it's yours.  This method is brought to you as the wardrobe method.   Again, reference the grammar section of the main topic post for this comment also.   A friend of mine does a lot of shoplifting and gaining things in a not so legal manner.  My friend, let's call him Bob. Bob uses multiple methods to get things he wants and can't afford or doesn't wanna pay for. These things include Blu-ray players, pc software, portable hard drives, cell phone cases/other accessories, and other things such as these.  The shoplifting is done at Wal-Mart. If it's small enough to fit in his pants pocket then obviously... if it's a little big for pants or coat pocket but still small enough, his wife puts it in her purse. Oh, did I mention he's married and he and his wife work together? Well let me mention it. Bob's married and he and his wife work together. If it's still too big for her purse then they use what they call the mark down method (mdm). The mdm is finalized at self checkout. By the way, Bob's wife's purse is actually a subtle looking diaper bag so plenty of space and lots of pockets. Anyway. The mdm as mentioned earlier has two ways of being done. Either they locate an item that is 1. Significantly cheaper than the targeted item. 2. Has a bar code sticker that can easily be peeled. If both requirements are met, they peel the bar code sticker off the cheaper item and cover the target's bar code sticker. They've used this first example of mdm for things like vacuums (Dyson) all the way to counter top appliances like blenders and crock pots. Mdm#2: For large in size but slightly cheaper items they still can't afford/refuse to pay for. Usually food items/extra groceries. Bob and his wife locate and memorize a large enough produce item and memorize its plu code or the go to banana (4011). The rest of this method is self explanatory. (Self checkout with the volume muted).  You know the little plastic boxes that hold smaller easier but more costly products such as large capacity flash memory devices? The ones that usually hang from the wire rack and have the grey lid. You know, the clear hard plastic ones that usually contain video games or pc software or whatever! Well the alarm thing by the doors at the Wal-Mart here are crap. There are two sets of alarm things due to the entrance being so wide. Well if the product is carried just right in between both sets, it won't go off. Bob and his wife have gotten out with butt tons of merchandise this way. As long as it fits in her purse, out the door it goes.  If my grammar sucks, oh well. It's 4 am and I refuse to sleep because I haven't experienced sleep paralysis in a few days and just read a thread on /r/askreddit about it.   Higher education costs should be based on personal income. Just as federal student aid is income based. So should the cost of education. If I'm only financially eligible for x amount with a Fed grant, then I'm only capable of paying y amount. "Y" being a small percentage (if any) of what's left after federal aid. I should only be expected to pay what I can afford to pay.  	54

I stopped learning when I was able to play in class with the Vita   * Devil/Angel Rooms never spawn on the First Floor, however, * The Goat Head ("He Accepts Your Offering") will force a Devil/Angel Room to spawn, no matter the floor * Not taking damage on the floor increases the chance of a Devil/Angel Room spawning * The Evil/Sin stat increases the chance of Devil Rooms * The Faith stat increases the chance of Angel Rooms * Making a deal with the Devil greatly lowers the chance of an Angel Room spawning, and will increase the chance of Devil Rooms   All you can do is praise to RNGesus it doesn't happen again   You can reach the Cathedral or Sheol after the Mom's Heart fight by getting a Devil or Angel room on that floor. Otherwise, you'll be forced into the chest.  However, after you've beaten Mom 10 times, whenever you go back down there again, you'll face off against It Lives!!! rather than Mom's Heart. After killing It Lives!!!, you'll be given the option to go to either the Cathedral or Sheol, every time you get that far.   I miss the textures.    **"Chub dislikes smoke!"**  This is a reference to how, when a bomb is placed while Chub is charging, he'll consume it and it'll explode within him. This is also a reference to Legend of Zelda, as a similar boss disliked smoke and was killed in the same manner (credit to /u/Aksh0le )   **"Rooms may yield more than you expect - Experimentation is key"**  **"A dark market lies under your feet"**  These refer to what's beneath the carpets Zelda-esque sleeping rooms and some rocks, as these trapdoors can sometimes lead to the Black Market rooms.   **"The walls will harden over time - Time is the essence"**  This refers to how the Boss Rush Room only appears in the wall if you beat Mom in less than 20 minutes, else the wall will "harden" and you won't be able to access it.   **"A piece of paper is your guide"**  This hints at the Missing Poster and the Mysterious Paper, which, when you die in a Sacrifice Room, will give you a piece of the puzzle to unlocking The Lost.   **"Deny his gifts to attain your reward"**  This refers to how you have to forgo the offerings of the Devil Room in order for Angel Rooms to appear later.   **"Sleeping gatekeepers will need to be awoken with a loud sound"**  This refers to how one must blow up the Angels in the Angel Rooms in order to fight them to attain the Key Pieces. I feel as though the Devils don't blow up like the Angels because Satan doesn't want you to fight him, as there's still a small chance he'll lose. Every offering he gives, although some make you stronger, also potentially make you weaker for the final battle against him.   **"Some doors require a blessing - Carry them with you"**  This refers to how the Key Pieces, the blessings from the Angel Room, are needed to open the doors to the Mega-Satan boss.         I think it would be amazing to have someone write reviews on modpacks, mods, and does interviews, and whatnot. That's all we would need to make ModMyMC a full news outlet.  Several people (including yours truly .) have expressed interest in doing something like that. It wouldn't be restricted to just Feed the Beast, but could include AT Launcher, and Technic, and those doing interviews could speak with people prominent in the modding community. I personally would love to see something like this, but I don't  know if anyone else is.  	26
 And seriously most of us would agree if you toned it down a bit. No one is saying OMG .. FINALLY.. I MEAN FUCKING FINALLY... WHOOOPI!!! HALLELUJAH OUR DAY HAS COME OUR DAY HAS COME.  But notice woopie said it, and then daiyuesen posted it, you bitched about it.. bohemianabe properly calls you out.. and then i am posting.. THATS CALLED GETTING A CONVERSATION STARTED.   we need MORE PEOPLE talking about this.. not less. Not sure why you seem to have a logical handicap when it comes to that fact.  Is whoopi the best person on the fucking planet to be talking about it? Do I wish this was the pope, warran or obama.. hey probably, but this is still a good thing.. and sill a good post. Sorry if you hate whoopi dude. SHE HAS A SHOW.. which i suspect you do not. She mentioned our issue, and she is getting more people to talk about it. I dare say, she probably did more with tha one comment than you ass has done the entire time it has been here.  Seriously do you know how a movement works? Hey if you want us to attack woopi.. like you just did and kick her out and ask her to stfu about student loans.. you seem to think that will help? no? a bit over the top? well reread your first comment dude. like I said I might agree, but you went way over the top.        they are the mortal enemy of /r/meatballs a truly free meatball sub, open to everyone.. except the mods of /r/meatball.. fuck them.   yeah and there is good evidence it has to do with taking the lead out of our gas.  and for those who dont know the history of how fascists work in america, yall should look up the history of diethyl lead and the scientists who discovered it was bad for all of us.(the scientist who discovered diethyl lead was also the dude who unfortunately gave us CFCs as well.) you will recognize the methods of attack as well as many of the attackers.  how [lead causes americans crime epidemic](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/)  [did removing lead cause drop in crime](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615)  whats bad is we have known for 2000 years that ingestion of lead causes people to be more violent.  but when scientists said it was a bad idea to spew it in our air all to keep our cars from knocking...they were attacked as liberals who wanted big gov to control our lives and the dems only wanted to help catalytic converter donors and they were all on the dole just to hurt poor defenceless big oil. They got death threats.. while big oil/gas went to the heartland to get fake scientists to say it was all ok. A gas ceo dranked a glass of what he said was diethyl lead for the reporters.. it wasnt .. HE WOULD BE DEAD. 100%   and when we finally said ok the science is too much to deny.. we got to ban this shit.. we left in 2 exceptions. one for nascar.. cause no one breathes nascar air(which they just recently a couple years ago, stopped using lead) and we allow american companies to sell it abroad to this day.. cause no one shares any air. but the good thing is the PPM in our atomosphere has declined a ton. As of 2013 it is finally nearly completely banned due to other countries laws and not our own.. but there are still a few countries and things that use it.  of course, dont blame the corps and theri fake scientists.. WHICH THEY KNEW WERE FAKE.. AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE LYING.. ESPECIALLY THAT BASTARD WHO DRANK THE SHIT... dont blame them for the deaths and shit that occurred as they fought true science and the removal of lead from our gas.        I'm really surprised at the angles the GOP have chosen on this. Really i would have chanted up and down, that there is a reason why we seal the records of minors.. that we as a society that minors havent developed enough to make proper choices, and so we have set up the judicial system to not ruin kids lives for life, due to mistakes they made as a children and yes this often includes very extreme unsupportable mistakes.   and really thats something i could actually support. the kid might have been an evil, perverted little shit, but he was still a kid and our society says they are different, even in many cases of murder.   the right could have brought up brain science and how the brain isnt fully formed until arround age 25.. yeah they hate science.  but it seems like all the supporters are taking the religious avenue of defence/attack. 'god forgave him and so should we'.. well hallelujah , lets empty the prisons then.. there is a fuck ton of god in there. And doesnt this open cruz up to asking if he thinks it should be legal?  yeah some on the right have mentioned his age, but.. well the right havent been as good at chanting in unison on that.   hes only running to spread messages like this.. and the earning potential.  much like sanders, he doesnt have a chance to do much else. (hey i love sanders but, reality and vegas says he has no chance)  the reason they run, is to drive the party.. much like sanders wants to start a more progressive discussion, cruz wants to start a bat shit insane, lets have a religious based government discussion.   at any rate the main reason cruz supports duggar, isnt because he is a christian, but because his family is uber powerful in the republican party. though his comments is supported by the bible and all that crap, this is more about politics.. if you noticed huckabee took the time to not only forgive dugger, but also mel gibson for his anti semitic rant long ago... and to attack the liberal media for making such a big deal about it.  its part of the efforts to radicalize the religious right wing, for political purposes.   you just using the opposite scale but saying the same thing.      and when your car breaks? or you break an arm, get sick. Can you be a single parent at min wage? Sorry sure many people get by for a time like that.. i sure as fuck did in college but please, your doing the exact opposite of what you accuse the article.. you are looking at one single bill and saying "look i can afford that" while ignoring the realities of the cost of actually life.. and thats not just monthly costs thats the unexpected as well.    yeah.. but live? NOPE.  afford things like medical and broken cars.. and prepare for the future and save for college.. NO. You know the kind of crap the right keep saying the poor need to stop complaining and do.. NO they cant.. not at these prices.  barely eek out an existence and still need help, now and then.. sure, no problem.   it helps he is a republican.. and a politically powerful one.  if he was a dem, it wouldnt matter how christian he was.. for huck.    This is capitalism, we should offer them an alternative... retool the show into an investigative realocumentary, looking into how many of the upper level and loudest "anti-whatever" people have this kind of dirt in their past.  I'd watch the fuck out of that.    well in this case, you need one above the other.      I'm about to.. i'm not interested in max pop. I got my pop up to get all the buildings i wanted and now going to tear down and build the city with rural areas i want.   yeah i did this once. A youtube hint says you never have to upgrade your roads if you dont have intersections. I think they mostly fixed it, as have had roads complain but still no intersections is best.   but you know it only takes 60 votes to invoke cloture.. and last time he filibustered they got 72    I would respond, but your choice of examples already made my case for me.  translated as "I would respond but cant, so I will just say something snarky.".. seriously this is what passes for debate skills for you right wingers. Yall always do this to. When you lose the debate you stick out your tongue and say NA UH!!!  DUDE the dems fought for women to get birthcontrol covered. MY EXAMPLE IS LEGIT.  your party praises and fights for the hobby lobby ruling and is against gay marriage. DEMS HAVENT JUST TALKED ABOUT IT.. they actually have legalized it all over the country  my example is legit.  The dems havetn just talked about healthcare reform they have reformed it.  SERIOUSLY You AND YOUR ILK.. say republicans who refuse to expand medicaid in their states, whcih will lead to 17000 deaths this year, are exactly the same as all the dems who did infact push for the medicaid expansion and expanded it in their own states?  **DONT BE A TARD ALL YOUR LIFE DUDE... I CAN BURY YOU WITH PROOF THEY ARNE THE SAME**  THE DEMS PASSED NET NEUTRALITY WHILE THE RIGHT ARE FIGHTING IT.. AND THIS TARD SAYS BOTH PARTIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.    If you had done any research using non Arab sources you'd know better.   look little douchebag.. quit trying to assume. This is your biggest little flaw. "I AM RIGHT AnD YALL ARE WRONG AND IF YOU DONT ACCEPT MY OPINION, IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO RESEARCH OR ONLY RESEARCHED BIASED PLACES.. UNLIKE ME CAUSE I AM GREAT"  fuck off dude, you didnt even read my comment.  IT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER.  yeah the ottonman king when he wanted more ttaxes changed some laws on ownership which made the people in the area transfer deeds to one person in town and have him claim to be the land owner. SO FUCKING WHAT.  people live on that land.  I've lived in my apartment for a decade, does that mean I own it? How about if I kill my landlord?  SEE right back at you dude. I guess the israelis own the occupied territory they keep putting settlements on despite it is illegal under international law. NOT FROM ARAB SOURCES. NONE OF MY KNOWLEDGE IS.. actually most is from the encyclopedias and the bbc birth of israel which i am quite sure you will claim is biased case they disagree with you as well.  And yes, you are idiots. Sending generations of young men, women, and children to die to gain a unattainable goal.  LOL.. ok i am just going to stop feeding the troll or talking to the crazy person. Who is sending who were? what teh fuck are you on dude?  Dude you need some serious help. This isnt hyperbole or an attack, but you got some issues that need working out. The least of which is your sheer lack of the ability to debate without being a pompous ass.     downvoting because it doesnt matter.  First the ottomans.. actually not totally true though yeah the king owned a fucking ton of the land, before we overthrew.. I guess that means it is OURS now. to do with what we want.. and the people who actually have lived on the land for generations.. WELL FUCK THEM.  dude, no we are downvoting due to your low effort reply, that since the INDIVIDUALS didnt own the land but their KING DID and we OVERTHREW HIM.. therefore they have no say.  Its horse shit. and give off your high horse when you assume only you know what the fuck you are talking about dude.  the only valid complain you have is "downvoteing without debating"  but when you say 'downvoting without researching" basically you are calling all of us idiots for not acception your point of view and the fact is some of us researched the shit and we still find your comment horseshit. So enjoy another downvote. Cause this comment is horseshit as well.     yeah your sooooooooooooooooooooo right.  I cant stand how dems keep voting to make women buy seperate health insurance for things like birth control.  i Fucking hate how the dems refuse to try to raise the min wage.  I hate How the Dems wont let the gop expand medicaid for the poor.  Seriously dude, you can say they are both corrupt, but once your comment is way our in fucking crazy land dude. I can BURY YOU IN PROOOF if you want. Dont be a dolt.    doesnt seem wise to me.  First off, though it doesnt say in the article, it suggests this comes about due to an anti tank missile hitting a bus, fired from gaza.  removing palestinian passengers not only doesnt alleviate this threat, but seems to me it would increase it. You have to assume they have to get people willing to shoot at these buses, knowing they carry fellow country men.. and well now the buses will only have israelis. seems from a security standpoint, a mixed bus would be much safer. I know some of past actions have freely taken palestinian lives as well is israeli but even with that knowledge it still would seem safer to have mixed buses.  and even if it is suicide bombings that could be alleviated with check points before boarding. IDk someone convince me why this is a good idea.    WEll probably on point with making enemies isnt worth it.      generally speaking you want it on your fastest drive.  So generally speaking it is best to leave it alone and leave it on the SSD..  now some will complain about writes to SSDs  due to the page file and well, ssds last longer than anyone really thought. Its not an issue.  the only reason to not have it on the SSD is space.     so it still works.. just no display? you should be able to just plug it in via usb to a pc and browse for the googledrive..  it it is android it is in the android/com.googledrive folder  windows7/8   c:/users/username/googledrive.  dont know apple offhand.    for me it would be more fair to us tax payers, if insults were allowed, as long as they were grounded in fact.   well you would think they would fight this fine, as they would have the right if the law is unconstitutional.    well you dont move it.. but you can set it to use a different drive.  there are arguments for not even using one. however you need to  have 800mb one on the c drive for memory dumps in crashes.. though most people dont use memory dumps for diags.. so you can get by with none.  anyways click windows key and R  type sysdm.cpl ,3   in the system properties that pops up click performance..  then advanced.   click change under virtual memory.  uncheck automatically...   set it to the drives you want.    The filibusters are great but.  1. they scheduled the renewal vote at this date, so that it is early enough from an election that they wont get in trouble.  2. the last vote had 72 yays, more than enough to bypass any filibuster or even a veto(which there is no threat)  3. since that 72 vote, the senate has become more conservative.(and if you dont get what I mean by that look at the last roll call for the patriot act.. it only passed because nearly every republican but rand voted for it. and he filibustered it last time as well.   so call me pessimistic... but i dont see much coming from this.     . A 1983 Missouri law requires that women buy optional insurance for elective abortion coverage.  wow. I'd like to see if that is constitution, or an undo extra burden on womens rights. No other medical procedure do you require "extra insurance'.. basically the state is saying that a woman must expect prehand that she will have an abortion for what ever reasons. And pay extra for that 'right'   and yeha they damn well know most wont get the extra insurance, because most people who get abortions never ever expected to have to get one.   such fucking evil.    shhhhh there is no war on women.  /s    I dont see anything on the picts.  so it probably is a hardware issue.  doesnt have to be the monitor, could be the card, I am guessing both are installed into same card.       well apparently you attack a christian by wishing them to have a happy holy days.  SOOooooOoOOoo yeah.   anyways at least here, the muslim community has seen an increase in random gun shots into the community.. so far no one has been hurt.   it really depends on the person.. i think the newest version has a pop up every 2 hours asking if you are still watching.(dont know I stayed on an older version.. cause it is better)  now work from my pc.. and having teh phones right next to me.. its a bit more than easy to keep them going.  it you cant be near the phones... well its still kinda worth it IMO, you'll prolly at least pay off the phones and you can reuse them for all kinds of things, get an odm meter and use one in the car as a smart meter.. well most new cars do this but for older these are awesome.. can use one as a back up cam.. or a bird feeder cam.. hook to an rc, and have a driving drone.  but yeah i am still buying phones myself..    well its mostly been in decline.. a few months ago it was $1 per day per phone(all passive).. and pretty consistent no matter where you lived. so 150 a month per 5 phones. Now you are pretty lucky to get $100, if an american.. (they get paid the most)  last month they had a good 2 whole weeks of shitty service.. many crashes, and lock ups. It really blew, i thought they were going out of business. but the past week has been decent as far as crashes go..except on perk quiz which has been locking up the past 2 days.     it can vary wildly with perk, depending on a lot of things from where you live, to which version and which apps and how you run them.  For the most part you can get 40-80 cents a day per phone on perk.. you can get higher but then it becomes less passive.(or by cheating)  but like with perk swipe and perklive  tv combined with netflix or youtube shows.. you can manually increase your earnings rates up a bit.  yeah i know kinda vague but the answers are all over the chart in /r/perktv these days.. the range is a bit too high to give a proper average.                have a rather hipster friend, i'd like to help.  she has had failed experiences with various cig like vapes.  I'd like to get her something, low maintenance.. shes not going to build her own coils.  but i want something that gives her clouds and the power to quit.  i'm happy with my vamo/rba setup, and havent been here in ages to check the new tech.. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.  lets say $100 to spend/.            my sales arent updating.. in a timely manor.  i make a new sale and it will show the old stuff.. sometimes several minutes before i can access the new stuff   even worse when it wants hammers, screws and chairs at the same time.   but jesus its always like 20 screws.. sure they are made rather quick, but 20!?! arg, its the one thing I am ALWAYs short on when the boat arrives.  screw da screws.    Anyone else experiencing this? is it temp? Would think if i was banned, i would stop getting points. But past 3 days, when ever i try to redeem, it gets canceled. No answer from MS as yet.         it seems to be multiple ads.  what I dont get, is all my phones will freeze around the same time but on different ads.. however the ones that happen to be on the same ad all freeze at the same spot.  I almost never ever get the "are you still watching"  everything locks up before then                  Its supposed to be a moderation button but we all know its a disagree button. Why not at least make them say why?    i want to be able to look at each ship.. like shipyard view and know when various components failed. Power levels and ammo levels through out the fight. So if i am always losing certain things its easier to see and armor more. or move it.  i want to see the damage caused by each weapon.. what was effective, whats useless. i want to mouse over the jammer and see it jammed 10 missiles that would have caused this much damage if they hit.. while the defensive flairs saved me this much damage.  right now is hard to tell even if the little ships that get blown away fast are worth even having.. or not.. sure they die but do they help?  ship creation is def the coolest part of the game, but could be way better if i had the data i needed to make much better ships. I would play more with the various upgrades, rather than just be mostly concerned with costs and weights.  the game has that computer aiming system, says its better than recruits.. how the hell can i tell.  is turning on rapid fire using up my ammo before it is effective?  i need data!! to become the ship builder of my dreams.       I'm a bit bad at editing my comments, and am slow at it, and often see i already have upvotes after i save. and i figure people should know, so they can take back their upvote if they want.  i dont personally know of anyone completely altering their view to make a bad view it look popular after the fact. But i personally have accidentally left off a contraction.. used an are instead of an aren't which totally changes the comment.  none of those times had many upvotes/downvotes but it could happen.         I hear this advice, but when i look at Articles on tips and tricks.. they suggest at level 10.. 90% of the trade hq is expansion parts.  It doesnt work this way anymore. you can often see zero in the list. Most of the time its 2 or 3 out of the dozen or so they have listed.  its completely boring trying to not level up.. and expand under these conditions.(yeah i will try the second account thing latter)..  So basically my question is .. you guys at the higher level, when you go into the gthq, how much expansion material do you see amongst yoru donuts and what not? cause if it is 2-3 like us at level 10.. I'm going back to actually playing.                     I was having the most problems with the "if you like perk,.,," pop up but also had problems with perk quiz.  Getting rid of facebook solved both,.   If my phone goes to sleep.  or I am stuck on the bagel of doom...  I know what I will find.. if i wake up my phone or fix the bagel.  the STUPID MOTHERFUCKING IF YOU LIKE PERK APP POP UP.  is this the new "are you still watching" timer?  Fuck love how they delay it by microseconds to try to trick you into clicking.  Wouldnt be so bad though, if it didnt crash perk.. ALL THE FUCKING TIME.  I dont think I have ever got the pop up ad without it crashing perk first.                                        I still clear cache regularly, run in safemode or at least airplane.. but i i sit it sitting on a donut, i just click desktop and back to perk. Loads instant every time.                                                                                 oh look.. you move really really fucking slow.. not in much of any real danger but hey.. we are going to make you feel like you might be.  and cant the fucking dude take his medicine before an important mission? Hey i get the shit is rare, but its like "hey i am going up against the baddest mofo here, think i could have a dose"  game rocks otherwise the the fact i am "infected" has been pretty lame through out the game.  Its not like i needed any influence to do the shit.. i seem to want to save these people and they seem to only break it out a couple times in the game and seems like the only purpose is to annoy.                                                       No i dont care how hard it was.. just how long.   game gives us an open world and then locks us into that mission for  ages..(ok i suck a bit) but jesus.. from searching every floor of  the school, to the pit levels, to getting out of the pit.. to having seizures despite i stole some antacin early on in the game.. before destroying that batch i found.  hey i get main missions gonna be a bit long... but damn that one.   maybe give us average mission times, in the quest area.. so we know "hey if you start this one.. its gonna be a while"            Fuck sounded like an alarm concert last night.. with my 9 phones going off.  Love the zinger help on tmobile  click link "how to turn off amber alerts on your tmoble zinger"  get webpage 'that function is not available for that phone"  arggggggg   lol                           with the perk codes i seem to be getting a bit more than I am used to.  are their easier ways without buying?  I mainly use mine for the sweeps.. but see you can use in prize mob and perk quiz and dont know what else.  So how are yall spending the perk tokens?                              idk maybe coincidence and they fixed things back at perk.. but none of my phones stick on the spinning donut.. all loading vids fast like they used to.      newest version seems to load videos way slow.. my phones are more likely to hang watching the donut.. or just fall asleep loading. Clearing data doesnt seem to change anything now,. And all the non google online stores of apk files seem to have updated.  i'd rather not mess with it, but i'm tired of watching donuts.         right now 343445 tickets left..  I dont forsee the drawing this year.      Love the game and know you can ignore it, but sometimes its just retarded.  trying to go 500 meters, see some of our guys in a skirmish, stop help, of course get attacked by an eagle as soon as i am done, but before i can loot the bodies, an ammo truck goes by, i let it pass but 2 seconds latter another ammo truck going the same way.. i destroy this one, loot a couple bodies and a chase the courier mission pops up.. i'm getting annoyed, decide to leave and suddenly the base behind me is under attack.(its normally not quite this bad but geez, let me catch my breath, reload.. something)   Took me a few too many times to learn this.  leaving banapur or the arena, jumping off a cliff "i believe i can fly"... nope splat. At least it didnt kill me... everytime.   why take it away.. what am i going to do with that? kill bhadra with my awesomeness?  and really why take the guns, they hide everyone they dont want you to kill and you lose karma for killing innocents. the arena is the only place that makes sense.. and actually IN the arena. cause all the audience seems to have a ton of weapons.(ok title is a lie, i dont get the gun thing either)         Some wont run without it.  but one of my zingers kept getting really hot and slow. I removed back cover and battery, and now it doesnt get hot at all and performance is keeping up for longer between data cache clears. TEMP DROP WAS 25c@!!!!!!! or about 50F  and I see someone selling the back covers and and batts for $8, and has sold 2 of his lot.  not sure if i will sell mine.. not using the back cover or batt atm, but i might want to repurpose the phone in the future.   (on the zingers, if plugged in and running, if you take out the batt, it will reboot but then be fine)  and PS I AM watching the ADs, these phones are attached to the computers at my work, set up so everyone can see the ads and we have a busy lobby             how do you perk 24 hours without waking up every to click the 'are you still watching " button  edit:  thanks for the help and info.  going to look into   auto reboot phone app  and the run on start up apps  if that doesnt solve my issue, I'm going to get a monkey.

Not that any of this info helps, but its all the info i knew at the time of the question.  I could well be this is some personal joke I am supposed to know and completely unsolvable by yall but at the moment I am baffled... so i decided to cheat and ask yall               Basically asking for scientific guesstimates on what the sky would have looked like.  I figure our light cone radius should be shrunk by even more than 4 billion light years due to inflation. And I figure due to actual relative movement, some have moved out of view and will come back into view as we go back 4 billion years.   I also get the milkyway was younger, I dont have much info on galactic development.. if baring mergers they quickly reach an average star level or slowly lose stars after an initial burst. And I dont know if we had a merger in that period or how many.  I'm guessing we would see a lot more stars with the naked eye. and with the galaxies closer, i guess they get bigger and brighter too. **Just how cool was the night sky 4 billion years ago.**  4-5 times as many stars? a lot brighter?    South Carolina here.  Basically that. Card blew up, was under warranty. Was told it couldn't be repaired and they didn't have an adequate replacement. I agreed to take money instead. They asked me a little bit later if I wanted to wait and see if they got in new batch of refurbs at the end of the month. I said no, I would rather just take the money. Doubled checked with them a few days later to see when money would arrive. They said 3 business days, accounting was cutting the check. I bought a used card of ebay expecting the check.   In three business days, a videocard arrived at my house instead of the check I was expecting. I figured, they obtained a last minute replacement, and figured it might be their right to honor the original warranty agreement instead of the check as agreed to in emails. I was annoyed, but since I mine the BTC, i put the card to use. But not having the check, coupled with me buying a new card, this has me strapped a bit.(it also didn't add a lot of power as I replaced a card slightly worse than it, as I don't have the power supplies yet to run that many cards.. so not a lot of income gain)   It's been a week. And suddenly i get a check in the mail from them.   I'd rather have the cash, and more than willing to send back the card... on their dime. If that is an option for me. However, I have already used it for a week.  whats my best options. And Can I go ahead and cash the check in the time being.   Basically that. I get a much much better hash rate with the bins from 1.1 for normal scrypt mining. I use the lantis bins and for my twin frozrs 7950 i go from 650 to 711.. steady no hw errors.

But amd doesnt have them, all the usual areas and links for linux drivers have turned up empty and there are a quite a few searchers like myself with no luck.  SO does anyone know if that can be done, back up the driver and sdk off one distro and put on this one?                   I'm sure it has been asked and I see 1.3 is easily patched, i supposed i could figure out 1.52 but still would be nice to have   I get well over 300 with 1.5 bamt  about 250 with this one and nothing i do seems to fix.                                                        	199
       Yasuda is a fine choice, and priced reasonably   It's not all about BPA, and the fact your falling for that shit shows your all about the hype.  Harbs and Balke don't give a fuck about that, they're drafting off what gives the ball club the best competitive edge and need.

Again, when your culture has been around for 2000+ years, basics such as produce and livestock are a completely different ball game than here in the US.  The knee jerk reactions are evident as to how naive you view world foods.     This is cultural, and perhaps even a difference in physiology.  Being Japanese, it's been in our society for hundreds of years.  Bodies respond differently.  I hear what you're saying, but I didn't even flinch for a second when this was offered.

I hope the Giants don't become our arch enemy like the Cowbows were in the 80's.  Those were painful Championship games   Same thought process.  If Harbs was able get Alex to play above his potential, imagine what he can do with Kaep.     Coffee, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, white pepper, cumin, onion powder, paprika, season salt.

Are you a fan or a hater?     Exactly this.  We've forgiven Alex many times in the past for mistakes, yet the moment Colin makes one he gets crucified.  Let's see how the kid bounces back from this   yeah bc monday morning/arm chair qb's such as yourself are guru's when it comes to football.     Not only this, let's at least give Kaep a chance to see how he responds to  a loss.  We've given Alex many chances prior, it's only fair to give Colin this same standard.

Alex played em 2x, and failed.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt from last years's depleted receiving core, but this year he has weapons.    If Harb was able to get a player with a low ceiling and get him to max out, how far can he take a player with a much greater potential?  Our coaching staff was so clever and amazing with Alex, just imagine what they have in store for Kaep.  They've been game planning for Kaep, they will put him in situations to succeed.     Unknown entity?  Our coaching staff watches and scrutinizes these 2 players everyday for the past 2 years, they know the exact weakness and strengths of both.  Now while Kaep might not have the stats all Alex lovers love to spew, he's opening up the playbook Harbs designed to have.    I got 5 on it saying we'll see a bomb to Moss in the next few weeks, and we'll see different plays we haven't seen all season because we've had to cater to Alex so much.     Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.    However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.

You did your part, all you can hope for is that she is grateful and can return the favor one day   Exactly this, every Alex debate has to have #'s and %s.  Now while that might look sexy to Alexsexuals, we look way more dynamic with kaep.  Even VD raved about how much more zip the ball has when it comes out of kaeps hands.    Ill give some benefit of the doubt to Alex last year bc of the depleted receiving core, but no excuse for this years giants game.  3 int's, and that's with suped up WR's.  I think our play book was at half max bc we had to cater to Alex.  People forget how dope our coaching staff is that put Alex in situations to succeed.  Guarantee Randy Moss is gonna have 70 yd bomb from Colin soon.     So all you guys think Harbs and the staff aren't competent enough to game plan against that?  Because essentially, when you're dissing kaep saying defenses will know how to game plan, we won't be able counter attack.  Please explain   And the same argument can be made for Brady, so don't categorize all the time    Don't even bother, the Alexsexuals love down voting any mention or praise of kaep.    	113

 I would avoid it.  Consider that most stores need to make at least a 25% mark up to cover overhead costs...they are probably selling it at slightly over their cost (around $150), the distributor (who also needs to make at least 25%) probably paid about $75 for it (plus shipping and import fees).     not free...someone had to pay for that.  they probably got credit from the manufacturer   Pretty cool...the only problem with this is there's no option to search by new releases or by year released   Google Image Source says Hisamatsu YuMinoru      And if you have Windows 7 or Windows 8 installed, you get 10 for free      who is she   Valley Transporter has vans that will take you      it looks like a mace   NP.

Sure you make make similar drugs in the laboratory, but they are very expensive and require government subsidies to support production and distribution.  Would it make sense to go to the places where poppies are grown and destroy the farms that grow them?  That or regulate their production and sale?      I'm wondering why nobody has dealt with the source?  Poppies?  Poppy farms?    weird.  It opened for me.    "Hail to the Shill!"            welcome to the real world.  You must be from /b/         Gnomes...or fairies   ha ha noam!  [noam noam noam](http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/noam-noam-noam.jpg)   Gosh...don't know what to say.  I suppose it depends on where and how you use it.  I've found it very useful for conversations with my darling wife and her family.  I don't use it often in public, except when dealing with service (restaurants, taxis, stewards, shop keepers).  Mostly when we're in Korea my wife does the shopping though.   when people already fervently believe that the world economy is controlled by lizard people  actual lizard people  do you really need to spend the time proving that they cant detect when theyre being mocked?   Time to switch to Android   Oh lookie!  Gloat is at it again!      It's pathetic.  You'd think they would come up with something more interesting to say         asshole   I hope they ban you.  Not only are you a moron, but you're an english one too   The anti-vaxxers are everywhere         fuck you and the horse you rode in on   um, I was?  leaving this shitty subreddit anyway   because it's a challenge for wow veterans      There's nothing new in wow actually.   Hmm...I'd say there's a lot of skill involved as you can't take advantage of gear.  You have to rely on your wits and your skill.   mocking you for being a moron.  you probably believe in the rapture also   Not in my state.   I'm not a paid poster   I'm not interested in mounts, gear or "treasure".  I'm motivated by leveling perks and gold.  Once you hit 100, there's nothing more to do except farm/auction which is really boring  I can't tell you how many times I've hit 100, deleted my toon and started over.   I honestly don't care about flying vs no-flying.  WOD is no more exciting than any other part of WOW.  And there is plenty of flying elsewhere.  Sure it would make it easier to do everything, but then that's cheating really.  Here's a challenge for you: try to level a toon without special armor or magic items to 100!  Do it now   My supervisor?  Not sure what you're referring to.  Anyway, I live and work in Massachusetts.  Vaccinations are required by law for public space use and schools.  I'm sorry you don't have kids.  They change everything, especially perspective!   Because she's hot?   As a doctor and a medic, if you don't vaccinate your children you are doing more harm than good.   So you're saying that what Israel did before is not the past now?  Doesn't make sense.  Anyway what do you care what Israel is doing?   Why would you post something like this on TIL?  It's obviously not confirmed by anyone or anything, so it goes against the rules of that subreddit   Dunno...something like this I suppose http://www.schs.ws/schs2/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/map_native_american.gif   Whale watching or go to the beach and walk the length of it (can take several hours - bring a knapsack for things you collect and some water).  Mass Audubon also has a reservation in Wellfleet that's pretty awesome...nice trails for hiking, a boardwalk, also a beach area.  Not a lot of "shopping" to do per se, unless you're into cheap knicknacks you can buy just about anywhere               I went to college in 1969   yes, they are mostly fundies (fundamental religious people or conspiratards)   troll.  reporting you      I played with my youngest daughter for the last 7 years.  She's married and has a 2 year old now.  I suppose I'm paying the monthly fee in case she wants to come back.  I also roll new toons once a month or so, run them up to 100 and delete them...it relaxes me   This morning I rolled a priest.  I'm at level 35 today.  I'm playing him naked, greeding on everything and selling.  So far, I've made 321 gold   Only race bait if I were baiting my own race which is kind of silly   My eldest son works for the commonwealth of Mass. as a civil engineer.  He said that most people are corrupt, inept and dishonest.  He said people just want to pull a pay check and go home to their video games and beer.  There's no conspiracy.  It's just that most people are lazy and self centered.  Most of the "evil" in the world is either someone being lazy (or a bunch of people institutionally lazy), or corrupt/self-centered.   They are fixing this in the patch.  No flying for you!   Psyop.  None of this is true.  it doesn't even depend on where you live any more.  The reason we're hearing more stories about bad things happening around the world is because the internet is becoming more available than ever before...that's a good thing.   I am half black and half mexican, so I think I can post whatever I want.    Also, I see these people in the ER every day.  They have free insurance, are uneducated and keep coming back time after time for silly things like cuts, bruises, headaches, sniffles...   GLOAT, BLOAT, MOAT, STOAT,          What information did I post that was false?  You have to have 100 comment karma before you can vote.  That is true.   And the follow up: http://www.amren.com/ar/pdfs/2009/200907ar.pdf         There are other discussion forums online where you don't have to have karma to participate.  I just don't see the point of Voat if it's only there to compete with Reddit   I figured that much.  I enjoy reading your posts, though.  Please let me know when your book comes out.  You do sound a lot like Robert Steele.  I know you're not him.  I suspect you're a lot younger, possibly 1/3 of his age even.        Give the folks at Arcadia a call...I'm sure they will know better than anyone   I think these changes have been made to attract the new kind of player we're getting lately, which seems to care more about "items/gear" than game play.  I think Blizz is not catering to you and the way you play any more.  They see that this new generation of players is willing to shell out $30-$60 for items in addition to paying a monthly fee.  It's the new cash cow for Blizz.  They'll be including items in Diablo next if they haven't already.

Looks like a spot near my sister-in-law's home in Seoul...within walking distance of her apartment actually.  Can't remember the name of it   I've read all of your comments and submissions and you don't support any of your (wild) claims with evidence or references.  Care to explain why?   because it made me shudder looking at it?  I get that feeling you get when you rub an eraser on something smooth like glass...druuh druuh druuh   Do you have evidence or proof of any of this, or are you just making shit up?   Reddit is not run by an evil corporation.  It's run by [Conde Nast](https://www.condenast.com/).  They own Wired among other publications.  Hardly evil.   Hardly.  It's just becoming more and more corporate.  Not dying at all   You're talking shit.  You can say anything you want on reddit.     You can say anything you want on reddit.  Just create your own subreddit and say away!   You can say anything you want on reddit.  Just create your own subreddit and say away!   Voat is useless.  "You can't vote on Voat".  I call it "Gloat" because once anybody has something evil to say about Reddit, then everybody talks about "voat" like it's some special place.  It's not.  You have to have 100 "comment karma" before you can vote.  And that's only one of the reasons why I won't use it.   When is all this doom supposed to happen?  And I thought you were leaving the country?         The nutrage lady embarrassed her family and the company, a lot of Koreans felt embarrassed also.  My wife of 29 years did not feel this woman represents Koreans in any way.  She said this kind of attitude is not how Korean women behave and should not be taken that way.  Sending her to prison for a temper tantrum was pretty silly.       honestly if you care so much about the way reddit used to be, why don't you create your own site and invite people to join it?  I'll join.  Just don't create some arbitrary rules limiting use of the site like GLOAT did            Obviously we're in the minority.  I feel this man is full of shit and as bad as any of the others         I don't heal anyone now.  just let em wipe   check Craigslist for western Mass.  Wholefoods is not in Amherst, but it's close by and they are always looking for help   fake tits are fake   From what I remember, she won't be able to work legally in Korea, but there are lots of under the table opportunities            That that wow is so fucking boring, I've becoming a troll tank.  It's a lot more fun than I thought.  I que as a paladin tank, then create huge pulls whilst shielded.  Then when everybody wipes, I release and stand at the entrance until they kick me.   I remember hours of fun porting people in using my warlock.  Now that spell is useless      Nothing new here.  If you're into this stuff, check out Bishop Accountability http://bishopaccountability.org   Happy to see my senators stayed away from this (MA)   I don't like raids (too many people running around, no leaders, no fun) and don't see the point of achievements   It used to be fun to quest and do dungeon runs.  Now it's super easy to quest, the loot is mediocre and the more advanced levels only have a few dungeons.  Also, part of the fun was getting to the dungeon.  Now you can just port in, do the dungeon, and get out.  Random dungeons don't have any teamwork any more.  In fact, the tank is usually ignored by dps and often not healed any more.   Well, I guess it's a new game.  2006 was what, 9 years ago?  There's a new generation of players now and they're not the same...don't have the same gaming ethic.   I listen to it because it's the only talk radio station in my area that comes through clearly on my car radio.  I think it's entertaining, sort of.  The ads crack me up.  One time they had a psychic on and were asking her questions like "can you find my wallet" and shit like that   I listen to him.  I think he's a joke, thus entertaining.   Welp, I've been playing since 2006.  I used to play with my daughter, who has moved on to Elder Scrolls.  We used to quest together and it was fun.  I never got into raiding or heirlooms or anything like that.     Because it really sucks right now      um, who the fuck cares?  reddit never was anything more than a news aggragator       \_(_)_/         How could that possibly a MILF?         those tits are grotesque   aika yumeno      Yuuka Minase   fuck you    me?  nah...i've got 7 grandchildren.  I'm too old to move to New Zealand   no sex for you   I don't think there will be a catastrophic crisis, another 9/11 or Pearl Harbor.  I DO think, however, that this downward spiral will continue, possibly for another decade or two               saw this on GLP earlier   one of many to come.  forum sliding?  you ain't seen nothin yet   assuming this is Robert Steele, when are you leaving the US?      who the fuck cares about a bunch of degenerate ex-hippies and druggies?   What's your evidence of all this?  Where are your sources?   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-david-steele/whats-wrong-with-america-_b_748023.html   Just waiting for a thumper to appear!   Welp, have you read the Bible?  80% of Americans believe that every word is true      how about a tl;dr?  I'm driving   I think he's Robert Steele.  Their writing style is identical   Tried it...maybe my computer's too slow?  I found it very annoying   WOW has gotten cringeworthy - the lowby levels (below 70) are easy-peasey, so children are playing them.  And, yeah, they act like children.  The upper levels (70+ are yawn-inspiring.  5 dungeons per area, the quests are annoying and the loot is insipid).  Honestly don't know why I bother playing that game any more.  Guild Wars 2 is slightly better, but you can't explore the unlocked regions, there are no boats to explore the seas, and there are no mounts, so if you're into exploring, as I am, you're SOOL     Where's Robert Steele when you need him?   Wha was the story he was working on?   So what?  Who the fuck cares?      You write like Robert Steele. Are you sure you're not him?   Robert Steele LOL   fake tits are fake   You sure it has nothing to do with their tiny dicks?         I'm too old.  I really don't care.  I've got 2 more years till retirement, then I don't plan on living much past my 80th birthday, which is in about 17 years or so...  Regardless of what has been said here, and elsewhere, I live in one of the richest parts of the country (Massachusetts) and I don't see any of this "element" discussed here near where I live.  We are quite prosperous, thank you.  And I have the grandchildren to prove it!   Robert, is that you?   reddit can bite me   I ignored temptation to try drugs in high school and graduated top of my class.  Was drafted to fight in Vietnam War.  Went as a medic, went to medical school up on completion of tour.  Worked at busiest hospital in Seoul in the 1970s.  Married, had 3 kids.  Still married 29 years later.  We have several grandkids   I'll make a list here as you share your favorite forums:   ...and the 12 Trillion the Pentagon got away with during 9/11   These pics are about 8 or 9 years old.

 No.   Find your local MA or NA meetings and go to them. You can't do this by yourself, no addict can.    Fact: most people are idiots.    You can't handle the truth.   Prediction: This movie is going to bomb because people are going to think this is a superhero film and be utterly disappointed.    The Detroit Lions hired my middle school bully as a weight and conditioning coach. I cursed him back then and the curse shall remain with him and everything he touches until his death.    If you die from this...good riddance.    He's gonna get so laid.    He fucking hanged himself. He is no role model, he is a coward.  EDIT: Was a coward   ewwwww   Southeast Michigander here. We import out water from the Toledo system so yay...   ....and it is totally shit. What a fucking retarded show.    Let's trivialize police brutality for internetz points! Fucking white kids.    I hate this pose. The foot looks all crunched and weird.    ...and I think that it would be the perfect way to end the series. I would be satisfied.    I feel a movie is not necessary. Didn't we play the game?   We feed a great deal of that "wasted" food to pigs, which in turn gives us yummy bacon.    And how does Robert Jordan's death factor in here? Authors are not living analogies of each other.       More flaunting. My point is made.    If you breed dogs you are a bad person for that choice. If you support dog breeders you are a bad person for that choice. Just because people are happy about what they do doesn't make them good people. My words aren't going to make the bad people go away, but I can point out your flaunting your evil in the faces of reddit users. And you really can only claim ignorance on my behalf when all the humane societies close down due to lack of homeless animals.    You can't type your way out of this or point your finger at anyone but yourself when you open your home to a bred dog. What you have done is a moral travesty and you support a community of evil.    We could spend all day Googling shit to support our sides...but the big difference lies in the fact that I don't have an immoral action to defend. This is telling in itself. You are not made a good person because some people may support you.     Your bred dog is the living representation of a homeless dog put to sleep for a choice you made.    Let me rephrase: Breeding dogs is a moral travesty. Every dog bred means another dog dead.     Then you are a piece of shit human being.   Breeding dogs for profit is a moral travesty,  period.    Go to hell, dog breeder. There are dogs at the humane society that need homes.   Yay another future-full-of-dirty-scrap-metal movie   yay another dude-turned-around-looking-at-shit poster   Nope...still old'n'nasty   Download the Marijuana Anonymous app and find your local meeting... do it today.    Fuckin nasty   fucking gross. Gross!   Read "In the Buddha's Words - An Anthology of Discourses From the Pali Canon - Bhikkhu Bodhi"   Blah blah blah rehash, blah blah blah clerks, blah blah blah 90's. Go away Kevin Smith, you're boring now.    Holy fuck she got ugly   Why are people so afraid to move their sleeping cats? I'm always shoving them out of the way with my foot in bed and I constantly have to push them off of tables, counter tops, and my laptop. They don't give a fuck why should you? Just move the damn cat!  Anyone who claims to be oppressed by a sleeping cat should not own a cat.    You might when you realize how narcissistic he is. It's a book of lies.   I read half of it but eventually got sick of the guy talking about himself. Very colorful descriptions of India though. Gives you some insight into their culture.    I agree, they are not the best. Change it! Whoever you are....   So what is your end-game? In your mind can a school that does not need improvement even exist? What will make you satisfied, or is it that you're telling us we should never be satisfied with the free educational services our children receive.    Are you telling me what I should want? I'm a Democrat, but your liberal use of the word "improvement" leaves a lot to be desired in my case. I am a satisfied parent that takes my kids to a school I love.     Both my kids go to a Michigan charter school and I am very happy with it. So basically I hope nothing changes.    Oh wow I wonder if Wal-Mart can afford it....   A hammer is a lethal weapon. Nails can be, too. Pull your head out of your ass.    Big fucKing deal   This is....puerile.    I was getting ready to rage because for some reason I expected a Delorean bastardized with Monster logos.   Did you turn into Yoda towards the end there?    Crikey!   Like Photoshop   Too bad all that beauty is wasted on lesbains. Praise jeebus!   Wow. Very nice   Wow she looks like Anne of the Thousand Days   My girlfriend and I attempted to watch "Olympus has Fallen" and ended up turning it off after 30 mins or so. It was just a bunch of mean people shooting screaming people (from what I remember) and it wasn't fun for us.    Oy, that's a heifer that is.    She's got a tight little body. Totally a cougar.      Whothafuck?   My Grandpa took me to see "Con Air" with Nicolas Cage. It was also my first introduction to Steve Buscemi and John Malkovich.   Everything mammalian is surprisingly relative in some way. For instance the average breath volume for land mammals is about 6-8 mL per kg of ideal body mass.   EDIT:ideal    But it seemed rather automatic, programmed to only move when I was shooting, like the gun's trigger was the gas pedal. It was fucking trippy.    So I was playing an online session and I had a pretty hefty wanted level. All of a sudden a zentorno (I think) with no driver appears out of nowhere and I am able to get in the passenger seat. It only starts moving if I actively trying to defend myself from the police using a gun from the passenger seat. And it always moves in the direction  away from the police officers and eventually I'm able to remove my wanted level...I think. I died before I was able to find out and I've never seen the ghost-getaway car again. Is this a thing?  Was I tripping?   Shitty potato cam lights   IMO Jansport's are just as flimsy you cheap, talented bastard.    Who?   Black?   No actually those are painted bats. Stop raping the language.    Shocked that an old person died or shocked that nobody has heard of this really old person? To me you should not be shocked by either considering this is a computer machine.   Isn't that like the risk you take if you are a military vehicle?   The sad part is I went into this movie totally prepared to be weirded out and this part was just too weird for me.    I sort of lost it when he was having virtual sex with her. It was stupid and downhill after that.       I'm so sick of seeing Emma Stone's pug-ugly face in movies. I'll skip this one just not to hear her talk.   Talk about getting fired up.   I'm getting a little sick of Chris Pratt. I feel like his career is the product of focus groups.   Those are some disgusting feet. Jesus what is wrong with you people?   Show us your tits already.   Suspend yourself in the disbelief. I think you are doing it right because you really are not supposed to like Piper all that much. Have you watched the second season?    Considering Japan can't have a military...   Just shut the fuck up already. The guy makes movies with similar artistic styles... woop de doo!   She's cutting the circulation off to her toes with those fucking stupid shoes.    Show us your tits already   Yeah, Texas doesn't count.    This bullshit simply doesnt happen in gun-friendly states. Thankfully I live in Michigan.   I am starting to get my 9 year old daughter into comics and she is showing an interest in drawing them as well. What would you suggest I do to stoke her creative fire?    The first time I ever heard about you was when I listened to LoveLines with you and Dr. Drew way back in the day.   LPT: buy some fucking sunglasses and use your goddamn windshield visors.    Jesus its a fucking trailer....would you like the whole movie? I swear people just love to spoil things for themselves.    I heard somewhere (im too lazy to link right now....someone do it for me please) that it was because the harsh winter killed off their usual prey of wild animals.   If you are a mammal, might I suggest doing daily tick checks. They are everywhere.   The Grand Budapest Hotel  I was amazed, I was glued to my seat, and I was very impressed with the acting. I cried when it was over knowing that something this beautiful graces the big screen only a few times during my generation.    Your kid is a pussy. Tell him to nut up and grow a pair.   Stop everything! A rich and famous person is hurt!    First and foremost: improve your English.    Eh, they's knobby.   Those are some weird lookin toes   Some of that frustration results from the fact that we feel we should be able to tell the person how to spend the money once we hand it over, like the money is still yours even though you've given it away, which is not the case. Money, once given, belongs to the recipient. You should feel happier that you made someone's day easier. And if they spend it on drugs or beer, that is their right as a human being.    I love how this thread turned from hating on selfish bitches to proclaiming what an awesome society we are in general by not helping those in need with a buck or two, or a handful of spare change from our pockets. Poverty is a real problem that real people suffer from. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.    You would need a predator to find that out....         No Emily, what are you doing? You have best feet in hollywood, take off those feet ruining high heels!   You think that matters? Ha.   FUCK YEAH    FUCK YEAH A LIFETIME OF DEBT AND DESPAIR   But if we all did this then we wouldn't get to leave snappy notes for our roomates!   Make up your mind already so they know if you're going to hell or not.   Maybe don't try be like them and wear symbolic jewelry. You just validate them by trying to be like them.   Self-promoting bullshit. Fancy fondant-covered slabs of sugar bread are a phase of this generation,  and when the fad dies your business will most likely follow.    The other dude doesnt get upset...there is no cringe here, maybe just a slight misunderstanding between buddies.    That bird has a parasite that makes it seem so "friendly." Seriously, kill it.    I think that grin is a result of bad teeth or lack thereof. I agree that the dumbass cabbie is totally at fault for believing a dude with jacked-up teeth.    Fuck this sterotyping meme.    Bullshit sentence, he should be senrenced longer to max security. This sixteen-year-old PERSON held someone at gunpoint. He deserves to have the book thrown at him. Once you decide to hold someone at gunpoint, you aren't a kid anymore, you are an adult who should face all the consequences of one.    Ewww   Gross feet-ruining high heels   Big deal. I mean...its a really big deal.    More religion, more problems      Goddamn I feel sorry for the bloke that has to windex those   Do it yourself. Google Earth or something.    Yep, she has reached the limit. That baby face looks too creepy on her body now.   Wut   Probably some weird Asian thingy or whatnot.    Thanks science, for letting all the poachers in the world know where to go for a sea turtle free-for-all in international waters.    It's a travesty nonetheless. Comparing the two and saying one "ain't so bad" is evidence of injustice and of a society run by propoganda machines. You are getting sucked into it, pal, and are becoming part of the problem. Both ways are wrong. It is wrong to even have forum for knee-jerking verdicts until this case is decided in court but America fucked that up a long, long time ago and now we breed people who have no idea what justice really is outside of what Hollywood rams down their throats.    You can't compare the two ways of social injustice as being similar or different. You aren't right by being less wrong.    I feel like she would be more popular if her last name wasn't panty-hair.  	130
 It's easy to say "just go with it, get lost in the moment," whatever, but sometimes we feel self-conscious without meaning to, and get stuck there, like a centipede thinking about its feet. In those moments it'd be nice to have some ideas to fall back on.   The insistence that you should always "just know" what do to in bed needs to die a quick and painful death. If it really worked that way, no one would need to ask for advice.   Because  It's  Not  Google   I assumed he intended "this is more about what I as the guy like to see" in the context of "I like this because then I can tell my partner is enjoying what I'm doing, which means I'm doing it the way she likes it." At least that's what I'd have meant, because that's the whole point of the act for me.   "Tell me more" is way too underrated.   [Relevant.](http://www.narcolepsyinc.com/home/?p=2418)   "That's the lecture. Are there any speeches thinly disguised as questions?"   If you can't wait till morning, PCL this late probably has a couple of quiet empty corners, especially along the east wall; there's some secluded chairs back there. I saw a guy a few hours ago napping on some chairs he'd pushed together. Some of the group study rooms should be empty, too.  During the day, first choice is /u/bste2015's suggestion of the SSB's relaxation room. The study rooms at PCL may be full, but it's worth checking.   Third floor of the Union has some comfortable chairs in a hallway by the east windows. It's not exactly private, but it's nice and quiet and nobody bothers you.   Awful choice of method. I have no idea why she did it that way.   Speaking of insecure passwords, here's a story I sent to [Computer Stupidities](http://www.rinkworks.com/stupid/) years ago. I'll just paste it here:  My workplace just switched to a Microsoft Exchange mail server. As part of the switch they went around to everyone's PC and installed MS Outlook and some other networking gizmos.  They gave everyone the same email password and put the word out that passwords wouldn't be changing for 45 days.  Everyone. Has. The. Same. Password. And everyone knows what it is.  They did this ON PURPOSE.    You don't know what her own pain was like. Telling someone they have to keep bearing their burden so we don't feel bad is the true selfishness.   Itself.   I used to do sports massage, and for several years I joined a team that worked with the western Missouri MS150 team at the overnight stop. It was one of my favorite things all year. Great people, great fun, great event.   Would have been even easier if you'd ridden the bike instead of carrying it.  Seriously, way to go. Great achievement.   So you can toolbar while you toolbar.   Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas.  You know he knows just exactly what the facts is.  *--Steve Miller Band, "Take the Money and Run"*   "Be yourself" is incomplete and confusing advice. A good, full version would be "Be true to yourself," which is more liberating. So if you want to talk to someone, you'd like them to feel at ease so they will engage you, and to do that, you put on a pleasant expression, for instance. You may not feel particularly good in the moment, but you truly want to enjoy their company, and thus you want them to enjoy yours. If you overdo it to the point you're just putting on a false front, that's another thing.   Same with saying pleasant things even if you're not feeling good or charitable; you want the other person to hear what you're saying, really hear it and understand it, so you do what you can to say it in a way they'll listen to. Your instinct may be to say, for instance, "That's fucking bullshit," but you also know that the other person will just get defensive and dismiss your opinion, and that's not what you want.^1 If you say "Are you sure? What about ..." or some such, then your message will get through. You're working harder but being truer to yourself.  ^1 (unless it is, in which case go for it)   You can benefit from the good small stuff, but not from the bad small stuff, so it holds together.    Sorry, my fault.   Not me, but at my last workplace I was told of a fellow who used a remote desktop from home to access porn through someone's computer at work. I have no idea why he went to all the trouble. But he forgot to close and delete everything when he was done, and the next day the coworker came in, turned on her computer, and screamed so loud they heard it two blocks away. The perp was fired as soon as they figured out it was him.   I'll be sure to say hi to your mom.   More like 100% in most cases. The take from the concession stand is the only money the theater makes.   And as was mentioned earlier, they've done enough research to find the price points that maximize their profits there, and a crucial factor is that you can't go somewhere else.    Violence can be used for punishment and retribution, which are good things. Nudity and sex are pleasurable and rewarding, which are bad things.   You did dis?  ...  I did dis.   Not all the big names do that, and TE is the biggest name and he does it every time. Just sayin'.   That's where I've seen him too. It's amazing how he finishes his official sets and then goes out into the campgrounds looking for more opportunities to play.   Here's how I once heard someone introduce him:  How many guitar players does it take to change a light bulb? Ten -- one to change the bulb and nine to say "I could do that." Unless the one changing the bulb is Tommy Emmanuel; then the other nine go home to practice.   There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it.   And then along came Jones!   Well surely there was *some* fuck all.   An apple every 8 hours keeps 3 doctors away.   I had a similar question, and this answered it. Thanks!   I sometimes say "That made a lot more sense in my head."   I'm not very good at boyfriending.   He's been around for some time, but he's not as much of a character.   The 2 is NOT a loser here. In fact, this particular suit is difficult to assess, because the number of spades you will lose depends on how the opponents' spades are distributed. If they each have 2, you can play the AK and collect them all and have no losers. If one opponent has Qxx, though, the Queen will take a trick, because after you win the AK the Queen will be the highest spade, and it will win one trick. (If the opponent who plays after the Jxxxx hand has QT98, then you have two losers. That's a distant possibility.)  Note that in each case, after you play the AK and, if necessary, play a third round to make them take their Queen, the rest of the spades are winners, not losers.  Remember that counting losers is only useful in a *suit* contract, because as soon as you're out of a suit, the next time the opponents play it you can win the trick by trumping. You can only do this if you have trump, though, so it's most useful to count losers in the hand with the longer trump holding.  So a loser is any card in a suit in the long-trump hand that you will have to lose before you can start trumping. So if your diamonds are Axx opposite Kxx, you know you can win the A and K, but you have to lose the third trick before you can trump their diamond plays, because you have to follow suit three times before you can use your trump.  So, sometimes (as with Axx opposite Kxx) you can count your losers in a suit right away, and sometimes (as with AKxxx opposite Jxxxx) you won't know for sure until you find out how the opps' cards are distributed.   I knew a pair of twins in high school, and there were subtle differences in how they dressed. I could always tell them apart if I saw them together, but if I saw just one I was never sure.   I call this condition CDH, and it's basically why I never took up drawing.   Thanks for the correction; for some reason my hazy memory was that Leo was talking to Margaret. I fixed the comment above.   Just an off-the-wall idea, but what if you occasionally went out to eat with the *specific intent* that he would order something healthy from the menu? It sounds as if he's in a habit where waiter+menu = crap food. Once he's said "I'll have the salmon salad" in that situation a few times, and had a tasty meal as a result, maybe it'll be easier when he's at a working lunch? Just a wild thought.   The seeds for compulsive overeating are often sown in childhood even if the problem doesn't manifest till later. Most parents use unhealthy foods as rewards (be a good boy/girl and you'll get ice cream), so eating junk and the endorphins that follow become associated with happy feelings.    Indeed. I like to quote Leo McGarry from *The West Wing* describing his alcoholism, when someone asks why even one drink is too much. "I don't want a drink. I want ten drinks."  Edit: Detail corrected.   It's partly the specific foods and partly the context: Using food to get those feelings unrelated to nutrition. Somewhere I saw a study that said addiction doesn't happen unless you go through all of these stages: Use, stop using, feel withdrawal, use to ease withdrawal feelings. Soon you get used to using those endorphins to deal with other kinds of stress.  I sometimes go back to something a friend told me, about someone he know who worked in an auto body shop, where they use paints that do bad things to your brain when you inhale their vapor. He'd drink heavily after work every day, and if you asked about it he'd say, "After a day with those chemicals I'm fucked up. Drinking is a fucked-up I can deal with."  Same with overeating. I've sometimes counted myself lucky that at least I eat instead of drinking to deal with stress, but that's just less bad, not good.   The story goes that Oswald Jacoby could look at his hand, unsorted, then put it in his shirt pocket and draw out the cards one at a time at his turn to play, without peeking.   There had been suspicions about this pair, so one of their opponents was watching for unusual actions. He noticed that they were coughing in ways and at times that didn't seem natural, so he made notes when they coughed until the session was over. Then some smart people figured out what the code was. Look on bridgewinners.com for Eddie Wold's post about the matter, he was the one who caught them.   "I'm running away from home, but I'm not allowed to cross the street."   I used to work for a newspaper in a metropolitan area. Once the top editor called all of us in the newsroom together to explain that times were tough and we wouldn't be getting raises on schedule, and we'd have to cut back on expenses. I stood up and asked why we had just flown five reporters and three photographers 850 miles away for a basketball game. I was pleasantly surprised how many of my fellow rank-and-filers came up later and thanked me for saying it.   I had to do this same thing once. Poor little snake. That was years ago, and I still tear up thinking about it.   Dress for the job you want ...   Thanks. It's a bit late for me (I'm almost a PhD in the social sciences now), but it sounds like good advice, and maybe some of the younger folks here will find it useful. Agreed about needing physical analogs for the math.    Reading books (including e-ink readers such as old-style Kindles) has a physically different effect on the brain from anything involving a computer or TV screen. It has to do with the areas of the brain that get stimulated by the light.   If you're bound and determined to waste the same amount of time with hard-copy reading as you did with computer futzing, you could do it, but it won't come as naturally as chasing the electronic glow.   I read somewhere that White's slight advantage is just enough that with perfect play White should win. But as has been noted, the game has not been solved, so it's still speculation.   I've played bridge (the card game) for some time, and this is a factor when bad players play good players, *but* the good players still come out ahead overall, because the luck of the clueless comes into play less often than skill vs. skill. Put another way, a high-variance strategy (essentially, not knowing what to do) may work now and then, but not in the long run.   To expand on /u/ihadacatonce's answer, basically any game that includes randomness. Any card game, backgammon, etc.   One top poker player has a complex approach based on game theory and high-level math, and he says that you could still beat him even if you don't outplay him.   This is basically why I didn't go into physics; I need to have some sort of physical analogy in my head for these things. (It might have helped if I'd had an explanation like yours way back in high school.) I was pretty good at the math, but the more abstract it all got, the less I wanted to continue.   Optometrists can; they're fully fledged medical doctors, [says here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometrist). Opthalmologists are MDs, so no question there.  	55
 This is a response to both your comments and a general overview of the paper for everyone, the points I make are generalized but to help understand what might be going on:  The paper (see here, open access: http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2015/1/ehp.1408698.acco.pdf) wanted to see if the beneficial effects of exercise on mortality were changed if exercise was performed in a more polluted area. The basic findings were that exercising (mainly cycling in this paper) decreased your mortality risk regardless of how polluted the air was compared to those who did not exercise. They did some analysis on the amount of exercise done (supplementary table 1)  but they didn't have enough data to take anything from it really due to the nature of the questionnaire, so really this is a general exercise vs. no exercise.  Acute exposure to polluted air can decrease lung and vascular function (see pg 4 and 5 of the paper for refs) and chronic exposure is linked/causes increased respiratory and cardiovascular illness and mortality. In this paper they termed high pollution as over 19ug/m2 of NO2, which can cause oxidative stress in cells.   The benefits of exercise can include increased strength, mitochondrial density and endurance, additionally the mitochondria and cells are better able to resist oxidative stress (http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/54/6/1206.full that's free access not the best source as it refers more to exercise with people with hypertension but the same effects are seen in healthy people). The better resistance to oxidative stress will enable you to better "resist" the pollutants in the air, improve vascular function etc.  There is obviously a balancing act, too much pollutant vs the benefits of exercise. The key thing to take into account is how long the exercise takes and how much your breathing rate increases. The intensity of exercise wasn't taken into account but if you say 15 breaths per min at rest and 45 breaths per min with exercise (that's intense exercise levels, 30 breaths per min might be a better number). In a week, you would have 151200 breaths with no exercise and 158400 breaths if you exercise for 4hrs at a very high intensity which is 4.75% more breaths/wk. That's a relatively small increase in breath no. for exercising intensely as a whole and given the more you exercise the better your cells should be able to resist oxidative stress it's not surprising that the benefits of exercise outweigh the slight increase in air intake. (Breath volume would increase with exercise too but that's really variable in people and the intense exercise breath rate should hopefully account for that).  An interesting study they reference is this one from Hong Kong http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17291575  Here the high levels of pollution are 6-times that in this study (120ug/m3 NO) and their minimum levels are the high level in the Copenhagen study. They see the same effect, exercise keeps you healthy even where smog is very high. It should be noted that they didn't specify that all exercise was outside in the smog but some of it would have been and they were exposed to way high levels. They also looked at what air pollutants correlate to disease, NO3, O3 and particulates below 10um had the most negative effects. The benefits of exercise were more pronounced with the high levels of pollution than the lower levels in the Copenhagen study.  **TL;DR:** The basic message is that exercise will keep you more healthy compared to not exercising. The benefits of exercise seem to increase in more polluted areas. If you can exercise somewhere away from pollution great but if you can't it shouldn't put you off because you think you might inhale more pollutants.   This is an opinion piece by a professor at UC Davis about his own experiences during his career only. It's good to see this kind of article published in an actual journal despite it just being an opinion article (i.e. it's not based on reviewing employment practices at multiple institutes).      Hmm it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. A couple of points about how this might affect the process:  1. There is a $1495 publishing fee already, **if** your paper is accepted - the high cost is because it is an open access journal - I.e. No paywall. The cost (unclear to what that is) for the sped up process would be mandatory if the paper was accepted or refused  2. The journal aims for a decision within 30 days already - this is not a guarantee, I've submitted to journals with this aim and had to wait up to 10 weeks for the initial decision. Having a guaranteed decision time is great for the submitting authors (assuming it is peer-reviewed correctly etc.)  3. It seems that this process will use reviewers employed an external company. Typical peer review is sent to somebody (ideally 3 reviewers) in the field of study who review it free of charge - it's something that at least in academia you are expected to do. The downside of this is that reviewer may be time pressed due to work commitments which results in either a delayed response time or a poor review. I've had a review where only comments on the abstract were made and took 10 weeks to get, the paper was accepted but I wouldn't class that as a peer review (there was one other reviewer who did a slightly better job). It's interesting that scientifc reports says they only guarantee one reviewer, which I think is complete bullshit. There should be 3 reviewers to enable the editor to make an informed decision and get a more representative view. Hopefully they do send it out to 3 reviewers and it's more of a legal thing by guaranteeing one reviewer as sometimes a reviewer can accept a paper but not return it in time.  4. The main concern would be what level of reviewers this company has. Are they up to date in the field of the study? Is the field their speciality or just given to them as they have some form of biology background? What level of education do they have?   5. The benefits of the reviewers from this company is that they may have the time and pressure to submit a good detailed review (I.e. If there are complaints about the review they may receive less work). If they have more time they may read up on the specifics of the paper which will let them perform a more detailed, nuanced review. As an academic, if I was to give a rubbish review as I volunteered to do it nothing would be said to me. Perhaps the editor may put an asterisk to my name to not send me a review again (which is what a good editor would do) but I doubt many do this (I know of one who does, other editors seems to have its a luck of the draw thing based on my letter to the editor following the peer review of my abstract).  6. The extra fee should, in theory, go to the external reviewing company and not NPG (though they probably will take a small cut - based on my cynical business views!). The company will pay the reviewers a fee for doing the job on time and take a cut themselves. The people reviewing the document shouldn't really care if it's accepted as they get paid regardless, same with the company. Scientific reports will in the vast majority of cases go with the reviewers decision so they won't care if you've paid or not.  In short, if the company has good quality reviewers then this may be a good thing. If they don't then the integrity of the journal could take a hit if poor papers are accepted and poor papers will be released into the community (this happens anyway for some of the reasons I've given above).   The link is to the open access paper. Here's the abstract anyway:  The molecular mechanisms behind aging-related declines in muscle function are not well understood, but the growth factor myostatin (MSTN) appears to play an important role in this process. Additionally, epidemiological studies have identified a positive correlation between skeletal muscle mass and longevity. Given the role of myostatin in regulating muscle size, and the correlation between muscle mass and longevity, we tested the hypotheses that the deficiency of myostatin would protect oldest-old mice (2830 months old) from an aging-related loss in muscle size and contractility, and would extend the maximum lifespan of mice. We found that MSTN+/ and MSTN/ mice were protected from aging-related declines in muscle mass and contractility. While no differences were detected between MSTN+/+ and MSTN/ mice, MSTN+/ mice had an approximately 15% increase in maximal lifespan. These results suggest that targeting myostatin may protect against aging-related changes in skeletal muscle and contribute to enhanced longevity.      The paper is open access but here's the abstract:  The molecular mechanisms behind aging-related declines in muscle function are not well understood, but the growth factor myostatin (MSTN) appears to play an important role in this process.

These results suggest that targeting myostatin may protect against aging-related changes in skeletal muscle and contribute to enhanced longevity.      In this paper, Collagen isoforms 10, 13 and 120 were shown to increase longevity to a similar amount and combining them didn't have an additive effect.   Collagen isoforms such as collagen IV and VI and are implicated in cancer, these help form basement membranes which help promote angiogenesis (blood vessel growth). These collagen isoforms may also bind to growth factor receptors on cancer cells and promote growth of the cancer cells themselves. Other collagen isoforms like collagen I may prevent tumor progression but may be implicated in the negative aspects of aging.  In terms of what you saw it may be what I'm referring to but it could be approaches that scientist use to study cancer in vitro. It's increasingly common for scientist to grow cancer cells (and other cell types) in a 3D extracellular matrix as this better models the in vivo environment and the cells behave more like they do in the body. This **should** reduce the number of artifacts (it's not perfect and needs improving further) from cell culture experiments and help scientist better understand the physiology and biology of cells. Collagen is often used, as is Matrigel which is a basement membrane matrix (rich in collagen IV among others) isolated from a mouse tumor and can promote cancer phenotypes in healthy and cancer cells.  Like with most studies that get reported on this is the first step so knowing what to do or eat is hard to extrapolate without taking into consideration that this is in worms!  	9
 These guys are idiots.  It if was in the strategic interest of those fighting ISIS, those accounts would be closed already.      we should google via google and not yahoo                                                                                               Market laws are not real laws anyway  the underlying premise of the article, and a good one  but when they are extended beyond their meaning, they become no more than tropes.  The other hidden term in the doom-sayers is a misreading of history. People recite the Microsoft/Apple war endlessly, but it really didnt happen that way. For a start, it was not Microsoft that made the PC the de facto standard, but IBM. With its massive brand leadership in business, when Big Blue decided to go with MS and Intel architecture, everyone else had to follow or go under. Atari, Amiga, and all the CP/m systems vanished within a few years. The only non-IBM clone survivor was Apple. However, IBM did not do so well out of it either, and eventually exited the market, selling its ThinkPad line to Lenovo. Most of the other players from the 80s and 90s are also long gone. Microsoft did prosper, but it did so on OEM buy-in for Windows, and subsequently on major systems like Exchange servers, and the ubiquity of Office.                           I hope that, despite his persecution, people will follow Aaron's example of conscientious action and his commitment to the ideals of honesty and openness.  I think it's interesting that the government chose this particular case to go after Aaron on, especially considering that JSTOR didn't press any charges. I wonder if has anything to do with the way that the corporate state has locked up a lot of our society's knowledge in private database and expensive subscription system. I think Aaron's attack on this restrictive system was not so much a material threat as a symbolic one, and presented a serious challenge to a system that maintains legitimacy by keeping most of the public ignorant about its nature and its history. In such a circumstance, spreading information freely to the public is pretty much a revolutionary act.

Lets hope they mix it up a bit.  I like robotwars   It could be that the news was not as bad as they thought it might be.

Just downvote if you do not like it. I'm not forcing it on you .   Why?  I thought it was fascinating.  It speaks of the power of online communities on information and how manipulation of the community can manipulate how we interpret information.   It was removed from /r/technology for being off topic. I would not know where else to post it.   Comments can be bad for science. That's why, here at PopularScience.com, we're shutting them off. It wasn't a decision we made lightly. As the news arm of a 141-year-old science and technology magazine, we are as committed to fostering lively, intellectual debate as we are to spreading the word of science far and wide. The problem is when trolls and spambots overwhelm the former, diminishing our ability to do the latter. That is not to suggest that we are the only website in the world that attracts vexing commenters. Far from it. Nor is it to suggest that all, or even close to all, of our commenters are shrill, boorish specimens of the lower internet phyla.

 Thank you! She was really the main event, I was just there to make her look good :)   The company my girlfriend works for uses a great costume shop in town that has any kind of garment for a costume that you'd ever need. The pants had an MC Hammer-esque crotch though, so squatting down to get on the kids' eye level definitely had a risk of seam splitting.          It's actually in Spotsylvania, Virginia but otherwise spot on :)   Yea the Pittsburgh interview was when Frank planned the implosion. In Chapter 10 @8:40 Peter and Frank have a heated discussion where Peter tells Frank he isn't afraid of him anymore. The Watershed Bill failed and his people need the jobs he promised them and Frank had better fix it.  The next scene is Doug and Frank discussing accelerating their unspecified plan. Peter's confidence has been built up and they're losing control of him. It's time to put him away. This is the plan to have Rachel seduce Doug the night before a radio interview and get him drunk after being sober for so long. So Frank schedules the interview and tells Peter to be ready and to go to this gala the night before. There, Rachel works her magic at the hotel, and boom goes the dynamite.   Killing Peter was really just a spur of the moment decision by Frank. When they're in the garage, Peter is drunkenly babbling on about needing to come clean about everything that's happened. Well Frank can't have that. Peter wasn't supposed to be a liability after he withdrew from the Governor's race, but clearly he'll always be a thorn in his side. So how do we deal with a perpetual Peter problem? You put him down. Politics.    More than anything it helped Frank look like he genuinely wanted Peter to win. Frank was the big name in the leadership who backed Peter from the get go and with the Majority Whip and his wife working so closely with him on this bill and getting it passed, people would think, "Oh wow, Underwood really believes in Russo. He really wants him to win." And as the New York Times reporter reminded us, Peter didn't have much experience backing legislation, so this would help with that. But when the bill failed, it made Peter look like less of the contender Frank wanted him to be. Fortunately, it wasn't that big of a bump in the plan.   In Chapter 11, after Russo gave Doug the slip at the hotel, Frank chides Doug for taking his eye off of Peter. "There was a plan here, Doug. He explodes, he withdraws, we put him back together, then he quietly goes away." (@24:00).  Frank wanted Peter to look like a major contender and then once Frank orchestrates the implosion he can be like, "It's really such a shame, myself and the leadership really believed in him." Then the leadership is scrambling for a new option for Governor and Frank ever so conveniently has and idea: "Let's send Jim Matthews back to Pennsylvania, he could definitely win with only weeks before the election. Well now we need a new VP. Hmmmm... I wonder who we should choose..."  Plan executed. 8/10. -2 for Peter's sloppy "going away."  	7
 When I had my son they had to go HUNT DOWN the doctor... an hour after my epi wore off and the nurse couldn't do anything. That sorry bald man was in the breakroom! I spent an extra hour in labor for him to eat pizza and watch tv. Whats up with these sorry doctors nowadays? honestly, OP you have all rights to be in the room with your wife. Kick his ass if he steps outta line the slightest bit!   Oh wow. Your writing style is amazing OP! Being from the south too (GA) I appreciate your beautiful imagery. There's nothing quite like the south. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I really do hope you can come to peace with it yourself (I know that's going to take some time). I'd like to think she found peace before that final plunge. I was almost taken by the currents at Myrtle Beach when I was 13 during a youth trip with the church. I was dragged a mile down the shoreline, and luckily I caught a break in the current (like how between two there's a calm spot?) and was able to get back to shore. I wasn't in too far, but I was just out of touching range and apparently not a strong enough swimmer for those currents. They only had yellow flags out that day. I'd hate to think what may have happened if I'd ventured out there during red flags. There were no lifeguards posted.  	2
 Close. Am I speaking with a fellow Fall Branchian?   I was waiting for you. Glad you could make it.    Bristol Motor Speedway is definitely an interesting sight to see in these parts.    Definitely worth it. Good luck to ya. Maybe one day you'll be a fellow East Tennessean.   Fall is definitely one of the most beautiful times of year around here.    I love it. I've lived in several parts of the country as my dad was in the military and when he retired we moved here.  None of the places weve lived in can compare to East Tennessee.  Depending on where you live you have the best of both city life and country life. Southern hospitality isn't a myth, everyone treats you better here. It's a great place to live. And actually I just transferred to Middle Tennessee State University last year so I'm right here outside of Nashville when school is in session. I think choosing to live between the two places would definitely depend on several factors but if you want the option to have a quiet secluded life (with a view) East Tennessee is the place. Also,  not that I'm saying your life has to be secluded in a place like East Tennessee, because it doesn't. You just have that option if you want it. Hope that helps!    Oh yes, you must come back when there is not a festival going on. There are so many less people and you can see the town in its true form.    I'll notice you by your driving first and then the Illinois license plate.   My favorite place in Ashville is the Biltmore Mansion. The view from the back of that place is amazing not to mention the house itself.  	9
 * Chrome and Firefox security i feel is almost at par with each other.  They both get owned at Pwn2Own and every other contest, so its just evolution. Multiprocess(Electrolysis) is coming to Firefox soon.     * Chrome is quite ahead on HTML5 support true, but Google has a lot of "only works on chrome" going that will hurt the open web for the future. Google being in a more dominant position also tries to make switch which is in their favor at times (eg. recent HTML5 switch on YouTube - Media Source Extensions )   * UI customization. Hands down. Nobody comes close to Firefox. * I think Firefox also wins here with the support of Firefox Sync, and it is cross-platform(iOS version coming soon). But each to his own.   * Privacy - Cant stress this enough to matter because people just DON'T want to value it; Went you get Chrome from Google, there is and always will be some form of Privacy trade off.    Firefox is for pro-privacy and supports DO NOT TRACK tech. Chrome is just a blind NO to this question.  Mozilla doesn't want your data but Google will surely want it some how.     * READER MODE! :D (i love this on android now, will come soon to Desktop)   * Extension support - I personally feel Firefox rules this (maybe the fanboy in me)   * Firefox on Top of the [Browser GrandPrix](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534-12.html).  2013 yes - didn't find a new one :( .   Also beat chrome out on [benchmarks](http://arewefastyet.com/) - Lower is better.   * Personally hate the new "Works on Chrome" or "works on webkit" views. If you're a dev YOU SHOULD ensure your site works everywhere. Another reason i stick to Non-Webkit browsers.    EDIT - Chrome is Tetsuo aka RAM hog :(   As for "apps" on Firefox - https://marketplace.firefox.com/   Button's a clean driver. Alonso gets real aggressive once he finds a sweet spot.   after staying in the 11th floor of a building in Pune with little-no coverage; i had enough with airtel!   BSNL 3g speed is good! I was kinda surprised when it touched 1000kbs while i was in Andhra. Went to a forest reserve recently and only BSNL had coverage there too.  I like Docomo too; they have better 2g speed that the rest   Nope, it's a separate company, they only use the search part and ands protection layers over it so that everything is encrypted and not tracked.    "toll-free"*   *-Introductory offer. Subject to market conditions   you dont have to go directly to google - look into https://startpage.com/ ;)   look into https://startpage.com/ ;)   Alonso should never be blamed for switching teams; its his life and he had to turn it around; being second best is nothing in this sport where winner takes it all.   It was Frustrating as a Ferrari fan to see ferrari not deliver for many years in a row. Im now happy that Ferrari is doing something and i wish Alonso's future also brightens up   apple's apps and the apps using internet is a very different thing. Surprised he cant see that stark difference.   Flipkart maybe be run by Indians in India, but works out of Singapore       pipelight or the original crap flash from Adouche   i do understand that part; everybody is competing, i just hope some miracle happens to McLaren   im hoping for a reverse BrawnGP :'(     I just can't see Honda get their act together.   They've been catching up seconds; they have finally started completing a race. Its hard to play catch-up when you've been out of f1 for long. Matter of time.    i think McLaren has a chance to go to the top; Ferrari was trailing far behind from the Mercs until the safety car came;   The only champion car on the grid is the Merc and every thing else doesn't matter, Alonso saying if they(Ferrari) are not on the top, his move was fine, seems alright to me now.    disclosure: Ferrari Fan(even though i support Alonso)   you need the proper Gstreamer 0.10   1.0 version codecs for h264 to work properly   you sir are awesome!   It certainly is possible, you just need the right color palette.    Digital Painting isn't that bad with gimp. Once you get a hang of the brushes and brush settings your work flow will be smoother.    Path tool can help you with sharp edges or strokes.   Also use layers, definitely helps and saves time on mistakes.     If you're trying to Make something of the face mash thing like the images you posted, know how to cut out images properly. Use layers, set warmth tones, use curves, blur and clone tool.   Edit - combine multiple software like krita, mypaint and Gimp, you'll finish much faster    yup! they have to pay for this!    Also do consider - http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/31vvf2/fight_for_net_neutrality_the_way_forward/cq7yfta   Do share on your Social media accounts!

You have a family here at reddit.   Happy Birthday. Bless you! :)   i did file a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968) on this, nothing has happened so far though :(   Still happens on my Stock 5.0.2 lollipop Moto G at times, after consistently browsing for some time. Most reproducible when i repeatedly use the search fields of some sites.(more crash prone in private browsing mode)     That article is shitting people with that bunch of links   There's an option in the setting's to get the enter key long pressed for emojis   lower is better for all.   You can choose the different systems under "Machines"      ah nope not everywhere http://arewefastyet.com/   Snoop Using Linux OS;   The foot icon belongs to GNOME - an Open-source Desktop Environment - the most common/default on most Linux distros   You would have like it better if you had watched it in the theater though; i saw the IMAX and non-IMAX version, and i must say IMAX is truly miles ahead. Its very immersive when you get the IMAX scenes, and the sound/music shakes up everything!     linux :'(   get ublock. its highly efficient, OSS, and light on memory compared to others   scrolls pretty well for me   its on nightly and aurora firefox   ah i've had this at times, reduced when i switched from a Micromax to Moto G, please do contribute to this bug with info/logcat etc. - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968   cough cough http://www.ghacks.net/2015/03/31/firefox-37-find-out-what-is-new/   WebM support will be on its way soon now :)   yes you can https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-up-firefox-sync   Its coming soon! If you want to try it out get the Nightly Versions ;)   i like it a lot, personally.   Its improved a *hell lot* from where it started.   Yeah there maybe a couple of bugs here and there, but its been a good experience overall :)   For me - uBlock, themes, Firefox Sync, privacy and a neat UI - cant ask for anything more.      i guess you could use "ifup"/"ifdown"   I feel bad for both kimi and alonso. Both of them have hard quite a rough time for a long time now.      no technology can locate a phone that is switched off.  NSA does this; its possible.   yes please do; Worst part is most Indians don't bother about Political/Law situation unless they are bought onto the their TV screens. By the time they act it will be too late.    My BP is rising after reading each question.    So per minute call charges; Customer Care charges(treat you like shit too); Monthly Data Packs charges(when internet is actually cheaper tech); No HD voice calls(except DoCoMo); Poor connectivity, Roaming charges etc.   And out of the world profit for them - OKAY   Nil R D - OKAY   Next - separate per app plans! - OKAY     Same; its a monopoly draft that's been prepared.   I really don't understand these folks. How much money do you want to eat?      yes please do!      Fernando Alonso resembles Che Guvera :D   Why don't you try some other project like pipelight or so. They run on the latest flash version. See if that helps          IIRC it refers to the situation in the Tie Fighter game    Why is this not on the Front PAGE? :O    ITS AWESOME!      Ah I'm on nightly   What im saying is without MSE, the playback with HTML5 video playback on Linux is bad, stuttering. With MSE it is better(but yeah bugs are present).   For me Man of steel - the mythology part was just perfect(Everything about it) _/\_   The suit was good, cast was good, but the destruction oh god(but yeah it gives him reason).   I felt in lacking in the depth with Supes and the Villain.   BUT I LOVED IT :D  EDIT - Yes! im coming back to type this - HANS ZIMMER - BRILLIANT SCORE(gives you a feeling of supes anytime you listen to it)   ok bye!   Does look like emoji, you'll need to get the right fonts for your particular OS.   i was on Infinality for a while, Switched to Freetype later.   I wasn't able to stick to a specific rendering style for long xD   Still no luck:   MIME Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2"   DASH: no(18)    Just to clarify, tried this out on a fresh profile.   I only have the top 3 box's (HTMLVideoElement, H.264, WebM VP8) enabled on the YouTube HTML5 page and the rest disabled. MSE disabled by default.   If i do enable MSE then vp9 kick's in most of the time, but it currently has A/V sync issue's among others which let the devs to disable MSE on Linux.    onts still seemed somewhat blurry). I didn't know about Infinality, I'll have to try it one of these days. The fact that it includes "Windows" presets seems to be promising.  yeah i think Infinality is better for your use(has Mac styles too).   Im on Freetype though, serves me the best :)   chrome used a technique called *Head fake* to give you an illusion of speed.    Undoubtedly, this has been adopted by others too.   http://www.computerworld.com/article/2519182/desktop-apps/mozilla-designer-touts-tricks-to-give-firefox-the-illusion-of-speed.html  Edit - word    I can put Firefox on Linux and Windows side-by-side, and the one that hurts my eyes is not on Windows.    Please do try out freetype-freeworld or Infinality(there's nothing better than this in the world)    [Freetype](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/)   [Infinality](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html)     ou should confirm what codec YouTube is using for the video you watch.  For me its always - avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2 and it feels horrible :'(   He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out   ah yes, saw this, i just wish basic support is added to gnome-release for now. Edit - looks like very little activity there   sorry for your time! didnt understand properly first time.   oh okay, understood it wrong. Thanks for correcting me   ah! dont know bout that, you'll have to stick to one   yup it does! :)  Edit - watch comment below   export chrome desktop data - Firefox   Use Firefox sync for cross platform sync.   Also long press a video and 'Open with App'  and choose vlc - perfection    I'm not sure. I haven't reported one.   Hoping this issue on the radar.    I've got gstreamer 0.1 and v1 both installed.(hopefully believe I have the right packages)   Firefox should mention somewhere on the help what all packages are needed for a user.    And everything is at default, YouTube html5 shows a tick mark on h264. Mse disabled.    h.264 is bad on Linux :( No Smooth buffering, and playback stops at times.   I had something similar while closing tabs, but I had filed a bug report and it was resolved.   Are you on the latest version of Firefox? If yes and this continues to persist better file a bug report.    Yup it is.    They have to use what apple provides, nothing much from the outside   Felt the same. I think because few people use Yahoo, their page-ranking system is bonkers. But its quite decent for day to day use :)   Second this. Should be mentioned on the Play Store itself.   People do use it, emoji became an article on [OMGUbuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/11/see-install-use-emoji-symbols-ubuntu-linux)   hmm...wish i knew how its done and understand other peoples code   Ah im not sure if this is gonna help you, but with bumblebee installed and running, you could use "optirun -b auto nvidia-settings -c :8" to activate nvidia-settings and create specific Application Profiles.    Other option could be to use the Nvidia proprietary drivers(incase you're still on nouveau).   In PowerMizer set to Max Performance.    Also check out these guides, might help you: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/docs/CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf   http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Installing-Nvidia-CUDA-on-Ubuntu-14-04-for-Linux-GPU-Computing    Hope you find a solution!   i think your app should be able to use GPU when needed automatically.   Maybe if your look around you could set some parameter/command to permanently run the app with a GPU. Or the Nvidia Settings Manager could be of help.   As far as i know the battery drains as fast as the usage. When your hooked to the power port, it just lets current pass through, nothing more i feel.     well since you've turned off optimus, your power consumption has shot up. Your only other way around is to disable the GPU In BIOS if it does support such a feature.   Me currently using bumblebee and its your best shot for proper power management. I think its better than the nvidia-prime thing.   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee    okay, i dont understand a thing on that page. :/   Im gonna quietly wait for this. :'(   There's lots open source emoji projects like [EmojiOne](http://emojione.com/) but none have made into the Linux Desktop.     Every other OS now has support for color emoji's and emoji input as well.   Why's it taking so long? Emoji has gone mainstream and is used a lot these days.   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-google-chrome?redirectlocale=en-US redirectslug=Importing+bookmarks+from+Google+Chrome   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-data-another-browser  EDIT - passwords are still WIP - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=589589   Yup Everything will be like a new firefox!    if you card is Optimus based, i think you should definitely use [Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/); it takes care of power management very well.   Yes! Create a separate profile - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles   Now. Enjoy.   awesome :D   It is! Maybe just check the menu and see the  settings of your addons if it's enabled    Synfig    Firefox + ublock addon will help you!    Firefox sync provides sync capabilities  across platforms.    Install the hangouts plug-in. I use it, works pretty good       time based sort should be extended individual albums      Since MSE is disabled on the Linux Nightlies, i've been served video's on YouTube with the codec "avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2" but the playback is extremely choppy and stalls every now and then.   Other than enabling MSE(which i currently avoid due to A/V sync issue); anyone know what could be the trouble or a fix for it?  EDIT - also no DASH support   Check these tools - http://www.nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html   Maybe F3 is the alternative key for you. Im not sure why Ctrl+F isnt working out, but its fine for me on my Fedora. Try checking out in Gnome Setting - Keyboard - Shortcuts   Giant title bar - get HTitle addon    Triangle - Very Unique   recommend you to create a fresh separate profile for nightly   ah well depends, sometimes the updates in Nightly are small 3-4MB or 7-10MB.   You get the 45MB+ updates when you haven't updated for a few days time.  EDIT - yes mostly once a day, unless something of critical importance breaks(quite rare)   Is your system a Dell/Asus? They use something similar to that name for updates or something(if im not wrong)   i think you need to reset your browser:   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings    Or create a new profile(Backup - data first!):   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles     i use beta, wasn't working on beta. Thank You for the info :)   I remember trying out Chrome when it launched, its was good then, but i continued using FF.   After a while i started reading about all the amazing headfake techniques chrome uses(like faster animations) to make people believe its faster. Once android came, i knew Chrome would rise to a peak and so much control to a corporate wasn't good i felt.   And NSA happened too.    Stuck with Firefox all these years(From version 1.3 or 1.5) and i still love this browser! I hope once they launch the iOS version soon, Mozilla will get a better hold of the mobile market, and also if they launch on Windows Phone it will be a win too.   Had a canvas 2, i used it for 2 years, pretty good phone, even though it was big.  Somehow adjusted and got used to the size. I gave up on them when no sources were released and no further OS updates by Micromax. Also a horrible Service center experience.    Switched to the Moto G 2ng Gen. (2014).   Its well designed, has the same screen size of 5 inches like the Canvas 2 but the curved back, the thinner screen edge bezels, super comfortable to hold and with a feel-good material Motorola has won me over completely.   Also Brilliant Hardware performace and Awesome reliability on Software Update and love for almost-Stock Android experience.     Thank God this is being addressed(Voted!), browsing unknown sites on mobile is a pain with all the ads auto opening in new tabs and random downloads.  	113
 I'm having problems running the hack... The game freezes right when I hit start after character select. I have tried running from an SD card and a USB drive. When using the USB drive the light on the drive blinks indicating it's in use but nothing happens even after 10 minutes. I have also tried recompiling the ISO. The ISO is loaded using Nintendont.  Any help?   No, this is a Let's Play!   Which monitor mount are you using? I would like to run a similar setup (one landscape one portrait).    His look of defeat afterward... so sad.    They've spawned in Zombies on creative mode in Minecraft before so maybe it wouldn't be. All up to Geoff though.    Goldin Hood   Seems to only be for certain members, Amazon Prime membership not guaranteed to have this deal.   Also worth noting that they are offering $50 off the original kindle and kindle HD, and you can receive one of each offer if you are eligible. For instance I got a $75 off Kindle Paperwhite for $44 and a $50 off Kindle for $19.   Link to the $50 offer [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8 docId=1002406861).      http://i.imgur.com/hQbKq1J.jpg   I'd say social life is really depended on each individual. If you want to have fun and be around people, then you will find people that want the same. If you just like to work, then you can do that.   The social scene is definitely here, and if you want to be a part of it then you can. You will do a fair share of work here but most people take it in stride and have great social lives in addition to the work they do.   Hope that answered your question.    Or get the newly released M50x that has a detachable cable.     Congratulations on getting in! Carnegie Mellon is a great school, and I'm sure you will have a great and fulfilling time here should you choose to come.   To answer your questions:  The professors here are extremely receptive to undergraduate research. Really all you need to do is ask. I knew quite a few people my freshman year who did some really cool research projects, including building and programming a small boat that could guide itself across a pond and someone who was programming the software for a missile defense system. Really neat stuff, and all you need to do is ask.   Professors in different departments tend not to share too many different classes, but as an ECE/CS student you will be taking classing in pretty much all of the colleges.   You have the option of transferring from ECE to CS if you want to, and many people try to. However, you should keep in mind that the CS department is extremely selective and admittance rates, even from internal transfers, are extremely low. If you want to transfer to CS, I'd advise you talk to your adviser ASAP to get that process underway.   The language program here is really great! I take Mandarin, and know many people taking Japanese. We have really great professors, small classes for a really personal experience (my Mandarin class has 7 people in it right now) and a great curriculum that really helps you learn the language. There are many options for study abroad over the summer and they offer many scholarships so you don't even have to pay.   Again, congrats on getting accepted. If you have anymore questions feel free to reply or PM me.    For most people there is no shut down. Just the closing of the lid.    Fawk Coo Fawk Coo PWAUNCH PWAUNCH PWAUNCH    Baaaaaaaa ba ba, ba ba baaaa buuuuh baaaaaa, ba, ba ba buh, ba ba BAH BAH BAH BAH   It's actually 33.3%. 3 + (.333 x 3) = 4. 3 + (.25 x 3) = 3.75.  And the damage reduction is when it's NOT locked onto a pilot. So presumably lock amounts will stay the same. Who knows what the damage reduction is.    I'm looking for a 128 GB SSD for around $50-$60 or a reasonable price for a smaller SSD. Not really looking to spend any more than that, but if you have a 240 GB drive for $80 or so (I know, super unlikely, but hey might as well ask) I may consider it.  Let's see those offers!   Sent you the wrong one, sorry. Try the one I just sent!   PM sent.   Thanks so much!   Thanks!   I like your other game icons too! Can I get a link to some of them?   Thank god there's no "Over 75 Awards Won" icon on the cover. Damn that was annoying to look at.    Nope.    Got one of these [beepers](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/) and hid it in a friend's car. I actually forgot about it for a few months and remembered only when he came up to me and told me he had maintenance done on his car because he thought something was wrong with it.   I then proceeded to take the beeper out of his car and hide it in other places for a week or two at a time: in his fridge, in his desk, in his backpack. He thought he was going crazy.  I started feeling really bad for him because it was really consuming his life, so I took it and didn't hide it anymore.   But if he ever does anything to annoy me...   A kid falling down is hilarious and you think about it every day? Wtf?   DayZ  Thanks so much!   Antichamber  Thanks so much!   213   Thanks a lot!   Entering. Thanks!   Entering. Thanks so much!

Entering. Thanks!   I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1uts8o/19m_my_long_distance_girlfriend_19f_was_diagnosed/) a little while ago asking for help. I have some updates to that story and I would like to hear your opinions on what I should do.   I waited a few weeks after my first post and I sent her a card that generally said I'm sorry for what I did, I will give you space if you want space, but I am here for you if you want me to be here. It was a very kind card (at least I think so): I didn't make any implications that she should reply or anything like that, it was very neutral and she could have done whatever she wanted with it.   She then posts on her Tumblr a few things. First, she posts this:     "Im tired of this. I have already made it very clear how I feel. The rest I dont think I have any obligation to explain. I am done caring."   She then deletes it maybe an hour later (I was checking it pretty obsessively) and posts this:   "There is really nothing I have to say to you, because every time I do try to think of something to say, all that comes to me are words of anger. Thats not something Id like to do, unless maybe it is really necessary for you to understand. So now the only thing I have to say is that I think the best thing to do now is just to let go and move on. I have made my peace and I will let go of whatever anger there is remaining. I have no regrets, no blame, no guilt, and no will to even try to explain anymore. I would like to move on without even the tiniest things holding me back. Though I guess I do have one more thing. Saturday did not hurt me as much as you might think it did. So let go of whatever guilt you say you have. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore.  I get pretty angry and start to vent things on my Tumblr, which I thought she didn't know about. I said some very mean, untrue things. I was just so angry and I was writing down whatever came to my mind.   Turns out she DID know about my Tumblr and read everything. She sends me a very angry email saying things like "obviously I was too nice, and you're taking advantage of that, you don't say these things to people to make you feel better about yourself." She legitimately thought that I wrote it in the intent that I wanted her to read it.   Her friends messages me too, doing general "you're spewing nonsense, you obviously don't know my friend, grow up and leave her alone you don't deserve her".   I send her friend a message explaining that I didn't know she knew about my Tumblr and that I never intended for her to read what I wrote, and that I would leave them alone. She sends a message back thanking me and saying that what I've said means a lot (not sarcastically, I think she really meant it).   Sorry for another wall of text. I don't really like leaving anything out.   My question now is, do you think that I should wait this out and see what happens, or do you think the situation is wrecked and I should move on? She obviously did not want to repair this even before she read what I wrote, but I know that it hasn't even been that much time since our initial argument. I know everyone said to wait a few months, but I knew I would feel like shit until I did something proactive.   Thanks so much for all your help.     A previous post here linked [this](http://livingmanicdepressive.com/2012/08/21/relationship-falling-apart/) article.   What do you guys think of it? Does it have any merit?   If any of you are wondering I'm already in the "past break-up" stage and she says that she doesn't want to be with someone who is acting so selfishly (when she came to me and asked me for some time to myself I was kind of pushy and tried to talk her out of it). It's a long story and if you really want to hear it I can tell you guys.   [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1w3fhj/my_depressed_man_broke_it_off_although_im_hurt_i/) is the original redit post.    Before I went to college I used to look down at my keyboard every few letters for whatever reason. Just typing a lot of essays helped me learn to touch type. It wasn't even a conscious decision to learn, it kind of just happened.  My advice is to just type a lot. If you really want to stop looking at your hands tape a piece of paper over the keyboard at the top and type with your hands under it so you can't see your hands or the keys. Alternatively, if you're truly desperate, get a keyboard with no legends. That will definitely make you learn.    I think they're planning one last 360 Let's Play when Minecraft gets on the Xbox One. I"m pretty sure that's what he's referencing.    Thanks a lot!   I see. Thanks so much man. I really appreciate your help.    Your armchair psychology is very good. Thanks so much for your help.    Thanks man, your post helped a lot. This just happened to me yesterday, so yes it is very fresh.   I am going to give her the time she needs. How long do you think I should wait? I know you said months, and I know you don't know very much about my situation, but just your opinion based on this situation would be great.   And yes, I am prepared for that worse case scenario where she just deletes me. But right now I just want to help her in any way I can, human to human.    I do want to give her the space she needs and deserves, but is there anything I can do to let her know that I still care about her and that I'm still there? We left on really terrible terms and I want her to know I'm still there for her.   I was thinking of sending her a post card every once in a while just saying hey I'm still here for you I hope you're feeling better. Nothing pushy, nothing that makes her make a decision, nothing that makes her respond. Does that sound like a good idea?    What I think I can do:  Obviously right now I've hurt her so much that any advance I make in the near future probably won't be received well. I think it's to the point where if she saw an email from me she would delete it right away or if she got a letter she would instantly throw it away. So attempting to contact her now is out of the question. I feel like now I just need to remind her that I am still here. My mom thinks it's a good idea to send her something ever one in a while, like a small thing of chocolates or something like it, addressed from me so she knows that I sent it but with no other text. I think this is an okay idea. What do you think?  I still really want to apologize to her for what I did, but again, I don't think she's in the mindset to receive it. The second to last message she sent me was "This is so upsetting you need to stop this I don't want to hear it". Do you think it's a good idea for me to try to apologize, and how would I go about doing that?

Thanks in advance for reading this and helping me out.  **BACKSTORY**  Im a sophomore in college and go to a university on the East Coast. Last summer when I was back for summer break I met what I think is the girl of my dreams. We both have our homes in the same city on the West Coast. If you asked me why I love her, I couldnt give you a definitive answer. But I know that I am the happiest when I am around her and I love her more than anyone I have ever known.  I met her only two weeks before I had to go back to college, so I tried to make the most of it. I was with her almost every day and I had the time of my life with her. When the two weeks were up I knew that I wanted to have a relationship with this girl and I wanted to ask her out in person and not wait, so I asked her out, and she said yes, and we both left on great terms.  Throughout the semester we keep in contact and talking almost every day, Skypeing and messaging each other and what not. It is during this time that I learned that she has pretty big family issues that were left unresolved when they happened (her parents got divorced and I dont think she ever learned to properly handle it, and she still has big issues with her father to this day). I was able to relate to her, since I too have had problems with my parents, and I put it in my mind that this is something to think about and maybe help her in the future.  Winter break comes and Im so excited to see her. Unfortunately, she had planned a trip to her home country Taiwan that would take up almost the entire break. So I see her twice before she left, two of the best nights of my life, and she left. We still kept in contact but it was difficult due to the time difference. We sent emails to each other every day but we talked about very serious topics. In her last email to me she made a comment saying that she thought it might not have been a good idea to enter into a relationship so quickly.  **THE MAIN PART**  She comes back from her trip and she tells me that she has time for one last visit with her. So I meet her and I can tell pretty much right away that something is wrong.  She tells me that late last semester she was diagnosed with depression and that her father is abusive (her words, not mine). And she tells me that she needs time to sort things out by herself. I ask her what she means by needing time and she says that she cant handle a relationship right now and that she doesnt want me to contact her or talk to her.  I preface this next part by saying at that point I had no clue about how to talk to someone or help someone with depression. I know now that what I did was completely and utterly wrong and hurt her more than I can imagine. But back to the story.  Naturally I do not like what she is telling me. I felt terrible that the person I loved was diagnosed with depression and felt so hurt by the fact that she didnt want to keep in contact with me and talk to me. Again, this is before I knew that people with depression push the people they love away. So I told her that I dont think I can do that, especially now that I know that youre sick, and that I want to be there for her and help her overcome her depression. And she kept saying no, that she needs time, which is something someone with depressions would do. I got so frustrated and angry that she didnt want me that I stormed out on her. I know. Bad call.  I sent her a text that night saying I was sorry for leaving the way I did and that I am there for her whenever she needs me. She sends a text back saying shes sorry too and that hopefully were both a lot happier when we see each other again.  The next day I wrote and sent her a physical letter saying basically that I dont expect a response, Im sorry for being an ass and that if you say you need time, you need time, Im scared that you will forget about me, I love you and I will miss you, please dont forget about me. I also said that I dont think you have to do it this way and that it hurts me that you are doing this to me. I know, I know, the absolute wrong thing to say.  Wednesday she gets my letter and immediately sends me an email. Here is the most relevant bit.   "When we talked, what I really needed was your support, your patience, your understanding, and your respect. And I feel that I didnt get any of that. I had hoped that you would understand, but now I feel like you havent even tried. I didnt do this to hurt you. In part I was trying to protect you, but I was also trying to protect myself, something I need to do. How could you think that this is something that Ive done to you? I dont blame you for anything. But I honestly cannot understand how selfish and immature you are acting. You say that you care, but right now you are hurting me rather than helping me. I cannot be with someone who acts this way. I see very clearly now that we cant be in a relationship. This is not how love works.  I have only one request. Please do not make this even more difficult for me. Please just leave me alone. Youll get better and youll move on and live your life. You will.  I wont forget the memories we made because they were good memories, but now its time to move on. I really do wish the best for you.   Naturally, I go ballistic. I called her, left her a pathetic voicemail, emailed her back three times, recorded a pathetic video and sent it to her, and messaged her on Facebook. In short, I didnt do what she wanted.  She unfriends me from Facebook and I ask to her to not unfriend me. Im trying to talk to her, saying things like Youre right. I dont understand, but I cant if you do this. Please help me understand, I want to be here for you. It gets so bad that she messages me, in all caps, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.  And so I stop. And thats the last interaction Ive had with her.  **WHAT I THINK NOW**  From what Ive read online, and looking back at what I did, I did the exact opposite of what she needed me to do. She needed me to understand, but I was too blinded by wanted to keep this relationship that I wouldnt listen to her until she had to scream it over Facebook. She did what people with depression do, and I didnt see that and tried to talk her out of it and blame her, which is the absolute opposite of what she needed. I know what I did hurt her so much.  At this point, Im not concerned with getting back together with her. At this point I just want her to be better. From what Ive heard her depression is severe to the point where it is hurting her physical well being in that she can barely make it through a day without almost collapsing. And friends that are complete strangers to her have seen her on campus have told me that she looks miserable and that theres something wrong, even though I hadnt told them anything about this. She doesnt have very many close friends, and she hasnt told her parents about her depression because partly, theyre the cause. Im pretty sure I am one of the very few (or maybe the ONLY) person she has trusted this information with.  I know she cares about me or she wouldnt be acting this way. But Im not concerned with that right now. All I want is to be a good person and help her in any way I can. I still care so much about her, but my goal is not to get her back. My only goal is to help her get better. My question is how do I do that?  Thanks for reading my incredibly long post, and thanks for the help you give. I will be here on my computer all day so if you have any more questions just ask and I will respond quickly.  A note: she has said the she has been visiting a therapist, so she is getting help professionally. Im asking what I can do personally to help her.  **TL;DR** My girlfriend was diagnosed with depression that is severe to the point of it harming her physically. She told me she needed time to figure things out herself but I wouldnt let her do that and I pushed her so hard she broke up with me. She needed my support and I didnt give it to her. Right now, I am not interested in getting her back. Just as a friend, what do I do now to help her in any way?

Note Sauron was without the Ring in LOTR, but was quite the formidable adversary nonetheless, and growing in power. Scuppering the Ring in the ocean would not change anything, he was going pretty gangbusters as it was. If he regained the Ring, well, game over, but the only way to ultimately defeat him was to destroy it in the fires in which it was forged.Also to address other points in thread, there are no other volcanoes mentioned to cast it into. and as Gandalf stated: But there is no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there.  As to sending it away: But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess, said Elrond. And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.  So you hide it, you lose; you try to send it West, they won't take it; Bombadil will forget and lose it; nobody is immune to its creeping influence. Much as it sux, and given Sauron's rise and the discovery of the Ring, the only solution - despite being ridiculously difficult, was to get that bitch to Mount Doom baby.   I like to think he found rest in the west, beyond the sundering sea..      The veteran: 'There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?'   Which brings us to our next question, in what ways could the Lord of the Rings have played out, had Gandalf been called Gandalf the Greg?   Thank you for your submission!

Welcome to 21C, I don't understand why this even bothers you enough to type so much. Or me to type so much responding for that matter. I must be drunk..   You not understanding the passage of conversation (or wilful negation of) is a poor excuse for yer lack of argument. If it wasn't blindingly obvious (which it really, really was), I'm saying you really have no idea what yer talking about. The more you comment, the more I feel like hugging you as one of our special followers. Just maybe get upset about something else, because this is not something you need to trouble yer precious mind about. To answer yer original query, no.   Yea well my opinion is that you really don't know what you're talking about, based on everything you're saying. I appreciate you're working from an ill-informed standpoint (arguably your fault) and that Anonymous may be a pesky fly in your newsfeed, but that river runs deep, and what bugs you is likely [this](https://i.imgur.com/sCQrTOG.jpg), not [this](https://i.imgur.com/g4Q7g40.jpg).

Five months later, Lister stared out of the sleeping quarters' viewport window and saw nothing. Just a few, very distant stars, and an awful lot of black. It was pretty much the same view he'd had for the past twenty-one weeks At first he'd found it awe-inspiring Then, slowly, that had given way to just plain dull. Then very dull. Then deeply dull. And now it was something below deeply dull, and even below deeply, hideously dull; a word for which had yet to be devised. It was, he thought, even more mind-numbingly, deeply, hideously dull than an all-nighter at the Scala, watching a twelve-hour season of back-to-back Peter Greenaway movies. If you went to the British Library and changed every word in every single book  to the word 'dull', and then read out all the books in a boring monotone, you would come pretty close to describing Lister's life on board Red Dwarf.

You reckon he can write a manifesto or put out anthing other than lulzy rants from where he'z currently? Project PM was digging into the shit that nobody took too seriously until the Snowden revelations smashed the doors wide open. He had his foibles, an aristocratic air of snobbery, a penchant for not disagreeing with that he was a mouthpiece for Anon (which doesn't make much sense) but end of day he was an investigative journo who did actually give no fucks in following the story. Was he sloppy? Yes, to his own detriment obviously. And produced nothing? Eh he was a voice sharing what was found. He admits poor skillz, but no point in exposing crime or malfeasance if you have no way to tell anyone about it. So hellz, a FBI shill instigates a raid in a private security company, delivers instructions as to how to pwn them, share linkies with journo in teh loop, he digs into delivered data, fucks up royally online after raids, getz v , faces 100yrz jail for bullshit, and you're gonna complain that he didn't deliver?! Fuckin' 'ell..    We don't even have a Bill of Rights..but you do, and yer Amendments and Constitution an' all..y'all seem to think it's kinda okaaay these days for all that to be ignored.

A pittance compared to the shit that's exposed and allowed to slide these days, and y'all just roll over and go 'M'kaaay..' Not much shit happens in this country cuz we're small population at teh ends of the earth (worth taking if yer playing Risk but, then sally forth), but for better or for worse in this era the shit you guys do affects us all, as much as the Brits did at one stage, as much as the Romans did at one stage, as much as the Incas did at one stage (time and location dependent). Our laws are getting tightened as a reflection of your laws getting tightened. Not that yer laws are adhered to anyways (national security blanket), just make a workaround from some schmuck to say hey torture ain't torture and yer good. No accountability, and that sux. Weird thing is, I think our prime minister's an asshole, for so many reasons, not least being that he'z an asshole, but i quite like yer prez. But then I step back and realise that what happens there affects here and I only like him cuz he'z less of an asshole than the past few. What kinda compromise is that?! We're in the shit, YOU'RE in the shit, what was once considered American Values is completely compromised.

We apologize for the inconvenience.   Copypasta cuz lazy (or efficient)..  While plastic is usually considered an "artificial" material, it is typically a polymer based on organic petrochemical compounds. Polymers can be described as large molecules made up of simple repeating units. The word polymer is derived from the Greek words poly meaning "many" and mer meaning "part". Many types of polymers can be created by varying the molecular composition of the repeating unit. Being organically-based, polymers are therefore subject to degradation and breakdown through natural oxidisation. Degradation may be initiated or accelerated by numerous factors including ultraviolet light, visible light, ozone, pollutants, manufacturing impurities, oxygen, and heat. During degradation, oxidisation can result in the breaking and rearranging of chemical bonds along the polymer chain. This can begin even during the manufacturing process, due to the conditions of extreme heat or pressure that may be used to form the polymer. To delay the onset of degradation as long as possible, both process stabilisers and long-term stabilisers are added to the polymer. The most important primary anti-oxidants used for long-term stabilisation are the sterically hindered phenols. Unfortunately, these exhibit an undesirable side effect when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. They develop deeply coloured molecular structures resulting in irreversible yellowing of the plastic. To minimise this effect, polymers are also provided with an ultra-violet stabilisation package. This package is often made up of ultraviolet absorbers (UVA) and hindered amine light stabilisers (HALS). UVAs protect physically through molecular absorption of the high-energy fractions of sunlight. The absorption transforms the molecule into an excited state, and when it collapses back to its original state, the absorbed energy is released as a thermal emission (heat). In contrast, HALS protect chemically by combining with oxygen when exposed to sunlight to form stable nitroxide radicals. These trap the oxidising free radicals released when the polymer is exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Eventually, the stabilisers are either consumed or migrate to the surface of the polymer where they are abraded away. The polymer has then lost its protection and deterioration proceeds rapidly when exposed to the factors mentioned above. In theory, after-market protectorant products provide a coating to replace or supplement the original UVAs or HALS in the polymer. They cannot, however, reverse any yellowing which is the result of degradation of the sterically hindered phenols within the polymer itself.   I will remove you if you don't stop.

 Didn't see it today, but it's pretty darn common to have military helicopters flying in and out of the Pentagon. I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's any scoop to be had-just another day near the Pentagon.   Thanks, dcpanthersfan. I feel a bit annoyed to have been lied to, but I'm glad you saved me from calling the County Government to inquire about it and looking silly. (And I'm glad that people can go to A-SPAN for free.)   I was at a Giant in Arlington tonight, and a woman was panhandling asking for $2 so she could stay in a winter homeless shelter in the Courthouse neighborhood. I gave her the $2, but I'm wondering if homeless shelters really charge for people to stay there? (I've heard a panhandler near the Pentagon City Mall make that claim as well.)  I'd find it unsettling, to put it mildly, if there is really a charge to stay in local shelters, particularly when it is so cold outside. (I'd also find it strange, given that local governments around here frown upon panhandling.)   Ordinarily, federal workers have staggered schedules. Between gliding schedules, compressed schedules, and other changes, people get to work anywhere between 7-10ish and leave anywhere between 3:30-6:30ish.  Have everyone come in today for a handful of hours and then all leave at the same time, and you end up with the metro so full, people are at risk of being pushed onto the tracks, and complete gridlocked streets, just as the weather conditions start deteriorating.  Perhaps unscheduled telework/leave, followed by early dismissal would have cut out enough people from coming in to the office to avert a Commutageddon 2.0, but since Commutageddon in 2011, OPM has made a conscientious effort to put the safety of employees first, even if at times, they end up overreacting to a bust forecast. (See http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/commutageddon-a-year-later-would-the-same-fiasco-repeat/2012/01/26/gIQAhzgKTQ_blog.html)   It's like the cursed yogurt in the Simpsons. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_pqnsKWlpc t=0m30s  We'll be updating the dinosaur exhibit at the Smithsonian so it'll be scientifically accurate according to today's understanding of paleontology, instead of being a fossilized relic depicting the 1930s understanding of, well, fossilized relics. *That's good!*  It'll require the dinosaur exhibit be closed for five years. *That's bad.*  That time will allow the museum to dismantle, clean, and remount the dinosaur to be more accurate. *That's good!*  But in the process, there will inevitably be breakage and other damage to the dinosaurs. *That's bad.*  While the process is ongoing, there are still a zillion other free Smithsonian museums to explore, and there are other neat exhibits at the Natural History Museum besides fossil hall. *That's good!*  But none will satisfy the kids who are really into dinosaurs. *Can I go now?*   Happened to my 2011 17" Macbook Pro yesterday. Thankfully, it's still under AppleCare for another few weeks. Without warning it shutdown, and when I rebooted up, saw blue and white stripes at the Apple screen and had trouble getting past it. Apple Store is replacing the logic board.   *nods* That is really strange. I also went to an Apple store. (Heck, most of the independent mac retail/repair places have gone the way of the dodo, which is a real shame. There used to be a wonderful DC-area independent Apple-authorized repair shop that offered very affordable rentals for repair customers, but it went out of business a few years due to the Apple Store around the corner.)   Yep-you were right. It's the GPU. They'll be replacing the logic board, otherwise they would have charged me $525. I'm darn lucky it happened now instead of three weeks from now.   Ouch-I'm sorry to hear that! And thanks for the confirmation.  My laptop has never felt as speedy as I thought it should, for the top specs, maxed out RAM, and plenty of hard drive space left. I wonder if the logic board has always been a bit dodgy?   Thanks! :-)   I was using my 2011 17" Macbook Pro (first with Thunderbolt) and all of a sudden, it shutdown. Upon hitting the power button, I get as far as the Apple logo, but with a strange vertical blue/white lines. [Here's a picture.](http://imgur.com/Pq8qf1f  ) It did not want to progress past this at first, and it was even hesitant to shutdown when holding the power button at this point. It made a noise as if it was powering down, but didn't actually do anything for 2 or 3 tries. I was able to get into it by holding down the option button and selecting the startup drive. But clearly, something isn't right.  Thankfully, it's under AppleCare still for a few weeks, and I will take it in tomorrow, but I'm wondering what the heck this is? My googling leads me to think it might be the GPU gone bad?   Bad enough when civil forfeiture is done properly through legal channels. If the Gothamist's reporting on this is correct, I'm genuinely shocked and appalled at the situation.      Strange lawsuit. Under NY law, it is legal for women to be topless. Private property owners can prohibit it on their property, but unless there were signs posted or something of that nature, I don't understand how the building owners have a leg to stand on.      This point is a bit murky, I suppose. According to the linked article, BMA's records indicated that the painting in question was donated to them in 1937. Other articles seem to indicate, as you noted, that the item was on loan to the museum (but even if it was on loan, it WAS willed to the museum).  Either the museum owned it or it was willed to the museum (and she had passed before the painting was stolen).   This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone but the woman who claimed to have gotten it from a flea market and her lawyer. Basic first year property law: nobody can gain good title to stolen property, AKA the Irving principle.  In "The Ballad of Irving", Frank Gallop's classic parody of Lorne Green's "Ringo", the protagonist was Irving, the 142nd fastest gun in the West. One of the versus starts with "141 could draw faster than he, but Irving was looking for 143."  Well, just as with Irving, who would have been dead meat against the 141 fastest gun slingers but could take out #143, an innocent owner of stolen goods might have better title than someone coming along after them. Basic, black letter law.      What is the "life lesson" there? That it's okay for employers to screw employees?   Beat me to itI was just coming here to post that. I'm so relieved that he was found!   As I said, casual gamer who buys games from Amazon. I haven't been looking at GameStop until recently.   I'm just a casual gamer, so, I only buy a few Xbox 360 games a year. I mostly get them from Amazon.com. I recently moved to an area where there's a used game store (a national chain) within walking distance, and thought I'd check out the used price of Grand Theft Auto: V. It's around $55 for a used copy. The store is selling it new for $60. I know full well that across the street, Best Buy is selling it new for $40.  I mentioned to the clerk that they're selling it used for $55 when it's being sold new for $40 across the street, and he just shrugged and seemed uninterested. He certainly didn't make me a better offer.  Looking around, I didn't see any bargain used games. From what I saw, they were all only about $5 less than the new games they sell.  Is this standard for the used game market nowadays? Are these stores traps for the unwary, or is it just my local store?   Will do.   More details here: http://www.wickedlocal.com/brookline/news/x920322813/Maimonides-student-missing-since-Jan-6 The tl;dr is that he's been missing from his home for more than 24 hours, last seen on the 6th around 12:30PM, he's 5'11, 140 pounds.      Thanks-I do feel better hearing that its actually hard and not just me. :P   One troubling element is just how much territory the border exception for searches covers100 miles. I've been stopped near White River Junction, Vermont by the Border Patrol for a checkpoint. Not an area I would consider being near the border, by any means.  They looked in my car, asked me and my passengers if we were all U.S. Citizens, and when we nodded, they let us go. I wonder if it would have been quite so easy if everyone in my car wasn't white.   I haven't seen anything as absurd as this since the Rakofsky v. Internet case.   Actually, I have had an issue with a cab driver driving in the wrong direction and not following my attempts at getting us in the right direction. Reported him to the cab regulators, got a refund and apology from the cab company and the cab driver was suspended. It got to the point where I became concerned for my safety with whereever the cab thought it was going, and I would have demanded to be let out, but we weren't in a great area, and either Uber didn't exist in DC yet or I hadn't heard of it and I was concerned I wouldn't be able to get another cab.  You're right, Gumburcules, DC isn't pleasantville. Getting dropped off in a random part the city isn't a great option.   It definitely is unpleasant, but the worst of it is the difficulty of keeping my eyes open so my eye doc can remove the lashes. In order to see the root of the lashes, the doc needs to use the light on the slit lamp. A side effect of distichia is light sensitivity.  I love my current eye doc for her patience and understanding. The first eye doc I found in DC yelled at me for having trouble keeping my eyes open as he shined a bright light in my face. Something that I understand normal people would have a hard time dealing with, and it's a lot worse with light sensitivity. *rueful look*   I have it too. It's irksome. Every once in a while, I have to get the double-set of lashes plucked.   Contact Mary Cheh's office. You might also want to try contacting WTOP's Ticketbusters.   Companies CAN fire gay people in most states. And the same people rushing to protect Robertson are opposed to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act that would prohibit this.   People of color who didn't feign being happy with the status quo might find a cross burning in their lawn, if not worse.   Again? This isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened at the zoo...    I can see hypothetical scenarios where people might suffer harm from the breach. Fraud protection replaces losses from debit or credit card fraud (if reported within a certain time period), but if a card is suddenly frozen or canceled due to fraud, it can cause economic harm and other harms to consumers who may find themselves unexpectedly temporarily unable to access funds. Not everyone has cash on hand.  I have yet to see evidence that Target was negligent, but that doesn't mean they weren't. It's early yet.   Presumably, any suit would be based on negligence, which in common law requires three things: (1) a duty of care; (2) a breach of said duty; and (3) damages arising from the breach of the duty of care.  I am not your lawyer. I am not giving you any legal advice other than to tell you that if you believe you have been harmed, seek a lawyer.  All I can tell you is that as a consumer who shopped at Target myself in the time period of the data breach using a debit card, at the moment, I have no cause to sue Target. First, there has been no actual harm to me as of yetthere has been no fraud on my card, I have not been blocked from using my funds, etc. Second, I have yet to see evidence that Target was negligent. They may well have been, financial data is supposed to be private afterall, but until more information is available about what the hackers did and how, and what Target could have or should have done to prevent it, it's a little early to conclude that Target was negligent. (I AM angered that for a couple of days, Target was claiming that the anonymous executive cited in the press was wrong and that no PINs were known to be compromised, and today, lo and behold, PINs are known to be compromised. That might be negligence, if people were harmed by hackers using their PINs to drain accounts in the past couple of days, but again, no such stories have hit the press as of yet.)     My understanding from my folks is that a lot of the MDC officers were corrupt.   I strongly urge you to get to know your professors. Go to office hours, ask questions, bring up current events, etc., make sure they know you, your talents, your interests, etc., because when you apply to law school, you're going to want some glowing, detailed recommendations that explain the problems you had, how you fixed them, and how you are a wonderful candidate that any school would be lucky to get and here's why, ......   It's not like food trucks in L'Enfant take away business from anyone other than federal government building cafeterias. Why cap how many trucks are in L'Enfant?   Another option is to contact the US Department of Transportation's  Aviation Consumer Protection Division within the Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings. Their website is here: http://www.dot.gov/airconsumer      **My 5 Questions:**  1. What were your favorite routines or sketches on the Smothers Brothers? 2. Were you surprised when CBS fired you? How did they notify you? 3. Who was your favorite musical act on the show? 4. What gave you the courage and willingness to put controversial, topical subjects on your show? Were you ever tempted to give in to the network's pressure? Did you ever disagree with each other on how hard to push or push back? 5. Tommy, what was it like finally receiving your much-deserved Emmy in 2008?  Public Contact Information: smobro1@aol.com (according to: http://www.smothersbrothers.com/)   I'd call them now (well, now being Monday). It's always good knowing what your legal rights are.   http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1q5lbi/nh_man_fights_states_denial_of_copslie_license/         I'd some some vegetarian entree ideas.   I just left Montgomery County after 8 years and moved to Arlington, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask away. (Plus, I'm now only 20 minutes South of where I was in Bethesda. :P)  If you PM me your email address, I can forward you a guide to DC (with some of my favorite restaurants, things to do, etc.) that I drafted a few months ago when I had 3 or 4 friends moving to the area in the same month.   If you're getting a Samsung, you might want to talk to the Big Screen Store people. They price match, extend the warranty, they do delivery, and I think you can pay extra for wall-mounting.   Was this back before DC had meters? I know that I used to have trouble getting a cab from downtown to DC to Bethesda, even though I lived 4 minutes over the DC/MD line. It's been a lot better now that they switched from the zone system.   Thanks! :-)   Thanks! I guess this is the sort of thing they might have told people on October 1st, but rather than make us come in for 15 minutes just to put up away messages and stow files, etc., my boss had my team stow our files the night before and telework on the 1st for 10 minutes, so, yay for not spending more time commuting than working the 1st day of the shutdown, but we might have missed out on some last minute instructions. :P   Looking at the news, it seems that there's a possibility the shutdown might be ending soon. *fingers crossed* If the shutdown does indeed end, how will workers be notified that we should go back to work/what is the time frame? Might I got to sleep at 10PM with no official word that a deal is in place, only to wake up at 10AM and log on to CNN.com to find out I should have been at work an hour and a half prior, or will there be a day in between a deal and being called back into service?   If I can be forgiven for making a joke without adding anything helpful or substantive to the thread, this sounds like a response to a Whose Line Is It Anyways's Scenes From a Hat prompt.  Drew Carey (or Aisha Tyler): "Things you can say about your brewing, but not your mother."   Cast member 1: "I'm unsure if my mother is moldy or healthy."   Cast member 2: "It certainly smells right. Is it okay if the top of mother is dryish?"   Congratulations! Nothing like it, is there? :-)   Or the [DC Ballers](https://twitter.com/DcBallers) food truck.   Not a mall. The Mall. As in the park between the US Capitol and the Washington Monument.   The thing is that this isn't a budget cut. Washington Monument Syndrome applies to discretionary cuts. Here, federal law mandates cessation of all activities that are not directed at imminent threats to people or property.   No, no it's not, and it's not Washington Monument Syndrome, Cardine. Washington Monument Syndrome is a real thing, but it applies to cuts in funding to an agency that gives the agency discretion on what to cut. When agencies choose to cut visible, high-profile things in the hopes it draws public attention and leads to cuts being reversed, that's Washington Monument syndrome.  Here, what is funded and what isn't funded is NOT discretionary. It's mandated by the Anti-Deficiency Act, a federal statute that conceivably carries criminal penalties. Nobody has ever been convicted of violating the Act, but agencies have been dinged for it, and prosecution is still possible for violations.  In the event of a lapse in appropriations (AKA a government shutdown), the Act (31 U.S.C.  1342) prohibits continuing to employ personnel in excess of that authorized by law, except for emergencies involving protecting people or property.  So, under the Act, it is allowable to declare park rangers, park police, etc. essential to patrol areas to protect monuments and parks. It's allowable to use such personnel to respond to emergencies and protect people. It is not allowable to use such personnel to keep facilities open.  There was a WMATA (Metro) worker killed on Sunday in a work-related accident in one of the Metro tunnels near Union Station. Ordinarily, the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate the incident. Based on the above part of the Anti-Deficiency Act, however, the agency determined that responding to this incident did not constitute addressing an "imminent threat to the safety of human life..." If there was a known ongoing threat to human life, the NTSB could and would respond, but since the incident had happened and there was no known imminent threat, they could not.  This isn't the Presidential administration trying to inflict pain to rally support. They are following the law.   Gabriel Quirk! He's a really nice guy.   Moreover, any concession at all would mean the Republicans would demand another concession the next time this fight came up. Six weeks from now. Because the CR the Senate passed is only to fund the government for another six weeks.  Fulfilling a new Republican demand every six weeks would look little different from a Romney/Ryan presidency. There is no way in hell the President can give in to this extortion.   Hmm-I'll look into that. Thanks! Mind my asking what a reasonable price is these days?   Wow. I had not heard that they'd be dropping that much! (And I suppose I might want to save just in general to buy around the holidays when prices drop overall...)   OK, thanks, dr_shamus. :)   Is this the Quatron? http://www.costco.com/Sharp-AQUOS-60%22-Class-1080P-120Hz-Edge-Lit-LED-Smart-HDTV-LC60C6500U.product.100037851.html   I don't have a Blu Ray player yet, and I don't know if I'd be getting one. I have a lot of DVDs, but I haven't bought one in months, since I've been relying on HD channels or streaming via Netflix or Amazon Prime over buying physical media, so, I'm leaning towards skipping Blu Ray.   Hi all. I know that lots of people recommend Panasonic's plasma TVs, but unfortunately, Costco doesn't seem to carry them. I want to go with Costco so I have 90 days to return it if there is a problem, as well as for the extended warranty (Costco tacks 1 year on to the manufacturer's warranty).  This link is pretty representative of what my local Costco has: http://www.costco.com/51-inch-tvs-and-above.html  It's hard judging the quality of the screens in Costco due to the lighting conditions, and solely looking at the specs, I can't tell what's worthwhile. Any recommendations? Would the 55" Vizio (E551D-A0) be a reasonable purchase?  I'm in an apartment that gets a decent amount of sunlight. It has blinds but not blackout shades. I'd primarily be using Fios HD channels and VOD, an XBox 360 (for games), and I have an Apple TV for streaming, so, SmartTV is not essential. I don't know if 3D is particularly essential, either, as I generally prefer 2D movies in theaters.   It was a one month extension and it's expired. The original deadline was August 31, and it was extended to Sept. 30th. See http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/capitalcomment/local-news/dc-taxi-drivers-protest-deadline-for-credit-card-readers.php.   It's not exactly a vacation. I'm relieved to hear I'll be paid eventually, but that doesn't help pay bills now. Money aside, I can't take this involuntary time off to travel, despite not having seen my folks since December, because this could theoretically be resolved any day. Can't treat it as an opportunity to go galavanting when one can be due at work the morning after at any time.   Actually, federal employees may be exempt from the seeking work requirements. They are exempt in DC, at least. "Furloughed federal employees will not be required to obtain job search contacts if they file for unemployment benefits in the District of Columbia." http://does.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/does/page_content/attachments/FAQs-FED%20GovtShutdown%20ONLY-October%202013-FINALv2.pdf   What sheriffs do is neatly illustrated by the unusual duties of U.S. Marshals in Washington, DC. Because DC has no sheriff's office and it is not a state, the US Marshals Service has been assigned the functions that a sheriff's office would normally carry out. In DC, serving legal papers is done by private process servers, but if they have difficulty, it's done by US Marshals. In DC, security at the DC (non-federal) courthouse is done by US Marshals, as is prisoner transport. In DC, evictions are supervised by US Marshals.   Hell, in 1906, the Supreme Court itself put a sheriff on trial for contemptit was and is the only criminal trial in Supreme Court history. For those interested in this, and it is one heck of an interesting story, I strongly recommend the book "Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism" by Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips. A great read.   Um, what on Earth gives you the idea that nobody can arrest a sheriff or that the authority of a sheriff exceeds that of federal law enforcement? Federal law enforcement can most definitely work in a county regardless of the local sheriff's wishesyou need to reread the Supremacy Clause and the line of cases from 1796's *Ware v Hylton*, 3 Dall. 199, to 1816's *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, 14 U.S. 304, to 1859's *Albeman v. Booth*, 62 U.S. 506, to 1958's *Cooper v. Aaron*, 358 U.S. 1, to 1982's *Edgar v. MITE Corp.*, 457 U.S. 624, and there are plenty of other cases out there that make it quite clear that federal statutes trumps state laws, and federal officials exercising this authority trumps state officials.  And federal law enforcement can most certainly arrest a sheriff. Or a mayor. Or a governor. Or any other state or local official.   Is it powered by unicorn tears? It sounds rather suspicious to me.   A good question, and not one that's easy to answer. Certain parts of the ACA would go into effect regardless, but what is enforced and what is not enforced may depend on whether funding on enforcement is restricted. (AKA, defunding wouldn't stop the Act from requiring insurance companies to follow rules X, Y, and Z, but it might stop the DOJ and HHS from being able to go after insurance companies that follow those rules.)   Breathe.   Wow-thanks for the gold! :)   One of the things the House Republicans attached to some of their continuing resolutions was a clause that would allow employers to opt out of having their employees' health care cover anything they find objectionable. This basically transfers the religious exemption to the coverage mandates of the ACA from just religious organizations to all employers. If you are unfortunate enough to work for a zealot who thinks contraception is wrong, you wouldn't be able get contraception through your employer-based health insurance if that element of the GOP's hostage demand goes through.  (Of course, given how broadly it was worded, people working for a company controlled by a Jehovah's Witness might not be able to get a blood transfusion paid for by their employer-based health insurance. Yay Republicans.)   It's not that talking points are bad, it's that they lack details and nuance. The West Wing described the problem with ten word answers really well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dKvletfSo  The transcript of that speech by President Bartlett is this: "Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword. Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high? So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every once in a while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else."   Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid did not cover most dental care. Given how difficult it was to just get passed what the ACA does, it wouldn't have been politically possible to expand benefits to include dental care. As you put it, it's extremely costly.   Both. That the jobs that are furloughed are referred to as non-essential doesn't mean that they are not important, just that they don't have the potential for having an immediate impact on life or property, the way that a police officer or doctor would, or the staff that ensures Social Security checks go out.   I find it appalling that merely 2 weeks after federal law enforcement officers responded to the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, those officers and their colleagues remain on duty but will go unpaid until the shutdown is over.   And yet there are many other families of federal employee that rely on income from work performed that will not be paid until the shutdown ends.  Which is not to knock the military or suggest I don't respect and appreciate what they do. But I also respect and appreciate border patrol agents, US Marshals, the FBI, and other federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on a daily basis defending the US. They still work during the shutdown, but won't be paid until the shutdown ends.   Most people still have no idea what is in the ACA. That's why you have people like this guy in Kentucky happily signing up for Kynect, the health benefit exchange established by ACA, while saying "This beats Obamacare, I hope." http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/22/kentucky-obamacare_n_3801054.html   Democrats are refusing to compromise because they aren't being offered anything. The government operating isn't a Democratic win-it's the way things are supposed to work. It's non-partisan.  Similarly, raising the debt ceiling is also not a Democratic win. It's also non--partisan and the way things are supposed to work.  Republicans are trying to attach all sorts of elements of the Republican platform to these two items. (And note that the continuing resolution to fund the government is only for 6 weeks of funding. It is absurd to suggest Democrats should allow major changes to Obamacare or any other Republican goodie on a bill that allows for only 6 weeks of funding, even if you think that merely funding the government is somehow a Democratic win!)   I think it probably would have. Remember, most Members of Congress are multi-millionaires. Their congressional salary is a pittance compared to their investment income.   It doesn't have to be with being considered essential, since essential government employees aren't furloughed, but they also won't be paid until the shutdown ends. (They are, however, in a better position than the furloughed employees in that we have no guarantee of backpay whereas they are sure to be paid eventually.)   It will still be funded even it a shutdown. It will not be funded if the continuing resolutions offered by the Republican-controlled House was signed into law.  (And note that the continuing resolution is only for 6 weeks. That's right, folks. Republicans are holding government employees hostages, and get to do it all over again a mere six weeks once the shutdown ends. Yay!)   Yes. Economists ooh and ah or shriek when the month to month job growth/loss moves 150,000 jobs in either direction in any given month. Currently, around 800,000 government employees are furloughed. That's a pretty damn big impact on the economy.   The Kreeger Museum is really neat. It's the private collection (and in the former home) of a former GEICO chairman, and is a fascinating and eclectic mix. Worth the cost.   I'm not so sure. Neither side can afford to quickly cave, and there is no compromise that could be reach that wouldn't be seen as a cave. Unless something happens tomorrow, once a shutdown starts, I don't see it ending in just a day or two.   In this political climate, I don't see how we can get retroactive pay. The constituents of those pushing us into a shutdown are hardly likely to be thrilled with their Congresspeople if they let us get paid for no work (even if the lack of being able to work was not our choice).      In the end, most people are going to put a case on it, so you can't tell what color it is anyway.   I hear the line at DC area Apple Stores was huge yesterday. I got to the downtown Verizon Store at 7AM, was the 9th person in line, and an hour later, they started letting people in to the store 9 people at a time. Didn't get much easier/better than that.   Every federal employee has given their fingerprints to the government. Nearly every unpaid college or post-grad federal intern has given their fingerprints to the government. Every law enforcement related officer have given their fingerprints to the government. Most licensed security guards, PIs, etc. have given their fingerprints to the government. Nearly everyone working with kids, from schoolbus drivers to teachers to administrators to after school people have given their fingerprints to the government. Everyone who used the now mostly defunct Registered Traveler systems (like CLEAR) gave their fingerprints AND retina scans to the government. Every person arrested has given their fingerprints to the government.   TL;DR point 1: Government already has a zillion fingerprints, so who give a damn if they can get more?  Point 2: Buying an iPhone 5s is optional. Using a fingerprint in lieu of a passcode on an iPhone 5s is also optional. Let people make their own choices.   Frederick is lovely, but if those commute times are acceptable, one might as well look at an apartment in Rockville itself. Rockville is, well, 0 minutes to Rockville, and it's also about an hour to Baltimore (more with rush hour, but you probably can schedule seeing friends around rush hour). Rockville is 15 minutes from DC and is WMATA-accessible via the Red Line.  The big "but" (no Principal Skinner jokes, please!) is that you probably won't find a townhouse for that. You can probably find a decent apartment for the 1600 range though, including pet-friendly apartments with dog parks.   I'll second Georgetown Bagelry. The bagels are delicious, the staff and the owner (Mary) are really nice people, and the pricing is reasonable. What's not to love?  I'm moving from Bethesda to Arlington, and easy access to Georgetown Bagelry is what I'll miss most. (Not to hijack the thread, but if anyone knows of a decent source of bagels, for the love of Pete, tell me! Tell me!)   Take Canal Road/M street towards the Key Bridge as an example. There's an intersection at the Whitehurst Freeway where people get stuck in the intersection all the time. Not because they are doing anything wrong, but because drivers up ahead suddenly stop and put on their turn signal to merge into the left-most lane that goes straight on Canal Road/M street, blocking the green light for the middle lane that goes right onto Key Bridge.  Someone can have two green lights in front of them, traffic moving, and all of a sudden, everyone gets stuck because of a car(s) blocking the lane. That's an example of an intersection in DC where one can get stuck in the middle of the intersection and have it not be their fault.   Sometimes in DC, one gets stuck blocking the intersection when traffic jams up ahead without warning. Yes, one isn't supposed to block the box. One also isn't supposed to treat a green light like a stop sign.  At least with a speeding camera or a red light camera, someone is doing something against the law that is within their control. When a police officer pulls over a crosswalk encroacher, he has theoretically observed the traffic conditions at the time. A camera aimed at crosswalk encroachers, on the other hand, can easily pick up drivers who got stuck without being at fault.   It would make a lot more sense to have given Harry Potter books to local homeless shelters with a high kid/adolescent population instead of throwing them in a dumpster.   I'd like to see a 60 minute made for TV movie version of Walter Miller's novelette The Darfstellar. (It's not long enough to make it a full Silver Screen movie.)   Well howdy, neighbor!  I agree. A more rationale solution is to cut class sizes, and I think alumni want them to do it to tighten admissions standards. I don't think we're at all happy about the drop in the rankings, not that rankings are the end all, be all, but the slide hasn't been good.  Still, if they aren't willing to cut classes and want to at least maintain them, a new building is a good idea, and you might as well build with extra capacity.  The buses usually will say Blue Route (Main Campus/Metro) or Red Route (WCL/Metro). The shuttle bus that goes to WCL does indeed park across the street from the Metro, whereas the Blue shuttle to Main Campus parks on the same side of the street as the stop.   I'm listening to it right now and enjoying it so far. :-) (One of you is apparently my neighbor in N. Bethesda-I'm currently in Bethesda!)  As a current WCL LL.M. student and WCL JD alum, I'd like to respond to what you said about WCL's new building by noting that WCL has already outgrown its current building, just in terms of finding enough classrooms.   In my LL.M. program, I've wound up in lousy classroom spaces I never saw as a JD student-classrooms where there isn't enough room to have a laptop and casebook in front of you simultaneously without putting one in your lap, and classrooms where several students' won't be able to see either of the whiteboards in the room without turning around.  More space is needed just for the numbers as they are now.   Seems like a good idea. It's centrally located for a lot of commuters who'd like to pick up something from a big box store on their way home.   I wonder if the guy is linked to the ex-real estate broker in this Consumerist story from July 2012: http://consumerist.com/2012/07/13/colorado-family-kept-out-of-own-home-for-8-months-by-squatters-claiming-adverse-possession/   Agreed. I'm a WCL JD grad and current LL.M. student there, and it's a great school with great professors. I started the J.D. program back when its rank with pretty much on part with UMD (I had gotten into both).  I am appalled at the idea of increasing the study body. I think we need to reduce the number of students from their current levels to improve our rankings and employment statistics. Increasing them seems like lunacy.  But for strong clinical programs and for the strength of our professors, I definitely agree that WCL easily contends with other area schools.   Tell that to Maryland Judge Robert Nalley. No, not because he has heard cases involving letting air out of a tire, because he committed the offense, plead guilty, and was hit with a $500 fine and 6 months probation. He also was suspended from his duties without pay for five days.  http://www.courts.state.md.us/cjd/pdfs/nalley/exhibitd.pdf     	110
 This sounds really grim. Your best bet is to find a new job because even when you get promoted, there will another issue for the next promotion. This company sounds culturally broken with poor incentives.   The other issue is that your manager might just not be honest with you. Managers, especially in technology who don't have a ton of managerial experience, sometimes don't know how to give feedback, and so will tell employees that they are doing great work when they might not be.  This might not be the case with you, but you should try and get feedback from multiple sources. If your output is indeed double and high quality, find a new company.    The kindle is so much easier to read and much lighter. I am amazed OP reads eBooks on Macbook Pro. Thats really hard ergonomically.   One option is to use the "night" options on apps. e.g. Instapaper ad others come with a "night" mode where they turn the background black and the text white. I find that a lot easier to read.    What about Dick?               A lot of police harassment doesn't happen with speeding or traffic violations but with simple things like broken tail-lights, or expired registration tags. Sadly a self-driving car is unlikely to be a self-fixing one.    you mean Donald :)   You seem like you have a ton of solid operating experience. I would imagine that if you study finance, you could perhaps translate that into an operating role at a larger company and build a career from there.   If you really like programming, you could get a software degree but without a lot of programming experience, it may be hard to get a great software job and your experience doesn't really back it up.  Perhaps after the finance degree you could look at a startup role where you can blend your operating and software skill sets better but with the limited info here, my take would be to get a degree in finance / econ.

I once watched a movie about the invention of the windshield wiper (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054588/) 2 hrs of my life I won't get back. Not all heroic stories need film adaptations.          Avoid it but always be really nice and have a really good relationship with all the assistants. Thats the fastest way gossip spreads and they are surprisingly influential. Be really nice to everyone but especially them (which in the stress of the workplace people sometimes forget to do), and it will make your life a ton easier.     This list has great ideas.

Research using sites like NYbits (not sure where you are looking for but I am sure there are similar sites in other cities). These tell you what prior rents were and complains by former tenants.

Add peri peri salt on anything - from roasted vegetables to roast chicken.   Fair point. I wasn't thinking that through.   I can foresee a few potential changes: 1. Much more even distribution of humans across the globe as the perils of sea navigation decrease substantially. E.g. North America may have been settled by people from Africa and Asia given that the perils of travel would have been meaningfully reduced  2. Remote island archipelagos would also be meaningfully more settled  3. Titanic would have clearly been a much smaller tragedy, but more importantly, the survival of influential rich aristrocats like JJ Astor could have significantly changed recent business history  4. Coming back to #1, meaningfully more trade that started earlier could have significantly changed culture and food. E.g. ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Greece and Indus Valley may have intermingled more, and survived longer as a result creating more continuous history  Perhaps investment and innovation would be more on naval and sea-faring capabilities and less on terrestrial conquest. This could have political ramifications for sure (more colonization, less inter-country fighting in Europe), but also delay innovations like rail travel and air travel in favor of water based innovations  What I am not sure of is whether this would substantially decrease the historical advantage had by early adopters to agriculture. Would fishing really enjoy a substantial advantage is unclear to me. If it did, you could conceive a situation where coastal fishing economies could balance out the power of agricultural economies. Not sure the implications of that though.    You should politely respond with "I really appreciate the offer. I am very keen to take up the internship and work for you, but given that I have to move to do this internship - this will be very hard for me to do with this offer given that this will barely cover my rent". Be very polite and stick to the facts.  Be open to ideas they have. Perhaps they can help get you subsidized accommodation, or can offer you an end of summer bonus if you get an offer. Assuming this is a job you want, they might have other ways to make you whole.   But only have this conversation if you are fairly sure you are ready to walk away if they don't budge since at the internship level, companies are usually less willing to negotiate.

 I thought defense mechanisms were one of Freud's theories which are now regarded as useful, but not scientific..   EDIT: Yup. Googling reveals http://www.sparknotes.com/psychology/psych101/personality/section2.rhtml which includes the following (*Some critics argue that psychodynamic theories are not falsifiable (see pages 8-9) and therefore unscientific. In response to this criticism, proponents of psychodynamic theories point out that empirical evidence does support some psychodynamic concepts. For example, empirical research shows that there are unconscious mental processes, that people have mental representations of other people, and that people use unconscious defense mechanisms to protect themselves from unpleasant emotions such as anxiety*)   Fall in lesbians?    Oh...did not know that! Extremely cool!   What infinite series is this? I don't get it :(   Aerodynamically it may work. The drag and lift both will increase immensely because water is a thousand times more dense than air. And the friction drag will also be much, much higer because the viscosity of water is much greater than air.  So I don't think the engine will have enough power (even if it DID work under water!) to actually propel the aircraft forward. Plus there's cavitation and other issues which arise due to the differences in fluid properties!    Of course, I don't know where anything wazotea said contradicted with anything you're now saying or where you get this idea that the Butterfly effect is simple. Of course physical processes have to occur between the butterfly flapping its wings and a tornado... Chaos theory is exactly about the complexities of a highly nonlinear system! Don't really know what you mean when you say highly non-ideal. Every model has to make assumptions about behavior. That's why they're called models and not reality.   Anyone who works in Chaos theory will tell you that is in fact, the exact opposite of convenient. It's just scientists making the best (in really amazing, creative ways) of a very bad situation in their attempts to understand nature.  I also notice you still haven't provided sources for your "Chaos has been widely regarded as wrong" statement...  EDIT: I just noticed something from your first post. You said:   This, and what remained of your post are typical "chaos theory / butterfly effect" nonsense. There is no scientific proof of anything similar to this, it's all "mathematical" with a number of missing physical components. One such component is the compressibility of air, for example, which when perturbed on small scales, the air compresses and decompresses. With internal friction, any kinetic energy imparted to the system is dissipated as heat. Not propagated "exponentially".  In fact, if a disturbance were propagated "exponentially", it would not be chaotic. Don't know where you got that from either...  That's it. No references from you, no arguments against the article I've provided -- no replies from me from this point. Unless we meet face to face. Then we can talk over a beer :)    Under actual atmospheric conditions, there is currently no way to prove that chaos / butterfly effects actually determines anything in the atmosphere. In fact, I feel confident in saying that all atmospheric motions are governed by physical processes. We may not know all of these physical processes, we certainly don't know how to simulate them accurately and precisely enough to incorporate all relevant quantities  Oh yes of course! That's exactly what it is. It's because we can't simulate them that we need mathematical theories. And it's because when simulating them, we find many surprising things that we didn't expect. Like the fact that if x is very close to 'y' at time 't', they will then stay close (at least within a certain bound that depends on how close they are) for the future. The absence of this theory is what chaos is about.  I have no idea why you think chaotic process are NOT governed by physical motions :-/ Also chaos in the atmosphere seems quite highly regarded. I also don't know why you think they are "well established as grossly incorrect". Do you have any sources for this? The above article has the following to say: *Most scientists agreed that climate has features of a chaotic system, but they did not think it was wholly unpredictable.* If that's what you're saying, I agree with you of course Here is an article with many references that seems to regard chaos theory as an important tool: http://www.aip.org/history/climate/chaos.htm  In my head chaos theory IS a mathematical tool, not a "physical" one, though the line is pretty blurry (that's a philosophical debate). A chaotic process is just one where if x is close to y...I already said that. All of physical modeling depends on the predictability of the model. That's really all there is to it.   I don't know much about meteorology, but I can say that wazoheat makes PERFECT sense to me. I am an aerodynamics researcher and I deal with turbulence, which has exactly the same problem. Molecular interactions have effects on large scale eddies and so on.  What you're getting confused with is probably the following: A single car may have effects on the chance of rain. That does not mean that every single car will have an effect. It means that some car starts a change, which when interacting with changes with fifty other cars and buildings and miscellaneous things (that sounds like the "Favourite Things" song!), leads to major effects.   So overall, what is causing the big change is not JUST the car as the butterfly effect seems to imply. But without the car, the change would not have occured!   If that makes sense to you (and I hope it does!), now it should be easy to see that unless we are able to model the car, and the fifty other things, we cannot predict the weather a month from now! Unfortunately, modeling the car is outside the scope of current computational abilities.  By a "Theoretical" limit on the models, I always understand it this way (and this was what I was taught in graduate level turbulence and numerical fluid dynamics): Since molecular interactions have effects on macroscale events, we will have to model their interactions along with macroscale interactions. Now, these interactions are unfortunately (for us), related! So, the only way to resolve this would be to model all the molecules and all the interactions!! This inability to resolve all important scales of a problem results in a limit on our capacity to model a lot of turbulent phenomena.  Like the saying goes, to model the universe accurately, you have to create another universe.  Sorry, I got carried away with turbulence, but the two are very related, it seems to me.  EDIT: You're right in your last sentence!! Sorry,  I just read that. That's exactly the problem that turbulence faces, except that in addition, it's IMPOSSIBLE to separate the temporal and spatial scales, because they're coupled through various interactions,  a subset of which is the famed Butterfly effect that you seem to despise so strongly :)  EDIT 2: Also, you're wrong about all disturbances being dissipated. First off, it's viscosity (not conservative), not compressibility (conservative) that causes the dissipation. And for many disturbances, they propagate because of instability grow very quickly before viscosity can take hold. See any textbook/online explanation of how turbulence comes about and small scale disturbances grow... There is only so much the already small viscosity of air can take care of.   No, I think he means whether you hiked and camped in the "backcountry" or whether you camped close to your car.   Nice! I've actually read the book, but I read it when I was 13 and skipped over all the parts I didn't understand, which was quite a bit :)   I had read a few articles in Scientific American about this. Two are attached. I'm not qualified myself to answer this question and any knowledge I can give will be a subset of these, since my knowledge comes from there. One of them is from 1975 (the pdf) and the other one more recent:  1/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/2008-05-21_1975-carroll-story.pdf  2/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sean-carroll-eternity-to-here  The tl;dr seems to be entropy   The force is not opposite to the direction of motion of the bike. The force at the point of contact is in the direction of motion, because that point on the wheel is moving _the other way_ with respect to the ground. See the link in my other comment.   But the force is small and does not matter.      Sorry dude/dudette, I got carried away for a moment on the interwebz there! :)   Technobabble? Seriously? That friction accelerates a rolling body (in this case the wheel)? http://cnx.org/content/m14385/latest/   You say "This is your speculation. Not any kind of scientific fact", but you say exactly the same thing I did when you said: "This is also true, but has almost no measurable effect." In fact the difference in friction is very easily measurable.   I stand by the scientific correctness of all that I said. I already admitted it wasn't the answer to this particular question.   EDIT: Also, the square-cube law has to do between the relation between the weight (volume multiplied by density)and the size of an object. Did you even read the link you posted? Not the force due to gravity and the force due to drag. Drag increases with the frontal area (S), the velocity (V) and the aerodynamics (all included in the coefficient of drag C_D.. also where the square-cubed law is relevant because weight increases proportional to (size)^(3/2)). It is NOT related to the gravity in anyway except through the velocity, a relation that has nothing to do with the square-cube law. Also, the answer to this problem is independent of whether they reach terminal velocity or not.  Though really, I don't mind the downvotes. My answer was not really relevant to the question. But most of what you said really, is wrong.   Trails don't spread in various directions because there's nothing to push them in various directions. Once they're out of the engine, the ambient wind (if any) is the only thing that adds any motion to the vapor.  As for the distance. Yes, that would make perfect sense. Since we have no way of judging actually how far the trails are, trails that are farther away would be (incorrectly) perceived as shorter. That's a good point!   Your first sentence does not automatically imply what OP is asking. It is not true that only square numbers have rational roots. (2/3)^2 is (4/9). 4/9 is not a square number, but still has a rational root.   http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-men-have-nipples  **a tl;dr of the article from the article**(since I took the effort of googling and clicking on the very first result for you, I might as well do this too):  In a now-famous paper, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin emphasize that we should not immediately assume that every trait has an adaptive explanation. Just as the spandrels of St. Mark's domed cathedral in Venice are simply an architectural consequence of the meeting of a vaulted ceiling with its supporting pillars, the presence of nipples in male mammals is a genetic architectural by-product of nipples in females. So, why do men have nipples? Because females do.     Momentum is the amount of "motion" in a body, while Kinetic energy is the amount of - like you said - "energy"  The immediate relation between KE and momentum comes from the simple fact that momentum is the amount of motion and Kinetic energy is exactly the amount of energy used in that motion! So yes, they are intimately related.  Intuitively, it's easy to see why the amount of motion is directly proportional to the velocity, because well, that's exactly the way motion is defined (an object moving with a certain velocity)  That brings us to why KE is proportional to the square of velocity. Let me illustrate this with an example which we'll build and then solve -- all step by step.  1/ Think of KE as the amount of work needed to bring a moving body to a standstill (Actually, that's exactly what it is). 2/ Imagine you're applying a constant force to do this (just to give you an intuition) 3/ Think of two bodies of the same mass, Body 1 moving at velocity 'v' and Body 2 moving at velocity '2v'.  4/ Since you're applying a constant force, the (-ve) acceleration of both bodies will be the same, so it will take twice the amount of time to stop Body 2 as Body 1 5/ But work is (the integral of) (Force) x (dDistance). Since Body 2 is traveling faster than Body 1, it travels more than twice the distance as body 1. And so, the work needed to stop it is more than twice the amount of work needed to stop body 1 6/ i.e. The KE of body 2 is more than twice the KE of body 1. i.e. The degree of relation with velocity is greater than 1 for sure.  How much greater, you say? That's your simple math. Integration will show you that the degree of the relation is 2.   Intuitively, Body 2 will travel four times as far to stop as Body 1 (That should be easy to see).   People with tumors etc. in frontal lobes commonly report near-death/afterlife experiences as well. My mother had a tumor in her left-frontal lobe and consistently reported hallucinatory and religious things.  Some more info: http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/brain-religion1.htm   The heavier will go down faster. Gravity is of course the same for both, but friction will be more for the heavier biker (Friction is a function of the normal force)  And because the friction acts in the direction opposite to relative motion, the direction is such that it accelerates the motion.  I don't think there will be too much difference, though.  EDIT: Why the downvotes? This, while not complete (I agree the drag effect included above is much more significant), is all correct.   Not 5 db. The resulting sound wave will be the sum of all the waves, where by sum, I mean the result of the interference between all the waves (http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/u10l3c.cfm)   The article says it would need booster shots, but apart from that you're right..it would if it could!      I use Endomondo for running and My Fitness Buddy for weight training. The former just works well for me and the latter has an easy interface for tracking workouts.       Multiply. As an example, if treadmill 1 says 300, and 2 says 200. Your total calories spent is 300 * 200 = 60000. Makes perfect sense, since your running is the product of the motion of two treadmills.   They active damping for all turbulence related things, really...   Darktable maybe a very good option for you. It's the FOSS option for Lightroom and is supposed to work quite well.   Depends on whether the can can take the pressure difference.       Nobody's said it yet, so let it be me... The band that fits the bill - Porcupine tree    What bellcrank is saying is that the further away you are from the wing, the better. This is because the loading on an aircraft is almost exclusively on the wing.  So the front is the best, followed by the back (tail), followed by the wing.  However, a counterpoint to this is that you have to think about the kind of turbulence you encounter. For example, if the effect is a pitching moment about the center of pressure, then the front would be a bad place, since it would get displaced the most. A rolling moment -- the center row is best. A yawing moment -- over the wing.  Basically, turbulence is a bitch and a plane is not a bus. There is no best place.    Well yes...since the can explodes due to the pressure from inside the can. In fact, it should explode with lesser shaking, because the pressure difference between the inside and outside is lower (pressure outside is zero).   Good answer! In fact, you don't even have to do 50. I'm sure 5 would be a good start!   The problem is that Hollywood also doesn't render it in real time. The renders for photorealistic CGI take a long time (days even for a single frame some time, depending on the lighting etc). The video is only a sequence of these rendered images which is then saved to disk. Not even close to realtime.   For gaming, you need real-time rendering, where user actions will control the lighting and so frames (at least the changed parts) will need to be re-rendered.  So while you're right about it being a matter of time, it's probably a long time away still.   Oh...It does seems like the Higgs field is really what causes the speed of light to be the limit. So my answer is correct...with the Higgs field being a lower level explanation.   Stress certainly does weaken the immune system. That's a link that's been verified over and over through many, many studies.  "Negative" thoughts are kind of hard to define scientifically, but if you're thinking about stress, then yes, they do weaken the immune system.   There seems to be some confusion here.  In vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed of light, which is related to the mass, yes. That's where Einstein is king and relativity doesn't allow anything to cross the speed of light. Irrespective of your mass, the terminal velocity is 'c'.  In no-vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed at which drag is the same as gravity, so the object cannot accelerate. Here, Newton is king and the terminal velocity is dependent on the shape (frontal area) of the object among other things.  I don't know what the Higg's field is, so if that's somehow relevant, I'm completely wrong about the first part. I'm only an aerodynamicist and confident about the second.   Sigh...read article. The point is to reduce the incidence of mitochondrial disease.   That Caption gives the picture a whole new meaning.   This is probably going to be a little vague.  I started SS a few months back (already posted twice about it). Currently, due to a family emergency, I had to travel back home and don't have access to a gym.  In the last two weeks, I haven't done anything.   I really don't want to waste whatever little gains I've got, so does anybody have any advice on what I should do, considering I don't have access to a gym (at all...), but I do have space for bodyweight stuff.   Currently, all I do is pushups...   She's no lady!   A disclaimer: I've never been to a therapist, and I do not have the money to go to one.   Two years back (or maybe one and a half), I was really out of it. There was a girl, and there was work and there was my sick mother and all together, they had pushed me over some edge I didn't even know existed.  Even though they were definite causes, I slipped into some sort of meaningless sorrow, where I would be sad and/or angry for absolutely no reason. I would walk around punching trees till my hand swelled up. I would burn myself with cigarette butts. And I would have no idea why I did what I just did.  Now, I can't relate to that version of me AT ALL. Even though I still feel that deep, deep sorrow some times, and a less deep constant numbness all the time, I can't imagine at all burning myself. That pain...  Anyway, I seem to have gotten completely distracted. So, I mentioned my mother was sick, right... she died two weeks back. And it was quite bad.   But in no way was it as bad as what I call my depression...and that scares me...      No idea at all :( I've just learned to live with it..as in, retype words.    It's like a group chat in GTalk, but over SMS.   It does, as long as they're on Whatsapp too.    Yes, me!   I hate that. Swiftkey has a gesture that you swipe to the left to delete the previous word, but I think it falsely recognizes fast typing as swiping left in some cases.   And I keep pressing backspace instead of 'M' too, which doesn't help with my inclination to delete by mistake    Just leaving this here, because Indian Classical music is all about microtones and a lot of Indian songs (even non-classical Bollywood songs) are microtonal:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAt6jW8QvJE      Thanks...So do I just skip the powerclean, or can (should) I add more bench press to the routine?   Hello all,  I'm starting the SS program, and because of a complete lack of interest from all my friends, I've been doing it on my own.   The problem is that OHP and Power Clean look like very umm..."dangerous" exercises, i.e., wrong form can injure you seriously (more so than squats, deadlifts and bench presses), so I'm too apprehensive to try them alone.  In fact, I even got advice from a random cool dude in the gym about my wrong squat form, which made me even more apprehensive to try the Power Clean and the OHP...  Are there alternatives which would give similar results?   (Ir?)relevant info: I'm a runner (5k in 17 m 30' to give an idea of pace), 180 cm, 74 kg (163 lb) and want to get strong, but not bulky (well...no interest in bulk, to be precise)   You say crippled and happy, as if the combination is perfectly natural :)  Of course you would take crippled and happy over depressed. I would, too!  But a crippled person could just as well say he/she would take depressed and able to play soccer instead of crippled and seemingly-happy, not knowing that depressions is just as bad for the ability to play soccer...  Now we're just arguing semantics. I know what you're trying to say, and it's cool :)   I'm sure you understand just as much about being crippled as a non-depressed crippled person understands about depression.  Don't mean to be rude, just putting it out there. My mother was paralyzed for four months before her death, and man....did it take a lot out of her.... Depression is just as hard, of course, but being crippled is in no way easier.   Everything's meh... all good, all bad...don't know...  Basically the usual :)   It's a harmless joke, but I took a while to get it because I thought they were talking about depression: http://i.imgur.com/YecHQ.jpg  Sorry, source thread (since OP is author of comic): http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/11dtfd/this_new_invention_of_mine/   Could someone link to these posts (that have good links) on favourite bass lines, solos and drum patterns?   That snarky kid wasn't worth the amount of time that took to load on my phone   Yes! I heard that without knowing it was the theme and loved it instantly!    In a round about way, she is teaching inner game.  I think it's the other way round. In a roundabout way, inner game is about getting to basic truths about the self.   I think even a one-way car rental will be cheaper than a taxi, which will be more expensive than a Lex, which will be more expensive than Amtrak, which will be more expensive than Greyhound/Megabus.  The last two options will get you to downtown though, from where you'll have to take the Blue Line or if you really want to, a taxi!   Sure. Here's a map of my first run : http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/136158431/   Actually, the loop above (the one I talked about in the comment) is slightly longer than 12 miles because the run I've mapped doesn't include the arboretum.    Another noob question.. Why do you expose for 20 sec in such a situation, i.e. what does it add to the picture since nothing is moving?   Or maybe the 20 sec is only so you can get the aperture down to f/20?      Very, very bad facilities and encouragement at the lowest level. It's not just in running. Things are changing (supposedly), but very slowly.  Even now in the US, I can't help but feel jealous admiration when I see high school events with better facilities, more encouragement from the community and just as much love for the sport than at the national level in India. It's crazy and it's awesome.  That's the short answer, really.   Yeah one is a fork of the other, supposedly. I like TeXStudio better, even though the menus are oddly named (IDEFix? :-/)   I run a loop involving Crystal Lake, Busey Woods, The Arboretum and Meadowbrook Park... Comes to a total of 12 miles and has trails interspersed with roads,   I used Vim with LaTeXSuite, but it was too much. Simplified and went to Vim with LaTeXBox. That's a real blast. Everything works really well.  Now I'm on TeXStudio, which handles multiple input files better than anything else I've seen. I don't work as speedily within a single file as in Vim, but I'm learning to live with that.   Thanks for the link!   We can do it together next May/August...That's what I'm aiming for!   Yes I do!  Subscribing right now!   Thanks a lot for the advice! Evidently, I'm trying to bite off far more than I can chew for now ;-)   Will try to get a heart monitor from somewhere and a foam roller!      Hello /r/running, this is my first post here... but I've been running a while. I was on my college athletics squad back in India for long distance (well 5000 m track), and then stopped running completely and started again about 4 months back because I read **Born to Run**  Corny as that sounds, I was really inspired by how over-the-top enthusiastic the author was. I'm not really into equipment (including the vibram shoes) or into timing my runs. I just really like running. I've never run a marathon and I never intend to do it.  That should tell you something about the kind of runner I am. I just like to run...that's about it. I run for varying amounts of time, speed and distance (5 to 13 miles at 7:30 to 10:00 per mile) depending more on my mood than anything else.  But I do love trail running and I really want to get to the point where I can do the Zion National Traverse in a day. That's 48 miles.   My question (sorry for all the irrelevant information, but I like talking about this stuff) is how do I get from a relaxed 13 miles to a relaxed 48 miles?   I ran the 13 miles in two hours and wasn't really tired at the end (but my legs were sore, probably because I haven't run in a while), if that helps with judging my running ability...   Walmart's got full length mirrors.   I'm not sure. I came back one day and it was gone. It wasn't even very expensive, but it was new (replaced due to many flats). I was locking the frame and the front wheel thinking the back wheel would be fine because it takes more time to get it out. Oh well.  Strangely enough, when I first got the bike, the seat was stolen, but the thief was nice enough to leave an inferior seat on the bike so I wouldn't be left without one!   I used to just bike around the county roads North of Windsor and stop and click on the roadside. Sunsets are really beautiful from there and you almost always get images no one else has seen:  Here are a few that I took (shameless be my plug):  http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/4851523843/in/set-72157619590842900/lightbox/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/4807013484/in/set-72157623118486812/lightbox/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/5068127638/in/set-72157623118486812/lightbox/ (This one's Japan House/Orchard downs) http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/4836941492/in/photostream/lightbox/   I just saw this repeating over and over with this playing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KipH9GLuiiI  Epic...   How about a video on how to remove and put in tires without quick release -- especially back tires!  My back tire was stolen recently and I would love to use this opportunity to learn stuff...   And I didn't know Koreans etc. started at 1...that's cool!   We don't start from 1 :-/   Ahh thank you very much! I wasn't counting the bar at all... So in fact, I was underestimating my values...That's good and refreshing :)   I just started Starting Strength and am maintaining an online diary.   I noticed on one post that some guy squatted 295 lbs! While that weight is really crazy, what I wondered was how 295 lbs could be evenly balanced on the left and right.  Then it hit me, what if they're only counting the weights on one side?!   So, is that the way it's done and I've been entering double the weights I squatted on my first two attempts into my diary? (all of 70 lbs, both sides included!)   I booked flights to Vegas for thanksgiving to backpack in the Grand Canyon. That place is already full.  Does anyone have ideas for other 2-night backpacking trips in the area? Everything's cool but anything below 10 F and I don't think I have or can afford the relevant equipment!   I was thinking of Bryce and/or Canyonlands. Opinions?     Just make a new post saying there's a meetup at a bar downtown and give a time (10-11's a good starting point) and we (well atleast I) will be there!  I organized one in Blind Pig over the Summer and lots of people showed up, though for the first 20 minutes, I was alone and wondering if anyone at all was going to!  Blind Pig (both of them) are great pubs. Jupiters is cool. Esquire is okay. Crane Alley in Urbana has great beer.    Organize a reddit meetup for drinks at a bar in downtown Champaign!   Trip to Mt. Dade in Sierras:  Didn't take winter clothes. Fell into a lake. Froze in the night.  Didn't take sunglasses. Got snow blindness. Was very bad.  Ask me about how to not prepare for winter backpacking trips and I will tell you.   Hello,  Does anyone know of a good place to rent campervans in the Portland Area? Everything I found online is for RVs.  I don't mind RVs, but the rentals are way too expensive. So if anyone knows of cheap RV rentals, let me know too!  Thanks!   Seriously, that's a heck of a ride with some serious climbs. I can see where this would be a big deal versus riding in the Midwest.  Oh yeah, completely! The only reason I got through it was that I kept riding!     Yeah it was only my second time there... Didn't even know the difference till it was pointed out!  Rode from Stanford Campus westwards (I think) back to the campus!   http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/132959991  And me at the top of the first climb (note the completely inappropriate clothing!): http://i.imgur.com/cRZQp.jpg  Anyway, very exciting it was. Thank you for listening :)   So we have to remove the notion that it is a "true captured moment" because it is not true to what we see with our own eyes  That's exactly what I'm going to do now, after reading all these comments...Thanks!   Yes yes, many times yes!    My friends and I want to go backpacking into the Canyon (the popular S-N-S rim-to-rim trip) during Thanksgiving.  We were comfortably planning the whole thing and waiting for everyone to confirm before we got permits. However, from my reading yesterday, it seems getting permits is very hard because of the popularity, so now I'm worried.  People who've been there, done that... How early did you get your permits?    Of course you can use it as a crutch. That's the whole issue I'm dealing with it. If I have a crutch, I tend to use it without thinking, and end up having less fun!   Thanks, excellent advice!    I was just making the point that you could replace militant with military and your statement would still be valid.     Militants...Military?   Ah okay, that's probably not the problem then. Good luck :)   Does anyone know of a place where I can practice drums on an actual set for free? I have an electronic kit, but it's not expensive enough to feel the same at all. Not even close.  I'm not a music student. I remember once in my first year (long ago), I'd asked about this and was told that the practice rooms are only available to music students.    	99
 That ain't cool   It's an open secret. Amit Shah said the same thing bluntly after the Lok Sabha elections. I'll try to post the link here.   Bro, dropping 30 places in the list of the most corrupt countries is kinda of a small achievement. I don't think you should start with that sentence if you are trying to highlight the rampant growing corruption in India   That's what I'll check tomorrow    Rs. 1500-2000 with 10mbps speed and around 60-80 GB data in Delhi   Probably not in the coming decade. Maybe after that.   But in a way it is good as we will be able to see how this plays out in countries like U.S and learn from their mistakes/exleriences after 10 years.    Although I am a BJP supporter and believe that Kejriwal will eventually end up like a Lalu or Mulayam (both had a lot of expectations from people like Kejri has since both were disciples of J.P but...after a decade or so they did not turn out to be what people expected) I do think that this hike in the education expenditure is good. If it is executed properly then it could be one of the best things that ever happened to Delhi.  Moreover the play grounds of Government  schools will be available to colony kids for playing after school hours so that'll be cool too. It's a small move, but was really needed.   Okay then. Thanks for the advice!   Damned if you do, damned if you don't. At least the people who know a thing or two about diplomacy will understand the reason behind such generosity. It's a long term investment.   I got to know about the amature astronomers association in Delhi and decided to join it in a week or so. They basically gather at a place and do some star gazing with their telescopes.  Being a complete noob I have no idea how good the visibility is in Delhi considering the air quality.   Any suggestions or comments?   	10
                love it, what a great idea!         Have fun!!                           Oh yes, #1 fan    I totally felt the same way :) it was very well written!   You don't offer anyway to justify the message behind the words he said, whereas this article does. It seems as though you are heated by how people interpret his message--maybe he should choose state them a little more clearly. I mean he believes in the bible, but not scientists? Get a grip. Jeb is trying to appease his donors while trying not to piss off half-way intelligent voters.          the fact of the matter is that he doesn't attribute climate change to HUMAN ACTIVITY because he isn't sure of "what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural--it's convoluted"                     [here](http://youtu.be/vG8Yh0XuCJ8) :)               thank you so much!                        What do you feel, has been one of your greatest/favorite achievements as a United States Senator?      awesome idea!   yes!!                                               	61
 As someone who recently went through the whole college application process, that looks a lot more like a rejection letter than an acceptance. The acceptance letters are nice and shiny and professional, and they usually come in huge packets for lots of papers. The rejections are just single unflattering little envelopes.  EDIT: OP follow up, did he get in?   Yeah, but he'll probably charge you a ridiculous amount of money for something that should have been free and bore you the whole way through it. In the end, you'll be disappointed with the outcome and vow never to return to the field of dentistry again.

The day the music died. Him, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens all in a matter of minutes. So sad.   As much as I love JFK, he really didn't do much of anything productive as a president. Anything he started either failed or fell to the wayside. And I mean literally almost everything. He also got too personally involved in the Cold War. He was a politician trying to fight a war with the wrong goals and prerogatives in mind. Someone in charge so far outside of his element made the entire conflict a rockier road than it had to be. He really should have just let the people who knew what they were doing make the big decisions. After he was assassinated, a few things he has begun were completed by his successors as he became a martyr, but for the most part, not much went through. A great man, personally one of my favorite historical figures, but a generally overrated president.   could have?   Jimi Hendrix. Died at 27 (basically founded the 27 club) of asphyxiation. Jimi Hendrix moved to Europe and formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1964. They recorded with each other for about two years all the while traveling around the continent to play with the greats. In 1966 they hit the main stream. And then, almost overnight, Jimi Hendrix became a household name. In the next four years they would play some of the most legendary concerts ever preformed and write some of the greatest songs ever recorded. Even today Hendrix's influence is clearly recognizable in modern day music. He was one of the greatest instrumentalists to ever live. And yet, he was only a mainstream success for four years. Imagine how far he could have gone otherwise. Imagine the what he could have done if he had more time. Gah, makes me sad just to think about.   I'm not from the US. I would definitely argue it was an American victory. In the end, the British promised to stop their attempts at native American expansion in Canada and stopped the practice of impressment on American shipping routes. In contrast, the British got almost nothing out of the war.   Never heard of the simple syrup thing, I need to remember to try that some time.   Woah what's that??   Last time I threw a party, the biggest complaint was that most of the drinks were just too strong. What are some easy to make drinks that cover up the flavor of alcohol?   orget the Net?   'We're Going to Need a Bigger Net'?   Surrender might not be the technical term, but it's generally accepted that the British lost the war.   It has worked on multiple occasions.   Not even close though...   The Battle of the Red Cliffs: Emperor Cao Cao's army was exhausted after a series of forces marches and unprepared for battle. Cao Cao did not reguard this and pushed on anyways. After reaching a river, a spy in his army advised Cao Cao to chain his ships together to avoid sea sickness. Upon seeing the ships, the opposing army sent fire boats at the fleet. The ships were trapped and quickly caught fire. This battle marked the end of the Han dynasty.   nbsp;  Battle of New Orleans: In an attempt to revive the failing British army, General Packenham decided to attack the military stronghold of New Orleans and gain control of the Mississippi River. Andrew Jackson and the American army were well prepared however, and the British were easily repelled. The American army took only a fraction of the losses of the British. To make matters worse, the war was already over. Although word had not reached Louisiana by this time, the Bitish had surrendered long before the attack had even begun.   nbsp;  Battle of Watling Street: As the Celtic leader Boudicca lead 210,000 tribal warriors south, burning and pillaging along the way, she decided to launch a surprise attack on a small Roman outpost on Watling Street. About 10,000 soldiers were stationed there. The Roman's could literally see the attack coming from miles away and easily out maneuvered the Celts. They began by using crossbows at long range and then setting up a phalanx when the army got closer. In the end, the entire Celtic army turned and ran. The Romans only lost 400 compared to the Celts 80,000. Boudicca committed suicide and the chance of Celtic victory was all but destroyed in a single battle.   Not really... I don't know enough about the English language to explain why that would be wrong, but I can identify it.   That's pretty good, but I have a friend that can top it...   nbsp;  "What would it be like if the moon was always orange?"  "Why's that?"  "Because that's what color it is right now"   nbsp;  Breaks out into full sprint: "Sorry, my hands got stuck in my pocket and I panicked"   nbsp;  "Oh my god, don't you wish they had dog dental cleaning treats for humans?"   nbsp;  "I've been trying to finish this pizza crust for the past half hour"   He was thinking of California Chrome.   Eggnog. I tried it with on who loves it and another whos never had it. We both agreed that this is what we imagined paint tasted like. He said it was bad eggnog, but regardless it ruined it for me.    You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.   Self advertising?   Yeah, but with comments like this he's flushing away his potential.   Wait what?   'Newer'?? This is the weirdest use of quotes I've seen in a while...   She lives on Mars.   A mixture of the two. I guess he's normal, but with an abnormal amount of brain farts.   Haha yeah... Apparently this isn't the first time someone has made a mistake like that in the same mental state either. He later sent me a link saying, "See? I'm not the only one, I'm not an idiot". He's still an idiot.   "Holy shit its 3 in the morning?!"  It was 10:20. He was reading the time off of a magazine advertisement.   nbsp;  EDIT: Oh, I got one more, different person. "I'm a vegetarian, but I eat fish" Reasonable, lots of people do that, but her reasoning behind it... "No, they're okay to eat because fish aren't animals" Apparently in her world, fish are either some sort of plant or fungus. Someone should tell science.   nbsp;  EDIT 2: Andddddd one more. A friend of mine last year informed me that Google Chrome won the Kentucky Derby. Yup. An internet browser won the world's most prestigious horse race. I mean I guess I get where he got that...but still.   Can I get a TL;DR on that?   0 Minute War!  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War   I tried to do this once. Believe it or not, a 100 pound 14 year old didn't have too much authority over a 250 pound 35 year old dad. I was honestly worried he was going to charge me. Then he took two tries to get out of his folding chair and my worry dissipated.   I used to ref soccer, hated dealing with this. I was at a game once where a keeper took a goal kick, only to have it immediately intercepted by the other team and shot into the open net. Goal, right? That's what I thought at least, and whistled the play dead before retrieving the ball and walking it back to the center of the field. When I was half way there the coach of the team that was scored on ran up to me and started shouting that "THE GOALIE WASN'T READY, SO THAT DOSNT COUNT! TAKE THEIR POINT AWAY!". I said that's definitely not a rule, and even if it was, if he wasn't ready he shouldn't have made the decision to start the play. These are middle school kids, they know the how the game works. He had no verbal response to that. Instead he grabbed the ball from me and punted it two or three fields away. "Go get the fucking ball, punk" he said. I calmly (and quietly, and very slowly just to piss him off) explained that the home team needed to supply the equipment for each game. Field, nets, etc. And if his team couldn't provide a vital piece of equipment, say a ball, I would have no choice but to have them forfeit the game and give the other team the win. Everyone quietly watching him walk across the entire park to get the soccer ball and bring it back was the most satisfying experience I have ever been a part of.  TL;DR: Made a very reasonable call the coach didn't like, he got mad and punted the soccer ball away and told me to go get it. I told him if he didn't get it and his team, the home team, can't provide the necessary equipment, they're team forfeits and the visitors win. He retrieved it.   No, you're actually very wrong.  *Insult: a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action*. Again, and actually serious this time, is English your first language? That would explain a lot. Your definition was a little misguided. It okay though, let's just try steering that brain cell in the right direction, champ. Anyhow, I have not once insulted someone because I wanted to hear them reply, what the hell kind of concept is that? If I'm insulting them, I'm clearly not a huge fan of hearing them speak, so why would I even want them to respond? You for example, I literally could not care less if you respond or not. Literally. The best part is though how you act like you're not trying to come up with some sort of comeback or response. Who was the one who began this whole thing by responding in the first place? Oh, right that would be you. "What have you been doing the whole time?"  And sorry to disappoint pal, but if you think anything you have done, or even can do, by commenting on Reddit is going to make me the least bit angry, you are more than delusional my friend.   Awwwwwwwwwww   "Man sneezes into tombstone during concert? Woah. Intriguing. Let's watch. Wait what? Is this a church? Well that would explain the tombstone. Wait, come on test_subject3655, whens the last time you saw a grave on the *inside* of a church? Well hold on now test_subject3655, this could be some weird religion where interior burials are common. If Scientology and the Church of the Button can be a thing, well I'll be damned if graveyards with a roof can't be one too. Either way, some guys gonna sneeze in one, they better get to it. 7 seconds to go. Woah, woah, woah hold up. What in the fucking dick was that? Was that an elephant? In the church? Why in the hell wouldn't the title mention the fucking church going elephant?! What is the title anyways?-Holy Jesus Christ I'm in idiot."  EDIT: Watched the video again. Couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed.   R+R=L(S)?   Please please please post a video of all of this. And then train my dog to do it. But seriously, the first part.   How does one exactly laugh at something while not paying attention to it? Do you even think before you type? You got that one lonely brain cell left, use it.  While under normal circumstances it's easy to understand the difference between insults and jokes, yours seem to be the solitary acceptation. I'll tell you what, how about you actually make your jokes *funny* and your insults *offensive*. That way not only will I understand them, but maybe we could even consider what your saying 'coherent'. This might seem like a lot to take in for a person like you, but one step at a time, bud.   I literally said out lout, "Holy fucking fuck", even though this isn't even really a theory, it want this theory to be true the most out of all of them.   I think if you're already in the car, its too late for you anyways.   Is English *your* first language? Because it's  capitalized, genius (I think I should explain that 'blast' for your benefit. I'm calling you a genius sarcastically. That means that I don't really think you're a genius, on the contrary in fact. I'm calling a very stupid person.)  I keep responding no because I care about (but not limited to) your opinion as I think you should probably know by now, but rather to educate your dumb ass. In my own humble opinion, it seems we shouldn't waste the single brain cell you have left. But if you would rather waste it, hey it's your brain cell to 'blast' if you insist upon doing so.  And are you still defending your incredibly messed up sexual assault joke? I stopped reading your little 'retort', and I use the term very lightly, about half way through but was shocked to pick back up and see that you were still at it. It was hard to believe you made a joke like that in the first place, but to sit here and watch you defend these actions... Despicable. I don't care if you find that sort of thing hilarious, but I certainly don't, and I think I speak on behalf of the majority of the general public when I say that so please stop saying things that degree of fucked up. Gosh, it really brings your character into question.  And don't try to explain your joke; it's never funny when you need to explain the joke. Come to think of it, it was never funny in the first place.   It really is the trouble makers that get away with the most.   Are you really joking about molesting people? And comparing it to an almost harmless joke (I say 'almost' for your benefit. The teacher didn't care, the students thought it was ridiculous. Literally no harm or even unpleasantness that could have come remotely close to coming out of it lasted even the length of that day) someone made on a teacher in middle school?? That's and disrespectful and fucked up on so many levels. And to think your trying to preach righteousness. Unbelievable.  And I'm not trying to prove your weak insult about a 'shit' wrong. I literally could not care less about your opinion. In fact, I'm getting a kick out of watching you still struggling to 'blast' me. ('Blast'?? Seriously? Jesus, how fucking old are you?)   The class would just be dying about how far he could go  I did actually. And even if it didn't, you just assumed these things. As we all know, when you assume, you make an ass of 'U and ME'. Or, in this case, just you. So being 'blasted' on basic reading skills is on you. Its funny that you blame me for what you thought was clearing it up later, and then went back to the previous un-cleared up hypothetical scenario you made up in your head. If you didn't get it the first, or second time, I'll say it a third. I nor anyone in that class, have naver made or laughed at a 'borderline stalker joke'. Are you still assuming things?? Read it again, slower this time. Good lord, just get it together.   I've got everything under control   I had Harrison, a Ford Mustang, Philip Rivers, a Dodge Charger, and 'The Sharp Dressed Car', a Nissan Z.   Don't really need to bother with "keys" though, do you?. Its not like you're going to get there and realize you forgot them.   Being put on the spot.   Well I would be offended, but it just seems plain silly to take egotistical internet ass holes with a superiority complex seriously. For the record, no one thought what he was saying was funny, they thought it was funny that the teacher did nothing about it. Are you honestly saying that you were never a juvenile middle/elementary school student with a slightly distorted sense of humor that probably encompassed some sort of immaturity? If you say no you either missed your entire childhood, or you're a conceited dick. If you say yes, then you should understand why a class of children would find immature things like this funny, and apparently just troll people on the internet because you have nothing better to do with your sad pathetic life. I couldn't care less about your depressing little existence though, carry on making the world a worse place for the rest of us.   You're asking the wrong person   That lower left...extremely sketchy.   [Well, well, well, how the turn tables- . . .] (http://youtu.be/KdhSxMgpJL8)  Sorry, made me think of the that scene...   Um, no. I get why it was seem like that, but I was there, trust me it didn't go down like that. The class would always be dying at how far he could go just walking all over her and when he was done she would laugh along with the class like it was a tiny little joke and no big deal. In reality, he regularly crossed the line and went after her personal life and family. It was hilarious, but so, so wrong.  EDIT: Don't care so much, but why downvotes?   [Ahem] (http://youtu.be/JgCHJM2fT2U)   There was a kid who would just say some ridiculous shit to this one teacher because he knew he could get away with it and just wanted to see how far it would go. He said things like, "On Christmas Eve, I'm sneaking into you children's bedrooms (she had two infant girls) and painting myself green so I can and hold them as ornaments instead of your Christmas tree" and "In the middle of the night I'm going to climb into your husband, so that when he talks you'll hear *my voice*" (he put some great emphasis on that last part), and even "I went online to 'rentaslave.com' and ordered you a nice new pair. Oh, happy Martin Luther King Day, by the way". Just some weird fucked up shit. The most shocking part though, was her reaction. She never did anything about it. Just laughed politely and said things like, "Alright, now I think that's enough now, John" all the while still smiling courteously like he had just made some chuckle-worthy light hearted jab.   The dress really is blue.      Shockingly similar to my New Years resolution.   "Dude, chill"   Ask Michigan.   Okay, so this one is serious. Probably going to get buried, but serious none the less. Can someone (preferably not too huge of a stoner, just to avoid bias) who lives in a state where marijuana has been legalized explain how it has changed things over there and if you're in favor of the changes? And if you partake, how the system works exactly and what it's like compared to going into say, a liquor store. It just seems like such an alien concept living in a state so anti-marijuana.   I'm not from Maine, but lobster is fucking delicious no matter where you are.   "N64 SUX"  Self post, /r/gaming.   Penicilalsn. Nailed it.   I would say Obama, but decapitation via immediate and simultaneous clotheslining from every direction courtesy of the Secret Service seems just like a rough way to go.   Being trapped in a room full of legos barefoot with a nice big puffy pair of boots on the other side, next the only door. And then when you get to the boots you find that they have no souls, or in fact no bottoms at all, and the door is locked. And then it starts raining legos.   Explosive diarrhea, no bathroom.  FTFY   I Disappointed no one said Stairway to Heaven yet. I would totally choose that, but not the original, [this fucking incredible version] (http://youtu.be/LFxOaDeJmXk). Maybe not *quite* the best cover ever, but it is without a doubt up there.   EDIT: Nah, I'm just gonna say it. I mean come on, John Bonham's son in a bowler hat playing his dad's old set? The president just fucking grooving away? Jimmy Page nearly jumping out of his seat? Robert Plant brought to tears? No, it doesn't get better than that. BEST COVER EVER.   Lol thats like playing a song called 'divorce' at a wedding   How is that unbelievable? Can't  you just...point to your head?   James Spader. I like to think of my dog as an evil mastermind meticulously planning out every detail in his elaborate scheme to rid the world of that darn cat across the street. No one can scheme quite like James Spader, he's the perfect embodiment of a sami-evil puppy. I hope when you all see the Avengers you just imagine Ultron as a six month old Yellow Lab who sometimes runs into the wall while he's chasing his tail instead of a metal death robot. Avengers, Age of Mr. Cuddles.   ...Jimi?   Directions unclear, do I shut off the headphones? I hear a whole lot o Zeppelin. I like this game, OP!   He's way past 11...   The entire 'proof' system is not only confusing, but unnecessary. It differs from country to country. In the United States, 2 proof equals 1% alcohol. That means that vodka at say 80 proof is 40% alcohol. There is really no point at all to the system. Encouraging people to do basic math I guess?  To make matters worse, the system changes in each country. What 80 proof means in the US could easily mean something completely different in another country. But in the US, 200 proof is as high as it goes. Thats 100% alcohol.   Not all words, just those that are important or relevant to the story.   It sorta looks more like he said, "we need to have a talk about boundaries"   Literally the highest it could possibly be. 100% alcohol.   'Snoop Dogg'   So, sounds like your boyfriend was nearly raped, at the very least sexually assaulted. So why the hell are you mad at him??   Hope the front doesn't fall off. Watch out for a wave, and what ever you do, don't  go beyond the environment!   Okay, fine. They contributed the slide.   Yeah, I was totally joking about that one... I love Newark, especially downtown, but its by no means a tourist must see.   It is, there is just too many people.   See at least three Broadway shows (if you're there long enough), the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Central Park, a few museums, the 9/11 memorial/One World Trade Center, Yankee Stadium (not to be confused with Citi Field), the Empire State Building, Bronx Zoo, USS Intrepid, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center, the United Nations Headquarters and maybe the Jacob J. Javits Center if any big thing is in town.   New Jersey hosted the Super Bowl last year. New York played no part in that, most people even flew into Newark.   You guys have the weirdest sense of humor  What?? I've lived in many places throughout my life, New Jersy among them, and let me set the record straight, the standards of comedy in New Jersey are absolutely no different from the rest of the United States. At all. On top of that, if you didn't see any nice sights, you didn't look hard enough, or at all for that matter. The Delaware Water Gap? New Jersey shoreline? Cape May? Ellis Island? For god's sake, Newark?!? The only people that say New Jersey, or any state for thay matter, is 'ugly' are the ones that are too lazy to step off the parkway (even the parkway though, pretty damn nice down south...).   It's English.   It went beyond the environment.   [e-dubble] (http://youtu.be/AYKYvVkhIYo)?   I believe you're thinking of Sesame Street.   Uh, [Fear of the Dark] (http://youtu.be/Nba3Tr_GLZU)?   I think be whines because he's trapped in a little metal box with no attention, not because he needs to be pushed.   I think you're in the wrong.  	102

 probably just to prove that [he/she] can upset the hive mind.   Hi all!   I've been living in the portland area for about a year now and last year it didn't even cross my mind that I might be able to do some winter hunting, coming from New England.  I've heard that black trumpets come up in January? Is there anything else I could keep my eyes open for?  Thanks for any help in advance!   basically I was reading through the top comments and saw the discussion of whether Fight Club should or should not be mentioned. It had been mentioned there a few times. And then I sorted "controversial" and saw it a few more times. And so when I had landed on this particular comment I thought to myself "that is so brave." And then I said what was in my heart.  If what is in my heart is worth -3 karma, I'll take it. But just know, I died typing from the heart.   dude there was a nickolodeon episode with summer sanders (the one where people got slimed) where a girl had invented just that.   did you really use 2000 pounds of sugar?   ooh you're going to really popular in a few minutes   I'm giving you my karmic support simply for how absurd this sentence is.    who even considers the third godfather?   so brave   I could not agree fucking more. I don't know why people like this movie. It's a terrible garbage film.   Oh yeah! I forget about that academy award... Never got why that movie was so popular.   hey here's the funny thing:  A little ways up there's some dude that said around the same age his english teacher bought him booze and also sexed him up a few times.   And all of the comments were like "LOL NICE D000dD," because, you know, it's apparently awesome when female teachers fuck their male students.    Lol that's so very very wrong. And HILARIOUS!   I laughed too much    As a cook, I will absolutely cook your food however you want it. But if you order a $25/30 steak well done, I will think less of whoever is behind that ticket.  It's not so much because you have tastes that are different than my own, but more of a combination of proper technique and also straight logic.   Because let's be honest, if you're going to order that steak well done, just get a hamburger, no bun with some onions and mushrooms on top. Load it up with A1 and enjoy.   But also because to me in my esoteric ways, ordering a steak over medium (and even medium is pushing it), is like ordering sushi quality yellowfin tuna cooked entirely through. The tuna is "supposed" to be served seared and black and blue. And arguably that's why you're eating the tuna in the first place. Otherwise, you are eating something prepared incorrectly and probably would enjoy something else more.       what about when Ryan Dunn almost killed you with a golf cart?   b-but... That's what h4x0rs do. right?   oh sure, you get all the love for pointing this out... But I point out hanged vs hung and everyone shits on me.   I really hope this is a game   Sweet dude!   one of my favorite movies of all time!   great, now i have to get those color sperrys   wait, what?   huh, I've always known both kinds to be called chicken of the woods... interesting!   i read that in peter griffin's voice   hmm no rings though... could be these guys: [Armillaria tabescens](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria_tabescens.html). But idk, doesn't seem like a good fit.    the picture titled "green fungus" looks like [turkey tail](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/trametes_versicolor.html) perhaps...  the one titled "what is this?" could **maybe** be [scalycap](http://www.mycokey.org/result.shtml?genSpec=Species ID=1707 showList=Result random=27669)  the picture titled "more" looks like old chicken of the woods to me [Laetiporus sulphureus](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/laetiporus_sulphureus.html)   could be [Scleroderma bovista](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/scleroderma_bovista.html).   throw it up on vimeo!   TL;DR heartbreak   wow, that description got bizarrely political in the fourth paragraph.    It frustrates me that this is not further up with more support.   I would probably go insane if I worked in this kitchen. Then I'd probably start sculpting hamburger asses.   lol you quit? BULLSHITTTTT   In my little experience with this, they are not oysters. You're looking for shelf mushrooms, which will growing out of a tree or some kind of wood, and not have a stem as these do.   dude! I'm stealing this so hard.   first as tragedy, then as farce   you made me tilt my head and go what the hell is-- *waitaminute*   I agree with you, even though I feel shitty about that.   idk why everyone's downvoting you... It's just your opinion. I've just personally never met somebody who classifies modest mouse as a "one hit wonder." If anything they have two hits, and a fairly thorough following.    allow me to attempt a translation:  That looks really good! What are you doing later, girl?   I was thinking the same thing. Better camera, more light and a tad bit of better presentation would make all the difference in the world.   soft cell   I've never met somebody who thinks they are one.   I understood this   that's just tuesday night   you just made me yell "HO SHIT!!!" and then I grabbed my ear   eh, he's some dude that wrote this book called Antifragile, which makes a strong case for what you're saying.   how many times are we going to link to this?   lol did you read what he said?  the fundamental problem with this thing is that it's impossible for the Lightning plug to pass raw 1080p HDMI as they want you to think it does. It simply doesn't have enough pins.   ITT: some people had abusive parents, some people are pussys   haha, are you Nassim Taleb trolling people in a /r/programming thread?   Indeed.   You know what? Everyone is going to downvote me into oblivion for this. But just shut the fuck up with this self righteous bullshit.   People cheat, it's been happening for a long time. I'm sick of seeing this shit on Reddit like it's some sort of black and white issue.    \o   Time to become a Buddhist Monk   Wait... Do you really think of the POTUS as someone who plays golf on the weekends and has downtime?  I mean, fuck.   oh my god. Thank you. I may have just ruined some important things by spitting beer everywhere. But it was worth it!   no more medicine!   man, I've been seeing you all over lately... Were you really a pope?   did you explain what you had done? Did he laugh it off?   you should reply:  " differently*   where* "   oh, you sound like such a cunt sock experiment   yes.   I said out loud to myself, "Yeah, that's right," to your comment. It doesn't make the much sense, but I'm drunk and even though I just typed then deleted a whole paragraph trying to explain it, I just want you to know that's what's up bro.   Diogenes would disagree.   pfft... Black Russian   Commenting to save   This article... Plleeaaassee.   An excellent question. He probably feels great about it though.   it's what he is! All racists with money and power are dangerous.   this really is excellent!   hell yeah bro. I play that game through every 2 years or so.   indeed it does. I don't think I'm ready for that much fun...   You can't redefine veganism to fit or support your own lifestyle choices.  Vegan/vegetarian is an ethical stance.  Yes, yes it is.  Veganism (/vignzm/) is simply an extreme form of vegetarianism which eliminates any and all animal products from the diet. It can also refer to.the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products in every manner possible  oh, and more specifically,  One of the main differences between vegan and vegetarian diets is that vegan diets exclude both eggs and dairy products...  It sounds like you might be a vegetarian.   Where'd you get that idea from?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism  I'd like to start making things up too. VEGANS CAN EAT HONEY!   Three weeks from now: My gay retarded dog found this on his last walk.   hahaha, priceless!   I was thinking the same thing. "Oh boy, I'd end up getting drunk and hurting myself reaally bad."   good enough for me   Uh, this isn't even a funny story to me, it's become part of my life dealing with the bums down there.    ITT: people afraid of butterflies. *Who knew*...    Even though he has not proved his claim, you have also not refuted his claim.  A logical fallacy, known as an argument from ignorance.    which is alright, I think.   "YO!"  	85
 When this was first posted it made me think of this exact video. The shock in the voices are just so real. The crying involved just makes you realize the shock they are going through.   https://youtu.be/sbxKbI9Ik4o   https://youtu.be/sbxKbI9Ik4o   Just the icing on the cake at that point.   Where do i sign up for a turn to get to kick this guy?      http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/west-loop/dog-walker-caught-on-camera-kicking-puppy-west-loop-building   OP on youtube [just posted](http://i.imgur.com/psOncPP.png) that she is friends with the owner of the dog.  edit [found a news article](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/west-loop/dog-walker-caught-on-camera-kicking-puppy-west-loop-building)  The building's security guard, who is stationed at the entrance, noticed the beagle dog was acting odd before they entered the building's elevator, according to the property manager. At that time, the security guard watched a live video feed from the surveillance video located in the elevator on a monitor stationed near the entrance desk.  safe to say it is the right company.   Hard soccer pass maybe? Wouldn't surprise me if it could be enough to break a rib. Enough to rage the second i saw it and closed it.    mmmm pork...   One of my old jobs involved insurance involved repair work on cars. Was sent to a job in Compton, knocked on his door and he answered and was surprised to see me. White guy shows up to his door to replace his car stereo and the first things he does is grab a gun and put it in his waistband. He sat on the porch while i installed the fastest car stereo install ever.   But not your left, that will cause you problems later in your life.   for netflix users  http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80010655    Wouldn't take that bet, you never know what could be laying on the seafloor even with an educated guess.   I knew the name but couldn't place it, thank you.   Kinda mad it isn't the whole video though, /u/GallowBoob i hated you at first but you do post some content that hasn't been seen on many subs. You do post edited content until you beat the horse dry though.   and these people vote...   soft   Damnit OP i was just about to stick my pitchfork up your ass, but decided to help since you tried to redeem yourself.  [time stamped early to add britney which is kinda funny](https://youtu.be/5M1ZKPCLb4I?t=1m40s)     What year did this start? It seems like 10 years at least.   Context for a dumbass?   in   Heat waves happen all over the world and people die from it all the time.   There actually might be quite a few things hotter than our sun.   Heat the sticky tape, not the place you are going to put it on, and make sure you clean the shit out of it with alcohol first.   the sun   I don't see a problem with this. ^^^^^I'm ^^^^^from ^^^^^LA   Thank you for being a great people.   even the replay is boxing...   Apparently we missed a Tampa goal?   How did they score???? live extra wtf   wtf is this boxing shit?   Anyone know how Morrow got the black eye?   who is the crowd booing?    they were hermetically sealed  Do you have a source for that? I searched and the best results were all on whack job conspiracy sites and it wasn't even a real source. I've worked on elevators and i hardly doubt that.    Black smoke , which it mostly was, is oxygen starved.  Was there black smoke in the OP video?   I'm not going to argue, got better shit to do.   You sound like you don't understand how convection works. Put a shit ton of combustibles in a highrise, air flows up the elevator shafts and supplies a constant flow of oxygen to it. That is how you get such high temperatures.   I'll let it slide because of that boner inducing slap sound.   On a similar thread someone posted [this video](https://youtu.be/UvluuAIiA50) and really found it fascinating. Someone replied with a HD version but can't seem to find it.    It was silvery  It is silver when it reaches melting point at 660 Celsius / 1200 Fahrenheit, what color does it change when it reaches 3000C / 5000F?    Maybe it is a list of dicks she has seen and max showed his to her and she refused?   Have 900 hours into the game and have only seen AI put planes on a carrier once.

That shows ww2 shit all year long. I still feel like the main History channel could be showing better things than Pawn Stars.    Think this is a full blown orgy by now...   Thank you for being you OP   Overrated    i quit last week   [This map](http://i.imgur.com/8cSk8ye.jpg) shows it better than i can explain it but it isn't exactly to scale. Mainly has do with geography of the area of the LA basin. The southern most point of the california aqueduct ends at [silverwood lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Xk0Je) which feeds the high desert mainly Hesperia/Victorville. You can see the aqueduct in the top of the google map link.  The colorado aqueduct feeds into [lake Mathews](https://goo.gl/maps/qQgvj) in Riverside. You can't see the aqueduct in the supplied link because it mostly runs underground after it reaches the mountains [around here](https://goo.gl/maps/JwVJF) via the San Jacinto tunnel.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct  On the first map i link, i live in that area marked as groundwater to the east of LA.   i know what his problem is   Was just giving an example of it's location on the east side of the Rockies. Did i say anything about the water level on the google maps link?   Why i took the time to explain it without being a dick. I enjoy being able to ask questions in subs meant for other countries about the context. Usually everyone is really nice about it and offers a good explanation.    [Strontia Springs Reservoir](https://goo.gl/maps/OYk0i)   Unfortunately it is on the wrong side of the rockies.    Guy in red (runner) needs be touched by the ball before he touches the 3rd base.  Since Trout was able to touch the base and keep his foot on it before the ball touches him he is considered safe. If there was another runner on second base, the third baseman only needs to touch the base before the runner does.    Watched it live and couldn't believe it until like the 3rd replay.   Colorado river only feeds SoCal and not much of the LA area, Mainly Riverside and San Diego and parts of San Bernardino. All of the central valley gets its water from the north part of the state.   Only time will tell when the wall goes up to divide the rich from the poor.   Yes by "old stone" i meant that in the same context that i stated. OP has mentioned countless times on how he wants his landscaping and showed how he wants to enjoy his "Backyard."   I am happy you used the term "usanians," it should be used more often in this same context. We are all the product of the same experiment.   edit - wow i sound like a drunk asshole... someone be my friend   Do you have any luck with that username?   I'm sure it it easier to get rid of old stone in the US compared to some of the older cities with history of those kind of stones in Europe.   The stone was ugly as shit, love how your project turned out.   OP this is wonderful, once this post gets enough views the nice people  will come in and clean it up.   Guess my lazy ass will reach for the keyboard to thank you. I copy and paste letters sometimes because i'm to lazy to type it.   Why does it seem like nbc have such a boner for hawks?   what does his username say?   Maybe a restaurant in a 5 star hotel?   I can get lost on vice's yt page for hours.   We have a global outreach instantly compared to news more than 50 years ago.   It is hard to like baseball, it takes a certain kind of fan to love baseball.   This is the reason i go to Angels games and not Dodger games, anytime i have to drive into downtown LA for NBA or MLB games it takes more than hour. I can be in my seat to an Angels/Ducks game within 30min of leaving my house. Both markets are the same distance from where i live.   Every camera has things they are designated to get, they have a general idea what it is needed, but every camera has a certain role.   It is the way you prove your manhood to say you have the alpha cock.   This is worthless and the game is rigged.    http://www.donotlink.com/f96k   I would say you are correct, at the very end of the season he says his new catch phrase is his grand kids. He puts up with Jerry because he loves his grandkids.   PD have duty ammo they issue out to officers, they are all accounted for after a certain time. They use other ammo at the range and such.   I live in socal and don't even do this.   troll   Yes i want to fight you now, you are now my reddit nemesis.    Pretty sure general maintenance is crazy high.   We lost one almost the same way with the fluid around the lungs, we had her drained and brought her home. The next day she was still doing ok, but the more active she became more it made the fluid worse. Third day she was having such a hard time breathing that i immediately took her to the vet and had her put down.   Who are the kids?   Instant death, no pain.   In the other pic OP posted you can see the spindle is extended out without spacers, so it probably doesn't even come close to the bumper.

Holy shit, i love hearing British talk shit about America, this is why i love Clarkson and TG America sucks ass.  edit - Apparently i'm going to have to hail hydra to watch anymore of these?   Not the greatest movie but fun in it's own way.   Ya not your typical dive bar.   Most of the popular beers will have more than one keg attached as well.   No shit? If you are aggressive on the way you pursue them it is just going to make them drive even more insane. Exactly what this video shows. He could have tried to keep his distance which at the 4 minute mark he was told to do so but ignored it. Even saying traffic wasn't as bad as it actually is, if you can't safely narrow down a search area after you break off a pursuit, then you don't have enough officers that clearly are needed.  It isn't like the bank robber went in and shot the place up like north hollywood. Once he robs a bank the FBI are involved, no reason to jeopardise my family or your family to capture a guy that can get away with a few thousands dollars only to be captured in a better and easier way later. Why escalate a deadly situation even more by provoking a suspect? Up until the end a single officer was in pursuit of a vehicle and it caused more danger to the public than putting a dangerous bank robber into custody.  edit - I love how you immediately downvote because you disagree     /r/thebox    I'm guessing the new one you are talking about is the one in the second link.   it's life.   Canadian engineer here. Believe it or not, their job page was officially named RIMjobs at one time. /facepalm   Am i the only one that thinks the aggressive speeds reached in traffic are more reckless than a bank robber getting away with insured money? If you have to put this many innocent people in danger to get one guy of the street, when should you say protecting the innocent is more important?   Edit - Even at the 4 minute mark the other officer says to disengage the pursuit and the main officer says copy, but continues to pursue when it gets the most dangerous.    Prob would if they were in the lower section.   I used to install alarms for 10 years, using [this](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=43) you could do what you want.

OP wants to see the money grow without having to spend time on making it grow. Which i would want the same in his situation.   Don't know to upvote or downvote.   I know you like to drink soda.   Going to go watch the land before time now...   Ouch, explain to a bogan that lives in the US?   Didn't know two halfs of a zebra had a docking routine.   I think i want to live in Norway now, people celebrating without even knowing why they are...   I have a gold plated one i'll sell for the same price.   Went there in elementary school on a field trip, but we just went around and looked at the plants. There was no education that a elementary school kid will remember.   Seems to be heading that way, I wouldn't exactly say MTV picked on the kid like /u/Paradiselost541 says. It gives you an insight into his head and try to understand what he thinks. Gives people more context into what someone with a learning disability deals with and can comprehend the world they live in.   Can i get some context for a lurker friend of mine?

He grabs them just in time.   Ex gf had a 17 year old cat that lost her vision suddenly, retinas just suddenly started giving and detached. We got rid of the bedframe to the bed and just put the box spring and mattress on the floor. The cat would sometimes forget about the drop off and walk of the end of the bed until she got used to it. She still knew where the food and litter box was and figured out how to reach the living room. Sometimes running into things getting used to it and where everything was.   Congrats on making me hate you.   The basics are understood on how it works, but can you explain why a volcano erupts on this side and then a major earthquake happens on the otherside?     It really is, Can we in history and as humans imagine 300 million years? Even a billion? We still don't really understand a million years ago. We really only learned about plate tectonics in the last 50 years and we still can't explain it.   you're not OP...   Most of the good ones can't be dropped in water though.   You can have an easy swappable battery or it being waterproof, not everyone is capable of switching out a battery that has been built with water proofing in mind.

Yes, i believe in June our city is going to offer $2 sqft to remove lawn and to put in something better. Might do it to the side of the house that has sun all day.   I think inches would be dramatic... and thanks for linking the thread.   How much elevation change do you think could be happening?    Fuck the haters on your shoes and other bullshit. You are who you are and she fell in love with you. Just be glad you found someone who loves you that could care how you dress and is your best friend. Everyone else here on reddit atm are just jealous because you found love and they have not.    The two recommended to me were [Buffalo Grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouteloua_dactyloides) or [Zoysia grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoysia).  Currently most of my lawn is at least 4 different types, Mostly invaded by crabgrass, which  results in [this](http://i.imgur.com/C98MKpw.jpg). After renting an industrial power rake.  My whole lawn has a mixture of permanent shade and sun.  Please help...  edit - i know St Augustine is used around here a lot, will have to use the identification tool to find how what types i have currently, the shaded areas are different type than the ones in the sun. I also need to get rid of the shade that is currently there, the two trees that provide the shade are very old and termite infested. They are on the curbside, and would have to get the city to remove them.   Roll call?   You were driving slow enough that a trailer of fish passed you?

You've never filled a 5 gallon sparkletts bottle with mostly silver before have you?   Just looked at wunderground and we are getting shit on  edit - this is where are ground water comes from so i am happy as fuck.   Been there many times and usually driving a highreach.   I've never heard anything like it, might get a thunderstorm once every two years, and it will be fun. It sounded far away but it rolled across the valley like it had a vengence. Currently getting rained on pretty good.   It echoed like i've never heard from the mt baldy range. My lights actually flickered seconds before i heard it. WTF was it?   "chad said if they were gone longer than 15 mins we come in guns blazing."  "you don't even have a gun"  "damn it woman don't even argue with me"  Always a great movie when the black guy is the rational one throughout most of the movie.      I have never enjoyed the sound of rain so much, at least i don't have to be on the freeway during any of it.   http://i.imgur.com/yCAYh5D.jpg   Now i'm sad. We actually got some rain today though, that will run off into the ocean. =(   Someone needs a snickers.   You can always use a sharp knife to cut underneath it.   Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.  Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it.   Or finding something not in the same field of your degree and gaining work experience and creating a job history. Doing these will probably further your career than a degree and sitting on the side of the road making people sorry enough for you to give you a job.   or cat facts   no homo   What part of the IE though and how far into LA do you have to drive for work? I live in the west side of the IE and still would spend an easily 2 hours getting home from west LA.    I filled a 5 gallon water bottle less than a quarter of the way and it was almost $300 bucks.   What kind of drill bit is this? I've never seen one with a different kind of metal in the tip of the core. Guessing it is for easy replacing the sharp starting edge of the bit?

Hello. I have a recipe running which triggers every time i make a new post on my Tumblr blog. It then sends an e-mail to my Buffer account using Gmail.  Recipe works great, but it won't add the main image of my posts as an image on the e-mail it sends and instead it sends an "image not found" picture. I have to say that i'm not creating image posts, just normal text posts with an image on top.  [This is the recipe i am using](http://i.imgur.com/atcfFsF.jpg).  Any ideas?   Mmm, can't really stop the fan without removing the PSU from the case since it's mounted upside down and on the bottom of the case are some covers for the air (can't remove them).  But i'll try that.  EDIT: I can see the PSU fan turning from the back of the tower (on the bottom) and i think that the noise i'm hearing is synced with the fan.   Tapping the PSU doesn't stop the noise, it just makes it "faster" for some seconds, like it's doing some more "spins", like it's losing it's rhythm. I can't describe it correctly.  Truth is i've been also having coil whine/noises from one of my hard disks and from the GPU. I fixed the noise from the GPU by setting the fans a bit higher and the hard disk by unscrewing it a bit.   I see, thank you very much. Maybe i'll try my luck with an RMA, but support here in Greece is not that good (it can get extremely complicated to RMA a faulty device) and that's why i'm asking if that noise is bad news for my computer.   Doesn't coil whine actually sounds like whining? Like [this](http://youtu.be/HP73edpQwgc?t=2m13s)? Mine is a more buzzing one.   Hello. I have an Evga Supernova NEX650G Gold Power Supply 650W. During the past weeks, the PSU started making a buzzing electric sound. It's not very loud, but you are able to hear it, especially if you are near the PC/PSU.   I checked for loose connections, tried the computer on another socket, with and without a UPS, nothing helped. According to the BIOS, the PSU is giving the correct voltages and there has been no malfunctions. But is this sound normal?  [This is a video](https://vid.me/Sqke) i recorded on which you can hear the buzz )starting at 00:09). You can hear a similar noise [on this video](https://vid.me/qB2) (it's from another user having a similar problem with a similar PSU).            151, thanks!            My bad, i added a link to my Twitter account on the original post in order to prove that i also like LibreOffice (and that i'm not affiliated with MS in any way). I just fixed that and messaged the mods, i hope it will be restored.   Haha, yes, that's true :).  (and that's one thing i didn't like on Office 2013).   Since it's Microsoft's, i guess there's a n extremely small possibility to be ever available for Linux...  You may try the [web version](https://www.onenote.com/Notebooks) or the [Official Web Apps](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/07/run-microsoft-office-web-apps-ubuntu-desktop).   Office? Office is not an app, it's a suite of apps. Which app do you mean?   File-Account-Sign out and try to sign back again.      How many times has this been reposted? Over 25000? Over 45000?   From what I remember, it has a 60mb upload limit every month. But yes, I agree with you, people should use what's best for them    When I was using Evernote, the free version had very limited space and bandwidth. Onenote connects with your Onedrive and so you have much larger space available.   [Here](http://www.321download.com/LastFreeware/alphabetically.html) is the directory of available apps.  My favourite one is [Fastone Capture](http://www.321download.com/LastFreeware/page4.html#FastStone Capture), which is now a paid app.  **EDIT**: I have no affiliation with the site or the above app.   No. I repeat: in my opinion, YSK that Microsoft OneNote for Windows, which was a paid app and part of a costly Office suite, is now available for free, with many updates.   Because it's free and it's a very good app. Many people don't know that Microsoft offers such a great tool for free, since it was part of the paid Office suite just a few months ago.   Maybe [this](http://lifehacker.com/migrate-your-data-from-evernote-to-onenote-with-this-to-1560885406)?         I'm in need for a song of that kind today... :)  Edit: Added comment      Its not when its angled. I know what you mean, had that with a galaxy nexus. Its almost everywhere, no need for angle.  I'll repeat, Microsoft has already acknowledged the defect.                        According to them, it's limited.  But there are many reports online from users about this issue. Some say that they needed to exchange their Lumia 930 3-4 times until they got a good one. That's why i'm waiting before demanding an exchange, chances are that even the second one might have similar issues.   Microsoft confirmed the issue.  https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/549484852244774912  Please check links on original post.             The fate of the Eurozone economy could well be in the hands of a man who once monitored the sales of virtual goods via micro-transactions in Dota 2 and Counter-Strike  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/greeces-new-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-valves-former-steam-market-economist-1485336   The authorized service found nothing wrong with my phone. From what i read, there are many Lumia 920/930 with screen issues. It's up to the service if it's going to offer a replacement.  EDIT: For example, look at the replies [on this topic](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes).   So, after Microsoft [promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2qptfp/lumia_930_microsoft_is_working_on_a_new_update/) a software update for those buggy Lumia 930 screens, we are still waiting. This happened a month ago, and still nothing.  All they can do right now [is "feel" and "hope"](https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/560042370251505667) and tell you to [wait](https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/553279308559417345).  This is not a rage against Microsoft, since i really wanted (and still want) to like Lumia 930 very much, i really like Windows Phone and i don't/didn't want to buy an Android or iOS phone. It's just my disappointment for all those defects (screen is one of my problems, the most serious one).  I'm going to wait a few weeks more, for a fix/optimization with an update or with Windows 10. If nothing happens, i'll just request/demand a screen/phone replacement and never buy a Windows Phone again.  As i [wrote](https://twitter.com/test_subject3791gr/status/560044091522568192) on Twitter   @LumiaHelp Sorry, you are a company, we paid much money for those phones. You don't just "feel" and "hope", you do and solve asap  Otherwise, make no promises.  edit - spelling    , "",  template  .      .  	129
 Probably March, too - there's really not much coming out in those months that's big enough to beat Star Wars   He said no because he was concerned over how big of a deal it was, and that he was unsure if he wanted to risk making a bad movie and disappointing everyone.  Abrams is a lifelong Star Wars fan, I doubt he would turn that down because it took up too much time.   That Luke one was released yesterday, and it is a very obvious fake from that picture of Mark Hamill with his beard. Reverse the "leaked image," and put it next to the Hamill one.   Nope, that's gonna be Rogue One - why else would they choose to not have Marvel at a *comic* convention and put Star Wars instead? Something big is coming.   Yeah :(   Seriously?? Where?   Cleaned it up a little... Not my best work, but good enough  http://imgur.com/nr7IoHa   Most likely from trailer 3   In reality, all this does is create more hype for the movie. Two screenshots that give away very little information won't make that much of a difference to them.   It does to the countless number of people who do care about star wars   No, I followed, but I have my facts, and you have your wrong opinions. That's okay.   Mad Max, Interstellar...   Too bad Star Wars is gonna be there :)   You know what, I don't even know why I bother.  http://imgur.com/zlyH2VQ   You have absolutely no idea what has happened in the 30 year gap between the films.  Also, what's with you using the term "mulatto?" I forget, are we living in racially segregated Alabama in the 1960s or is this 2015?   THERE ARE OTHER JEDIS IN THE UNIVERSE.    Well, you proved me wrong. I really appreciate you taking the time to find that direct quote and showing me how you were right this whole time.  :/   Why not? Give me facts. Give me a quote from someone that definitively says that, "Finn is not a Jedi." Has the movie come out yet? No. Have you seen the movie? No. You have literally no way of knowing any of this.   Looks pretty shopped to me   To keep it interesting, to change things up, to make the story better, to give new and talented actors a chance to try things, to challenge the assumptions that people have about who is who, etc. Pretty simple.   http://imgur.com/Zqiz8jR  You see that? That was art of Finn's costume officially shown at the official Star Wars celebration. What's that in his pocket? A lightsaber. They were *very* deliberate in what they chose to show, so there's absolutely no way that that's not a hint of some kind.   Exactly how I like to look at it - or decades! Only 1/20th of a decade until it comes out!   TL;DR - Literally nothing.   Well, it is actually. It's like calling Pulp Fiction a cult classic, when it's really well known, critically acclaimed, and pretty successful.   I think you might be one of the only people with that opinion, no offense.   It made enough money to qualify as successful and it got good reviews. Not exactly overshadowed.    fucking condescension   A lot more condescending than what OP said. Besides, why would you need someone to prove you wrong on an opinion? Isn't that what opinions are for?   It has nothing to do with how good/bad of an adaptation it is, it's just a poorly written, somewhat badly acted movie. It's just not good filmmaking.   It's incredibly well directed. Stanley Kubrick is pretty much known for being able to direct things well.   We're only 6 months away from the release of Star Wars The Force Awakens!   Foxcatcher?   I don't have a picture of the page, but this is the figure:  http://imgur.com/JjaIQgS   It has a waaayy better lineup of first party games, and it had a lot more innovative features, no matter what you say about their quality.    http://imgur.com/fcG4W5A  Not on the page it was originally posted to   The comment said "I can't wait for 9/11" (when Mario maker comes out), but that could be confused to mean something else    Just because the consoles don't sell well, doesn't mean they're bad. The Wii U is a fantastic piece of hardware, and I would take it any day over an XBone or PS4   I guess this is confirmation that it's real    What's wrong with Spielbergian? If anything I'd take that as a complement...   Me too :(   Nope, not really. Alec Guiness does not lose any of our respect after his death.   You still refer to King George III as King George III, even though he's dead.   Tarantino has nowhere near as wide of an appeal   Not on the same scale as Star Wars or Jurassic World or The Avengers   Well, I thought so. But, y'know, sarcasm is a little hard to communicate over the interwebs. A /s might help.   I hope that's sarcasm   I doubt Daisy Ridley will, but maybe John Boyega   He backed himself into a corner there didn't he   Or you could just eat one piece at a time with your hands   That's a little excessive. What if someone told you they didn't like the way you talked, so they just cover their ears when you open your mouth? It's stupid, and doesn't really make much sense.   No, I wouldn't mind having more Star Wars trilogies - it's just that you spew a constant stream of BS.   Can you stop?   Yeah, I've seen most of those - now that I think about it, Dr. Strangelove would probably work pretty well. Thanks!   Yeah, that's one of the ones I was thinking of.   Ok   Today was really disappointing.   Watch some of their other stuff. Trust me, this was their worst review in a while.         July 10th, when we'll most likely get it, is less than a month away - that's not far off!   Wait what?   No one is interested in low budget foreign risky science fiction action drama mystery prison break fantasy wizard films anymore  Source: have a degree in filmoeconomical studies from Harvard Universiteny    You know you can just buy the toys if you just ask   Not KotOR 3   Possibly - it could refer to a person, as in *the* rogue one   STOP IT WITH THE FROSTBITE! WE GET IT! IT LOOKS GOOD!   But no one said the movie centered around X Wing pilots   What does it feel like being one of the best gamers in the world?   It's a rare phenomenon, that has occurred a few times in the past few months, most notably at the release of Star Wars 7 Teaser 2, Fallout 4 announcement, and Fallout 4 release date confirmation. It is expected to happen again at the gathering known as "San Diego Comic Con," where new and exciting information about games and movies alike will be unveiled.   Hateful 8's December/January dude   You're entitled to your opinion, but that doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong. If the general public likes something that you  don't, it's probably something that makes a lot of people happy and something that they can enjoy.    Mother 3 is coming to America! ... Eventually... Hopefully...   Yeah - I really hope I can see it that way someday   One of the only movies I can think of that's almost perfect   Mkay   Haha she can't sit through a 2 hour movie but she makes an exception for a 4 hour one :P   /uj Well, it's probably going to turn out to be true /uj   Huh, that's weird.  I think that might be an extra blaster on the side.   I need no sympathy   Could be... Looks pretty legit  http://imgur.com/Hx9Ei7c   Well, I think it has a lot of redeeming qualities. It's certainly a competently made movie, and Steven Spielberg almost never fails to make an enjoyable/watchable film. I like how it mirrors a 50s sci-fi b-movie, which is a different take on what the Indiana Jones series usually is.   No, didn't say you ruined my day. I was just saying you were making unnecessarily rude comments to those who thought there was no reason to make a post like the one you did...   Well, he's a competent filmmaker, and he wanted to do it. Being friends with Spielberg was only an added benefit, I'm sure.   Here you go. These are just the first few that I thought of. Don't go with the assumption that every pre-1960 movie is a wacky Three Stooges-esque screwball comedy   Citizen Kane Casablanca  Paths of Glory Ben-Hur The Bridge on the River Kwai The Wizard of Oz Singin' in the Rain 12 Angry Men Gone with the Wind It's a Wonderful Life Rear Window North by Northwest Vertigo Metropolis Seven Samurai Anatomy of a Murder Some Like it Hot On the Waterfront Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Snow White and the Seven Dwarves      Oh I'm sorry we're all being such babies complaining about how you posted useless speculation regarding a movie you've seen *3 times* in 4 weeks.   Yeah, but you ask the question like most movies from pre-1960 are like that, which is not true.    The Man Who Knew Too Much   No... That's not true! THATS IMPOSSIBLE!   Thats *your,* idiot   That's a bit of a stretch.   Almost like saying, "Harrison Ford in plane crash = foreshadowing Han's death," or "Peter Mayhew old = Chewbacca dies"   No, Riggan also directed and wrote the adaptation of the play   "What pre-1960 film is still watchable?" What kind of question is that? Which ones *wouldn't* be watchable?   God I know - I don't know if my body will be able to handle it    Good point   Seems a little more believable than most of the stuff on here   So, all the millions of people that like Star Wars are neckbeards? And you expect not to get negative comments from people who disagree with your unpopular opinion?   Yeah - Rogue One is December 16th, 2016 and I think Episode 8 is May 26th 2017 - Anthology 2 is confirmed for 2018, and Episode 9 for 2019   By David Lean? On every level, David Lean's movies are almost perfect. Have you ever seen The Bridge on the River Kwai, or Lawrence of Arabia, or Doctor Zhivago? Replace that with Middle Earth.   Imagine how great a David Lean Star Wars or LotR movie would've been...   No - Netflix usually puts complete seasons of shows months after they air    What? Nimoy, Lee, and Brooks? I certainly hope not. I don't know if I'd be able to live with myself anymore :(   Shows from most major networks the next day? That's pretty good if you ask me.   I'm sure that's what's coming.   It could be a really cool comic    And Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation will have come out by August, so I would think Star Wars at D23 will be Rogue One   Episode 7 was printed on all the signs outside the studio in England and on the crew member clothing    Well, it's not up to the general audience and JJ Abrams to decide what's canon - the books are, and there's nothing you can do about it. It doesn't matter who cares about it, it's up to the people at the Lucasfilm Story Group.   I guess they don't want to spoil anything - it could mean bad reviews, but you never know.  The fan reaction has been pretty much positive though. It supposed to be the best of the sequels by far, and I can't imagine that there's anything explicitly wrong with it to make it *bad*.   Oh gawd it seems so far...   No I totally understand   	109
 So sarcastic and passive aggressive. You must have a really well-groomed vagina. You sorry saps are doing this to yourself, bitching like a bunch of children. I'm just calling it like I see it, but hey, if you want to join in the circle-jerk of useless whining, be my guest. Not mine or any other man'd fault that you feel inferior. Here's a tip though - doing this dear diary high-school shit on reddit isn't going to help you feel better about yourself or life here on planet-motherfucker. Good luck. I hope you can work through your neuroses and emotional problems. Be a real women or man, and face up to that shit. No one wants to deal with an adult child.    Clearly you didn't read what I wrote. It's ok though. I'm sure commiserating with your fellow hens in the sewing circle has elevated you oh so much in their eyes, and has contributed much to your well-being, never mind how pathetic this drivel sounds, and how it benefits neither sexes, nor does anything to demonstrate emotional maturity in a man. Most of you sound like chicks bitching about your so-called friends because you are too afraid to confront them, and you aren't man enough to deal with your own feelings, whatever that may entail. Frankly, it's pathetic and disgusting. Thank gosh for te anonymity of the Internet.    This post is retarded.  It's cancer.  What are we, a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order?  Do you guys not have balls?  Do you feel the need to hate on your fellow man to elevate yourself, as if you're some chick in the sewing circle?   I hate people who answer and thus give credence to this sort of trash, and what I hate are the obnoxious and stupid characteristics that are common in most people, sexes be damned.   Yep, but I hear you on the spelling/attention thing.  But even in professional fields, the standards of grammar and even things like basic sentence structure and all manners of other elements have gone to complete shit, or at least it seems that way sometimes.  Attention to details are important, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people don't pay attention, be it on their resumes, their e-mails, their text messages, or to their own goddamn life and what they are feeling and how they deal with it, period  :D   Keep up the good fight though.  I myself would allow for no more than one, two typos max on a resume ;)   Honestly, nothing. Men are pretty damn great. Namely, what I hate are characteristics that are common in most people, namely stupidity, willful ignorance, solopsism, and unnecessarilly catty bull-shit like this stupid post.   What I'm saying is, I hate the kind of douche-bag that would answer this, like he's some lost fucking hen who is quite low in the pecking order. The emotionally retarded and immature type of people who aren't man enough to deal with their own feelings, whatever that entails.   Honestly - what are we here?  A bunch of fucking women?   Edit:  seriously. Fuck this post.  It's cancer.    But there are so many, with so many nuances, that's why people specialize in just one field of it, and are hired to exploit the system and find loop-holes in said system...   But can't we all just get along?  Treat everyone the way you want to be treated!  Ad nauseum!   Either way, this is totally exciting me!   Awww, you didn't hire him?  But what forethought and clarity of purpose!  He would have surely been a great asset to your team!   Fuck yeah!  Kim is one of my fav porn stars!   You nailed a good few of them.  I'd add Whitney Cummings, and about most of the other American female comedians out there, among a bunch of the guys as well :D   You have good taste my friend.  May you be blessed by Patton Oswalt and his over-rated fat-ass being hit by Whitney Cummings plane as it crashes down from the sky.   I love that guy, but there was a point in one of his own specials where he even seemed to be sick or tired of working that schtick.  His broader, farther-reaching bits about humanity, social interaction, human connectivity, and the paints of being a parent are all solid and hillarious though.  Worth noting, saw him live, and with not much material on the former, he was fucking hillarious.  Probably the hardest I've ever laughed in my life :D   Not just that, but she's super fucking lame and her material is absolute shit...     He is/was a comedian? :P   Don't forget a lot of American female comedians as well...  they're just...not funny.   Eh, if popculture and Itunes have taught us anything, it's never underestimate the public's ability to gulp down copious amounts of shit-stained swill.  I wouldn't bet on it.   Your tub!?  That's her tub too buddy!   But he was doing you a favor?   What a great way to attract talent!  Don't mind the colorful language and boob-grabbing!   So many crushed dreams, so many idiots...   Was he qualified?  I mean, while I can appreciate cheekiness on either side of the table, it seems a lot of arbitrary standards, bias, opinions, and negative experiences and conditioning get in the way of the interview process, which sort of makes you sound like an ass-hole :D   Book smart?  That's just a term stupid people use to justify their lack of smarts :D   But look at her willingness to do dirty jobs and take on huge problems that are seemingly impossible to her!  Clearly she would have been an all-star employee!  Tell me you hired her!   But, if you had a sense of humor, would you have hired him?  :P   Cuz hell yeah for teen pregnancy and shitty, immature parents :D   They had their eyes on the prize!  Clearly they were a focused individual!  How could you not hire them!?   Dude!  How could you not have hired him?  Clearly he shows creativity and innovation when it comes to solving problems!  As for the rest?  Well, he doesn't give a fuck!   It sure seems there are a lot of stupid, ignorant, strange, and lazy people on the interviewee side of the table, but I'd like to hear about the idiots on the other side.  Thanks in advance for your replies :)   Well, I can't speak on that, but if you're posting related materials/comments in perfectly suitable posts and sub-forums, then the moderators have no business perma-banning someone.  Judging by the way they are quick to ban people for seemingly no good reason without giving said people a chance to explain anything (as if it should be needed in some of these cases), I'd say they have itchy trigger-fingers.   Whoa...just, whoa... on all of that D:   Such dedication though!   Project 1999 as a game is pretty great, but Honestly, whoever regulates those forums seem to be completely humorless and unaware of appropriate context and forum topics. I was banned within a few hours of posting a few comments that were completely in-line and relevant to the topics I was replying too. It seems they are power-hungry control freaks who have a hard time understanding people, language, context, etc. don't take it personally, but that forum is kinda fucking stupid :)   What if he really is the best - and you missed out on an opportunity to hire an amazing worker?   That being said, yes, he sounds like a dick, but I love how little nuances and things that those who are hiring choose to take offense at are so subjective and dependent on their own experiences and bias.  I wonder how many people who would be perfect fits at certain jobs and companies wind up being passed over because the hiring manager/HR/boss/whatever chose something asinine to be annoyed at, or projected their own personal issues onto the hiree  :D   Wow...  just wow.  Couldn't you have told them both to get off the planet period, and fired them from their sorry attempts at being human beings?  You would have done us all a great favor  :D   Hey, you'd be upset too if you had semen in your eye!   Bwahahahaha.  Simpsons did it first anyhow.  Your day:  0  Me:  1   That's what he gets for trying to steal your TV!   "My doctorate is in Art History."  *- Dr. John Zoidberg*   I'd opt for less vitality and go for 15 arcane, as the hunter's tools are awesome for PvP and PvE (specially beast roar), as well as a bit more skill.    Perfect for costume parties, or murdering people in the early AM hours of the morning!  Absolutely frightening!   Yeah, I just noticed that yesterday as a matter of fact - yes they are.  From the side-views of those attack animations you can see them fairly clearly and easily.  Between that, and the wintern lanters' brains being composed of seemingly dead messengers, it seems that a lot of the nightmare creatures are somehow made out of twisted/perverted messengers, which leads me to believe the messengers are messengers of the MP or some other great one, and since the great ones seem to have different methods and goals, that the Mensis school likely experimented or flat out somehow enslaved and warped some of the messengers, somehow.   TIL that god is an asshole that likes to destroy churches.  Consequently, TIL to stay the hell out of churches.   TIL that Muslims who don't even live in the middle east are still simple-minded, short-sighted, self-centered assholes with stupid concerns and beliefs.   Wow.  What a bunch of presumptuous assholes of so-called friends.  You don't need stupid people like that in your life.  That being said, stop trying to buy/impress friends in that manner.   Wait, what?  What bridge wolves?   LOL   "Being fucking late to every fucking thing fucking ever."  (Because she is late for everything, because she has to stop and clean or change the order of the throw pillows on the couch :)   It looks like full metal alchemist meets dead space meets bloodborne? :D   Actually, no.  I was much more specific than you, namely in regards to maximizing the potential of the physical/arcane split weapons.  But, you're welcome.  BLEAAAAAAAAAARGHEEVOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITREGURGITATIONEBLEAAAAAAARGH!   24 Episodes is fine with me for any series, really.  I mean, especially the way anime tends to draw itself out and all :D  Will definitely check this out.   Uuuuh, what show is that?  I need to watch it!   Those split arcane weapons are not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, they are meant to be maxed via the +% physical and flat arcane damage gems, as their base arcane damage is super low.   That being said, it isn't awkward, you just have to have the uncanny burial blade (cuz the regular one with waning gem slot sucks), and you can take that AR upwards of 600 relatively easy, and that is with regular depth 5 chalice drops, not the more rarer, top-of-the-line rank 20 gems or abysmal gems from bosses.  The BoM are even more OP with those odd gems, because it hits like a truck, and it hits super fast.   That being said, the problem is, it is way more work and effort to do all that, rather than say, get a ludwigs which is basically OP out the gate, even with mediocre % physical gems on it.  Plus, it can be enchanted.  This is why everyone likes and uses ludwigs - because it is easy to obtain, and easy to increase the damage with little to no chalice farming or work.  It's a total bummer that certain builds and weapons in this game are so lop-sided when it comes to optimizing them and staying competitive :(   Riflespear is fun as shit to play with, but it is very mediocre in damage, hell, even reach, unless you are talking about the riflespear bug, which is bad to base a more permanent build around, since it will likely be fixed via patch soon enough.  I used the riflespear exclusively on my BT and SKL build characters until I obtained better weapons in late game (cuz I hate the cane), and again, while distinct and fun, the riflespear is easily outclassed in both range and damage by the axe, or ludwigs, and most anything else.  That, and if you are talking about the riflespear bug, it will likely take him awhile to get to a place to farm the correct gems to make it bugged/OP.   Right. And the arcane scaling on the split weapons is shit and not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, and you gimp the split weapons if you only put %physical gems on them as well.  those weapons are meant to be boosted using the gems I mentioned, as the arcane stat itself makes almost no difference on them.   The split weapons aren't suppose to be turned into pure arcane either, because they have low base arcane damage and scaling in the first place, and wind up just as gimpy if you try to use them that way.   Edit:  the tonitrus is optimized via elemental damage gems, which are a lot harder to farm. Or at least, more obnoxious.    Edit 2:  to be clear, I'm trying to tell you why those split weapons are the way they are, and how an and how to properly utilize their stats.    Actually, the corect gems for BoM and Burial blade are the +phys % and +flat arcane.  You can make your Burial blade 600+ AR easily this way, and same thing with BoM.  That is how those should be gemmed correctly.   I got the perfect build for you.  It's bad-ass, sturdy, gives you access to all those tools you mentioned, and you can make several weapons ridiculously OP (though for burial blade, you need to get the uncanny version to be able to put in all +phys % gems and flat arcane damage, as the waning gem slots suck ass).  That being said, Rosmarinus wouldn't be the focus here, as you will top off at 15 arcane, though you could move the stats around, but 25 end is good to be able to use the different weapon combos out there.  Anyway, here is the awesome OP build that makes you shine for quality weapons and SKL weapons, but you could also viably use some STR weapons just for the hell of it if you didnt want to be too op:  40 Vit  25 End  25 STR  50 SKL  5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P  15 ARC   There is your 110 build if you start with Cruel Fate (has only 5 blood tinge).  You can adjust the Vit/end/SKL to your liking, but with this build and the correct weapons and gems, you can have a 650-700 AR Burial Blade, a 600 AR BoM, and a 850-950 AR Ludwig's (stupid, right?) with the phantasm shell.  Have fun!   Edit:  Thanks to my mate here on reddit who showed me how ridiculously awesome this quality build is :D     He is the only truly altruistic character in the story, and he says as much, dialogue along the lines of "I only wanted to help," and something about his family telling him he was wrong.  He is just a genuinely friendly, creepy, dude.   Which is a shame, cuz it's a fun weapon to use.  I used it exclusively until I got the burial blade and BoM on my skill build, cuz I hate the cane    How many hundreds of hours did you play DaS2?  :P   Funny, for being such a terrible game, all the FROM fans still played it more than any other game out there.  The best way to put it is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, but it is not a fantastic FROM game :D   It looked pretty damn good on my PC.  That being said, what all the DaS2 whiners meant (even after they played the game for hundreds and thousands of hours, and ejoyed it) is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, and it was still game of the year in 2014, but it is the least souls-like of the souls games.  It is a great RPG game, just not a great FROM game :D   Fuck all the whiners.  They still played it more than any other game out there, they still put 100's to 1000's of hours on it, and it was still the best game of 2014, hands down.  No other game, even AAA, had the same replayability and diversity DaS2 had, especially for PvP.  I love how people will say, "it's a terrible game, I only played it for 1000 hours"...  like, really?  What the fuck dude?     But I get what they mean.  What all the DaS2 whiners are trying to say (and the best way to put it is), DaS2 is the best RPG game of all the Souls games, but it is the least Souls-like of all the souls games, or at least, the most deficient of the souls games when it comes to all the little quirks and nuances that made the souls games great.   That being said, DaS2 easily has the best PvP and matchmaking of all the games (aside soul memory), and definitely has the best variety in terms of weapons/armor (even if it is redundant), but even that is great, as the fashion options are spectacular!   Hahaha.  Yep.  when I think Oedipus complex, I think of children wanting to bang their mothers...   LOL   I hope they do fix it, as I love this wepaon and find it very fun to play with it, even though without the bug, it is kinda weak compared to other weapons, it can still be pimped out quite nicely :D   That being said, like any other obviously OP or broken shit, I don't see it as a matter of will they fix it, but when will they fix it?  :D   Haha.  He sucked and died, in that order :D   The DLC in DaS was cut content that they just didn't have time to put in the original game, and that content was fantastic and worth it's entertainment dollar a hundred times over.  The DLC in DaS2 went hand-in-hand with the story, but I still think it was more of an after-thought (or at least, not like it was going to be implemented in original game), BUT, the DLC for DaS2 was the highlight of the game, with some of the best game-design and challenging bosses and some great new items and weapons.   The point is, I will buy DLC for Bloodborne in a heart-beat, whether it was intended content that was cut due to time-constraints, or an after-thought :D   Yeah - I hear ya on the checklist thing.  After a while it becomes mechanical, especially when you've done them on more than one character.  I actually enjoy creating my own due to the mystery of them, or trying out other people's glyphs, but the story-line chalices became redundant the second time around.  At the least, I would have enjoyed some different tile sets and lay-outs, or even more interesting would have been a wave-like enemy arena or boss challenge.  I think that would have fit just fine into the game, and really showcase the enemies as well as the player characters :D   So OP!   There is an enemy in the guide called "Izzy's admirer," though I can't remember who it was for.  I think it was an NPC hunter...   On my first NG ever I was able to stunlock him to death with a hunter's axe and 20 stamina.  I dont think he even had a chance to attack.  Same thing went on my BoM run.  Guy is ridiculously easy and under-powered, especially for being such a burly looking monster.  I wish he was as challenging as he looks :/   Really?  I didn't know you could die to this guy?  Not trying to be a smart-ass, but I thought this was a terrible boss fight due to how easy he is.  Seriously, if you just look at him he becomes stunlocked :D    I still felt bad killing her.  Even as a beast, she is kinda pretty and majestic.  Also, feel free to use "Ron the Funky Caterpillar" too :D   There should be a "you're gonna die," emote, or at the least, something like "careful, this aint NG" :D   Yep.  To me she is the Reindeer Beast of Christmas Past :D   Bingo. My guess is they'd need a larger amount of time to change it more than they did in making the gameplay swifter, yet still weighty. I love the game as well, and the only bad part is that the superb level design hides how short the game really is. Chalice dungeons are pretty cool, and a great feature overall, but I just wish they had time for more tile sets :D   Yes, for other content, not game-changing mechanics.  Don't start the blind hype-train all over again...   I agree for the most part, and fuck all that blind-hype-train crap people got all worked up over anyhow.  Disapointment is what happens when you have blind, unfounded expectations.  A lot of it seemed too complicated and convoluted and exclusive anyhow.   That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :(   What's that you say?  You miss losing more and more of your HP meter like in Dark Souls 2?  :D   Yep.  And that dissapointment is what people get for hopping on the blind-ass hype-train.  Don't know why people chose to believe in that shit and actually put their expectations on it in the first place :/   Well, as far as I can tell, that was all speculation, and people blindly got on the hype-train, and surprise surprise when FROM didn't have some sort of in-depth transformation mechanic and covenant system, especially to the degrees that players expected it.     And it's funny that people somehow expected these crazy covenants and transformations and blood mechanics, yet what we wound up is the most hands-off, lamest, shallow and bland covenant systemto date :/   All that being said, it's still the best game of 2015 so far, and likely will stay that way, and hey, at least Play Station 4 has one good game on it :)   Eh, that's what happens when people got on the speculation hype-train with no proof.  Even if those were the original ideas (which I don't think they were) it would have probably been far too ambitious, and be super hard to balance, and who needs balance when you have ludwig's holy blade anyhow? :D   My thoughts:  if that was indeed the case and the idea (as I thought all that was just speculation, and not actually from FROMsoft), it was probably too ambitious, and they had to simplify it quite a bit :/   You're welcome.  Have fun :D   You can't just create any random dungeon glyph (even with all necessary materials) unless you've already created a dungeon of that specification.  So if you wanted to make a 'cursed ihyll' of a specific glyph, you first have to make a 'cursed ihyll' of your own.     Provided you have all the materials you need, you go to a blank gravestone, use 'condust chalice ritual,' option, and make the parent dungeon.  Once that dungeon is created, then you can go to another gravestone and then you can use the 'find glyph' option or whatever it's called to look up the specific dungeon you wanted to run, and you can create it, all without having to use your own materials.   So, if you wanted to run a specific 'cursed loran' glyph, you couldnt create a 'cursed isz' dungeon and expect to access cursed loran, but if you did create a cursed isz dungeon of your own, you could access any cursed isz chalice glyph out there by looking it up the same way mentioned above via glyphs.   Lastly, supposedly if you create a parent dungeon of your own, with all offerings, you can access any and ALL combination of those offerings via glyphs.  So if you created a cursed/fettid/rotten Ihyll, you could join any ihyl glyph, even if it was only 'cursed and fettid.'   Good luck~   Have you created a chalice with those specifications already (ie, cursed/fetid/rotten)?  You have to create a chalice of that type already first, and then you can pull up the glyphs that fall under it, without having to spend your own chalice materials.   Yeah. Tiny tonitrus us can be pretty color though, and te cheap 15 ones (shell and paw) are definitely worth it.    Or how complicated the races and their primarily religious emotions and other factors are :/   Have you ever been to jail?  All these tough ass motherfuckers for all their street cred who act like bad-asses immediately start bitching to their baby-sitters, the deputies, saying shit like,  "I need a band-aid"   "I need to be taken out of general because I stubbed my toe"   "I need to schedule a doctor's appointment because I spilled my milk"   I dont say this to justify the negligence on behalf of the cops, but put yourself in their shoes for a second and know that they hear all these tough guys who cop to their crimes to their fellow thugs turn into instant pussies as they try to escape the consequences of their actions, and it happens everyday, all the time.  And of course, for the street-cred, they did it, but to the cops and authority figures, they are all innocent!   Yep. These open-minded, sheltered kids love to tell you to be open-minded and not racist from the safety of the ivory towers their parents paid for :D   Yep. It shows as much as its fatally-flawed idealistic, white-bred, well-funded, open minded liberal hipster yuppie bull-shit does. Respect people, for they are equal, I say from my sheltered, ivory tower that my parents paid for.    Racism itself is as old as man himself. Reddit is not classical. It is new, and racism is not unique to reddit...   We still calling them protestors?  Lets go even further PC with it and call them 'disadvantaged urban socio-economically oppressed urban societal victims.'   Yep. Maybe they chose that since arcane gives you more ranged attacks with the hunter's tools?  Either way. I don't like it. Optimizing builds shouldn't be so lop-sided - easy for physical, obnoxious and redundant for most everything else.  It should be equally challenging/easy/hard/redundant.    Ah, that's why.  I've only completed the glyphs I've done with two of the three rites.  I think I've yet to complete a depth 5 with all three rites (as I've just used them for farming regular gems and what not).   And yes, I don't prefer this method either.  Granted, a few extra points can be negligble, especially to skilled players, still having a lot of apparently base-line-needed gems for certain weapons being so far away and hard to get is stupid imo (again, thinking those %+flat arcane gems for BoM/burial blade).   Right.  I've read up on a lot of the posts about ranges, and it being similar to invading further upwards beyond the original DaS equation (akin to DaS2), but even then, I know there are a lot of stubborn people sticking to 50-80, but I suppose that is why a lot of us make multiple characters at multiple ranges :D   But I also have the urge to make a new character anyhow, because I enjoy creating them, and I have this really bad-ass Lemmy Kilmister character model saved that I want to employ as more of a main character, as I have thoroughly been enjoying the SKL build, but I think it would be fun to bring the STR up to 25 for additional weapon usage.  I know my other toon would be a good template, but I might just leave him where he is.  His face is kinda ugly :D   Right, but all the work to get that far and farm that much at chances to even get an abysmal gem, let alone one with perfect stats, for just one weapon?  Well, that is why people flock to using Ludwig's sword, because it is OP real quick with minimal investment in the game or farming, and it's bad-ass even with the base game gems.     I'm super annoyed and dissapointed in how FROM made competitive weapon optimizing so lop-sided, and it's a total bummer that they made it so hard to maximize a lot of weapon's potential (ie, the uncanny burial blade, as the waning slot ruins the base-line model).     I mean, I have multiple characters, and I've farmed a lot of chalices, and I have yet to see an abyssmal gem period    Edit:  And that's not to say it shouldn't take farming/work/effort/frustration/redundancy to optimize our theoretical top-shelf OP Tonitrus that we've been discussing, but it's a lot of work to make simple/earlier game weapons shine, like the BoM and later the Burial Blade, and use it to its max :/   An be a dex fag?  No whay!   I have a few PvP builds, and the most current/closest one I am using is similar to yours, though I had planned it to be primarily dex, but I wanted to make a quality build anyhow, so now I just feel like I could have the best of both worlds on one toon.  Anyway, Nathan Explosion is level 98, and his stats are:  45 Vit (I think, might be 44 or 46)  22 End  12 STR  50 SKL  8 BT (whatever starter stat was)  15 Arc   I mean, I could easily adjust it to make it closer to a quality build, but I think anything over 100-110 is too high, as it cuts out a lot of meta-ranges in PvP, and is frankly just unnecessary, as I enjoy focused builds where you have to sacrafice some power/expertise over others.   RACISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSM!  You're so racist!  Stop justifying brutal america's crooked cops purposefully oppressing the socio-economically disenfranchised urban youths!   Just kdiding.  In all seriousness, so sick of the politically-correct bull-shit and people who choose to sympathize with stupid and ignorant people.  But hey, who needs to change when you have the perfect, perpetual victim card?  Change aint a one-way street.   Here's another reply for you:  Bolt (and fire) scaling works off arcane, right?  Have you tried optimizing the Tonitrus on your quality build?  How do the stats and the damage look with nore STR than arcane?  If you have tested it out for max damage on that build, what's gems have you used so far, and what does the final damage output look like?   And now I want to build a new character based on your quality build, as it sounds like it optimizes a lot of weapons and can make for a very diverse character... but man oh man, running all those chalices again...  :(   My Skill build is at 98, and close to this, with a few less end, a few more vit points, and only 12 STR.  It is tempting to move him towards this quality direction and open up so many more options on who and what is my favorite character, but I really don't want to level him up any more :(   Yeah.  I don't think I've seen gems like that, though I could check on my main to see if he has anything remotely close, though he is mostly retired.   Anyway, I ask because I wanted to make a quality build for PvP to have access to a variety of weapons (as variety is what has always made the souls games fun as fuck), yet remain competitive - so I wanted to use ludwig's (which I never really liked that much), the cleavers, and hearing that tonitrus can be pretty bad-ass on a quality build makes me happy as well :D   But first, I need to go find me an uncanny burial blade, and then I need %/flat arcane gems with less shitty negatives, and then, another blood rock... ugh.  Sometimes I really hate how they did rocks and weapon variants in this game    What does the damage look like on tonitrus with the %phys/flat arcane gems?  Seems like it could really shine on a STR build.   I've been farming those flat arc gems, but so far no luck, because I keep getting the shitty -HP gems, though the few -kin/beast damage are great for PvP.   Do you use the regular burial blade with its shitty waning slot, or do you use an uncanny burial blade?  Or  As it seems it would be able to possibly pump out the most damage (2 radial and a triangle gem slot) since triangle gems come as +9% physical with the +70 flat arcane damage, whereas, it's hard to find a decent waning gem for the burial blade, or at least, so far it has been, and I have that 18% physical gem found in the main game on it.  	105
 what's the difference between hot sauce and spicy ketchup?   I heard white belts are just tossed in with the rest of the crowd and expected to survive at the same pace as everyone else in BJJ schools and that for the first few months - you don't really learn much. Is this true? If so... it really de-motivates me to try and learn BJJ. I learn better through a more organized, progressive curriculum. :/  Can anyone give me some insight?   If they were professional, they should have attempted to control this out-of-line cop.   Why didn't the other cops try to stop him from having a power trip?      Hey guys you just gotta think of how many times this shit happens but it's undocumented so we never hear of it.   Small man syndrome.   That roll... who the hell does he think he is - 007?   Did you mostly train Judo for Sport or self defense?   Yeah. For all he know he might've gone to practice twice a year.   Stretching helps a lot with soreness especially after practice.   They really give out free alcohol at art museums?   AHHHHHHHHGHHHGHGHGHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK OH MY GOD   Dang, you got downvoted a lot.   I thought Petite meant skinny/thin/slender not short?

That's a really good analogy. So what actual importance do grades serve?    Really??   Thank you, friend. Happy Cake Day.   The Flash   As in around 70% for every class.

Damn, what BJJ school do you go to that his workout machines too? Your tuition must be pretty pricey.   Very informative and thorough post! I agree with your points. Thanks for your contribution to the thread, friend. Best of luck in your fitness goals.   Me (In my head) - "WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING? WHAT HAVEN'T I BEEN DOING? I EAT MORE GODDAMN PROTEIN EVERY DAY THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR EATS BEFORE IT HIBERNATES. I'VE BEEN HITTING THE WEIGHTS LIKE I JUST STARTED A LIFE SENTENCE IN PRISON AND MY VERY SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON GETTING SWOLE. I AM A FUCKING BEAST.   (What I actually said) - "Oh you know. Diet and exercise. Gotta stay fit. Thanks for noticing."  Fucking real. Stay humble you beast.   Would you say Stronglifts 5x5 coupled with carefully tracking your daily calories would be a good strength/mass program?   How would you recommend someone looking to make "big" progress doing a cardio-based program that incorporates weights such as P90X?   Do you think gradual progress through upping up the weight throughout the course would've made a big difference for these people assuming their diets were just the same as whatever they ate and drank in these 90 days?   As in they probably just stuck to using the same weight of dumbbells throughout the whole course?    So, basically Cardio while eating at maintenance will not make you leaner? I figured that if you ate at maintenance and did cardio at the same time, the cardio would burn off enough calories for you to be under maintenance at the end of the day and with consistency, you should lose weight and get leaner.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HooRolKCM3s  Before/After results. Is P90X to blame or is it possible they didn't follow through with the program with enough intensity? For some of these people, they actually GAINED weight, Loss Muscle Mass, AND gained bodyfat rather than lose any and make any lbm gains.  EDIT: Also, how can one avoid making no progress in their body while doing P90X?   Lara Lor LeL   "A Billionaire" lolololol so condescending.    I thought Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawk Girl, and Martian Manhunter were the original 7!?

Dude, the fact that you even said this proves the Vietnamese Crabs theory... Do you not see the irony?   I saw no throws here... only bad trips.   Is there an example of this someone can show me?   Artemis or Huntress is Half Viet/White   His arms are unreasonably, irrealistically big.   Wow, thank you so much for your insight, bro. You're motivating me so much right now - I wanna be able to get to your size! Going to the gym right now to get an early start on the day - thanks for all the tips!    Understood, friend. Thanks for the insight. One question though - if I'm starting off with low weight (less than a plate) - would I have to go deeper on my form since the weight will be closer to the ground (for ex: 25s are smaller than a 45 Plate so I would have to go down deeper for it to reach the ground or to pick it up)   Understood, friend! And what would you say is a good ending point for a bulk? Obviously, we have to accept that the muscle gained from a bulk comes with a degree of fat, right? So is there a weight goal that I should set before I cut again? I think you might be able to offer some good insight on this since we're both about the same height.   Thank you for your advice! I will start focusing on eating less, doing more cardio through Martial Arts training, and starting to be consistent on a strength training program. After I see some good definition going on - I'll start working towards a bulk.   If I may ask another stupid question - how long do you think I should give myself before I start working towards a bulk? I'm not sure how long this will take so I don't want to try to "waste" any time per se.   In Stronglifts 5x5, the Barbell Row form is supposed to be set so your upper body is almost completely parallel with the floor with the bar rowed to your chest. I'm more used to the traditional barbell row with the bar rowed to your stomach with your chest up and back arched like so: http://filledfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bent-over-barbell-row.png  Would it be okay to sub what I'm used to in place of Stronglifts' Barbell Row? The form just seems dangerous and difficult and I have a hard time rowing it to my chest which makes me rethink whether or not I'm doing it correctly.   Also, do you think continuing Strong Lifts 5x5 would be good for me?   Understood, thanks for all your advice so far. I really appreciate it.  I'm just afraid, since I'm already pretty skinny, if I go under maintenance - I'm going to look anorexic. Is that a possibility since I don't have much lean muscle mass?   What BF % would you say I'm at right now?  And do you think I should keep below a certain number in order to try and keep it as lean as possible while trying to lean bulk?   My goal is to be a lean 140-145 (basically my current weight but lean) but does that necessarily mean that I would have to bulk up to 165 in order to get the necessary muscle mass to cut down to?   I'm currently starting Stronglifts 5x5. I'm kind of frustrated at my body because I wouldn't say I'm "skinny fat" yet I'm skinny and I have no cuts, no definition whatsoever. My stomach is flat without abs and my arms aren't lean. Not quite sure what I should do because I don't want to bulk because I do Martial Arts and I don't want excess weight to hinder my speed and I don't want to get smaller in order to get cut. Hopefully that makes sense.   Is it possible for me, as a skinny guy (5'7, 139-140 lbs), to lean out while not losing weight? I want to see definition in my abs and arms but I don't want to get smaller.   Will try. :)    Will try. :)   Does it have to do with the body mechanics of the kick itself or am I just at a low level of flexibility?  I can hold and launch a Roundhouse very well above my head height but I struggle to do so with the Side Kick.  EDIT: This is my goal: http://legalpronegotiator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/High-Kick.jpg  Is it obtainable with constant flexibility training or are men naturally limited as opposed to their female counterparts when it comes to the Side Kick due to groin flexibility?   Tbh this.   Holding target loose to avoid strain on arm = kicking force throwing the arm and "hyperextending it"  Holding target tight to avoid arm being thrown when kick hits target = putting strain on forearm and makes veins pop which equal "pain"  I've never heard of such bs.   My friend, who doesn't do martial arts, has been helping me out with my training outside of practice. I just ask him to hold the paddle correctly as I kick it and he complains that it hurts and hyperextends his arm. He also tells me that whenever he holds it while I'm kicking - his veins start showing on his arms and it hurts him.  I can't tell if he's being serious, if I'm somehow inadvertently hitting the target incorrectly to where he's getting injured or if he's just a lousy helper. There's little kids and older adults that hold paddles** for each other and I have **never, ever** heard any of them complain that holding the paddle was hurting their arm. If the kick misfires and hits their actual hand, wrist, or arm then it's understandable. But this... I have never heard of until now.  Edit: Paddles not Padded   I was joking   kendall jenner in the last gif. kim k's sister   Relevant http://i.imgur.com/t2OS8ww.gif   Won't you get sent back in time?   Won't you get sent back in time?   Won't you get sent back in time?   Oh, I definitely agree with you. Or was this a reply to roninsascha? I just thought it was very ironic that he was criticizing the kicking frequency of a Taekwondo practitioner, let alone a Red Belt.   Oh, hey friend. Check this video out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-1-Y4Mnro  This is the same song interpreted in dance by an advanced Taekwondo group known as the K-Tigers since if you were interested in that :)   Definitely not mocking them, but, in my honest opinion - that form at the beginning can be perfected by absolutely anyone with repetition. It definitely doesn't look like they had enough practice for this demonstration.   You didn't catch the White and Green Belts at the beginning of the video? All the kicks and forms are legitimate forms practiced in actual Taekwondo Dojangs but, for the most part - in this scenario, they were executed with bad technique.   This is a great answer.   Don't listen to that guy. lol  I'm sure you kick way more often than he does.   I have the same problem when I practice quick footwork on the mat. I get mat burn on my skin and sometimes it'll peel off and create blisters. When that happens I just wrap my blisters with gauze and tape so I can continue practicing while the blister can heal properly. It'll take awhile but it works for me and it'll work for you too.  As for prevention... I don't quite know the answer to that, tbh. Perhaps wearing in-door TKD shoes?   For a guy that's nearly a Black Belt in Taekwondo, I don't think kicking frequency is the problem. lol   No protection omg   Definitely looked like they didn't rehearsed beforehand at all before performing. :/      Thank you for the explanation.   The super speed also comes with the super tardiness.   But Superboy is also half-human, not full Kryptonian.  That still applies though?   too soon   Superboy is a hybrid clone created by Cadmus as well as Red Arrow (non-hybrid though). However Red Arrow seems to age physiologically while Superboy maintains in youthful apperance throughout the timeskip. It's hinted in the series that Superboy will never appear to age.  My question is, why can Red Arrow age yet Superboy can't despite both being Cadmus clones?    Maybe he wasn't telling a lie but the girl wasn't actually cute.

 I read it years ago, re-read a few (less) years ago, and just re-read it for a third time this year. Truth is, each time was a different experience. There's no question that Vonnegut was a cynical, depressing, misanthropic human being, but I think this book oozes with more of it than any other i can remember.    I'm actually sitting in front of a stack of books right now I tagged with BookCrossing.com labels. I'm taking them with me this weekend and dropping them off at various ice cream and coffee shops I plan to hit.   I first heard of this site about 5 years ago when I found a random Agatha Christie book sitting on a bench outside a CVS in Pennsylvania. Can't say I've participated enough, but I love the idea.    If it's true love, she'll understand.    Agreed. Just crossed the 300 page mark. Couldn't agree more. And normally I feel like I'm pretty good at picking up on subtleties like, "Oh OK, yeah, it's that guy's kid," or...you know...but when we find out about Hassan's origins and the guy with "John Lennon glasses," I was definitely caught off guard.   So long as the ending isn't going to let me down, I can see this easily being a 4 or 4.5 star review.   Uh, can we also talk about your record collection please? I'm insanely impressed.    OP = Stephen A Smith and/or Stephen A Smith's agent.    I have only a few author-dedicated shelves. One is Vonnegut, the other is Hunter Thompson, and of course, Uncle Stephen.    That's a throw the controller, scream out every religious figure's name in vain, kick a baby, smash the TV, jump off a building with tears in your eyes moment.   I'll light a candle for this player.    And from a financial standpoint, try and start at a library book sale too. You can almost always pick up most, if not all, of the series.    Same goal and six behind ya.    Nice picks. Some of my faves on there: A Farewell to Arms, The Great Gatsby, Catch-22, Fahrenheit 451 and All Quiet on the Western Front.  Ever read, "Johnny Got His Gun?" If not, highly recommend it.    I'm at 13.5 right now. Set the goal of 50 back in January. Not entirely sure i'll hit it, but I just closed out a nice run of three in two weeks.   Pirate Latitudes   The Great Train Robbery   Sarah's Key   The Killer Angels   Diary   The Devil in the White City   The Spy Who Came In From the Cold   Wampeters, Foma and Granfalloons   The Giver   The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time   Hyperion   Tales of Ordinary Madness   Breakfast of Champions (re-read for the third time)     The thing I like the most about sci-fi is in trying to imagine the unimaginable. For example, if Stephen King spends seven sentences describing a door to a hotel room, we get it. It's a door. We've seen millions of them and, save for the occasional little detail that an author may WANT us to see, a door is a door.  But when there is a planet, or a spaceship, or a spacesuit, or some sort of weapon - maybe a breathing apparatus - or a creature, or a species or a race or ANYTHING that doesn't exist, the author has to raise the bar a bit and help us envision these things. And there is a little beauty in that too. Again, we all know what a door looks like. But if an author describes a ship in such a way that we can get a bit of an outline, it's up to the reader to color it in. Maybe we pull from a movie we've seen or anther book we've read - or maybe we're forced to imagine something we've never considered.   A door is a door to every reader, but I'd argue the world of sci-fi allows for the chance that 1,000 readers can perceive a spaceship in 1,000 totally different ways.   Just my two cents.    Sorry, but not seeing it.   Perhaps you can join a book club? Maybe, like myself, it helps if it feels more like an "assignment" then just something you do in your leisure.  I applied a similar approach a few years back when I was just in an overall rut in work/life/etc. I joined a creative writing group, a book group that met up weekly (or if I couldn't make it, online forum) and just tried to exercise a different part of my mind. Similar to yourself, I was a voracious reader when I was younger, but it tapered off significantly in college. Now, I find myself in the unenviable position of commuting on a bus one hour each to work, so I tend to invest that time wisely in reading pretty much everything I can get my hands on. And on those days when I'm just not feeling it, I let my head hit the window and pass out for a few minutes. :-)    It's kinda sad to see him talk about how happy he "was" when he was 16/17. Dude was 21, heavyweight champ of the world, and he's talking like a guy who is 50 years old looking back on his teenage days.   He was amazing to watch no doubt, but damn, he was forced to grow up fast.    This is on my short list of books I read in one day. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I recall starting somewhere around 10am on a day during the summer and finishing right before dinner. It was the first one of his I'd ever read.  Went right back to the library, returned it, and proceeded to take out: Misery, The Shining and Salem's Lot.    Who wins the battle of the unfunnies: Peanuts or Garfield?   And Twilight.    Awesome, thanks for the review. I tend to lean more toward NF, especially history-related content like this, so I'll eventually work my way down my ever-growing to-read list.   Thoughts so far? On my to-read list.    **The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini**  One of the many books I've had sitting around for a while that I said I would eventually get to. I'm 180 pages in and I'm mixed with equal parts hatred and sympathy for the protagonist.    Samuel L Jackson. Everything is Samuel L. Jackson.  But really, whenever I see the movie and then read the book, the narrator is the actor from the movie. unfortunately this also holds true to other instances like Jack Nicholson in The Shining. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't picture someone other than him, King's description be damned.    Just went there for the first time in a long time a few weeks back and totally forgot how easy it is to get completely lost there.   	24

 You, I like you.   Me and a few friends got into a conversation about weird middle names. We wanted to see a few!   No, I'm an Anus Explorer. It's not very official, it's kind of a getting paid under the table type job, you know?   Your username is shockingly relevant to my profession.    Requiem for a Dream.   Fuck, this was so beautiful. I love their relationship and the worst things always happened To Jesse. Thanks for showing me this...bitch.      These guys are awesome! Definitely the new favorite. Thanks so much dude its such a hassle finding a new band.    This is helpful, thanks very much. You kind of said everything I couldn't express myself.   I'm 15, and I really want to work at a produce stand/farm. My dad used to be a farmer and has connections to try to get me a job. If anyone has any experience working at a farm at a young age can you tell me what it is like? Is it worth it?      Your lack of legitimacy in your answer in attempts to be funny is very pathetic.    Chronos is the man but I will agree a fed enemy chronos makes you wanna punch a wall.   Wow, really surprised no one said Loki! I despise him and would pick him in a heartbeat, but I feel you guys.     	15

 Happy Holidays!!!   where's the star at the end, bro?   Hm, good point. I figured liquor was an easy fix, but it's probably the best option. Thanks for the tip!    I like it.    I've been working as an assistant for the past year and a half and my boss and I get along great. He's gotten me really cool and thoughtful gifts for both Christmas and my birthday, but for the life of me, I can't think of a good Christmas gift for him.   Any ideas of what I can get a family-man around 45 who loves toys and TV shows?      what a card!      yes.    I'll pay you $30 to eat it.    coooooool   lol!    best.   i sympathize   	13

 Hyrule castle is always a fun build.    The new Transformers. Absolutely horrible film.    Oh that's what you did. I just thought you weren't happy with their service. I get it now.  You are damn clever.    I see what you did there.    That is a great idea. Possible character could be Snowden as well. He could even voice act it. He's not going anywhere.          All of that sounds like something I would be interested in so I will definitely register and get along to the First Timers     	8
 There are actually some people that can smell pregnancy hormones.   They know someone is pregnant because they give off a slightly different natural smell.

 The flakes, right? Takes me back.   All I can picture now is a parent being woken by the sounds of their two kids fighting. They walk into the other bedroom and shut the whole thing down.  "If you two can't share, then no one can have it!"   This is part two. [365 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2r5p41/365_days/)  I left shortly after midnight, following the last patrol rolled away down the street.   I'd have left earlier, but the Ives family had thrown a part rather, they were told to host one. Social interaction is good for us -- good for our morale. Everyone on the block was forced to go, and for whatever reason, the duration of the party was set for over four hours. I did my best to act cheery, but as my watch beeped past 10:00 and 11:00, I started getting nervous. It would take all night to reach the farm on foot, and my absence would definitely be detected first thing in the morning.  Finally released to go back home, I gathered up a few belongings (a change of clothes, bottles of water and an old watch with the location tracking abilities removed) and set off through the brush and trees in my backyard.  The trees soon gave way to abandoned roads and houses growing more and more sparse before falling off altogether. Huge swathes of planted farms stretched to the horizon in every direction, some taller than me. I'd been there a few times before, early on when I'd considered running away. It was how I'd met Jeff. He found me laying in the dirt, staring up at the moon.  The moon. There are people up there, still. Free, independent humans. The last broadcast that I saw from them touted the resilience of man, but we all knew that there weren't enough resources on the rock to make it worth it for the bugs. The bases aren't even visible from Earth, after all, but just knowing that they're up there -- that maybe, just *maybe*, there's someplace left to run to...  The farms are automated now, and run from a central cement bunker where Jeff monitors the motion sensors. It's hard to tell the difference between a person and an animal based on motion alone, but Jeff has gotten very good at detecting patterns and regularities. If something heads in a straight line for too long, he jumps in an old pickup truck and checks it out.   He doesn't mind me going into the fields. He's all alone most of the time, so he actually appreciates the company. In his book I'm crazy for risking it, though. I convinced him to let me stay at the farm until the sun sets again, then I'll continue on to the city. He's got some food stored -- something I wasn't able to do myself, what with them only portioning enough for one day at a time.  The sun was up by the time I reached the bunker. It was shining off of the old pickup's windshield, and casting a long shadow on the dirt beside Jeff. He was waiting outside.  Something wasn't right.  He shouldn't have been outside. Suddenly, I felt extremely small and vulnerable. Somewhere, hundreds of sets of eyes were scanning screens of satellite images looking for me. The clock was ticking. And yet, I couldn't silence the alarm bells ringing in my mind. Jeff's eyes were sweeping the field.  From the entrance of the bunker marched a bug, its six legs shuffling carefully along the loose gravel. The tops of its shoulders were level with the farmer's. Without hesitation, its jaws clamped around his neck, snipping the spinal nerves and dropping his torso like a puppet with cut strings.  I ran through the corn. Something was following after me, something large and fast. I turned. It sped past, taking a few seconds to realize that I'd changed direction. The ground dropped out from under me, pitching me face first into a mud-walled drainage ditch full of water.  I surfaced. Through a mask of mud, my eyes took in the silhouette of the stalks shaking and falling as the bug stomped back and forth. In my mind I replayed the vision of blood spraying from Jeff's throat. I sank into the water, and let it carry me slowly and quietly downstream.  The stream took me more-or-less in the right direction, though all my clothes are soaked and freezing. I should be able to reach the city tonight... if I'm not caught first.  The important thing is that I got out. It can be done.   Today, I lived as a free man. One day taken back of the year that they stole from me.  [363 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2rd8hj/363_days/)   Well, you tried.   All the best short stories are.      You need to change the permissions to public so that anyone can access the document ;)   Just go with a solid green phone case and photoshop whatever face you wanted over it.   I got confused and thought this was a story about Pete and Pete (from Nickelodeon). Definitely a fortunate mistake.  Keep listening to the podcasts, OP, but be careful. It's already saved you from potential heartbreak and saved your life... who knows what it might want in return.   This is going to happen. If I survive, I'll let you know.   Awesome idea!  I have to put in Birk-Verge Syndrome. The description of that space station still sticks with me. I've never read anything on reddit that made me feel that way. The story defines Cryosleep in my mind.   365 days... I dont even think that most of the others have kept count this long. For them, they hit this routine and switched their brains right off. Our extraterrestrial masters couldnt have been happier about it.  Every day as a part of their system, I go to the store for breakfast. Theyve picked out my food for the day, and packed it into a paper bag. Enough food for one day, nutritious and bland. My house is at the end of a cul-de-sac, and so I was placed in line behind the rest of my neighbors. After checkout, were seated at the tables for exactly 30 minutes. It doesnt matter if I eat all of it, or nothing. I have to sit in place for the full 30 minutes while the news plays from my watch. I can close my eyes, or look the other way, but I *cannot* stand up.  Being the last to sit down means that Im also the last to leave. This is why, for whatever reason, I have to miss the bus. Every day. The times are wrong. Ive filed the appropriate paperwork 365 times now, and yet nothing has changed. Its not humanly possible to move fast enough to catch that damn vehicle.  Every day, standing outside, watching the bus rolling away on its magnetic tracks, I can feel one of them -- feel it in my ears. Their insect-like clicks and pops resonate inside my head like flicking a plastic ping pong ball with the back of a fingernail.  I cant tell them apart. All their exoshells look the same, so I dont know if its the same creature that comes to punish me every day, or whether they rotate them. The thing rears back and wraps four of its arms around me, the thousands sharp fibers that look like hair pierce through my clothes and glide along my skin. Locked in a sort of bear hug, it then administers the disciplinary shock.  When people were still getting adjusted to the routine, I saw an old man step out of line at the store. He wanted a soda, I think, or a magazine. He might have been wearing a pacemaker, and the electricity killed him. When released, his face was twisted in pain, a silent scream hanging on his lips. The next day, the hologram of his face hovered above my oatmeal.  It occurs to me that tomorrow my own face will be on the holograms, either because I escaped or because they have killed me.  I just want them to know that not everyone has forgotten the way that it used to be. Goodbye.

Not sure why I picked on Pittsburgh so much, but there ya go.   Now I'm *Sad*.   1. Disregard the sidebar. 2. Ignore things like common courtesy and community. 3. Write 600 words while sitting around in your underwear and eating fruit loops. Now, your story is the best story of all the stories. There is no reason that even you can't be bothered to read it again to check for mistakes. It couldn't be better, you may as well not even try. 4. Now that your story has flopped, take the fight to the OOC. Remember rule #2, and keep in mind that it really is all their fault.   (Optional)   1. If your story doesn't flop, make sure to go to the OOC and hit them up for money. Any post over 100 points means that you've got their panties fucking dripping. Give yourself reddit gold, so that people can see how much everyone liked it. 2. Start a Kickstarter, an IndieGoGo, an OKCupid, an Ebay store, set out little tin cans on the sidewalk. Set the stakes high, and don't take no for an answer. Repost weekly. 3. Be vague about what you'll actually use the money for, like hiring an "agent" and an "editor." Make sure that you've already had someone "edit" it for free, so that that the money you raise can go straight into your pocket.  4. Show them that what you're raising the money for is already done/being done (badly) at no cost by posting it directly to the kickstarter.

Not that this is a big deal these days. Most places will take a card, but not this one.  On the outside, I thought it was a coffee shop. The sign read: *Strange Place*, next to a hand-painted picture of a steaming cup. I entered hoping to sate my caffeine addiction.  Instantly, I realized that it was a bar. Someone had spelled their beer across the hardwood floor near the entrance. I felt my feet sliding and smelled it before my eyes adjusted to the dim light. I suppose at that point, I should have just walked out and found an actual coffee shop. I could feel the people staring at me, though. An outsider, intruding into their private establishment. A small, person curled over a mop bucket, tapped his foot waiting for me to exit the puddle I was standing in. To save face, I resolved to stay for one drink.  The bartender's face was horribly scarred. Normally, I try not to stare at things like that. I mean, I know that it's rude, but I just couldn't stop myself from taking it in. It looked like someone had dunked the bottom half of his head in a vat of acid, and the skin was now dripping off. As he turned to face me, the sagging fold waved gently.  "Christ. Are you going to drink something, or just stand there staring all night?" he asked me. I realized he'd been talking to me before, though I hadn't seen his mouth moving. I couldn't *find* his mouth.  I ordered a draught beer. He poured it first into a large mug, and then plopped it up on the table with a solid thunk.  "Three bucks."  I fumbled around for my card. When I extended it out to him, now trying to make eye contact like a respectful human being.  "Cash only," he said and pointed to a stained brown and yellow sign held to the wall with packing tape."  "Oh. Sorry, I don't have any... Um, do you have an ATM?"  "You can put it on my tab," came another voice from down the bar, smooth as velvet.  I smiled at the generous stranger and thanked him. He smiled back, revealing long, stained teeth. His incisors were filed sharp as daggers, and hung down over his lower lips. How he had avoided injuring himself was beyond me.  "Huh-uh." The words came from behind me. The man with the mop, still standing near the door was staring at us. Only it wasn't the same man. This one was younger, standing up straight and muscular. "Ye'll not make another mess in 'ere, ye bloody buggah."  Feeling awkward at being in the center of the conflict, and confused over the reason for it, I turned to see how the man with the peculiar body modifications would respond... only to find that he was no longer there, and that the bar was empty. I'm sure I heard his clothes rustle as he got up, like a flutter of leathery wings, but couldn't see where he'd gotten off to.  "*No* messes, Martin?" A seductive woman's voice, coming from the even darker tables further into the bar. "Not even just. one. little one?" Slender fingers counted the buttons up my shirt in rhythm with her words.  The man rolled his eyes and went back to mopping.  "Hi there. I don't think I've seen you before in here."  "No, yeah, I'm just visiting."  She was beautiful, but there was something not right about her. I couldn't figure out what, though, since my eyes were falling down the neckline of her dress. Somewhere, I heard soft music beginning to play, a clean, clear voice singing.  Her hands were gliding across my shoulders, lighting up the tender nerve endings in the skin of my neck, grasping my cheeks. She pulled me in for a kiss. That was when I saw her ears. The ends were pointed. I stopped myself, but her fingernails dug in behind my cheekbones. Her tongue flitted across my lips... a long, forked tongue, like a snake.  I don't remember how I got out, only that I nearly stumbled in front of a car. The music slowly faded from inside my head over the next few hours.  Tomorrow, I'm going back to Pittsburgh. This time I'm bringing a camera.     :D And a happy NewBirYearDay to you as well!   No, I mean, it's not my birthday :P   No, it's New Year's Day.

I really liked it. I think the format works. It gives a limited view into a hidden sotuation, and actually enhances it.

Last action and suicide note is fine, because they'd have been alive to write it. The only ones that are unrealistic are those in which the narrator dies, and then somehow miraculously the story is posted to nosleep. That kind of story isn't realistic.   This isnt a happening-right-now-oh-God-what-should-I-do-help-me-nosleep kind of story. Im 24, and this happened when I got my first apartment at 19 years old.  After spending a year in the college dorms, I thought that living on my own would be a relaxing change. Instead of constant fights between roommates and parties dragging on into the wee hours of the night, Id be left alone in the quiet. My only company would be the old man who owned the downstairs of the house. The whole upstairs belonged to me, an attic converted into a studio apartment.  And things were quiet for a while. The whole first term of school went by unremarkably and some of the damage Id done to my brain cells and my GPA was undone.  For Christmas vacation, I decided to stay in town. Most people left for the Holidays, and being a college down, things pretty well emptied out. Suffice to say, I didnt exactly have a happy home to go back to, nor did I want to take the time off of my part time job.  Instead, I smoked a joint, put a frozen pizza in the oven and put on Netflix.  Alright, it was porn, you got me. When I finished, I closed the browser, but realized that the sound was still on. Even after I restarted my laptop, the sound of a woman moaning continued. Someone was crying, and it was coming from downstairs.  I was curious, and decided to take a look. My web cam had a long cord, and I lowered it out the window. There were other sounds now too, grunting and pounding.  As you can imagine, the idea didnt work very well. I could barely see a dark and out-of-focus shape through the window. A person was standing in the middle of the living room, bending over and standing up again in rhythm with the noses coming up through the floor. They looked like they were dancing or working out, but the noises didnt fit. It was definitely a person crying.  I watched for almost a full minute just to try to understand what was happening. Then the person yelled Help! On the screen, I saw the movements stop, and then she pitched against the ceiling right beneath my bed. The sound scared me so badly that the camera spun on its cable and I lost the view through the window. Id seen enough anyway.  I stood at the door to the stairs. Was it safe to go down? Was I safe if I stayed here? What if whatever was happening downstairs decided to come through the floor and into my apartment? Should I call the police? What would I even tell them? Should I put pants on before I go outside?  The noises had gone away. The ovens timer went off. After taking the pizza out, I sat on my bed and thought about what I should do. My high was still there, and it mixed with the comedown from the adrenaline, and soon I was peacefully asleep.   Hey thanks for inviting me to dinner at your house. I don't like how you've painted the walls in the kitchen. You can leave now. Bye bye.   Was there maybe a longer link somewhere?   I love that stamp!

Ok. /u/HR just got an earful from me.   Totally welcome! Don't stop writing!   The title isn't very inviting. It does kind of go along with where the story starts but not where it ends up.  The first paragraph overdoes the narration. Between dialogue looks and facial expression is expressed and analyzed. Keep in mind that the audience is (something like) a group of people around the campfire. The first part of the paragraph doesn't quite flow as well as it would if it were naturally being told.  You couldn't even call what we did breaking in / This made it easy for Connor... to punch the pane into oblivion.  Does that not sound exactly like breaking in?  There are a bunch of places where the language is too big for the story.   ...that human instincts capitulated hesitation. The id seized control of the brain by harshly irregular means...  People just don't talk like that. It's one thing to use uncommon language to say something very specific, but in this case the sentence should be really simple and the language complicates it.  Some of the words aren't really used correctly, either.  uprooting a **hellfire** of dirt and rocks.  But a hellfire is... actually a fire. It just lends to the overall impression that the writer isn't totally interested in the story, but is more focused on writing the words. It's strange, and I find it to be pretty off-putting.  This part:  Hair, hanging downwards. The hopeless battle between wrist and tether. Blood, starkly red and seemingly omnipresent on the slick dirt floor. Groans, sick, thirsty cries hailing from an owner long devoid of hope that they'd ever reach kind ears.  was pretty creepy and well done. To me, that should be the real focus of the piece. The "villain" is then there to serve the fact that the characters weren't supposed to find that.  Overall, the story is there, but the strange wording gets confusing and takes more effort than it's worth to get through. A few run-throughs of editing to cut away the unnecessary stuff are needed.

It always amazes me how few people get this.   I can't have children. My husband and I had just come to accept that. We didn't have money for a surrogate or an adoption, and by the time we crawled out from under our loads of debt we'd be too old. It would be irresponsible to try.  Last year on December 15, I got a letter in the mail. I almost threw it away along with the rest of the junk, but something about it... I think it might have actually been the paper. I'm no Patrick Bateman, but the creamy smoothness of the envelope was somehow just *right* in my hand the way that I'd never considered before. It was pleasing. The triple-folded sheet inside was the same way. I laid it out on the counter, smoothing it out by running my hand over its intoxicating surface and studied the words, the stork logo and even the signature on the bottom.  *"A gift,"* I read; the gift of creating a new life, which they would deliver for thousands who thought that conception was impossible.  I did the worst thing I could have done when confronted with that kind of gorgeous promise. I accepted. I called and set an appointment to be seen the next day, then I tucked the letter back into its envelope and stuffed it into the drawer next to our checkbook.  The next morning, my husband left for work and I thought about telling him as I kissed him goodbye. I didn't, though. Some part -- the rational part of me -- was sure that it was too good to be true. Just another ad for just-another clinic that wouldn't accept our just-another-insurance-plan.  The other part drew me on with reckless hope and curiosity. As I got dressed I thought about medical advancements I'd seen in the news that might make this possible. While eating breakfast I wondered what being pregnant would feel like. As I backed out the driveway I pictured what I was going to name her.  By the time I reached the building, my heart was racing with excitement. I hadn't let myself feel anything about children since we found out that I couldn't have them. Maybe I really hadn't realized how much I felt that I needed to become a mother. All of that was bubbling to the surface as I pulled into the parking lot.  The building was beautiful, if out of place. It certainly didn't fit the image that I'd made in my mind. The large center crouched near the top of the hill and looked out over the ocean. Natural light streamed in through dozens of bay windows that faced the water. The sheer white walls and floor seemed to glow from within.  The receptionist welcomed me and as she was checking me in, having me sign papers and fill out forms, I remarked on how beautiful the place was. It struck me that their usual customers must be paying fortunes to come here. She smiled and said that they're told that all the time, but that it was really more than just a doctor's office. The center focused on the "big picture" for both the mother and the child, and that fertilization was only the beginning. Most of the rooms, she said, were for recovery and bonding after the children were delivered.  "It's important to Dr. Bristol that the women we serve have a calming place during the transition of new life."  A nurse in white scrubs like I imagine Dolce and Gabbana might have designed came and led me into the back rooms. She took my vitals in one of the rooms. The natural light and warm feeling continued even deeper inside the building, away from the windows.  "I'll let the doctor know you're ready," she said, her soft, warm hand resting on the door knob. "... And congratulations. This is such a great opportunity for you." She smiled and left.  I wasn't waiting for long before the doctor politely knocked and peeked in through the door. Once again, I was surprised, but this time I was underwhelmed. The doctor was short and frumpily dressed. Here was the I'm-in-a-hospital feeling that had been missing since I'd walked in.  He didn't say hello or even look at me until he'd thoroughly studied my file in the computer through coke bottle glasses. His red, glistening face glowed against the backdrop of the white room.  "Ah," he said finally. "This is fantastic. I have just fantastic news for you. You're going to be able to have children. As a matter of fact, you're just perfect. Just fantastic." He smiled and rubbed his hands. "So, a boy or a girl?"  "Well, I... My husband and I haven't really talked about this, but I'd like a girl, I think."  "Perfect, though we could do a boy too, if you'd prefer that."  "Prefer it? You get to choose?"  "Well, *I* don't, but we allow all our new mothers to choose. It's our whole philosophy here."  The nurse in white knocked and re-entered the room, carrying a tray which she set on the table.  "What is?"  "To eliminate stress from the whole process. Some women we serve have a great deal of stress over those things. Many can't decide, so we end up delivering them twins. So many twins, actually, it's quite fantastic.  "So. Are we ready?"  "Ready?"  "Oh yes, we need to act fast if we're going to be able to get you in."  "I'm sorry, I was under the impression that this was just a screening. The letter said..."  "No no no! Don't stress. This isn't going to cost anything, and the decision is not permanent. If you change your mind at any time, you're more than welcome to come back and we'll help you through it. Does that help? I had hoped that we would be able to serve you today. A girl, you said."  "So, what, it's just a... some kind of treatment that will make me fertile again?"  "Yes, exactly."  "And... it's not going to cost anything?"  "It's my own very personal interest. Each year during the holidays I offer my service free of charge. A gift."  "And say if tomorrow, I talk to my husband and we decide again that we shouldn't have kids... I can just come back?"  "We'll take care of you. Whatever you need."  The whole thing was crazy, but what was there to lose? To gain?  "My husband, though, I mean, what do I say?"  "Say whatever you like... Or say nothing at all. This is your process, it works however you want it to. Exactly the way you want it."  "Sorry, I just... I'm surprised, that's all."  The nurse was offering me a tissue. Tears were streaming down my face, but I couldn't process what they meant. It was all overwhelming at that moment.  "Shall we, then?"  I nodded. The nurse prepared the needle, and Dr. Bristol swabbed the area on my behind with disinfectant. A pinch was all that I felt. I tried not to shake as I held in my sobs of joy.  "All done."  That night I made love to my husband like I hadn't since we were in college. I didn't say a word to him about the clinic or the doctor or the treatment. The moment never seemed right. The last time we'd talked about children was three years ago; did I really even know how he felt about it anymore? Then after the deed, I felt as if I'd lied to him, ambushed him. It would be a surprise, but an innocent one, at least as far as he knew.  The next morning I was sore. My legs were wobbly and my stomach was churning and bloated. From the lack of sleep, my head was foggy. On my way to the shower, I threw up. I felt drunk.  The day after, I felt even worse, and I was hungry *all. the. time.*  The third day is when I noticed that my stomach was sticking out, even more than it had on Thanksgiving. It wasn't just food, but wasn't it early to be getting a bump?  On the fourth day, I called the clinic again. I made it clear that I had to be seen immediately. Something was wrong.  "Don't stress," the receptionist told me. "Just stay calm and come out whenever you can."  ---  "It's too late," he told me. "Up to the third day, it's possible to remove the fetuses, but at four, it's hardly doable."  "Fetuses? What are you talking about? They're... they're nothing! I *just* had sex. It isn't enough time to..."  "This is fantastic, really. You're going to make them all so happy."  "Them, who?"  "The new mothers, of course."  "What?"  "Well, they're all waiting."  "What are you talking about? They're *waiting?* Waiting for what?"  "For their children, of course. Your children."  "What? I didn't agree to this."  "On the contrary. I'm quite sure that you signed the release."  "But I -- You said that I could change my mind. I want to change my mind, I'm changing it. This isn't what I thought."  "I'm sorry. It is too late. You should just be happy! Hundreds of women are going to get to know the joys of motherhood because of you."  *"Hundreds?"*  "Oh yes. You see, our method is to fertilize *all* of the eggs at once. One shot. Of course, there are *thousands* of those. After fertilization, we harvest the most desirable according to the wishes of the mother. Through a simple surgery, we transplant them from your uterus into the new mother's. You're a hero, really, you've given them a great gift."  "I don't want to. I just... I can't have children. I can't."  "You can't?"  "I'm infertile. That's what they said -- infertile!"  "I hadn't heard about that, of course. Hm... This does change the dynamics of things. I'm afraid that you may still not be able to have a child of your own."  "So you'll... stop this. This... *thing* inside?"  "It's too late, miss. Those other mothers... promises have been made to them. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be ethical. We need to see you in two days. Please make sure to schedule an appointment on your way out."   Alright. I liked ya before. Now I really like ya.   +1 for "Wow what an idiot."  Telling it like it is.

Woman gets abducted under the guise of being hired by a Wall Street firm. They keep her locked in a room made to hold women like her so they can use her for sex. When she's no longer desirable, they dispose of her.  The last line tries to touch on the expectations that got her there. It's intentionally a little vague, but her parents basically said that they wouldn't hurt her.  There's a confused sense of "love" or "want" and a misunderstanding of the sinister reasons that the business hired her in the first place. Parents' best intentions vs. real worldly evil.   They said they hired me for my resume, but I never worked one day in that job. They called me into the top floor office and passed me around, then they shared me with their friends.   When I said I wanted to leave, they shut me in a room -- furnished and locked, like it was made for this depraved purpose.   When I said I'd sue, they laughed. When I fought back, their smiles grew wider. When I was spent, they brought me here and left me to die.  Back when I told my parents about my new job on Wall Street, they told me, "They're gonna love you."  If that's when they love you   I see. Don't mind me, then!   "   Banana.

William Smith found dead along with an unidentified female as all seasons and 14 previously unreleased spinoff movies of the TV show Spongebob Squarepants come to Netflix at once. Jaden Smith was also found at the scene dressed as a crusacean, seemingly oblivious to the bodies sharing the couch with him.   I feel like there's more here than what's being told. It's a decent beginning though.  The format is more than a little strange. Is this an official document like a patient chart? Maybe you could do a little research as to what that might actually looks like. Else, E-mail traffic might work, too. I just don't get much sense of what I'm looking at.  The doctors don't seem very confident. Not able to diagnose an infection? Not willing to prescribe specific meds? Not sure that's realistic.  Thanks for sharing, keep it up!

Introducing /r/nocontextsleep!   I like how that cow's eyes are like... "Holy human, it's gonna be a long day."  Nice job!   First off, this part:   I went to check on her when I noticed something wrong. Her vomit was moving. Crawling. As Mary continued to heave up piles of small squiggly crawling creatures blood began to splatter. First small drops in the sick. Then eventually the blood began to flow heavier. Mary no longer heaved but weakly hacked as the size of the insects crawling out of her mouth grew larger. Coated in blood and sick they came scampering over her now pale and sweaty skin unaware of the destruction they just caused.  is AWESOME. That's where the horror is.  Now, to get to there, you took a strange sort of roundabout way. You start with "My sister Mary loves to travel," implying that she's still alive, and that this is something that she does all the time.  Then the main character is going on a trip with her, and it becomes clear that the story is focusing on this single instance.  After that, it jumps into the future. "Years later, I recently looked into one of those boxes and found Mary's travel journal." I think the story would work better with this part taken out. In the climax you already get to see that the vomit is moving, so it only really lessens the surprise.  Mary dies, in the main character's arms and only *then* does the main character call the hospital.  Then, it just sort of ends. That last line is pretty weak.  Basically, it just needs more **structure**. Some kind of cohesive plan to keep it all together and in order. Even if the events actually happened the way they're said in this, for the purposes of storytelling, just make them streamlined.  * Mary and I went for a trip to Ecuador * Mary ate strange food and got sick * She died when bugs crawled out of her stomach * I never found out what killed her  rather than  * Mary travels a lot * I went on a trip with her * Mary ate strange food and got sick * At the end of the trip, I shoved her things into the closet * Years later, I pulled the things out of the closet * Mary had written that she was sick * Mary was sick, I was there, here's how I know she was sick * Mary died when bugs crawled out of her stomach * They never found out what caused it  Good luck!   Just for the record, you can return by adding two spaces at the end of the line.  ---  There's this place I know. It's somewhere down the rabbit hole.   It's filled with oddities and terror.

For fucks sake, I hope so, and I hope he does them right goddammit.   Finiish story   I'm really sad that here everyone just hates on reddit. I really like reddit.     Did they need 7 or 8 windows.    If you keep complaining, we will shoot you with a patriot missile packed with shitty hollywood blockbuster movies.   USA USA USA USA...  I think I may have missed the point here. But if you don't agree with me I'll shoot you with my assault rifles and patriot missiles, right after I preach my fundamentalist christian religion to you. Foreigner. You ain't from here.   The one about Mike Myers from Halloween in a Walmart.   Have your goons grab one person, take them into another room for questioning, and shoot a gun. Leave the person in the room and go back to the main room. Inform the suspects that if someone doesn't come forward they will all be shot. Boom. Problem solved. You're welcome.   Probably this one if we're being honest.   It's the government. They're onto you. Burn the pill and your computer, buy a horse and ride into the wilderness that is Canada.   Candide, by Voltaire.

 My wife and I are the same but with a baby added, so work, baby, netflix in addition to mandatory grandparent visits every few days   I'm having a replacement phone sent to me, but I'd like to back everything up to make the transition as smooth as possible and then wipe the old one because it has to get sent back in      That's the ultra hybrid one I found lol   Do you have a link to the slim hybrid? I can't seem to find it     1. Thanks I'll take extra care for that bit  2. Hmm I've never heard anyone say they had that problem with the slim armor case before. I'm not worried about bulk because it looks about the same as the supcase I already have, and I like the look of the slim armor. I'd get the ultra hybrid because I don't drop my phone but I drive a big rig so I don't want to risk it falling from that height without proper protection.   3. I don't exactly like the look of full body skins, I was thinking something clear. I'm just worried about scuffing my phone while it's in the case because the one I'm replacing got scuffs from the supcase  Thanks for the tips   I loved it because it gave me more of a feeling that he was young and cold blooded versus his more sympathetic self in lotr   I'm getting my M8 replaced because of a cracked camera lens. Since I'm doing the advanced exchange program I will be losing my tempered glass screen protector, just the price I pay for not wanting to be without my m8 for lore than an hour.   I currently have the supcase because I thought I would end up using the IR blaster a lot but I haven't been at all so I'm ordering the spigen slim armor case and a nilkin tempered glass protector since it also comes with one's for the camera lenses.   That leads me into my question: what about full body skins? Even with my supcase on, dirt and dust gets inside and I have scuffs on the edges of my phone that I'd rather not have. Anyone use a full body skin in addition to a shell case?   Yeah I've experienced similar and heard the same. Nice people running the businesses. I deliver West of Billings though, so I don't have to deal with the grumps here. I feel like the closer you get to billings the more ornery the people get   TIL there's a mascot of the year thing    Also no truck drivers    Crow Agency by comparison is a cake walk. I've dealt with nicer people there than  I have in Billings.    And then on the southeast side is crow agency. Same exact deal. One of my old coworkers rescued a pup from there. Lured him into his delivery truck and took him to the vet to get shots and whatnot    I'm heights and I'm definitely only 30, just checked. I guess I'll have to call   I wonder if billings got the boost too    Aside from some wasted time, everyone won   I also put diesel treat in the tank every time I fuel in the cold   Let's get the most obvious one out of the way: Have a fucking hammer on hand   The HE machines I have now seem to work fine but I don't work in a kitchen anymore so I'm not sure. I'm iffy on these HE machines though. I feel like they don't use enough water to get some really bad dirt out    Could have been that too. We used the old crappy machines that kept breaking down in our apartment complex    Ah fuck well you got me there. I wouldn't want ride a bus or train smelling like ball soup   You have to wear alternate clothes between your house and work? If that's so that's is bullshit.    It's awfully nice of your employer to provide a locker room for you to change your clothes in. Oh wait, they probably don't and you're changing into your work clothes in the bathroom. Do you change back into your "Street clothes"  after you're good and greasy after a long shift? I go home and shower before I contaminate anything else because that's disgusting and why do I need to soil two sets of clothes? For professionalism? I think you have that backwards unless you park underground and have a secret entrance where customers don't see you. Some restaurants make you walk through the front door. I think it's more professional to show up ready to work. But yeah you have fun changing in that handicap stall or better yet, the tiny stall if the handicap one is taken.    Maybe that's what I was missing because I used plenty of detergent and used two fabric softener things in the dryer but by the time I went to go out the pants on for work they smelled like Olive Garden still    I don't even work in a restaurant and I know how this feels. I work such long hours most days that I come home, shower and go straight to sweats or pajama pants. I own several pairs of regular pants but I only seem to wear the same shirt and pants because by the time I go to wear them again, they've been washed and are the first things I grab from the drawer and closet.    Space Frog: Space Mission   Five nights at lowbread's   I haven't looked at the app but an idea that would give them incentive to update the list is that there could be an option to enable push notifications for every time a brewery updates their list. That would guaranteed that if it isn't seen, at least someone with the app would be reminded of said brewery, instead of the off chance they visit the website or Facebook decides to show them an update on their feed   Yep xerq.io   As someone in Montana, I've never used snow tires on my Mustang and it's my only car so it gets use all winter   1997 Ford Mustang    Basically yes. All the super expensive biked are basically meant for professional athletes, the lighter the bike, the less movement resistance they have.    After the 500-700 range you really don't get better durability with bikes, it's all about weight of the bike    As someone living in Montana I actually find it difficult to tell who is a hipster and who is a redneck sometimes    Even better if they're just what you have on hand. They'll match the furniture by not matching anything    Which is weird because mason jar everything was a redneck thing    Ah, I was wondering what the hell kind of bridge blocks water from flowing    What bridge is this?  I've never heard of such a thing    Laziness breeds efficiency    Imagine the frustration of teaching them how to use the safety as well as trigger discipline.    And the amount being used by your company are all relatively trained with firearms. I can't imagine how much would be used training a ton of primitive people who haven't even seen a gun before    In all honesty any decent place you find will be fine. I've seen some shitty ass apartments with decent heat in them. My recommendation is to find a place with a stove or fireplace. Firewood is relatively inexpensive and then you only need to use the gas or electric heat as backup.    [Well I'm never going down to Florida ever again and it was nice never knowing you, the rest of those areas] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Amblyomma_americanum_range_map.svg/440px-Amblyomma_americanum_range_map.svg.png)    Yeah and 60 degrees is cold for your Santa Monica ass   Porn with multiple locations is pretty fancy    Would a regular drill press not work? I mean I can literally put any bit into the chuck   I almost bought the dremel press thing, but I opted for a regular drill press because I found a used one for a great deal. It also doubles as a rotary sander, and the guy included the stand with it. Takes up more space but totally worth it for the versatility. I only have a tiny space to work with so having two bigger tools in one is great    I notice this about every "moving to montana" post. People acting like the person is moving into the winter apocalypse. My parents got me chains for my tires years ago but I haven't used them in over 5 or 6 years because I haven't needed them, even with how bad the last few winters were. I've never worn boots unless I'm hunting, I dress in pants, a t-shirt and a decent coat and I've only recently started wearing a hat now that I've elected to shaving my hair.  Winter is doable without having extreme gear but I suppose it may be necessary for people not used to the cold weather up here since how temperature seems to be perceived is relative to what you're used to   But also be aware of how deep the ruts are, don't want to get high centered   I lived in an apartment with baseboard heaters for over two years. My electricity bill was low (even with running 2 computers continuously) and my apartment was always warm.  I had friends who didn't use their heater and used portable heaters and I hated going over there during the winter because it was too damn cold.   I think the most adorable tool I've ever seen was an attachment to make a dremel into a mini drill press   Wow this looks really cool. I like everything but I don't think the tub fits in. With all the effort you already went through with the tile, a matching tile tub would have been awesome. (probably not comfortable though)    This is what I do   No kidding, I always go and never find anything    Even more disgusting is the limitations set on how much of the supplies teachers can use and many end up spending out of their own pockets to provide for their students. Meanwhile millions goes to facilities and buying brand new computers every other year.    Yeah it seems like the Jack is slightly too big. I bought an audio cable from monoprice and it doesn't stay in my phone, but my older cables I have fit just fine   I was going to say Streamline Late night is most reliable but then I realized today is Wednesday and they probably unfortunately aren't running    I would argue that a chef is anyone who has control/collaboration/contribution to the menu.   A cook is someone who just follows instruction without actually really knowing the cooking process like production line workers. For example, is an assembly line worker for something like a car a master mechanic who knows how to build or fix any part of that car? It's just simple tasks that can be repeated over and over quickly without any thought.    I wanted to start making a rubber band ball from all the asparagus that we went through but I could never get anyone else to contribute so I have up   Fucking kipkay videos. I used to like his short little videos but nowadays he has unnecessary intros and over half of his video is an audible ad or promoting his premium website    Hands down /r/unexpectedthuglife    Ebaumsworld also ripped it off http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/84399954/   Where can I find out which my state is?    I couldn't get into it. The longer I played the more bored I got    Have one for pork?    Seeing the consoles at that angle makes me really uncomfortable regardless of how secure it is    That sounds amazing. Two topics I don't generally like talking about to other people and a society where where they don't talk about them to each other   So basically what you're saying is that with most lodges, people who practice one of the many forms of paganism could possibly be welcome? (seriously asking)    Thanks. I was also looking into locking casters because I also have a small work area. My toolbox is on casters and can be moved.   We also looked at a bench at Sam's club. Basically it's a nice big flat top with metal supports and legs. Half of my toolbox can roll underneath it, the other half I'd have to mount on a board with casters to fit it underneath.   The pros are it would free up some workspace having the toolboxes underneath it, and it's obviously sturdier. The cons are that I'd have to drill my own bench dog holes, get my own vice to attach to it, and with the legs being metal, I might not be able to attach casters to it   This is definitely the way to go. You don't want to just have the wires going directly from the switch, into a hole in the wall, the  out a hole in the wall and to your device. It's probably also against code so if you were ever looking to sell you'd have to fix it anyway, might as well do it right.    Halo channel is one of the worst apps ever. Today I was watching spartan ops videos and after a video was over, the next episode was on the screen for me to immediately play so I played it, and the fucking audio was in Chinese or something. I went back through the unintuitive menus to select the episode again and then it was in English    If you want bang for your buck get inquisition as it's the longest game ever   I haven't done it yet as I've lived in apartments but a future project in my parents house will be just that. We did a complete remodel of one of the TV rooms and set that up for multiple cat5e cables in two areas where they could possibly hang a TV. The house has a specific design where we are able to run several lines through a pipe into the attic from the basement and from there lines were dropped and pulled down to the top floor rooms where there are existing phone or power lines. The rest of the house aside from the one that was already torn up can have lines be pushed up from the basement. In most houses you would end up needing to tear up sections of your drywall and repair them to run cables.    I just don't know how it can be programmed for so many variables like that. Just in my small town, there is parallel parking downtown, and some side streets have diagonal parking along the street. Then there are limitations on how far away from a corner you can be, or you can't Park in front of a fire hydrant, or there could be an alley access. Unless there is a universal parking method everywhere, I can't see the possibility of taking the human out of the equation.    I did that a few weeks ago. It said I'd get updates by email and I haven't even gotten anything saying it's being reviewed yet    So what about roads not marked or incorrectly marked roads on Google maps? Google nav always directs people the wrong way to my house because one end of my street connects to another road but is closed off by a gate only for emergency vehicles, but there's no indication of that in Google maps. And what about driveways or residential parking?    This is why I haven't done one here yet. I did one on a smaller website and my santa got my 6month son a new outfit, my wife a gift card to nordstrom, and for myself, a few things from my amazon wishlist, like curry powder, a doorstop alarm, a magnetic fridge newton's cradle from think geek, and a fucking rc quadrocopter   This is my ideal setup but I've been living in apartments so wiring isn't an option, but it's essentially how were going to wire my parent's house    Both will work fine honestly. It's unlikely that you'll need cat6 in the near or even far future but whoever owns the place after you might be grateful    I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at here   Where your coax line comes in for the Internet, you'll want a router. If it's a convenient location you can have a wireless router there. Then from that wire you'll want to connect to a gigabit switch and then from that switch you'll run cat5/6 to all your rooms. If you need more devices in certain rooms you can either run multiple wires or you can have a small switch in the rooms you need more wires in. Myself personally, I'd rather have a big switch and run all the wires to it rather than have 4 switches. Yes, you'll need power to the switch. Just remember: only one router.   The common setup I hear of is having a non-wireless router where the coax comes in, and then you put one or two wireless access points throughout the house from the switch.    Thanks for pointing that out. I didn't know there was a standard for bench dogs   Yes it is    Thanks for the tips I'll check them out    So would you recommend it for that vice alone?    You're right.   My problem is I'm still building my toolset and I don't have a lot of skills yet. Have a link to any plans for a good workbench for a compact place?    What's up with the placement of 10 of the bench dogs? They aren't aligned with the vice http://www.imgur.com/QakmpB1.jpeg   I have one of those spatulas, I like it but it gets a little sketchy with how small it is considering I make 14" pizzas    Those cutters are nice to have. Not as much dragging the toppings around like with a wheel. I like having a big one though, I have a small light one and I have to use it slow, unlike the big ones I uses to use at the pizza place I worked at and could cut a whole pizza in like a second   Care to explain for someone who has never owned it?    Your itty-bitty little kitty is kind of a dick   Goddamn that made my hair stand up   What is this even from?    I can't believe I watched that whole thing and I regret none of it    I agree. There's no excuse that Dragon Age Origins can have a skill wheel to access every one of my skills but not in Inquisition. The quick actions are nice for real time play but it's nice to have other less use abilities at my full disposal    I think it's crazy that black cats are harder to adopt. I adopted a black cat, not through a shelter, but from a family that had not been properly taking care of him. He is literally the best cat anyone could ever have   Looks like Kaarma is getting some karma   Yeah I'm pretty sure it's locally known as the Sheraton because that's what it used to be and people still call it that    Scheels? I think you're mistaken, that is an Underarmor store   I'm in this boat. My wife's family has a dish they cook during the holidays where you toss pork chops into a crockpot with several bulbs of garlic and let them marinate for an entire day in red wine vinegar and then cook them overnight. The entire house smells of garlic and vinegar for at least 2 weeks afterwards    Ended up picking it up. I have an older harmony remote but since having a TV, Receiver, and two consoles with CEC, I haven't had much if a use for universal remotes   Little Ricky has hated swaddling since month 1.5-2. Sometimes sleep sacks work if we don't put his arms through the holes but a lot of the time he gets upset that his arms aren't free so the only option sometimes is to hold your hand there and keep him from knocking the pacifier out until he drifts asleep. We contemplated getting that thing we saw on Shark Tank which is essentially like a sleep sack but with no arm holes and just extra room where the holes would be so he isn't cramped up but I'll be damned if we have to spend $40 on something like that when we could buy a yard of baby plaid for like $5 and make one ourselves. Luckily it isn't big enough of an issue to resort to that   They got like at least 15 morale boost points bro   I would argue he was the first, second, fourth, and fifth army    I call him Ricky Bobby because when he's trying to sleep he doesn't know what to do with his hands. They gravitate towards his face, pull his pacifier out and rub his eyes keeping him awake and subsequently making him upset that he's not asleep      Oddly enough it's the same as the thumbnail for the video    I find gas fireplaces unappealing to watch   The imagination's author   Man when I first heard about this I didn't have money to subscribe but I should now   Except this was actually a circle that was actually a portal so it is more worthy to be here than most I've seen   Yep, it will trickle down just like shit rolls uphill   Doritos Dew it right   Now put then between blue waffles    It definitely helps having a significant other that makes money. I unfortunately had to leave the industry because I wasn't making enough money with my first son on the way and a wife still finishing her degree (that won't net her a good job anyway) and we both feel that it's best to have someone be home for him until he starts school. But hey maybe I'll be able to pay off my student loans and save money for a food truck... Someday    It's the only fitting end for a chef   I usually use recipes as a base guideline    It was awesome. Just enough to make it not taste like regular chocolate chip cookies but it was just subtle    After 21 years in kitchens, how is your financial outlook? Especially after 16 different restaurants. 21 years is about 2 thirds of most everyone's careers. When do you think you'll retire?    Please God don't leave Android out   Sounds like you made a completely different recipe then lol. I also live at a higher elevation so I'll have to try your way next time   I made this recipe yesterday, turned out really awesome! I added some cocoa powder and cinnamon to the dry ingredients because why the fuck not   [This one happened about 20 minutes away from where I live last year](http://youtu.be/BmNdCH42tFE)    Body cameras is certainly a step in the right direction    /r/nottimanderic is right this way   You also love /r/tumblrgifs   Lasagna    Oh man if I wasn't driving when I heard that I'd have been rolling on the floor. It really takes something to make me scream with laughter when I'm by myself driving    That podcast is the highlight of my week   There's a lot of new things and changed things, and when I try to look up some information, most places assume you've been playing every generation   Oh wow I didn't pay attention to the title and actually thought the black bit was a silhouette of a space ship   It was basically made because minecraft was giving the cold shoulder to Windows Mobile    People still pirate PC games?    I don't mind it really. I remember Dragon Age Origins having an awful inventory and the original mass effect was a nightmare. I can definitely see the inventory being cumbersome on PC. I can also understand where they're coming from with the random valuables dropping from enemies. It always feels tacky to me when things like demons or mabari drop gold, so selling those for gold makes sense.   That being said, there's no excuse for not having any sort of storage in your stronghold, especially for a game that requires you to collect so many crafting materials in order to upgrade potions, armor, and weapons weapons, as well as re-equipping any potion that isn't your standard healing potion   Yeah, gingerbread sounds better than ground gingerbread    Make a kickstarter    I started at hard right off the bat. Haven't had much complaints about the AI at all   One of my favorite Christmas movies to watch    Thanks for the explanation. I didn't actually play the second game, just watched most of my wife's playthrough. Either way I'm not happy they ruined him   Thanks for doing this   Anders was awesome in origins. Fuck what they did to him in Dragon Age 2   I think something I really miss is the quick weapons toggle in Dragon Age Origins. They combined a lot of the good things about both games but a few are still gone. I liked that I could have two different sets of weapons and skills equipped to the skill buttons so I could change weapon sets mid combat. Like let's say my rogue was sitting back and shooting arrows and suddenly I'm the target, I switch to knives and fight close combat now. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I also thought origins had different arrows with different abilities you could equip.   Another thing I miss is having access to every skill in your party via the skill wheel.    Tactical view is awesome as well. My only gripe about that though is that you can't move far enough away from your character   I find myself frustrated with many of the same things as him but I am really enjoying it. Having a lot of problems doesn't necessarily mean it isn't enjoyable    This was probably what I was going to do but I wanted to be concise lol. I've tried mixing in chocolate chips before and they all end up at the bottom so sprinkling is the best option    The first question you'd need to ask is if it's possible for him to work 50 hours per week. Overtime is becoming increasingly rare for hourly employees, employers would rather put employees on salary and make then work 60 hours per week since they don't have to pay overtime that way.   Is 50 hours sustainable long term? The employer could say yes but then after a month or two decide to cut back.  Lastly, I feel there would have to be some compromise with your husband. It's great that you want to have more direct control over your child! But your husband is basically going to be working an extra 2 hours per day, so if he was 9-5, now he's working 9-7. I work 5 days a week but it's hours based on the work being done, basically I work until I'm done. I know what a huge difference an 8 hour day versus a 10 hour day can be. It feels like it takes longer to unwind at home and when you're finished with dinner it seems like it's bed time already.   That all being said, I think having one parent being at home until they're old enough to be in school is the best situation. Daycares are so expensive and it seems like unless both parents have a good paying full time job, daycare isn't even worth it. My wife asked if she should go back to working but any money she'd make would go back into child care so I'd rather have her have all that bonding time with our son  	146
 Dang! Nice!   Whereat, if I may ask?   Judging by the comments, shaming rich people? I intended it as a means to bring awareness to the poverty America still deals with, yet often times is ignored in media (probably because it's a systemic problem that isn't very sensational).   If you don't mind my asking, where do you live? I feel like in the regions most struck by poverty opportunities for advancement rarely present themselves.    Well, yes. About thirty years ago though, minimum wage was enough to survive on.    Right, agreed. It would indeed have to be rich folks who inherited their money.   Fame? Charity?   Agreed. I don't recall saying anything to the contrary :)   Publicity? Fame?   Yes! I like this too!   Some people can't get loans? How are they going get out of the situation where the only available jobs are minimum wage?   That would be nice, but how many of them would want to go for a double-digit number of months without the privilege they're accustomed to?     Huh. Intriguing! I'll definitely check it out!   I don't quite think that's what we're going for here...   Right. Of course :)   I like it!   Oh right! Whoops :p   Then we take out the show and just make it reality! Viva la revolution!   I do believe there are people trying to support families on minimum wage. Jobs are hard to come by, so people take what they can, which is typically insufficient. Also note that the minimum wage hasn't gone up with inflation over the past 30 years.  	19
 I'm going to have to try that scroll one)      that IS really impressive!!!    small stuff :)             But how do you care for such things?      	9
 "We remove what we're required to remove by law" is CYA-speech meaning "we'll do the bare minimum to make sure we don't get sued or arrested." Clearly reddit has a ton of other subreddits that host very illegal content, and their continual survival means that the admins don't think it's worth their time to actively look for these things unless there's a hint of trouble. They could just be honest and say "we don't have the manpower to monitor everything", but they clearly went the moral rationalization route about free speech and self-governance.   The worse problem is the efficiency at which the fappening and its spawned subreddits were removed, but while other subreddits that link to clearly illegal shit remain online. As administrators they have access to absolutely everything on the site -- does that mean they actively don't remove illegal content until the public catches it? If the answer is yes then the site should just admit that all they are doing is CYA bullshit instead of claiming to have actual free speech principles.   There are plenty of things on reddit that are clearly very illegal, but the admins don't do anything to remove them. You could argue "but nobody sent in a complaint!". Reddit could easily and probably do have a program to monitor for questionable content/content to remove (how else could they remove all fappening subreddits so quickly?) but they actively choose not to apply it to other things.   TL;DR the only reason why we took things down was because of DMCA, but we'll try to frame it in a morally relatable way that will backfire on the community.   What you are basically saying and other admins on reddit have said are that the only types of content that will ever be removed from reddit are (a) ones that violate copyright, (b) child pornography, and (c) personally identifiable information. Everything else is a total free-for-all.  This is the disconnect that you have with large swaths of the reddit community. Not only are those three categories occupy such a narrow range of topics, but yishan's earlier post suggests that the discussion is more or less closed on how reddit censors content. Also, these three categories are also conveniently ones that will get you in trouble with litigation or law enforcement, which makes it seem like a total CYA move.  Please, try to understand this perspective from the community's point of view. If you are going to actively censor content, you have to do it in a less tone-deaf fashion.   Alternative translation: "Not our problem unless you send the correct paperwork." Seriously, it sends a really bad message that the site isn't going to be proactive. Not to mention that a DMCA takedown request only covers a vary narrow category of objectionable digital content.   RPG video games. Not sure when it started (probably at some point during college), but doing the whole character creation and open world thing lost its appeal.   Our facility has been around for a very long time. I'm pretty sure some of the bottles in the chemical room date back to the 1990s. There are many other labs with even older things.  Most reagents never go bad.   Chinese guy here, raised in Canada. Judging by what goes on in college, my impression is that everyone has sex but nobody talks about it.   What about the Tcho chocolate factory? That's a pretty neat little place to visit for an afternoon. The Exploratorium is fun and has things for all ages!   I didn't know about the latter point, which would make OPs statement about lack of peer review correct. Plos one has huge problems with consistency and editorial control.   Recently did a little road trip to jasper. Coffee from Mcds was as good as Timmy Hos. The only thing the latter has going for them is that it doesn't blatantly look like fast food but it still tastes like industrially processed food. You also have Starbucks cornering them on food too, and local donut and sandwich shops clearing up the high end.   Not to mention the non insignificant amount of people sympathizing with fascism in western europe.   or how about just boiling it? "man, this coffee is making me really jittery!"   It will only boost recruitment if they think they can win. People have survival instincts.  Case in point: long after FARC became anything representative of an agrarian militia and turned to kidnapping and drug smuggling, the Colombian government needed some way to neuter them. The Washington Post had a great article about how they worked with the US government to wiretap every single call coming out of purported FARC locations. Every spot was GPS and intelligence confirmed, which was followed by a American gigantic smart bomb locked for use for only that site. Immediately after were actual Colombian forces which would clean up the area.  After a few years of this FARC in shambles and bankrupt, so they had no choice but to negotiate. The same can be done with ISIS, but it requires years of solid work to strangle them of members and money.   Millions? Try tens of billions. The amount of money that pharma pours into drug research would make the NIH go bankrupt.   You make an excellent point about ancestral roots. One reasoning as to why the EU has been reluctant to scale up sanctions is because of a lack of cultural history. Most of the member states are Western Europeans who still see the old bloc not as brothers but as cheap labor. Why should they sacrifice gas prices for them?   Hilary Clinton made a few hints in her interviews that Obama's worldviews don't translate into what he actually implements. My thought is that he is obsessed with his "legacy" of ending the Afganistan/Iraq wars that he feels paralyzed about doing anything substantial in the Middle East. That said, even his reticence for *political* engagement is really disturbing.   I'm surprised this wasn't emphasized more! You could break into a lot of buildings using this trick.   How many cancers rely on exogenous arginine? And how hard is it to co-opt another pathway to synthesize it?    #3: If the photons have the same momentum in a BEC, then wouldn't it be more of an issue that you can't pack them into an infinitely small space? Or is it that they won't have a singular momentum anymore once you hit the uncertainty limit at that size range?    But I guess if the Uspto grants the patent then the only way to get it dismissed is for someone to litigate, right? Are there many organizations out there who will try to get rid of a patent on solely altruistic grounds? My impression is that the Uspto traditionally let companies duke it out in court rather than to be in the business of denying patents.    The US patent system is now first to file. Unless I'm mistaken, it probably means that they can apply and possibly get the patent even if other organizations were the first to come up with it.   No, they provide a lot of grants and fellowships for researchers.   See the other post on this thread. Roughly they do about a third on "non-overhead" expenses, which is actually not that terrible for many charities. People like to focus on the high overhead, but the thing is that as organizations get bigger and your "direct spending" from fundraising goes up, the overhead accordingly balloons. It's unavoidable.  Here's another thought for those who are harping about research. Universities take a huge chunk of money from grants too. They also call it "overhead". It varies by University, but most of them take anywhere from 30-50% of a grant that comes in. For most grant programs, this is listed as either $X in direct costs (meaning excluding overhead and the extra is basically invisible to the application), or is lumped into a total sum (meaning the actual money the researcher sees will be a fraction of it).  Overhead is basically the "cost of admission" for a lot of big organizations. Sure, it seems ridiculous, but I can't think of many nonprofits who do such wide-ranging work and with such huge spending on research and services and have razor thin overheads.   How does that work for kidney donors then, if removing one is so invasive?   The problem with the American systems was that they were designed to intercept other sophisticated missiles. If you're just intercepting a shitty Palestinian rocket then all you need is something with a very good guidance system and a payload to detonate the rocket in mid-air. A Scud or most other missiles would be totally overkill.   Actually, this can also be applied to the Israel/Gaza conflict. Israel feels like they can airstrike them with virtually no impunity, and Hamas feels like that if they only have a 1% chance of sending a missile through then that means they have to send even more missiles. They're expensive to make, so if the Iron Dome didn't work they certainly wouldn't be sending in 15 at a time.   How the fuck is this still perpetuated on the internet. Virtually all democracies are republics, meaning you -- the people!! -- elect someone to represent (as in what a republic literally means!!) you in the branches of government! If you were to draw a venn diagram then a republic is a *type of democracy*, not a cousin or an offshoot of it.   I've seen waaaay too many primary care physicians who don't put on a pair of gloves, wash their hands, or use the hand sanitizer.   I think cats have this type of behavior too.   We have one of those too... ours must just be super crappy.   I work in a lab, but never used an ultra before. How do you weight out your samples accurately when the fine balance fluctuates ~0.005g even when you close the doors around it?   Do you have a reasonable idea of how the general public could have stopped Bush from invading Iraq? I'm genuinely curious, because at that point he had near unanimous support from Congress which is really all that's needed.   Military response? That's debatable, but certainly they deserve some kind of international engagement. Nobody bats an eye because except for North Africa most of the continent is poor as shit, and they don't pose a threat to geopolitical interests. The shit that goes down in Africa is utterly disgusting, but it's also morally reprehensible that no developed country takes the time to even become engaged in what happens there.   The point is not whether invading was a good idea or not. That was a foregone conclusion. The problem was the follow-through. If Bush had successfully created a vibrant and peaceful Iraqi democracy then Obama wouldn't even have been elected.   The Iraqis/Kurds will do that on their own. It's also necessary because it builds a sense of "community" when its your own countryfolk doing the groundwork.   When I go to bed I usually start dreaming almost immediately when I close my eyes. Is this normal? I also require a lot of sleep before I feel actually rested -- normally 10-14 hours.   Yet another reason to move to MV! Not a big fan of PA after living here for two years.   I live in Palo Alto and the closest Pho place is at the border to Mountain View. $10+ for pho.   I think it's incredibly expensive to implement a data archival policy if each county is doing it themselves. But what if there was a national cloud system that departments could subscribe to?   Wouldn't one be more worried about farm-raised animals versus wild? The population density would be way higher which means diseases and parasites are more endemic.   Does that mean the melanocyte-free patches will have a much higher chance of getting skin cancer?   A lot of familiar names on the list, and I'm kind of shocked that some of them are under 40! They've been around a while.   :)   I think it has a lot to do with driver issues. I upgraded my first laptop to Vista back in the day and while the performance was fine a lot of things stopped working because of driver incompatibility (eg. sleep). Nowadays that isn't so much of an issue, although I've had to download a few things from Sony's website when installing Windows 8 to get certain power options to work.  Trackpads are just something to be careful about in the PC world. I remember going to a Best Buy and testing out one of the first ASUS ultrabooks. I couldn't believe how bad it was and how anyone would let that thing out of testing. Good trackpads do exist, but I'm not sure why a lot of PC manufacturers make bad ones.   Not sure what you are referring to, but with modern CPU architectures and latest products from vmware/virtualbox/Microsoft the performance penalty is small.   ? Virtualbox supports running both Linux and Windows at the same time. You could even hide the Linux desktop and have Linux windows mixed with your Windows ones. Why would you need to reboot?   Could you not run the two OSes side-by-side? Plenty of high-power laptops can support that.   A mid-high tier Windows PC with the same spec is built just as well as today's Macbooks.   I don't understand the people who claim to have issues with Windows laptops. I've owned 3 laptops since 2004 and only one has had any kind of a "catastrophic failure" (my first ASUS Pentium M tank/laptop's hinge broke after owning it for over four years, but the screen still worked perfectly). My second laptop was a Samsung and it had a rattling fan noise by 3.5 years but the only reason I got another laptop was for the compute power. Now I have a VAIO since 2012 and there have been literally zero hardware issues.  In the meantime, I know several people that have bought Macbook Airs in the past six months where either the logic board failed immediately a day after purchase or the machine hard crashes once every few weeks.   I thought it would be nice to enter the 21st century by replacing my qwerty Android phone with a new flagship... but all it gave me are typos!   I think this is a common trend as you get older. As a guy, I don't understand why women feel the need to cover themselves with makeup and fancy clothes every single day. My girlfriend doesn't wear any and dresses in jeans and a tshirt, and the fact that she's comfortable makes her positively radiant.   I currently use click chemistry quite a bit in the lab. It's a really cool technique and I'm glad that Sharpless isn't resting on his laurels.   Not sure if I agree with the hairstyle thing. My experience has been that a lot of stylists have a very biased sense of what looks good. Even ones that you'd pay to dollar for, and even between stylists at the same salon.    I don't understand how self-reporting is still a valid form of data collection in some psychology and public health labs. "But there's no other way to get the data!" they say. Well, maybe you shouldn't do the experiment if you're just going to get garbage and mislead others.   I haven't had cucumbers in my sandwich for years. You've convinced me to get my next one with them!   He has said in countless interviews that getting older calmed him down quite a bit.   If .23 BAC isn't, then it should be. Driving with that much alcohol in your system is really irresponsible, and is an understatement of the year for someone who is the chief fucking prosecutor. That said, Rick Perry definitely stepped over some legal red lines.   My parents have been living in Canada for 25 years. No hesitation or pauses when speaking English, but they have a thick accent. In most multi cultural contexts that's very common and is pretty much functionally fluent.    IANAL, but it's probably no. This is why if you are going to contest a charge, your best strategy is to work quickly and escalate as fast as you can before they start hitting you with collection agencies. I suggest sending out a tweet or a public tag on instagram that would embarrass them.   The sad part is that there is simply too many people for "low density" farming to feed unless you turned the entire planet into farmland. Intensive industrial farming is just objectively more efficient. Bourlag's Green Revolution saved billions of people simply because farming techniques became modernized. I don't think people really understand that when at the mercy of the weather/climate, entire societies regularly starved to death. Look at North Korea now, and Eastern Europe not even that long ago.   Holy shit.   That's if you're an amateur.   On the flip side, there are bacteria known to accelerate tumorigenesis! H. pylori is one that many people know about for gastric cancer, but there's been a lot of work showing that Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal but an opportunistic pathogen, can invade the colon and accelerate the growth of these tumors. What's really crazy is that this bacteria can literally invade cells and cause disregulation of cancer pathways. There was a paper a few years back where they were able to find genomic sequence belonging to this bacterium in *metastatic* sites.   at this point i don't even think they qualify as a rebel group. they should be counted as a quasi-state.    Dictatorships by nature suppress dissent and free speech, and the natural urge for agency. Is that good for society?   Mega Man? How about Double Dragon 3. What the fuck.   why can't lyft do the same in return? this happens all the time in the taxi industry   The 1040EZ has pretty short instructions. You literally put in entries for how much you made, how much tax was withheld, do one or two lines of arithmetic, and you're done. Actually, it's such a waste of time that I think the IRS should really be sending *you* a notice about what they think you owe/are owed. A ton of people fall into this super easy category that they could just automate the whole process.   I don't blame him -- getting conned makes you lose your trust in the field and can shake you pretty hard. At least he didn't commit suicide like the guy at RIKEN. He probably had a lot of academics throw shit at him as the witch hunt got pretty disgusting at times. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a "fuck this shit, not worth it" moment.   Interesting theory -- I particularly agree on how Dany will develop in the books. She is portrayed as such a self-righteous leader that I'm almost certain GRRM has a twist for her at the end. She is blinded by her desire to rule, much like how Stannis and others vie for the Throne.   Goddamn... I should move out East!   Where do you find plans that are $155 a month for an entire family? Is it radically different by state? Here in CA an individual silver plan on the exchange is ~$200/m BEFORE subsidy.   It's too bad they probably won't have battles in space in this game with this one. I loved that part in Ghosts but wished there were jetpacks.   ITT a shocking number of people who think they don't smell. Almost every animal on this planet, especially our closest relatives, smell funny. Why would we be the exception?   Efficiency is a non issue. Scientists routinely make ips lines with non integrating methods. The hard part now is making cocktails to coax differentiation.    This should be repeated in every thread! Most generalizations are generally worthless. However, if someone is actually interested, they will undoubtedly change their behavior around the person they like. The problem with this if you're on the receiving end is you have to get to know the other person first in order to make a call.   Once Kurdistan becomes a state (I think at this point it's a matter of when, not if), any US president would be tripping over themselves to have a standing force there or at least a base. They have a good amount of oil and they're not going to let a neighboring shitshow ruin it.   The worst is when you are a postdoc though. It's at the age when you're starting to think about marriage, children, mortgages, decent possessions, retirement funds but the pay bump is very minimal.   It really depends on your field. In a lot of cases, if you are not going into academia taking six or more years for a PhD will put you behind in terms of on-the-job experience as compared to someone of equivalent age. You could apply to senior scientist positions and you will have a very good background, but you will also be competing with people who know what it's like to be in industry (eg. patents, navigating a team, etc.).   Some industries absolutely require a PhD for higher level research (eg. biotech and chemistry), but many positions in computer science it might set you back unless you plan on doing research. I would say that if you got a PhD in Physics and went into industry doing quantitative modeling in a completely unrelated field, you would for sure be at a disadvantage compared to others who are applying for the same position.   I think that the rest of the world sees the nuance -- the problem is in America. Combat troops in the Middle East has become such a politicized issue, and many people on both sides of the political spectrum immediately take maximalist positions: even one soldier or one bomb is too many. There is a very big opportunity here for the US to help the Kurds. Of course, it will help if the Iraqi citizen saw that they were being rescued by fellow Iraqi/Kurds, but the US can do plenty in terms of providing logistic support and supplies. Honestly, in a conflict of this scale I'm surprised that the US hasn't been supplying the Kurds since Day 1.   Ha! What idiots. The more they withhold money from Kurdistan, the faster they will declare independence. Honestly, tomorrow they could declare themselves to be a new country and Iraq could do nothing about it. They could then form a strategic agreement and have a US standing force, because technically it wouldn't be "combat boots in Iraq" anymore.   Stainless? Why not glass or Pyrex? I'm sure you can charge a pretty penny too.    - When you apply, the understanding is that the university will cover your tuition and stipend. It's very rare that this isn't the case and I've heard of no PhD student in the sciences who have had to pay anything out of pocket (Masters is another matter). In most departments you are expected to TA one or two semesters, but past your first year your PI will pay for you through his own grants. With regards to applying for fellowships, you are applying to graduate school fellowships in your own name. Your PI may also get you to contribute towards his or her grant proposals, which will provide funding for your stipend as well as research money. With regards to the PI funding you: you need to make sure that you are joining a lab with stable funding and that the professor is likely to be tenured if they are junior faculty.  - You should mention the specific professors in mind by name. You won't offend anyone -- in your application letter you need to talk about your research interests and this should naturally lead to some faculty at the department who will be doing something related.  - Letters of recommendation are your bread and butter, because aside from your grades there is nothing else for reviewers to judge. The applications start in the fall until December, so you need to get them lined up. You should be very aggressive in hounding professors. One of my recommenders was the head of a project course that I was part of. As long as they are in an authoritative position at the university and can speak for your laboratory efforts I think that is fair game for graduate school.  - You are definitely at a disadvantage if you are lacking in hard research experience, and your grades and letters will have to make up the difference. If you are feeling unsure I'd suggest working in a lab for a year.  - A side note, with regards to where you should apply: when I was applying for graduate school, my grades were just OK but I had a ton of research experience. I applied to a lot of schools ranging the entire gamut in terms of prestige. In the end I was rejected by virtually all of the schools except for the top tier ones. In my case (as well as for you), it is likely that middle tier schools are operating on training grants that have restrictions on who they can take in (ie. American citizens) as well as labs themselves having less funding. The top tier schools, however, have a lot more money and therefore can take in a much more diverse crowd. Keep that in mind when you are applying.   Canadian who got PhD in the states and doing a postdoc in the states too. Knew a lot of people from the UK who went to grad school in the US.  Some major differences:  - The PhD programs are way longer than in the UK. You can be in and out in the UK in 3 years. However, especially in biology this is not enough time to get papers for a good postdc so advantage USA. The problem is that because your stipend and tuition is being funded by your PI, he/she has no real incentive to let you graduate if you are productive. Similarly if a lab is well funded, they might "take a risk" and let you work on a long project that doesn't pan out for eight years or more! In the UK you have a lot of independence but that can range widely with American labs.  - With regards to independence, you are expected to apply for fellowships to support your funding. Many labs don't have this strict requirement, but keep in mind that you'll be spending a lot of time in your first year or two writing fellowship applications. Many of them are only applicable to Americans/Green Card holders, so you should make a list ahead of time and figure out which ones you can apply to. The ones where international people can apply to are EXTREMELY competitive, so make sure you have a polished application and the best letters of reference.  - In your statement of intent for the application, it's generally accepted that you should identify a few labs that you are interested in. However, for many schools (especially in biology PhD programs), you are not taken up immediately by any particular lab on day 1. You will typically do "rotations" around different labs to see where you will be a good fit. However, it's expected that you identify a few interesting PIs in your letter (and explain why! Read their papers!) to show that you've done some research on the school instead of just copy and pasting different applications.  - With regards to LORs, you will need to explain to your recommenders that they will have to write a "you can walk on water" letter for you. It's part of the culture, and if they can't write you one like that then you shouldn't have them writing one and drop them from your application. There is nothing worse than a lukewarm recommendation. Your recommenders should anyway be well-versed in American science to know what's necessary.  - Lab experience: I started my PhD program not too long ago (2006), and at that point it was expected that you go straight from undergrad into a PhD program and there was the expectation that you got your research experience in tandem with your undergrad education. Nowadays I see a lot more people take a year or two off to work in a lab and publish a paper, and it doesn't appear to be hurting their chances (in fact, it only helps if you have a paper). This might be a route that you want to take, especially since it will lead to a good letter of recommendation for graduate school and you will gain a lot of research experience without being thrown into the deep end on Day 1 of graduate school rotations.   Wow, kind of shocked at some of the comments in this subthread. Some people really hate the poor for starting families or not getting a proper education.   There's such a thing as "nutritional deserts" in poor communities and ghettos where childhood obesity is a bigger problem. For these places, a proper grocery store that sells this type of food is physically out of reach. You either need to drive long distances or take public transit to places that sells affordable healthy food. Also, if you are part of the working poor and are juggling shifts, there is no time to go to a proper grocery store as opposed to the corner store that sells boxed meals.   Ugh. And don't get me started with the Hangouts/Talk shitshow. It's like they want to reinvent the wheel every few years.   I agree -- unless it's something that can be realistically scaled (eg. a process engineer TODAY can envision how it can be mass produced), most academic work on this kind of thing are just fancy science projects. And this is coming from someone who has a degree in EE.   Speaking as a guy, I'd say life in general is pretty good. But there are many issues that, despite being extremely important, are outright ignored or dismissed. Certainly there are a lot of activist groups that advocate for women, but right now it is still seen as a social niche to be an activist for these issues that affect specifically men.   How long has the new Maps been out for? It doesn't make any sense for a feature that used to be there to (1) not be in the new version and (2) have Google say "we're working on that same feature". That would imply that they either literally killed the entire old codebase or that it takes them years to port something (like elevation, which presumably exists in a map database that didn't change in between versions!!!).   Holy shit, the bus tracker is infuriating. They had it in Gingerbread Maps for a long time and suddenly it's gone. When the new Maps came out they were like "we're working on making it feature complete." Bitch please, the code already exists. You're saying you nuked the entire old codebase?   Not to mention that for some reason, many restaurants and shops don't show up on search for browsing *when you're zoomed in on the location*. In the old interface you would have everything come up with a pin and a sidebar to scroll through. Not with the new Maps interface.   Europe got rebuilt quickly because of major assistance from the US. It's going to take way longer if not forever for Syria.    When i was in graduate school i had a lot of friends in middle eastern studies who traveled around Syria in the summer just a few years before the civil war. It's really sad to think about how the country has turned into a failed state so quickly and because nobody in the world really cares it's going to stay that way for a long time.    It's not bottomless.   Agreed! A local guitar shop has maybe a handful of guitars. Some of them carry really expensive vintage gear as "big ticket" items, but the rest of the entry-mid level stuff is pretty bad. Not to mention not a single local shop that I've been to has a proper soundproof room to test out an instrument in peace.  Also coffee shops: I live in the Bay Area, and there is no shortage of really shitty "local" coffee shops that claim to have great drinks and charge $3-4 for fucking drip/pourover.   The NCAA is basically the minor league for a lot of sports, so why shouldn't the players be compensated? Many of them are given scholarships that let them just barely get by, or are treated like de facto professional athletes with none of the benefits. Many of them never "go pro", and have to deal with injuries for the rest of their lives with no compensation or help from their alma mater.   I don't know if that's a fair argument though. One of the really attractive things about solar and wind are that despite its low output, you don't really have to do much once it's up. You basically get the energy "for free" from the sun. Nuclear energy still requires mining, enrichment, and building the plants themselves (I'm pro-nuclear, though). There were a lot of studies done that said although nuclear energy has a huge output, the sheer dollar amount of safety infrastructure, regulations, and bureaucracy makes it not that much more efficient.  You also have interesting advantages with solar/wind, such as decentralization of the power grid and the ability to deploy in remote/rural areas. You can easily deliver power to BFE without building extensive power lines, which is really attractive for interior USA.    The weird thing about Facebook is that they have the image of being the creepy and evil company, which results in a huge base that hates them. Google on the other hand probably engages in creepy and evil activity that is much worse but is viewed much more favorably.   The fact that your credit history, which is made up of a ton of things, can be aggregated into a number is mind-boggling.   Live in PA too -- I probably see one or two Teslas on a daily basis. The Leafs are everywhere though.   What makes me upset is that he is so openly hypocritical, and then lies to your face. it's an extremely cynical down of governing. Even with bush we knew what he was up to upfront and voted accordingly. Obama just seems like a slimy guy after the election was over.    It's a matter of survival! I'm surprised so few people get this point. Israel has *literally* walled off the entire Gaza strip, preventing anyone from freely coming in or out. Aid is at a pathetic level. Infrastructure is nonexistent. The only organization that will give any semblance of food or medicine is a terrorist organization. They will kill you if you support the "other side". What else are you supposed to do? Palestinians living in Gaza literally have nothing.  A parallel case (but not quite as close in terms of severity) would be Hezbollah in Lebanon. In many cases they were the only local force providing infrastructure, security, food, medicine, etc. I have friends who described it as "they were the only ones there." It's too bad they also caused mayhem.   just because it's made at a restaurant didn't mean it's better. most bars and pubs have to source from suppliers like sysco if they want the prices to be that cheap, even accounting for profits from drinks.   just like freakonomics. for some reason people easy that stuff up.   	107

Nick Finer, a specialist in obesity medicine at UCL, said the work was potentially of great importance to our basic understanding of how energy intake is balanced by energy expenditure, and potentially as to why this system is mismatched in those who gain  or lose  excessive weight.

The solar inverters are a crucial part of the solar power energy system that is used by the photovoltaic arrays.  A solar inverter or PV inverter is a type of electrical inverter that changes the direct current (DC) electricity from photovoltaic array to alternating current (AC). The alternating current or AC is the type of electricity that we use to run our home appliances. Using alternating current usually requires transformers, switch or control circuits. Solar inverters usually use special procedures, so that it can deal with the PV array that includes maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.         Are women starting companies in the most cutting edge fields and keeping pace with the future? One of the smartest things a woman can do today is start a company in quantum computing, space exploration or life extension.         Script Writing Classes helps to gain from reading screenplay books before he start his own masterpiece.         Laura Schmidt, a UCSF professor at the School of Medicine and the lead investigator on the project, SugarScience, said the idea is to make the findings comprehensible and clear to everyone. The results will be available to all on a website (SugarScience.org)       Morukov, a doctor and a former cosmonaut, was project director of the unprecedented Mars-500 simulation, in which an international team of six men spent 520 days in isolation to simulate a flight to Mars. Born in Moscow, Morukov studied to become a doctor before undergoing training to become a specialist in space medicine.                        Does synthetic biology hold the key to manned space exploration of Mars and the Moon? In the future, synthetic biology could also be used to make manned space missions more practical.      Until now, synthetic organisms have been developed and commercialized without international regulations; increasing numbers of synthetically-derived products are making their way to market. The CBDs decision is regarded as a starting signal for governments to begin establishing formal oversight for this exploding and controversial field.

 I actually might give this a shot. Sleep doesn't come easy here.   This isn't how nosleep works. The rules are in the sidebar.    Y'all okay?   This is why I have a dog. She barks at everything and sure sometimes that gets annoying but I'm secure knowing nothing will ever get to me without her letting me know first.   Hey R4R! I'm short and often grouchy and easily creeped out, and I need friends! Maybe more than friends? But mostly just friends. Anyone local? Male or female. I like working on cars, beer, bacon, boobs, baking, books, nail polish, knitting, and my dog.    "Chortle" made me chortle.   Update soon!   Spill the beans OP! We can probably help you but only if we have the full story.   Your mom may just be sticking around to keep an eye on you and the house. How long until you turn 18? I'd move in there ASAP if I were you. Just keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary that feels threatening.   I really enjoy your writing. If you have more experiences, you should post them. How is your wife doing now?   No one ever looks for those girls.  Queen street, Toronto?   Holy crap. This must be terrifying for you.   Best comment ever.    And um... "suicided?" I picture this being written in crayon by that mean kid who picks on everyone else, and his older brother let him on nosleep to scare the shit out of him.   It's the ring.    In the fall I had a feeling my ex's (who I'm still VERY weirdly close with) girlfriend was pregnant. Sure enough he told me she was. I looked at my mum that day and said "He's not gonna be a dad." I had no idea what I meant at the time but I had this feeling that something bad was going to happen. About 6 weeks later he told me she had had a miscarriage.   Also ever since I had surgery in December I seem to be seeing things in corners and blurry places here and there and the odd shadow with no cause. Something about being put under I think.   Anyone else read this, hoping for the mold?   Same here actually. My grandad's family used to just KNOW stuff and in the last few months I've found myself KNOWING things I have no possible way of knowing. We're also prone to seeing people in places they aren't. I basically got a dog for the express purpose of letting me know when the people I see are real.   Happy birthday! :) You are brave and brilliant and loved.   Seconded. Also the reason I don't put my dog outside unsupervised.   I expect I'll have a baby on Friday the 13th. Hopefully the Calusari aren't hanging around. No patience for grouchy old Romanian men.   I'm working really hard on convincing myself they're not. I was waiting outside the recovery room for a friend after major surgery this week and kept seeing people/whatever in the hallway out of the corner of my right eye. There was no one there. It was bad. At home I'm mostly just seeing blurry spots/shadows and my cats are wild all the time. My therapy dog can't be bothered with it though I've noticed she sleeps a lot closer to me at night now.   Holy. Shit. Coat hanger.    How to freak out someone who had surgery a while ago and since sees blurry things in corners: THIS. Keep us updated OP.   CALL THE COPS! No one ever thinks to call the cops.   Thank you, captain obvious. Also, fork off.    Boy that was helpful.   This was incredible. Props OP. I don' think I blinked the whole time I was reading.   Business idea: open Etsy shop selling different shapes/sizes/styles of tinfoil hats. Split profits?   Have you ever learned more about your parents? Tell us more!   Death, bro. Death.   MORE!!!   Commenting before reading because was 100% listening to Jar of Hearts while scrolling /nosleep new stories. Creepy.   Your girlfriend's name isn't Steph is it?   I find passing out is almost involuntary for me after a big adrenaline rush, if that explains the sleeping at all.   I might never sleep again...   Take the cat.

I have one on the top of my foot and one on the  side of my forearm and NO idea where they came from. I blame them all on the guy I hang out with but I don't think they've ever actually been his fault, they just appear.   Any news? How is he doing?   Are you in Nova Scotia? You described yourself and one of your friends EXACTLY like my best friend and his girlfriend. Her name is even Rachel and she's a ginger.   Mine too!   Hey OP. I'm a nanny and I've had a lot of strange experiences. One thing I've learned is if you want people to believe you, you need to take videos or pictures and hand them over to someone who can be objective. You could consider wall mounted baby monitors or a camcorder on a tripod, or even a cell phone video. You could also try a line of salt or brick dust at your doorway to see if she can cross it, and I would get in touch with the priest as soon as you can. Something else to consider, for someone who may be a bit more open minded, you could try contacting your local paranormal society. It seems most places have them and they can usually be contacted via facebook or a local shop. Good luck and keep us updated.    I swear when I was in emerg for my gall bladder, I was a little high on pain meds and saw a bubble and FREAKED OUT til the nurse explained it to me. It's a pretty widely held belief!   I may be. Or I may not. It all depends on your response.   It's... The Strangest Load I Ever Pulled. I think? Or something like that. It just sounds wrong to me.  	48
 Your post only makes sense if the exchange doesn't have a full reserve.   Off-chain transactions do not imply fractional reserve. You can have full reserves and transact off chain.   If they had the cash, why wouldn't they be holding btc anyways?   If an exchange is doing that, we've got larger problems, and withdrawing in bulk will cause another MtGox, which is empirically bad for bitcoin price.   I don't see why you'd reject old version blocks after a hard fork.  Does the code Gavin published do that?   It doesn't matter if its blocks aren't accepted by the 90% chain, as long as the 90% chain's blocks are accepted by the 10% chain.    My point is not whether we want to do it or rather it is good, that is a whole other discussion. My point is that if the above-mentioned payment processors, with their infrastructure backing them, collude to do it, they can force it regardless of what the miners want.  If they were to completely fork bitcoin in a non-backward compatible way, and 50% of the miners wanted to stop it, they could just collude to attack the fork, with a standard 51% attack.  You can't do this without the miners.   That's actually the worst way to fork. If we don't have 50%, we don't want to switch. We also don't want to force miners to mine larger blocks. You could get around that by specifying some non-backwards compatible protocol change, but I don't see a strong reason for that (I haven't thought a lot about it, though.)  (And seriously, a hard fork isn't enough, you also want to break compatibility with smaller blocks?)   It has the nicest user interface that I've seen. I only use it for checking balances and tracing coins, wouldn't trust my money though.   The 10% chain would actually be shorter and not accepted.    If the exchanges agree among themselves, though, on going one fork and not the other, the mining pools can mine all they want, but whatever they mined/voided will be worthless.  That's only if the forks aren't compatible. As long as the 20MB nodes still accept 1MB blocks , and more than 50% of miners stay on the 1MB fork, there *is* no other fork.  The 1MB fork would win on both forks.  The claim "whatever they mined/voided will be worthless" is just wrong, unless the other fork is longer, which only happens if 50% of miners switch.   He could have only 20% of the miners go with him, the rest will follow in a few hours. It doesn't matter what the other devs think, the original chain will be relegated to back-alley-shady-altcoin status in no time.  If less than 50% of miners switch, there's no "longer" chain to switch to. The one with only 1MB or smaller blocks will always be longer. It will not become worthless.  There's a reason it's said that you need 51% to uphold a fork.   If less than 50% of miners switch, then the longer chain is the one with shorter blocks, and even exchanges that switched still support that.  I don't see any incentive for miners to switch just because all exchanges did.  Am I missing something?   Maya: 0.   I believe Google Wallet allows sending any amount, although to cash out you need at least $1. You could just transfer some from a bank and back if you really need the pennies, though.    Do you get paid to write such things? How does one talk about Snowden without talking about the NSA?  You're using my criticism of Snowden to imply that I approve of the NSA. That's wrong, and if you can't see why, we shouldn't talk about the NSA altogether.  You are using the same tactics as government shills by focusing on specifics part of the programs while avoiding talking about the parts that affect Americans.  I'm sure government shills also use English, that doesn't mean I'm one because I use English. Logical fallacy, again.  And of course it's against others countries laws for the US to spy on every country, the UN called the US out on that matter. To argue otherwise is intellectually dishonest.  Talk about intellectual dishonesty; the example you linked isn't about spying on other countries' citizens, it's about spying on protected international missions! That's illegal under international law (and therefore under US law as well, due to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause).)  Is that really a serious question?  Yes. You'd do well to take every point I make here seriously.  Do you really believe that any country would willingly allow foreign nationals to spy on them?  What a country allows and what is legal are two different things.   In France for example they have "Loi Macron" that forbids such thing  As far as I can see this Loi Macron is something passed recently, within the last few months, for example http://www.thelocal.fr/20150410/france-gifted-but-lazy-loafing-pierre-gattaz and http://www.afrizap.com/en/france/. So it seems irrelevant, unless I'm missing something.   there are other laws but I don't know them on top of my head and frankly this is a silly exercise .  I don't think it is. I think the question of whether the activities are illegal in other countries isn't that relevant to whether Snowden did the right thing by exposing them, but I also think some of them were legal, and if you know otherwise I'd like to hear your sources.   For one source that says it is largely legal, see https://theconversation.com/i-spy-you-spy-we-all-spy-but-is-it-legal-20540.  I see your point, but when one starts with the insult before the argument, one looks silly, especially when the following argument is based on half-truths.  I don't think my argument was based on half truths.  Yet we learnt that Germany was aware, the chancellor appeared angry so its population would not get even more upset. One should not listen to what officials say, but what they actually do, and we know that the German spy agency helped the NSA.  That doesn't claim that the Germans knew the US was spying on *them*. They helped the US spy on other targets.  I highly doubt the Merkel knew that the US was tapping her cell phone, and your source does not claim that.  It's not a maybe, it's a clear yes, and the same is true of Americans.  For Americans, I have to decide if the good that was done by revealing the abuses outweighs the problematic parts of what he leaked. This is a very real tradeoff that is not solved by pointing to the parts that he leaked that *were* illegal programs.    I mean the collective value.  I still don't get what your argument is against my use of market cap. Explain what you mean by collective value, and why that has anything to do with my statement.  You may be arguing definitions. I'm arguing against what you are implying and against your method of argument in general. You have not actually elaborated on why your application of market capitalization to bitcoin is of any substance.  Someone above said something along the lines of "if bitcoin ever achieves any significant value, it will be easily attacked". The context was clearly saying that it's not being attacked right now because it's not worth enough.  So I responded by asking how it could be viewed as having no value now to attack, if the market cap is over 1 billion. Obviously an attack wouldn't pull out the whole market cap, but a successful exploit against bitcoin would probably be worth at least 1% of the market cap, which is still significant. There's also the point that as the price rises, the amount spent on mining also rises, which raises the cost for mining attacks.  I don't think that argument could be reasonably mistaken for the argument "bitcoin has a high market cap, therefore bitcoin=good", which I agree is ridiculous.  What the hell do you think a market cap of a volatile asset that crashes like a rocket pointing the wrong way if anyone actually tries to move some volume and has nothing to back it means, other than "this number is impressive".  It means that some portion of it is up for the taking should anyone have a real attack on bitcoin. Obviously you couldn't get the entire market cap, but some portion can be gotten.   I know what each word means separately, I don't get what you meant above by using both together.  Nope, that's the appeal to authority. Just because BoA does it doesn't mean it's right (unless foreclosing on the wrong house is right). They probably aren't misusing it as badly as you are in this case but the point stands.  You seem to misunderstand appeal to authority, and why it's a logical fallacy. We're not arguing over a factual matter, but a definitional matter. When arguing definitions, how it's used by people is a relevant form of evidence. You have yet to say what you'd consider evidence, or give any sources at all for your claim.  See http://skepdic.com/authorty.html, which lists the conditions that an appeal to authority is a fallacy.  I know you were trying to impress people. Stop pretending like you didn't throw "bitcoin" and "over a billion dollars" to make it seem important.  Well, if you can read my mind, why don't you comment on the brilliant rebuttal I'm thinking of right now?  Or more seriously, you *can't* read my mind, and apparently can't correctly infer people's intentions from their writing. The mention above was to disprove a claim. I have different things I mention when I want to impress people, but this sub is not where I try impressing people.   Some searching on collective value shows up only moral terms, not financial ones; could you link a definition?  Anyway, above I was told that market cap does not apply to bitcoin. Pointing out that people working in finance use the term should have been sufficient to disprove that.   Your criticism seems to be different, and you seem to think I was trying to impress people, which is incorrect.   I was using it to rebut the claim that it hasn't achieved any real value.  Why do you think I'm misusing it? Nobody has supported that claim.  And how else should I respond to a claim that I'm using a word wrong, if not by showing that other people use the word that way? Again, what would be acceptable proof to you?   Well yeah, if you have access to the machine when the password is put in. Or if you hibernate without encryption.   /r/ilerminaty   You could just read the article, you know. He mentions a figure that he thinks is the maximum market cap, and uses the term market cap.   If the fact that someone from BOA is using it is not enough to show that I'm not foolish for using it as well, then what would?   I pointed out that the head of global rates and currency research at BOA applied the term market cap to bitcoin, and they presumably know what the term means.  Reading comprehension, babe.   Vanitygen is a cryptographic brute-forcing application, and can be used to search for a complete address.  However, you will be unhappy with the amount of time required for it to find a match.   You put in all the characters except the last 6, then figure out the checksum.   So how much do you think you can get a month that are bought legally, then sold for 20% off?   And do you think those are bought completely legally? (`If yes{sell them a bridge;} else return "user is normal";`)   Actually, this subthread is about a tablet, and you said that the company could track by network logs.   Short answer: no.  Long answer: **NO**  Even longer answer: what's the largest amount you've ever been able to spend on Amazon using bitcoin?   I don't actually see this link elsewhere in /new, and the article is only 2 hours old.       With all transactions ending up in the blockchain, the only way to guarantee anonymity would be both purchasing and selling your bitcoins outside of any system which requires identification.  Actually, you can mix your coins after you get them, and end up with anonymous coins.   I'm pretty sure it is.  A quick search turns up [this](https://tbtc.blockr.io/trivia/block), can't be bothered to find a more official source now.   A block can't have no transactions in it, that may be the source of your confusion.   If you're using a computer they provide, and an operating system they provide, and there's malware on it, then yes.  If you use your own OS (say, Live Linux USB), or your own laptop, then they can't see what you're doing on Tor, or any good VPN.  They can see you're connecting to them, but not where you go.  There are ways to block that as well; see Tor bridges.    Do you have any idea how common it is for companies to install custom certs to track their users?  No idea. Any large company that cares will do it, it's easy if they set the computer up.    Can they raise the issue of how the server was found and the fruit of the poisoned tree?  They already raised it and the judge pointed out the problem with the request. I doubt that could go through on as a basis for appeal.  How about Ross' experts being blocked from testimony and that the journal and screenshots could have been total fabrication?  They'd have to show why the judge was wrong in denying the testimony (for being filed too late.)  You can't just repeat old arguments in an appeal, you need new ones.  For the "faked screenshots", they'd need to argue against the agents that testified for its credibility, which is different from the corrupt agents.  Again, doubt an appeal has much basis unless there are new arguments. Finally, do the indicted federal agents' crimes play a part in this appeal?  As nothing connected to them was brought up in the trial, again, unlikely.   [ Removed by reddit on account of alleged copyright or trademark infringement.

I've read companies can have control of their SSL certificate or something, but do they really do this?  If any link, such as imgur, is not https, then that will be trackable.  To track SSL you need the user to install a custom cert, which company computers can do easily.   Use Tor or VPN.   The sad thing is that he's using the same lawyer.    Or, maybe it is not up to the person defending all the relevant experiments done by all serious scientists ever, to have to replicate whatever ridiculous setup ginned up by a guy on youtube.  The people who made the video were replicating a previous experiment by MIT. Are they not serious enough?   The first link says  The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal Nature, which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a 6 ft (1.8 m) tank with 300 U.S. gal (1,100 L) of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized.   The second one is talking only about sinks and toilets as far as I can tell.   Awake. I hope Netflix picks it up eventually, that ended too quickly.    draining sink or toilet.  sink or toilet.  Notice how no pool is mentioned?  Look, why don't you just educate yourself on the strength of the coriolis force?  I tried, but there are two different papers quoted there with differing claims, and I'd need to learn a lot of physics to actually evaluate them.     PRISM collects all internet communications from US citizens, this is a clear breach of the The Fourth Amendment of the US constitution and the Bill of Rights which guarantees privacy and prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.  Your comparison of a US citizen calling Google and demanding their data of other countries makes no sense, you're just trying to whitewash what the NSA did.  I did no whitewashing. We're talking about Snowden now, not the NSA. It's a logical fallacy to say that because I think Snowden did some wrong things, that I think the NSA is right in what *they* did. I don't.  Now, whether it's a "clear breach" is debatable, legal experts have said otherwise, but that's not the point here. I'm talking about PRISM spying on other countries' citizens. You said it would be against other countries' laws, which I denied. So I asked you to list which law it would break, and you didn't answer.  An ad hominem is when you attack someone's character rather than their argument, there is no place for such place for such puerile attack if one wants to be taken seriously.  You've made some personal attacks on me yourself, but no matter.  The ad hominem fallacy is when you say "that guy is stupid, therefore he is wrong". When you say "that guy is wrong, for reasons X, Y, and Z, therefore he is stupid", that's not ad hominem.  See http://laurencetennant.com/bonds/adhominem.html  So your issue with Snowden is the fact that he let foreign states know about the capabilities of the US? But we know that these states (like Germany, France, Britain, etc..) knew about the program, they were part of it. So it was no surprise to these governments, in effect Snowden didn't disclose anything other foreign agencies didn't already, what he did was to let citizens know about the abuse of power by our Governments, and for that he should be thanked.  First of all, not all states knew about US spying on them. Germany in particular got very upset with the US for spying on them; if you're conspiracy minded you could dismiss that as fake anger, but I doubt it.  what he did was to let citizens know about the abuse of power by our Governments, and for that he should be thanked.  If you're a non-us citizen, then maybe. And I do think leaking any of the illegal programs (under US law/constitution) is fine, and I'll thank him for that. The problem is those documents he leaked, that did not describe anything illegal. I don't see how the fact that other countries may have known about them makes it any better.  Again, if someone were to publically reveal a weapon that your government had been developing against other countries, would you thank them? If no, then Snowden deserves no praise from Americans for the programs involving spying on other countries that he revealed.   Thanks for that.    The largest mining pool posted on the bitcoin developers mailing list the other day and said 20MB blocks were more than they could handle.  First of all, let's [link to the actual post](http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34157036/)  That says it's more than they can handle now, they want to to increase smoothly. Right now there's no need for such big blocks, but developers are worried about the future, and supporting more.  Anyway, I was talking here about what would happen if 20MB blocks were common, that's not going to happen for a while.  Greg Maxwell has said that most of the ghash hashrate drop off after the 51% scare was CEX moving their hashrate to other pools to hide it. This apparently happened after a meeting with all the big mining players, and is likely being done by other large operations specifically to make it appear that everything is fine.  This is a larger concern. I'm not sure if he said "most", though, what I recall is that "some" was hidden.   It is negligable to toilets, kiddy pools and sinks.  That source doesn't mention that at all.    The Bitcoin "market cap" is a bullshit metric that is there to make you feel a bit better (or not), it is not a market cap.  Learn what a market cap is before coming here and making a fool of yourself.  Please elaborate. I find it fascinating that [Bank of America](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101250070) is hiring people with no knowledge of finance as analysts.  I may be stupid, but I could probably become their "head of global rates and currencies research", because apparently that doesn't require knowing what market cap means.   Could you elaborate on that?      This [already happened](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=191039.0).  See also http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html   That's talking about toilets, not what the experiment is doing.   MURICA!   4188   Guilty!   Joinmarket   I think the people who made the video claimed they followed the same procedure as the MIT experiment. If that's true, a replication would have value.   If you had even a single result that contradicted theirs while being as controlled as theirs was then you'd disprove their experiment as not being strong enough. Surely there's a 50% chance of that if you're right?  And what about the MIT paper they cited and claimed it shows that the effect can be detected?   Just remember, in an alternate universe there's someone who saved two kids today.  There's also someone who posted "TIFU by not wearing contacts and letting two kids get killed by a car".  Multiverses are fun.   At the risk of sounding childish: could you try doing it and making your own video?  I'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that criticism of something should be within an order of magnitude of the original in rigor or higher. If someone makes a video of an experiment, the rebuttal should feel like it took a similar amount of effort.   I think we're using different definitions of smart.  The one I use allows smart people to sometimes be very very wrong.   More precisely, the law says that he's responsible for all money he laundered.   Timeline or wall, make up your mind.   Also, where do you live and when do you work?   Now you know how the steal-beams terrorist-melters felt    No it isn't, there is no country in the world that allows spying by foreign nationals, none.  What crime would a US citizen be committing by calling up google and demanding their data on other countries, as in PRISM? What country says that is illegal for someone to do?  What crime is being committed by passive collection of data that goes through internet cables?  This opinion piece is quite bias, the author starts his essay with a ad hominem which shows his lack of argumentation  Ad hominem is when you don't include arguments, they did include them. I in fact quoted one.  I would consider them a defector, but we all know that the spying on all Americans is illegal and go against the Constitution, that the government was able to extend the law to fit their needs is not surprising, but it doesn't make its actions any more legal, at least constitutionally.  Again, my problem is with his exposure of spying on other countries, which is certainly legal under US law, if not those countries laws.  I'm amazed that people like you defend the spying on Americans.  Don't be, because I didn't defend that.    just plain stupid.  Goldman Sachs does not employ stupid people.    Even more importantly, because the only response variable was flow direction, and if there's an equal chance systemic bias leads to either flow directions, there's a fully 25% chance that this result does NOT support the Coriolis hypothesis.  That's only *if* there was a systemic bias on both sides. You need to multiply the chance of having a systemic bias in the first place.   https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#decodescript says you can use bitcoind to do it.    Your sarcasm detector is broken.   So what's the difference between what they did and the MIT claim, or is MIT wrong?    Lol please. Calling bitcoin a currency while saying it has a 3 billion dollar market cap is laughable at best.  I didn't call it a currency. You were the one who said "any popularity or value", which it clearly does possess. There's enough incentive to attack it.  In fact your claims are nothing more than bullshit which can easily be debunked by comparing bitcoins value with number of nodes. As bitcoin gained value mining centralized, and the number of nodes decreased. This isn't "something I've said a couple of times". This is exactly what happened from 2013 to 2015.  There are other factors, in particular the ability to use bitcoin without running a node, pools coming into existence (and solo mining not being practical), ASICs coming out which made mining something you needed a new device for. All of those are one-time events, that wouldn't effect what would happen if the price rose even higher. If you'd like to do a more careful analysis that controls for those factors somehow, I'd love to see it. But as it is, what you're saying only shows correlation where we have several other confounders that may be the cause.  Yes yes, that will be fixed in the future. Like every other gaping bitcoin problem.  This is code already in github, which will be released after testing. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f9ec3f0fadb11ee9889af977e16915f5d6e01944   But that doesn't matter, the points he makes and the math he shows are sound regardless of that the person calls themselves.  I can't judge whether the math is right.  They got results despite the math.  That's not what they say. They cite a paper that did the same experiment, which they claim goes through the math and shows it is possible. Again, I can't evaluate their math either, but they aren't saying it should be impossible but we did it anyway.    Currently bitcoin is partially decentralized. Bitcoin is such an obscure libertarian play toy that it's decentralized enough to remain secure. If it ever gained any popularity or value, the current decentralization would not be enough to stop it from being attacked.  How can you call something with a market cap of over 1 billion as not gaining value?  If there was enough motivation all you would have to do is convince 3 people in the world and you have control of the majority of the hashing power.  I've said this as well a couple of times. I do think that if bitcoin went significantly up in value, there would be substantially more nodes, and mining would decentralize more.  Also, those 3 people (and in reality, it's 3 companies, which hopefully have multiple people that would need to be compromised) would gain a lot quickly, but would then lose a lot of mining power as miners switched to a different pool. I also think that if the price goes up, miners will have more incentive to switch to smaller pools, because of the very same incentive for attackers.  Do the math, 20mb blocks = 1 TB of dice game spam added to the bloat chain every year. How many people are going to purchase multiple TBs of disk space and give up all of their bandwidth to run a node?  There have been proposals. Note that pruning will allow for the vast majority of the blockchain to be discarded.    This subreddit was created to mine Comedy Gold, and to laugh at you.  The sub was created before I owned any bitcoin or knew anything about them, so you're endorsing retrocausality.  (The above argument has about the same epistemological quality as your own.)  We don't even need to say anything to convince reality that Butts are done for.  If you don't want to engage with the other side's argument, that's your right, just don't pretend you're interested in doing so.   They become more and more irrelevant every day.  What metric are you using irrelevant as a proxy for?  We never seek to convince you or anyone else, only to amplify the already-substantial laugh yield.  What can I say that would make you laugh?    That was basically done in the original post (the one with the math and theory) and the response it got is basically "try it yourself"  He doesn't claim to be a physicist.  Never let the ideal textbook calculations or simulations get in the way of empirical data. I test for a living. I learned this my first week on the job 13 years ago.  Which is just.... terrible.  I agree. OTOH, they also mentioned a paper that agreed with them on the math, so either one paper is wrong, or misinterpreted, neither of which I have the expertise to judge.   Because the other paper didn't seem to be addressing the exact same question, and it seemed to be the commenter who was interpreting it.   I can't evaluate his claims, but he does cite a paper and claim he replicated it. His results by himself might not be enough, but if the experiment was already done, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.  OTOH, the other side has a paper as well. Maybe we should ask a physicist.    3 mining pools control 50% of the hash rate. If that's not centralized I don't know what is.  If that's the case, then your claim above that increasing the blocksize to 20MB and it being full would destroy centralization is false. Either it's currently decentralized in whatever sense you're talking about, or it isn't, but not both at the same time.  I honestly don't know why bitcoiners come here and try to wage some holy war trying to debate us. We don't care about your ponzi scheme, and you sure as hell aren't going to convince us that you are right.   If you just want to laugh without caring if you're right or not, be my guest. The sidebar said this tries not to be an echo chamber, but I guess there's only so much you can do.  How can you say you don't care when this entire subreddit was set up to talk about bitcoin?  When you guys come here, all you do is get your panties in a twist, spout off some talking points, and then walk away with your head held high because you just "won".  How is that description any different than what you're doing?    Of course not, but it's illegal under US laws for other countries to spy on the US and vice versa, hence spying is illegal.  It's more complicated than that. Hacking would be illegal, but simply grabbing data from cables, or intercepting it when it comes into the US might not be.  What programs are you referring to?  http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/edward-snowden-is-no-hero  These were legally authorized programs; in the case of Verizon Businesss phone records, Snowden certainly knew this, because he leaked the very court order that approved the continuation of the project. So he wasnt blowing the whistle on anything illegal; he was exposing something that failed to meet his own standards of propriety.   [Here's another list](http://www.forwardprogressives.com/let-me-show-why-edward-snowden-traitor-not-patriot/)   If someone would reveal that the CIA is spying on other countries, would you consider them a hero, if it was completely legal under US law? Or would you consider them a defector?   Both sides quoted papers. Your "actual scientist" reference is ridiculous, as well as the "verifiable". Both cited "actual scientists", and the experiment is also verifiable.    Miners went from hundreds to dozens to 8  [citation needed]  It could be you're talking about mining pools, but that doesn't mean the mining itself is centralized, and they could easily move to a different pool.  nodes went from 20,000 down to 5800  Which qualities are lost by a descent from 20000 to 5800? How much further would be required for another loss of qualities?  I think most of that was right after SPV was released and you didn't have to run a full node to use bitcoin.   brb, checking my balance.  By the way, I had a credit for "REVERSE INTEREST CHARGES" on a credit card recently, wasn't sure what it was, but I called my bank and they sent me a check. Anyone know what that could be?   You said something about doing Bayesian statistics wrong, you never did any calculations. You complained about moving goalposts when my argument is the same as I started with. When you make those kind of accusations, it's on you to support them.    lol then your number is 10% not 1, stop moving the goalposts.  What's your complaint? I laid out clearly what each of my numbers meant.  Right, only on ones where someone can afford to bribe them with a lot of money like this one  There's little motive here for bribery, it's either suicide or accident. Doesn't change my priors.  You still don't seem to be understanding how the statistics work in this scenario: both the cops and family members are faced with a single case  They are. You aren't explaining very well how I'm getting the statistics wrong. I laid out a calculation, what's wrong with it?  You aren't addressing my point.   "More crooked cops" would be true, because 1/10 would be crooked. My point is that even a crooked cop doesn't lie on every case, and once you take that into account, the proportion of crooked cops lying on any given case should be lower than the equivalent by family members.   Use ublock   The prior on the cop lying in this instance would be 1%, and the family member would be 4%.  I had a typo above, sorry, you have a point.  My original comment still seems correct. Even if you believe the proportion of cops who would lie on some cases is higher than the proportion of family members who would lie, the proportion of cops who actually lie on a given case is lower than those who would lie on some case, but a family member has a much greater incentive to lie. After all, they're involved in the case.     http://hashingit.com/analysis/33-7-transactions-per-second  says the same, and it's from 2014.    A perfectly full 20mb block of transactions would net bitcoin a grand total of 56 transactions per second and it would lose most of its decentralized qualities.  Why? I know decentralization would go down, but I don't think it would be by that much.      Why not?  Making up some numbers, if the chance a cop is crooked is 1 in 10, the chance a crooked cop lies on any given case is 1 in 10, and the chance a random victim family member is crooked and lying is 1 in 25, then the family member has a 4 times lower prior of telling the truth than the cop does.  Edit: meant to say higher prior of lying.   The father said accident, the police said suicide, nobody involved said murder as far as I know.   And this is news because ...?   The justification is laid out completely in the [document filed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwzdZTHqha9tYkYtcUtaY1BsZjg/view)   I can only get sound on my mobile device, and can't watch 2 videos at once there.

I don't think I've seen the 700,000 figure before, but if it's accurate, and a significant amount were sold at $400, he could easily pay it all off.  Edit: They auctioned 130,000, I think: just an extra $150 on average from each is enough to cover that.  Further edit: they seized much less than 700,000, apparently only 174,000 or so. The question is whether Ross still has access to the rest.      of course spying is illegal but everyone does it  It's not illegal under US laws to spy on other countries. That's what the entire CIA is there for, basically.  It may be illegal under the other countries' laws, but someone revealing that one government is breaking the laws of a different government is generally called a traitor.  the biggest issue which Snowden uncovered was the scale of the spying, and the fact that the US spies on everyone including its own people which is a sign of authoritarian tendencies especially since it was done in secret and most likely against the US Consititution  If all he'd done was reveal illegal spying, I wouldn't have a problem. He revealed many programs that were completely legal, yet classified, and many programs that were against other countries, also legal under US law.    The first time it was cool, but the next 4 times it was a little boring. I'd much prefer $4 as a tip.

Edit: downvotes but no answers?   A crooked cop may be more common, but a crooked cop who lied on *this specific case* is less common.   I thought the question was between suicide/accident.

How to join ISIS boston bombers kill infidels nato oil war war war war   Above it says the police think it's suicide.   Sometimes, but they also have no training in finding the truth, and most people are just incompetent. It's like asking a random guy on the street who may have a bit more motivation.  Relatives also have motives for wanting a specific story. Police may also, but here the police were just reporting on what happened, and weren't involved.   It's surely possible that the US is exerting influence to embarrass him, but he's not facing any US charges.   Assange is hiding on charges of not using a condom in Sweden.

Ulbricht used an unlocked laptop with sensitive information that could and did land him a lifetime in jail in public with people around.  Don't mention his name and "properly" together, please.   This is both about a person that's involved with bitcoin, and illustrates a key selling point for bitcoin; that it can't be seized if held properly.  Both together seemed to make it on-topic, and at least 80 people have agreed so far.   Have you seen http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118440? Or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9310601?  See http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/    The insider trading was illegal, and it should probably stay illegal.  May I refer you to the sources [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/38dfc4/eli5_why_dont_tech_companies_simply_ignore_the/cruebie?context=1)?   Source?   According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act, no.   that's a pretty good sweet-ass bot   Insider trading should be legal, as many economists and others have said.  http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2015/Hooperharmed.html  http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2015/03/22/a-modern-insider-trading-law-would-recognize-the-victims-of-current-law/  http://business.time.com/2013/07/26/why-is-insider-trading-even-illegal/  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/26/insider-trading-makes-us-richer-better-informed-and-could-prevent-corporate-scandals-legalize-it/   /r/nocontext       Sort of, although that can be obscured as well, using Coinjoin. That basically means that multiple users all send in a merged transaction, so there's no way to tell which one owns which. There's code to do that at https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket  But what I was describing is different. Basically, you send bitcoin to a site that has a large "pool" of bitcoin, and they send different ones back to another address you own. So only that site knows which coins were which. If they delete logs (like they claim to), then nobody can tell even after the fact. There's one at https://bitmixer.io/index.html   Buy bitcoin, transfer to a mixing service, transfer to a new wallet, bam, you're anonymous. Cost of 1% or so. Rout the second wallet over VPN or tor for even greater anonymity.  Not that hard.   He does accept bitcoin, with his mega startup. Does that count?   /u/nathanielpopper, anything to say for yourself?    usually        Plot twist: all alts.   Not this again. If you don't like it, downvote and move on; I'm not going to have the exact same argument every time a submission is not directly related to bitcoin.  	149

According to the top comments, they are for a large part publicly funded, and the drug companies are pocketing the difference. Big Pharma is notoriously unethical.

I got tree fitty.   Here's one, although this article deals mainly with the danger associated with taking too much in one dose.  It does say this, however:  Tramadol is an increasingly commonly prescribed painkiller  prescriptions have almost doubled in the past seven years, from 5.9million in 2006 to 11.1million in September 2012.  Its popularity has soared partly because its cheap  now available as a non-branded generic drug, it costs the NHS 1.99 for 100 tablets.  Fears about other painkillers have also made tramadol an attractive option. Lizz's death is by no means an isolated case and highlights the dangers associated with a drug (Tramadol) too often regarded as the 'safer' option  Lizz's death is by no means an isolated case and highlights the dangers associated with a drug (Tramadol) too often regarded as the 'safer' option  The non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) are linked to side-effects such as indigestion, stomach ulcers, a perforated gut.  One of these drugs, Vioxx, was withdrawn in 2005 because of a link to heart attack and stroke.  Meanwhile, another painkiller, co-proxamol, was withdrawn after concerns about it being used in suicides.  Tramadol  which also comes under brand names including Zydol and Zamadol  is a synthetic opioid drug, similar to natural opioids derived from poppy seeds, such as morphine.  Its prescribed to prevent or treat moderate to severe pain after surgery, toothache or long-term pain conditions including back pain, fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  Tramadol is regarded by many doctors as a weaker opioid. But in fact it has the same risks of overdose as with morphine.   I despise Xanax and the effects it has on people. I think they should stop prescribing it altogether.     Adderall or K-pins cut my anxiety when I need. Although long term use and high dosage of those is not much better in terms of harm to your body.   Its your body, man. But I would be extremely careful with that shit. Just my two cents. Look into it yourself online.   You have really tried everything else?    I'll take your finest chemical cocktail, on the rocks.   I heard this shit is *extremely* bad for your organs.    I'll allow it.   Please don't let this be North Korea.   I would beat the shit out of said best friend.   If he's associating with that guy as a best friend, I think he has a right to know that said friend is a piece of shit.   The truth shall set you free.    "I can't feel my legs, Forrest..."   Craigslist is great for used electronics, depending on where you're located. I would definitely supplement your ebay postings with identical posts on craigslist. Since the CL posting is free, there is no risk of loss for you. If the item sells through CL, then you remove it from eBay and vice versa.    "Jersey Devil, you're my only friend."   I love you.   The social is the hardest piece of necessary information to obtain these days. Everything else tends to be pretty easily accessible online.  When I stopped selling on ebay, i wasn't too disappointed as fees were increasing and final selling prices were waning. I started selling locally on Craigslist with better results, and have also recently considered opening an Etsy store because much of the stuff I deal with is vintage/antique.   The main reason I stopped selling on eBay however was Paypal.    In other news... the amount of people killed yearly by falling/malfunctioning/hacked drones is about to increase.   Ok, now lemme get a recipe for bangin' Pot-Pesto.   Texas license plate: Check  Anti-Obama bumper sticker: Check  4x4 w/ steel bars over the grill and headlights for running down illegals in the desert: Check   With how susceptible their company/customer information is to electronic theft/hacking, I would be worried about having anything like that on file with them. Fortunately my life was not inconvenienced in the least when I deactivated my account and discontinued use of their terribly inconvenient service.       Get 'em, Gronk!    That my friend, is neither fun nor harmless.    What is this, Uber Africa?   Breaking News: Kanye admits he's wrong for the first, and likely only time in his life.    Seen it a thousand times. Fuck her. You'll be better off without her, whether alone or with someone better.   Trust me. Been there.    Last time I tried to sign up for PayPal, they demanded a copy of my Drivers License, SOCIAL SECURITY CARD, and recent utility bill.  Who in their right mind would send this terrible company a digital copy of their SOCIAL SECURITY CARD?    Not sure, but looks like a Garter Snake... which is pretty much the most common and harmless of all the snake brethren.    It probably will be soon.   Also, as far as the feathers on top of the hat, do you think they could be eagle feathers? They looked quite large. I feel like that would be appropriately symbolic.    I actually just saw it today at a local used book store that I used to work at, while browsing. The owner goes to a lot of auctions and estate sales so they have stuff all over the place. I am probably going to go back and buy it tomorrow, because he'll probably give it to me for around $10. Either way, I will certainly snap a photo(s) of it and post some links. It's quite an interesting piece.   The style of the crown itself was more identical to the first one you linked to.    Hey, thanks for that great info. In the symbol I saw, the crown was much smaller in proportion to the triangle and positioned entirely inside the triangle, at the center. That could simply be because it is older than the medal you linked to. I would say you are most likely correct and that my hat is the hat of a royal arch mason from the early 1900's. Thanks again.     I think you should capitalize all the words in your title, correct?     So... you gonna eat that?   Bless you.   Are you lying, bro?   Am... am I pregnant?   As simple as this symbol seems, I can't seem to locate another example anywhere. It is that of a simple thin golden triangle with a crown in the center. The crown looks similar to that which the British use in their military insignias from WW1.   Unfortunately I did not snap a picture of the exact logo. I would however be able to update tomorrow with one if necessary. The symbol is located front and center of the hat above the brim. The hat is in very rough condition, as it is very old. The hat manufacturer is called The M. C. Lilley Co. and they were established a few years after the civil war and are based out of Ohio USA. They are known for manufacturing military gear/uniforms as well as Masonic gear/uniforms. I could not locate the symbol, or anything similar, while using various keywords related to both subjects.   Oddly, there are also large feathers sort of woven into the top of the hat. Not sure if that is original or was done after the fact.  Any help identifying this triangle/crown symbol would be greatly appreciated!   Great answer, thanks man! I will do some research with the link you provided.    Da fuck you lookin at nigga?   WTF am i looking at? I love it.   What made these and how were they made?  I imagine this is what it looks like to smoke DMT while tripping on acid.    That's how Qdoba gets their meat.

 All depends on how far you can see.    Nah we just like to live dangerously. :D   Camera bike is indeed a 10r   You wouldn't change gears there though would you? I mean, you ride first for a bit before hooking second.    Try 'em with cream cheese, that's my tip! :D   Yes sir! Well spotted.   Lake Mountain, VIC. Get into it!    That's stunning slow mo! I wanna know why the extra clutch grab once the bike was already up - that's odd. Watching what happens on the throttle side is pretty scary too.    Lucky man. Last time a chain snapped on me it whipped up, beheaded an indicator, chainsawed the ducktail and made a bit of a mess inside the sprocket cover. I had a passenger on too, thank christ the chain guard did its job.    Heh heh can't be too careful eh! Anyway, I'm the guy in front on the grandpa bike.    I woulda spent some time making it loop better if gfycat gave you fine control. Top piece of road but!       Ganglebangers.    How about this one?   Samsung 'Dinner Party': http://youtu.be/0ZzF2UO13T0   Samsung owner here - Samsung ads make my fucking skin crawl. I'm with ya.    Eeeeeverybodyyyy jerrrrrks... Sooooome tiiiiiiiiiiiimes.....   It's almost as if they want the west to go in and attack them.   What about those of us who think it plays directly into the hands of the enemy? It's what these pricks have been begging for all along.   If you go out trying to be a dick to people, and people say "you're being a dick" you shouldn't act all surprised. OP baited christians and reeled one in, of course he's being disrespectful. That was the point all along.    My point is whoever made the sticker knew they were being disrespectful, as did the person that stuck it on their car. There's no reason to have it if you're not baiting.    These days, just something some christians stick on their cars.    Why would you get that sticker if you weren't being disrespectful? It's a Jesus fish with a different god in it.  It's designed to be disrespectful.    It was a beautiful reminder of our mortality and how fleeting youth and beauty can be. I watched it on the shitter and shed a tear while wiping my butt. That was an odd experience.    Indeed. Could have cut down on the wank factor.    99% invisible steps into those areas occasionally and is otherwise pretty beaut.    That and it made my penis go numb.    Hahaha indeed!   No point in doing reviews if you can't find a way to have a whinge. That's why I've gotta stop doing superbikes, what the hell can your average mug like me say about those things?        Told me? I was official scorekeeper!   My brother managed 10 times in 2 hours the first time he tried ecstasy.    Tough luck pac-man. You're eating the brown pills today.    It's a joke that reveals what you think about the situation.    You are blaming the victim, that's exactly what you're doing. Heaps of people take naked pictures of themselves, for whatever reason, and that's their business, and if they fuck up and put it in the wrong place that's their fault. If somebody steals them from a place they believe is secure, that's another entirely. They probably had no idea that their stuff was going to the cloud. It's all automatic.    They're a really nice little bike. Engine from the days when you didn't have to rev the piss out of them. Would make a good stunter. Have fun!    Could be the other way round. Screaming kids are an excellent motivator to want to get fucked up.    Gorgeous road.    Vine needs to fuck off and die. Sweet jam though!    Still gives me chills.   I sure did. Hope the video gave y'all a giggle! http://youtu.be/VohU0IjYUCY   I'm just on a plane now, the captain came on and said whatever the fuck he had to say and my brother said "nobody cares, John. Drive the fucking bus."   Your brother can start another PS3 user account...   "You might say he's Kelloggian, is that a word?" is how I heard it...   The Easter Basket is what it's called round here.    Jeez, it was dragging on the ground for less than half a second and it still got cheese grated through the leather.   I accidentally gave it a try.  It went OK.   Best for fun: speed triple.    Fuck you, I don't have to like it. I like watching great players struggle to overcome obstacles, not have rings handed to them.    Absolutely stunning work. Sheer magnificence.    They should wheel him out and sit him in a corner somewhere to throw lobs and nail threes and be devastatingly nice to opponents.    No Gazey. :(   God yes.   Good for quick cheap prototyping and full color models. The results can be hardened to a pretty solid form by soaking in some sort of glue. Stuff that isn't post treated in this way can start flaking in the finicky bits. But yeah, very cheap as they use regular 80gsm paper.    Wow, I never realised he was no jive-talkin' wigger.   Holy shit, different suspension for front and rear? Where do I sign?   Cleveland: the new Heatles. I was ready to get behind LeBron, but superteams are just icky.   As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.  Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers.   The fountain of youth... I think that's what happens when we try to change his nappy.      I dunno where in the world you are, but it's generally about as much as a Panigale.    The EBR possibly steers and handles a touch quicker, it's very enjoyable in corners. The BMW has a more flexible and more powerful engine, but it's a total computer bike and something like 33% of them have reliability issues, is what I'm reading. They've all got their individual character that will speak to different riders.    But... But I wasn't! I was saying it's a better all-rounder!    End of the day, Erik wants to be in that top 3, and he wants to race at the highest level.    The SX is basically exactly the same bike with the plastics off. Same gearing, same power, same torque and yep, same clutch. Better start working your forearm muscles!    Well cheers mate. I did a vid on your bike too, couple years back: Ducati Multistrada 1200 S Review: http://youtu.be/zyZ64Ef-yaY   On the bike, it's a Sena 20S headset (SMH10 would be almost as good and cheaper), through a GP10 backpack thingy for the GoPro. Wind noise is cancelled to virtually zero, and the audio is synced straight up with the vision. You can also record intercom conversations if you're out with multiple riders.  It's a great motovlogging setup, being able to talk on the bike means I don't have to shoot nearly as much footage off the bike as I used to - so I'm less reliant on having a cameraman around!  More info: http://www.gizmag.com/sena-20s-video-review/33093/   Haha bush mechanics FTW!   That's fine in theory - but I'd say looks play a big part in the majority of bike buying decisions, like it or not!      Cheers! I'm gonna get a sleep study done in the next couple weeks. Thanks for the feedback.    Hey there - I'm sleeping like shit and starting to investigate the idea of a CPAP machine too. What do you reckon? Worth a go? Did they make you feel more rested in the mornings?   I'd get more distortion at 12 mm. I reckon this is a 16 mm.    I think you need to put him on the level of guys like Valentino Rossi and Michel Schumacher - who not only dominated their sports, they transcended them to the point where the whole world started to take notice.   Fair go, he led the league in a pretty significant stat category this year, as well as leading the league in dunks. I think there's a discussion to be had.    Looks a bit like Michael Jackson.    Me too - bear with me here, I might be completely off track, but imagine the ball is your bodyweight. You come down hard on the shoe. The old shoes dissipate that force and don't bounce you back up. The new shoes seem to return most of that downward force back upwards.  How is that a good thing?   A ball would bounce much higher on concrete than on a trampoline.    ...wouldn't that throw more landing shock back up through the knee?   How many people burned their jerseys though? 20 would seem like a high number to me.    He was put on this earth to make the rest of us feel lazy.    ...riiiiiight...   Deke Sharon did a version I think.    Prostate massage would be doubly penetrative.    That's certainly what I thought when I saw it. Maybe it originated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Do5Nc8yIjk   NO TAG FOR YOU   "I like motorcycles because ANUS."  Fair enough.     Passionate and talented writers, photographers and filmmakers are exactly the people they should be giving prime access to. This is great publicity for everyone. He's demonstrated his ability, both to create strong content and to get it seen. He should get a press pass to whatever he wants now.    It's a 7 footer's move, and a really hard one. Big guys get it super easy all the way into the NBA. You'd need a very rare package of size, coordination, skill and dedication to develop that shot.    You just drill riders into your stock triples, you don't need to get a whole new jigger!    KTM motorcycles all use WP suspension - stands for White Power but I think they're fairly keen to move on from that. :)   Aye, and a flat bar too.    Fair few there I'd never seen before... Awesome!   Nope. But go nuts if you're worried. You'll start out pretty slow - remember you're watching some super skilled riders in these clips. You're a god damned champion if you start hitting those kinds of lean angles.    I often go out to an empty carpark at night and run slow circles and figure 8s with a buddy or two. It's fucking hard work but you come away feeling like a god.    I dunno, he looked pretty fuckin' buggered when he hit the bench!    Scary motherfucker.    Wade shits me no end, and this play is part of the reason. Gets the great dunk, then goes out of his way to turn around and step over the guy to try to create a Pippen/Iverson moment. Wanker.    Best bike in the whole world ever.    A mate stacked my bike years ago, and it had ball-marks in the tank too. I just can't think of what else could cause it...    Degrees cost a lot of money. All well and good to get good marks, but some people are in it to learn stuff and challenge themselves!    God, he looked stiff as a board to me. It looked like everything hurt.    Ugh. Got his money's worth, I guess...   Retina MBP is what I use, it's a beauty. The extra resolution is incredibly useful on a a small screen.    Yeah I'm not seeing that kind of nonchalant dominance out of the 2014 Draft class... At least, not yet.    Deng was an iron man in Chicago. He'll be a key piece if the heat do well.    Great collection, she can be proud!   Godspeed, Teabag Tornado.   http://i.imgur.com/EXe1oDz.jpg   I thought the judder was Dani chucking a tanty.    He's one of those guys with a stupid face.    "This shoe is as wide as yo momma's ass.    Search eBay for "size 12 4E" and you can pick from all the shoes of the rainbow.  Source: fellow barge foot.    Dominique.    He's a real nickelbucketpuncher, that guy, yeah.    The one dunk I ever got in a basketball game. I should add, it was a D-grade women's game and I was refereeing at the time.   I'd spent several hours a day between the ages of 17 and 20 obsessed with trying to dunk. But as a 5'11 white guy the odds were stacked against me. Still, when the stars aligned I could get up there, I just couldn't quite palm the ball to get it down. A volleyball? No worries. A netball? I was throwing those down like Dr. J. Basketballs just eluded me.   So there I am, bored out of my mind reffing this game, and one of the girls lumbers out on a "fast" break. I'm jogging behind her, the layup goes up, time slows down and my pupils dilate.   I saw the sit - the ball was going to teeter on the front of the rim. I could just feel it. And instinct kicked in. I wasn't going to miss my chance.   I took three quick steps and launched, grabbed the ball, and slammed it down with all my strength, shouting like a caveman. I landed triumphantly, threw my head back and hollered.   And then I saw the confused faces of the players, blew my whistle and gave somebody a sideball.   Best part was, as we got started again a kid on the sideline burst out in tears, wailing "no Jordans! No Jordans! "  Made my year.    I thought it roughly translated to "oh my god I finally got some attention, now I have no idea what to do with it. "  	115
 actually you caught it iirc   don't worry..they now made it so no one can watch it....   6pm tonight iirc   haha its cool...i was planning on typing it out myself   HAHA way to post while game still going.   if you watch from the mlg site there is a pull down with says "streams". Select Starcraft Blue(or if you are a gold member select premium 1/premium2) to view other matches being broadcast. If you use twitch to view I think its twitch.tv/mlgstarcraftb. If you watch from embedded player in Team Liquid select MLG Blue instead of MLG Red.   Basically its a second stream with premier casters/games. Yesterday it was used to broadcast WCS. Today it will probably be stream end of that tourni and/or other games from MLG brackets.   blue stream   take your first maurader and pull scv's and go win with that force? Alternatively...super early 3rd   there is another guy who posted asking for a ride...maybe you two could swap and trade off etc? http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ynh64/mlg_raleigh_this_weekend/   i think its more that the Seattle fans have been begging for a real tournament event and they thought they finally got one only to actually be getting a UMS map.

I live in VA and have friends who went last year say it was very lack luster    aren't the 8 open spots just the qualifiers from open bracket like normal? Or is there an additional 8 spots?   not really. He aid every time he has watched supernova he has gone bio first game and mech second game vs zerg.

Remember WCS NA is at the event too   Notes as I go through  * 2nd depot too early...should be built by scv that is building rax(heck you could even go 2nd CC before 2nd supply depot) * it seems to me like your two gases are really late(especially since you have 150 minerals left still after you build them) * also you said you wanted to do early pressure with helions....so why 3 rax? that's counter-intuitive. if you place 2x refinery down after expansion you can go into reactor expand pretty quickly. * you built rax on high ground and then lowered them to low ground....just build them on low ground if you want to use them to wall off...better would be supply depot wall off. * a scan around 6:30 would be really nice so you could no if he is all inning you or has taken a quick 3rd as you have 0 scouting * good news: at 7 minute mark you are ahead on workers. bad news: its bc your opponent is not droning hard. lol * ALSO. 1000 minerals floating at 7 minutes!!!!! Thats so much! Thats 2 CC's or 20 marines that you could be pushing with... * at the 10 minute mark you still have 0 scouting...what if he has mutas? also...still floating money...also you only have 45 scv's...try to hit 50 off a 1 rax expand at 10 minute mark...also you are just starting upgrades. no bueno * at the end your opponent is floating 2k/2k....a good zerg would kill you with that.  not trying to be harsh...just saying if you can clean up these issues you will be even better :)    they showed the winner...AMD   I posted this replay a while ago...sounds like the +1/+1 medivac push i do thats built off of polt  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476   i think he a paragraph  EDIT OH SNAP ITS MY CAKE DAY!   this sounds nice in theory but i don't no about practically. In the TvT i don't think my factory had started when i saw blue flame...i rushed to starport and didn't get anything out until after his harass with banshees.  I was trying to use those first helions to pick off some lings and i definitely got caught not looking at them...i failed to raise my depot in my main which is what really cost me the game(my frustration at the end was bc i kept trying to raise it and it wouldn't raise). Doesn't building a second factory mean i'm forced into mech? I HATE playing mech.    So in my last 6 matches I've lost all of them to early pressures/all ins or styles of build that i saw coming and I reacted to obviously poorly. For example. I was playing a TvT...saw he had 13 gas and I was playing 1 rax fe style. I scanned again around 6 minutes and saw he was doing the blue flame helion/cloaked banshee build. I built turrets in my mineral line and bunkers for my marines. I suffered some damages from the banshees because my opponent exploited the areas i din't have covered by turrets but overall i thought i was minimal....but still my build is thorzain build which masses marines which SUCK against blue flame helion as i found out when i went for a +1/+1 medivac timing ....so whats the appropriate way to respond?  Likewise, each of my last 5 games against zerg have been roach/bane or bane/ling all ins that i scout with my scan...i put up multiple bunkers in reaction(to the reactionary race yeah right) and I still can't hold any of these.   TLDR-I need help understanding how to react to builds i see  REPLAYS:  * vs Random who ended up being zerg http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=268966  * vs terran  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=268967     i believe i saw something about a way to stand up in such a way that lowers the naseausness from doing pushups...I believe it was something like plant feet-slowly roll up while keeping chin tucked-raise head   So I watched this game and I believe you are asking the wrong question. A better question you should be asking yourself is why did I lose this game? Now it seems to me that the answer you have come up with is colossus..but that is not actually the point where you lost the game. I'm going to remark on a couple of things i saw that were glaring to me  * you open with 2 rax b ut never put on aggression sacrificing economy for an army you do nothing with. Please note the filtersc 1 rax expand and try it, learn it love it.  * you make your expansion in your m ain...you can actually make that at  your natural and build 1 bunker earlier to keep yourself safe. This will kick start your economy.  * at the 15 minute mark you still didn't have 50 workers. With a 1 rax expand the goal is to 50 workers by the 10 minute mark. meaning your economy was worse  * add ons...you actually can't afford to constantly produce out of the number of barax with those add ons...this led to you cutting scv's and delaying crucial tech like medivacs  this is just general comments....here is an example of me facing a protoss and my play. note my scv count at the 10 minute mark and when i push(roughly between 10 and 11 minutes). Don't worry about the first push i did where I pulled scv's as i did that based on scouting the early nexus and is not something you should be worried about. Note my ghost academy comes down with my 3rd and my upgrades are decent ish...   Over all look at the filtersc timing guide for vs protoss..master it...win  :D http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=268850   can you attach a specific replay? i can give you general advice but a specific game might help better analyze what YOU specifically need to do.   in general it looks like he built a lot of cannons and tried to mass produce colossi and in general didn't spend his money. Remember that resource score also takes into account "unspent minerals" so its not the accurate of measures...he only had 50 probes to your 70 scv's + mules..you had a better economy by far.  yes...don't focus on targeting any specific units right now(except for maybe hotkeying your vikings and using them to target colossi). i'm in high plat and i'm JUST getting to the point where i can identify when target firing is beneficial. Rely on that macro :)   for a large part of the beginning of the game your main is not rallied to minerals so that provided worse eco for you..just a heads up  put those units in your bunker! if he had attacked with a couple sentries/zealots(which with what you scouted to this point aka double gas) would mean death to you  he failed to use his extra minerals on gateways/zealots. bad on him  look like when you maxed you either moved commanded or targeted the colossi with you bio resulting in you getting wrecked  in the end your marco ended up winning you the game...yay!   hmmm i've never noticed then using own3d for an arena...which have been where i've had issues. you could be right.   So I tuned into the LOL arena on MLG's page and right away i notice the Own3d logo. I'm really hoping they go this route for the future SC2 tournis too as twitch's ability to provide service has been fairly lackluster to this point.   He forgot to attack. He let Hero build up the air attack. He should have backed up and let the infestors regain energy...oh and he also received the InControl Kiss of Death.   I think the general consensus is that the builds you need to know are  all variations of the one rax expand  TvT:Thorzain Build - Covered in a Day 9 Daily TvP:Bomber Build - Covered in a Day 9 Daily. TvZ:3 CC helion/banshee???? I'm actually not sure on this one. I do the Polt TvZ build covered in a Day9 Daily  I'm not a huge fan of Day but he does map these builds out pretty well and they should probably be your next step. However, Don't be afraid to stick with Filters 1 rax expand and start trying to react. You should be to the point where your macro is good enough to start testing out compositions/responses      a replay would be preferable but honestly pure macro should win you most games in silver. Remember that vs zerg your 10 minute push is to destroy his 3rd..if he doesn't have a 3rd(and you know this by scouting/scanning) then you can take your own third and start pressuring with drops. Those upgrades seem late. My 10 minute push hits with +1/+1   I'm only going to comment on the TvP as I don't feel knowledgeable enough in TvT to help you there.  * 1)you placed that second supply depot way way to early. Either the scv building your rax should start it right after the rax OR that scv should build your 2nd CC when you only have one marine and after that you build your 2nd depot. not game ending but less efficient * 2)I personnally feel like your bunker is a little late...if he marches right across the map with a stalker and zealot you're screwed. * 3)THIS IS THE BIGGEST: IF HE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPANSION BY THE 6:30-7Minute mark(which btw is a great time to scan) YOU HAVE TO BUNKER UP.  The build works assuming your opponent is macroing too...but now you have to start learning about what you are scouting and what it means and reacting appropriately. Hope that helps :)   i believe it was because every MLG we were basically taking over the front page and so everyone voted to not show top /r/starcraft  stuff   on the medivacs one i would suspect second gas goes up right when the starport starts...maybe slightly before. It seemed like a deviation of the polt two base marine push and i know thats the timing of the second gas in that build   they are clapping to the beat of the song silly    Yeah I'm almost to the end of my second week. It is a very good program...although i don't know if i like it as much as p90x. I feel like i'm putting some muscle and some fat...we will see   league? i don't want to be offering my plat advice if you are masters bc my advice is probably worthless then.   Dargleins Micro Trainer. learn it, live it, love it...get dat APM   For me I turtle until i feel like I can control the muta flock(usually means one thor in the main and enough marines/turrets to protect each base in regards to the size of his flock-ie 7 mutas = less marines than 20 mutas). As soon as i feel safe i push out onto the map. Mutas are bad in straight up fights against upgraded marines and are used for map control, the sooner you can take that map control away the better imo. Please correct me if I'm doing this wrong master/diamond players   front page for this subreddit there is a place to assign flair on the left hand side near the top   no he isn't even in New York. said so on his twitter and in this subreddit yesterday.   Here are two replays of me vs zerg comp(just to show the builds). I \'m trying to decide which one is better. I currently do a late push with +1/+1 but that can mean i get shutdown by fungals. The earlier push would hit before high tier tech but be much weaker imo. Does it being earlier make up for that?  Early push: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267798  Later Push:http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267799   TIL Having mothership is useless without archons to use for archon toilet   game 1 cytoplasm vs hero is good. everything else was pretty one side. apparently Sasquatch was really close to beating Alicia but that wasn't shown on stream   its because adebisi isn't observing :(    yes. i just got a steel series and xperia play ad.   log in to mlg site. click the live tourniment at the top. Presto premium stream!   Why not hot key army to 5/6/7 since then you wont have to worry about relearning the other 4 production hotkeys? 5/6/7 are close enough to all major action buttons(T-stim, S/d-siege/unsiege, D-drop units, E-EMP) that you can hit all pretty easy. I have my army on 8/9/0 and i can do these well so i suspect you can too with groups even closer!   what about the monthly pass? its $20 per month and for me the price is worth it.   protoss don't seem to be going storm first any more in plat/low diamond. Maybe once i move up but its not something i have to concern myself with currently.   So right now here is my approach vs each race:   vs Protoss: I want to hit an early game timing. Needs to hit before the 11 minute mark as that's when first colossi tends to come out. I went to keep upgrades going. My Ghost academy should start when i take my third. I want the protoss to attack into me in a late game engagement so that I can maintain an arc and get EMP's. Later game Planetary Fortresses to create chokes while slowly transitioning to 3/3 BattleCruisers + ghosts w/ nukes.  vs Zerg - I want to deny the 3rd as long as possible: Including Ebay blocks. I want to have some early game harass(ie helions or marines in a bunker at the opponent 3rd). I want to feint pushes(walk to zelnaga's and back to my base) to try and force units instead of drones. I want fast upgrades(double ebay). I personally try to hit a strong +1/+1 stim medivac timing. Mass drops to allow me to build economy and start pressuring multiple locations. PREVENT 4th BASE at all costs!  vs Terran: Don't die in the early game....   As you can see I don't really have a good vs terran game plan. I don't know how to react to gas first if i'm planning on fast expand etc. How are you approaching each matchup from a high level   haha i'm platinum now using macro style games to improve. ^.^ Maybe i just suck at all in builds lol   bad english..i meant 4 medivacs total. Its the ideal composition for the terran late game deathball(or so i'm told). edited my previous statement for clarity   i keep seeing people say this but when i was playing 3 rax was geting stomped in silver. I think you should learn macro style as it helps you more once you get in the high leagues.   a)no banshees ever b)after he shows DT's u drop several mules...need those scans c)Lets assume we want to win off of 2 bases...maybe 3. watch your money as you attack...we need to keep it low so when we win a fight in the early game we can snowball our advantage d)UPGRADES..GET EM EARLY AND OFTEN e)you need 4 medivacs total and 3 vikings per a colossi....you had 10 ish medi's and 5 vkings which you suicided trying to kill A colossi f)once you do get to let game...you have to start dropping planetaries, making ghost and let the protoss attack into you...its the best way to be cost effective  EDITED for clarity   it seems you have trouble marcoing while attacking. You were floating a lot of money. Also you always attacked in one place with your army allowing the protoss to fight in the death ball. You want to make him split up. Think of it as zerg. If you are at 3 and main at same time...one will be damaged. These are theories of SC2 that will help you in all matchups. I'm not going to nitpick micro cuz i'm plat too.   if you could pretty please link a replay? Its really hard to know how to advise you with out seeing how you currently play. It might be that you are doing a build that is countered by the current meta...or something that is small. At the plat level templar first has been pretty much phased out to heavy colossi play since templar can be abuse so easy   yeah i can't even connect to the site. so sad :(   yeah i can't connect to that :(   either is fine...i'd prefer the premium as i pay for it.   6:00 am eastern and I can't connect to gomtv.net to launch the live player for the Code A stream. It just seems offline. Any one have link to launch stream or instructions on how to do so from within the player?   that same tourni(MLG) Tubby beat Huk right after iNcontrol lost. He just didn't get the flack   did you even watch the games? Naniwa showcased brilliant innovation today.   has 103 subscribers and isn't active lol   I am getting a lot of lag on twitch and i have 25MB down currently. Any one else having issues. Located in USA on EST...I'm talking about lag on 360 even..   you mean something like this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ddChqJ9Gn-IWEjlp0NmLcpy2WfEGbPs6qrf02j-TQrY/edit  and this: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5IWP8i6HN_vZ2F3NWhkN3lRRFN2Z2lYT0dWVFMtUQ/edit   i felt my drops got shut down pretty tightly.   how do i keep the concave while attacking? I tried to spread out but as soon as i start attacking in everything balls up. :-/   EDIT: actually even better question...what is my priority list of things to do in an engagement. I know i need to EMP, target fire Vikings, stim, and kite. What is my priority on what order i need to do those?   i don't...i lose even when up 11 bases to 4      you should look at the filtersc tutorials(located on the right hand bar). While I could critique the facts that you expand slowly, don't scout, and don't macro particularly well those don't play a big roll in bronze/silver level play. Watch the guides. Perform them and you should start winning.     i haven't down voted anyone at all. :( I'm sad someone else has  EDIT: I just went through and upvoted everyone so that everyone is back where they were before the other person downvoted.   the theory is..if your opponent is fast expanding, if i do an immediate CC I will not compromise my army or my infrastructure and rather that both will be immensely stronger than the normal 1 rax fe. I'll have to go through my replay tonight to see if I'm correct in thought   you keep the 3rd in base until its safe to move out(approx 9 minute mark)  	79
 Most comparisons suggest that self-care approaches are a bit less effective than direct face-to-face therapy, but some show no real difference. And most self-care approaches are pretty weak entities (the largest body of work has to do with the impact of being told "Go read this self-help book"). We spend a lot of time worrying about face-to-face effectiveness, but our other approaches are generally fairly primitive.  I suppose my point is that there is a logical fallacy in some of the reasoning around the importance of the alliance. Studies do show that in face to face therapy the quality of the alliance is a (actually 'the') major determinant of outcome.  The fallacy is assuming that the presence of a relationship is therefore essential. This entails a hidden assumption that the relationship "adds" something important.  But the research showing the importance of the alliance in face-to-face outcome doesn't address the importance of having a therapist in the room. It simply says IF there is a therapist in the room, the quality of the relationship is important.  I'm raising the possibility that one reason the alliance is important is that a poor one (or a poor therapist) can degrade the experience below that of a non-face-to-face form of therapy. So one could as easily say that having a therapist in the room is a risk as a benefit.  My guess is that a face to face encounter is generally a positive addition to therapy, but that the much of the variability in outcome has to do with decrements brought about by the alliance, not just benefits.      Yup, otherwise I'll only be talking from my own perspective. And an 18 year old has 18 years of 24 hour a day experience as a human being - that's about 3 PhDs-worth.   I'm a psychologist and author (The Assertiveness Workbook, Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help.   People often spend a huge amount of effort trying to feel better and feel that their progress is slow or nonexistent. But what if the goal was to go the other way - what would you do?  Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself MORE unhappy for that 10th day than you have been for the past week.  The fine print: You can only do or change three things in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up. I may quote your replies but will not mention your identity in a writeup.  I know, I know: No amount of money is worth it, etc. But thankfully it's a thought experiment, not a contract. And sometimes looking at what we could be doing to make it worse (and aren't) can help us see what we are actually accomplishing.  Anyway, that's my pitch. Thanks for reading.

The New York strip is the bigger cut on the right. If you look at the steak the pieces at the tip are more cooked then the pieces that are closer to the bone, that's why I like this cut for my wife and I, we can each take the pieces that we like. I didn't make this steak but the classic way is kosher salt and pepper on a hot grill over high heat for 3 to 5 minutes until a nice crust forms, flip with tongs and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or longer if you want it done more. let sit to allow the juices to redistribute and cut and serve.      Like everyone else, salt and pepper, dry mustard is also good or a little Old Bay Seasoning is another favorite. I also like to use the package of mixed cheese ends that you can find in most stores and deli's, they usually have a mix of american, cheddar, swiss, pepper jack and others. Make a roux, add the cubed cheeses and stir until combined, always works for me.

I then sauteed some mushrooms, carrots, onions and a left over small head of broccoli with butter. Then added half a box of beef stock and three tbls of Oyster Sauce, added the leftover meat and let that reduce for a couple of minutes then poured everything into a large baking dish, covered with the mashed potatoes, dotted with butter and baked off in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes then finished for 10 minutes at 400, remove and let cool before serving. I really don't know why I didn't take pics during the making of the slow cooker pulled pork or the shepards pie. I made this ramen with the leftover pepperoni ham and cheese stuffed pork chops from my superbowl dinner http://imgur.com/a/8cdy8   Sweet! I made a shepards pie with my pulled pork leftovers the other day. I just love getting a few meals from one dinner, don't you?   Yea, I think you just need another egg. Biscotti can take a lot of abuse like albino-rhino said. It's a very forgiving cookie to practice on if you don't have a lot of experience. I would invest in a mixer, it would be entirely worth it. Check out your local estate sales, look at the pics and see if there are any mixers available. I check mine all the time for sales and stuff.          I know the Safe and the Fappenning were very popular posts but one of the ones I keep thinking about is the one where a woman redditer posts a spread sheet of the non sex and her reasons for refusing her husband sent her just before she went on a 10 day business trip. http://www.reddit.com/user/throwwwwaway29 I wonder what has happened since?   Which post has left you wondering, what was the story behind it and what happened after?   Nice pic! Thanks. Why not post to /r/nycfood and or /r/Brooklyn    One opened at 68 street at the corner at the Alpine Movie theater (which I can't believe is still open!) and became a doughnut shop, there was another across from the theater and is now an Arabic store. One foolishly opened up right across the street from them and is now a Halal place and one opened up between Ovington and 72street and lasted about 6 months. Gino's has the banks and all the doctors offices on 75, Originals has the subway and the kids from the High school on 67.      Try the squares at Elegante's and then decide. Original is ok pizza.   Thrifted the first William Zinsser book a while ago and just got to it. It was a nice read and was looking into getting his popular On Writing Well and was going to order a Kindle Edition for $8.50 and decided for no particular reason and found it later in the day and I'm sure it was NOT there yesterday! :)      I picked up Writing Places by William Zinsser because it looked interesting on a thrift store visit a few weeks ago and just got to it. It was a good read and I looked into finding his On Writing Well which seems to be very popular so I was going to order a Kindle edition for $8.50 but thought i would wait a bit for no particular reason. I went to my thrift store again even though I was there yesterday and lo and behold his book was on a shelf! It was NOT there the day before. SWEET! It's not an updated edition but still very readable.      If you can try Elegante Pizza on 5th Av bt 69 street and Ovington in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. This family has been making great pizza since the late 70's. The best squares in the state. Just good pizza, so good I know for a fact that they have closed down 4 pizzerias who were foolish enough to open within a block of them and they are the last to raise their prices. Nothing but good pizza.

There's a guy on Tiny House Swoon (I think) who is building a home in a container on the back of an 18 wheeler and of course you know about this guy http://lifestyle.boredombash.com/man-converts-truck-into-home/ right?

It's the same with Katz, they don't make their own pastrami and soon it'll be $20 bucks or more for a sandwich. :(   Your absolutely correct! With so much info on reddit, pinterest and other online sources it's almost criminal what there are doing. There are so many DIY projects and so many cheap ways to create power I have no idea where these people minds are at. Again it's fine if it was just them as a couple but to subject their kids to such extremes I think it's shameful.

Read a recipe through at least 3 times before you even begin to assemble the misc en place.   A program, an app or a disk that someone can use to clean a computer to when it was factory brand new?   Oswald was a patsy, he actually tried to save Kennedy by warning the FBI but was ignored.                  I agree, but bringing little kids into the woods with no electricity? No lights other than candles when it gets pitch black at night? The guy's got no family, friends to help him build the dam house? He HAS to do it himself? As a couple ok but to be with NO communications? What happens if one of the kids fall and hurt themselves? Wait for the father to come back and walk/carry the kid to town? Crazy.   Maybe they should have built the house first and of course the kids are going to be at each other, what else do they have to do?   WOW! Incredible, thanks.

 Hell yeah. I was doing pretty bad on game I was trying to not ks my team and spread kills but what ended up happening was me going 1-9-20. A butt load is assist. And I was a monster late game split pushing like crazy. So if he knows what he is doing udyr is a force to reckoned with.    Didn't know about this. I knew if the minions chase you in a bush then it's warded. That's the only one I knew  	2

 Well at least he made his point.             I think it's SHIELD 2.0 I think some agents from Agents of Shield may cameo at the end as well. Who else are they gonna get to run it? Would be awesome if Coulson returned for a cameo as well.       Good lord. That cpu cooler.    some people don't have room for a desktop and a desktop doesn't have the portability of a laptop.    can you post the temps in Celsius please? I hate trying to read temps in Fahrenheit.      That's what I mean. With Civil War marvel has now dug themselves into a hole they cant get out of. Now in future solo movies they'll have to come up with some crap excuse as to why Cap cant help out Black Panther or something because after Civil War fans will be questioning these things more and more.    After civil war everyone is going to be asking why Iron Man isn't in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or why Captain America isn't in Thor Ragnarok. I think marvel have created an in inescapable situation here with civil war where they have essentially killed their own solo films by making civil war basically avengers 2.5 and now all the fans will be wondering why certain characters wont be in other characters solo films. Is the age of the solo film done?   FlashForward. That cliffhanger had me in tears. still pissed they canceled it.             One weeks not so bad I guess. Hopefully they do it soon and get it out of the way.    Anyone know if there will be any more 2 week breaks or will it be a straight run to the season finale from here?                  Just had a look on the receipt and I don't see anything.   I bought a 970 last week. How do I get my free copy of the witcher 3?   is it even on netflix anymore? according to https://netflixaroundtheworld.com/ its not.    Just curious.          Great. Just what we need more movies about American patriotism. Look don't get me wrong I enjoyed American Sniper but why does everyone have to jump on a bandwagon.                Beautiful.    Maybe hes adding a bit of spider-man to it?            yea by 1%                                           its like marvel cant seem to make up their mind how much of this movie is officially canon. They have referenced it since its release but when ever marvel talks about is past It always feels like the incredible hulk gets pushed to the side. What does r/movies think? is the incredible hulk canon in the MCU despite marvel kind of acknowleding it.          Any chance it will be with inside out?         For a second there I thought Sky was gonna leave Shield. I mean they set it up perfectly if they wanted to go down that route.    OP doesn't know how to enjoy movies.    Nightcrawler, end of watch            Its really annoying since its stops other games showing as being in game.    Figured it out. just took a bit of tinkering in EVGA precision. got my fans at 30% and the 970 is now sitting at a nice 37C.    hmm if you say so. its just compared to my old gtx 660 which would sit at around 40c while browsing with the fans on this is quite hot in my books. I guess I'm just not used to the new 900 series cards and how they work.    yea but right now im using chrome watching a 1080p movie trailer and its sitting at 49c. seems a bit hot.    How do I get the fans to run? I know they don't start running till about 60c on the EVGA ACX 2.0 model. I tried playing around with precision x but its kinda confusing. I want my fans to run at a low speed 24/7. Is this possible?   AMC movie talk.    So much this! I wish the larger fan base would hurry up and figure this out. It was never about the cars or the action it was always about family.       No offence but you just wasted your money.       By this time last year we already had confirmation of season 3. But yet this year we have no word on season 4. Any ideas when we might get a confirmation?   Pretty high I reckon. Unless they replace him with a new character to fill his spot.    I was thinking Thanos needs an army right? what if he summons all the villains in the MCU to team up with him to fight the avengers. This could be anyone from Abomination to Red Skull.  Who would you have on team Thanos if this were to happen?     This might be the best city builder since Sim City 4 imo. I'm having fun just watching streams. The gameplay looks incredibly engading and addicting and it looks like its got some real depth to it. Can it be Tuesday already? :D   In regards to Thor I was talking about Malekith.   It seems like Loki is the only villain marvel have seem to have gotten right in the MCU. Bucky was also a pretty decent villain in TWS so marvel do seem to be learning and hopefully they'll knock it out of the park with Ultron. But it seems like with Thor and Iron Man they struggle a lot to make engaging and interesting villains. Why is that? Are their writers just having trouble grasping the source material or are they just surrounded by yes men who have no idea wtf they're doing?   Cause too much water, am i rite?   I know that. Why do you think I'm going for the 970 .   Exactly.Plus I don't have $1000 to spend.    980s are over a $1000 here in NZ.    http://www.pbtech.co.nz/index.php?z=p p=VGAEVG2972 name=EVGA-GeForce-GTX970-4GB-ACX-Dual-Fan-PCI-E-3.0-Vid   May have the opportunity to pick one up on Tuesday. A local computer store is having a sale on 970's and its within my budget so I'm thinking of getting one. I play at 1080p so I just wanted to double check that I wont be affected by the 970 memory issues.    yep. And its actually a decent port.    I ended up torrenting it haha.    the torrent has leaked go try it out yourself.    Actually Carrie not be an intelligence officer again does kind of make sense after what happend at the end of season 4.       Not gonna happen for me. I'm addicted to trailers.    da faq. 2.5 years? so what does that mean for Quinn?    your not a pirate. Your just changing region. Everybody does it. lol.    I went to Netflix last night to watch the avengers but found out for some reason its gone and after a bit of searching I found out it left Netflix back in December. They really need to bring back expiration dates on the app itself so people know. I know we have great posters here who let us know what movies are available on VOD services each week but there needs to be something that lets us know when movies are leaving Netflix.         whats it like? its optimized well?      The OP deleted it as soon as it was announced he was ok he felt his title was mis leading once the news he was ok came out.    Honestly I think the podcast is better without him. I find he just yells out a bunch of random crap and I have no interest in any of his opinions but thats just me. I've also noticed that when Jesse is on TB seems to take the backseat a bit more and lets everyone else speak  but this week TB seemed to be quite happy without Jesse.    Yea of course.I don't care what people say I'm not gonna get rid of my Xbox one and Ps4.          So whats happening with the sequel? Do we know for sure that its in development? I remember reading that the sequel is expected in 2016 and that Aiden might not be the main protagonist.       I Amazing Spider-Man 2'd myed self. No regrets. The trailers saved me from going to the movie. so top kek to sony for that one.       Think for a moment about ghosts. There are two proposed types: intelligent ghosts, and memories. Then, there are time travelers, something that seems unrelated at first thought.  Intelligent ghosts are the type you can interact with, and can interact with you. Some consider them to be dangerous, and others think them friendly.  Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a childs laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.  A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well?            By the time May comes around BvS will be less than 12 months out.Which is still quite early for a teaser. Trailers don't usually start releasing till about 6 months out. A few movies being the exception like Interstellar with a teaser trailer one year out.    This is still not enough to make me switch. I use windows as my daily driver for work so I cant really switch to Linux even if I wanted to. I wouldn't switch to it on my desktop or laptop at home ether.    I always assumed it was bitch?      MTV and Awards used in the same sentence. LMAO. what a joke.          Nek minute...      I thought I read some where that hes supposed to have a cameo along with Heimdall. yea here it is. http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/idris-elba-says-heimdall-and-loki-are-in-age-of-ultron-calls-going-from-mandela-to-thor-2-torture      I know that. I'm asking what is stark going to do with the scepter.       Wonder what this means for his Alien movie? Would contracts have been signed at this stage so the studio is obligated to let him make it or could they still cancel the project?   20% on rotten tomatoes, 5 reviews only 1 is positive. I know its still too early to call it but its not looking good.    This looks really good. Ian McKellen is gonna make a great Mr Holmes.       I remember reading some where about Zoe returning in a flash back or something. I guess it was just a bs rumor.    the star wars prequels. The internet forgets that there is an entire generation of people that actually like those movies and probably dont say anything when their favorite movies get hated on.    they had reshoots planned for January-Febuary so its not to far fetched to think they coud of used that time to put something together.          anyone got one last guess as to what they might announce?   hes on drugs. I mean look at his eyes he looks like hes 420 blazing it.   http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/01/a-hulk-117758.jpg   I've only seen him in House of Cards. Any movies of his I should check out?      well if spider-man isn't in Civil War after this then something went seriously wrong. He should have more than a cameo if they are signing a deal with the directors of Civil War.                "Make it better" he said lol    Since we know Ahsoka is alive. Where was she during revenge of the sith?       First couple of tv spots are already out.       That was a dick move on his part. He should of just done it and not drag it out, he basically tortured the poor girl. I guess they wanted to show how far Doug had fallen and how loyal he his to Frank. Still pissed me of though.    Not sure if its just me but games have a been pretty shit recently. just wondering what everyone is playing?   But I liked clones :(   that would be weird but a nice surprise none the less. Maybe strange uses some alternate dimension thing to bring spider-man into the MCU?   Its not official, but they have been right about stuff before. They called the marvel and sony spider-man deal months before it was announced.          When you realize you only have one episode left before you have to wait another year :(      Inception      RDJ is more likely to announce the new actor playing spider-man rather than the director of the new movie. Spider-Man will replace Iron Man as the face of the MCU come phase 4 it would only make sense that RDJ announce his replacement.          Paid sex is best sex.             Take a break! seriously people take your 15 min break or however long you get! Get some fresh air or get something to eat. Do something just get out of that chair and put that headset down every chance you get otherwise you will go insane.       In Soviet Russia we be friend you.    Any news on when Wii U emulation might become a thing?      Totally agree! I fuckin loved whiplash. I would of been happy if ether American Sniper or Whiplash won over Birdman.    I thought American Sniper was a much better movie than Birdman. Birdman is just overly long, boring and tedious outside of Michael Keatons performance it just didnt do anything for me.       You guys are lucky. Back when I was younger. It took up to a year for a movie a movie to hit vhs and dvd. Now it only takes 3-4 months. For bluray and VOD.      Man remember when everyone thought this was for the halo movie? good times.    FYI. Its not my poster.       Thanks. I knew he slipped in the bath tub but I didn't see the lump on his arm. I was watching it pretty late so I guess  I didn't see it.    Since the first film took place in 2019. Would be a nice little nod to the first film.    Use Hola extension and change region to US.    Anyone care to explain this? I was a bit lost      Just wanted to double check here first, does the standard $7.99 sub include HD or is HD only included with the 2 screens + HD sub for $8.99?       Being in NZ we are a full day a head of America. So I have to wait till saturday.  the pain is real.       I'm a big gamer, I love all platforms but nintendo has never really done anything for me outside of Pokemon.So its weird that I've been considering picking up a Wii U but I'm not even sure why I want one. Are there any MUST have Wii U exclusives? I guess I do want to play Mario Kart 8 and theres always the off chance nintendo brings out a pokemon colosseum like game for the Wii U sometime in the future. But beyond that I just dont know really.             Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War calling it now.             Back when infinity war was announced their was a bit of debate whether or not infinity war was one movie just split into two or if it counted as avengers 3 and 4. Anyone know if we ever got an answer?      I was excited for the mods and to see what the pc community would bring to the table but Ive already played it on ps4 and now after this 3rd delay any I had for the pc version died with it.  	200
 Jesus, I understand if people weren't interested, but how can anyone - man, woman, child, lizard person, whoever - think that that kind of rudeness is acceptable?

       Not gonna lie, completely missed that first post lol         https://twitter.com/gemisisDev  I'm currently working on my first big game on the PS Vita (Keeping it private until I have something pretty to show... which is looking like it'l lbe in the next two weeks or so!)  I also do miscellaneous dev stuff, like helping with some 3DS homebrew stuff, running a C++ game development Twitch Stream, game jams (when time permits), and more.  Working to use Twitter more so recently, though I just want to Tweet about stuff that matters, cause I don't think people would find my ever day thoughts as fun lol That said, once my game is public, expect lot's of Tweets as I work on development more :)   Pretty sure that's the "YOU STOLE MY T.A.R.D.I.S.!" expression lol   Gonna call it now, he's a Terminator.   And I kind of like the idea of that lol      All of my brothers friends, who are 6-10 years younger than me, are now either 6ft tall, getting their drivers, or going to college soon.  	10
 You will find examples even on this thread. The Philippines and Japan come to mind.   :) You get bored writing and reading. And sometimes Reddit doesn't cut it. You'd be amazed at how far behind society is from current research.   Hint: look harder. Try looking for published research articles and not some oped   This had me falling off my seat!! That final pic, w.o.w.    Sounds like the beach party was a 'farewell' to all her friends. You should probably 'write' here a letter.   I think there's a double misunderstanding here. I assumed you were referring to the women/men finding what is rare attractive. This was my mistake as I combined your comment with someone else's. I meant that finding the 'rare' exotic and attractive is natural.  Considering women/men prey is lame with or without the mileage. But I wouldn't fault anyone for traveling far and wide to find 'love'.   It does.   You have very penetrating eyes. Pretty cool.   This is humbling to read. Sometimes you come across stories and experiences that remind you of just how little you 'know' about life. Thank you for sharing.  Things like this will be helpful to know as a parent raising a female child. Not so much to protect but to be of some sensible support and compass through it all.   Hugs bro!   Nah. The male equivalent of the 'B' word. The 'stupid', i think is the equivalent of the dumb jock. No?   People will surprise you in a positive and negative way. I think your story is refreshing and adds to the convo.    Actually it is not. It is completely natural.   You clearly haven't been out much. Actually, and this is backed by many published research findings, the most highly rated male is the black male. (Asian rank number one in the female category). Being scary is a stereo type that doesn't hold true everywhere, not even everywhere in America. Please quite with the self loathing already.   Haaaahahhaa!   This is what the video camera on your phone is meant for. :/   This right here is accurate to the minute. I know, I timed it quite a few times.   Oh I'm not just referring to polygamy. I meant to apply the question to all marriage.  And to be honest, beyond playing advocate and outside of the marriage debate, time to maturity has reduced I think. At least physically if not mentally.    I understand and agree. But who is to decide what the cut off should be and why? Not meaning you should answer, its 'food for thought.'   "You aren't born a polygamist. " This is scientifically unfounded hearsay. There is actually much more evidence supporting this (statistically) than being inclined to homosexual behavior.    Why are you discriminating against people under 18.  To play devils advocate here, what magically happens on the eve of the 18th birthday  that 'changes everything' and makes it okay? It is a completely arbitrary age and is only a matter of time before this too is changed.  And 'you' having or not having a 'problem with this' is not a legal argument either.   Been there. Understand and appreciate your being candid. My initial comment was a FTFY. Well, one way of looking at it is that we both agree the current 'trend' is broken since, in a healthy society, we should be appalled by any acts of cruelty and senseless violence towards any living creature.  That the media pushes this or that idea is one thing. This however, is reddit. "We" shape the conversation as it should be.      I thought we all were. This is reddit! Every one is here because we all know and are tired of the very fact we are discussing. Yet you want to propagate it. How is that making things better?    Evidence suggests that it will. Does not mean that it should...    Stop retweeting it. You encourage it.    If the story about him getting divorced and losing everything were true then you have to wonder how broken our legal system is. Please Emit how it makes sense to lose a SO and all of your material wealth, for whatever reasons, is just?    Imagine the uproar if there was no footage. Holy shit.   FTFY    Why not just read them as actual words to avoid being confused. I never say 'i' 'e' when i type or write, i actually say 'that' 'is'.    Under the letter of the law, they probably won't be held in contempt. Any reasonable judge should enforce in favor of the SCOTUS ruling.   Hawk eye here. AMA.   The power of reddit. Sounds like a He-man esq thing   It isn't collective shame, it is collective guilt.   It's an idiomatic expression in the English language. Used in a situation where there is a danger of eliminating something good or precious (baby) when we are hyper focused on eliminating something bad or useless (dirty bath water) .    I think /r/ManWhoSmokes was being sarcastic.   Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this thread. I feel that these stories need to be told. The naked truth about the ills, which we as human beings were capable of inflicting upon one another, need to be reechoed.    y -_-   A reason to doubly evaluate and re-evaluate every step, every conviction we hold. I think never being absolute about any and everything except the sun rise and sun set is a sure way to avoid falling into such deeply misguided atrocities.  	37
 When I right click, it selects each of my objects. I can't move them anywhere unless I want to move all of them.   I suck at character modeling. How did you get good at it?   Blender kicks ass at creating stuff like planes and materials. But sucks at character creation.     If we had a good list of links, it would be good for new users like myself.      I'm using AE, blender, and maya. And I don't feel like cycling through softwares. I was impressed by element 3d.    Great man. Thanks   Just wondering. I need a renderer.   Usertesting is pretty good. $10-15 per test.    Also, what other sites could I use?     I saw someone who did a speed modeling video where a guy modeled a gun based of an image which he had in the background really fast. He could chose a polygon and stretch it out in less than that of a second. I'm thinking he just uses keyboard shortcuts, for that's what people do in Blender speed modeling videos. So, what keyboard shortcuts do I use to do such?     Can I just import my models into renderman and then use muh shaders to render it out?   Alright. So how do you do the "sped modeling" thing? Where one is able to stretch and select polygons very fast in blender or Maya? Do you just use the keyboard?     I saw a video where a guy created a 3d model off of an image? How does he bring the image in? How does he change the size and select shapes of polygons so fast? A simple explanation would be great?     I want my reader to feel sadness and anger. But I feel like killing characters to often becomes cliched and gimmicky. What are some tips, r/ writing?          I've worked on a few vidya games which was pretty cool, but I was completely sapped of creativity. We used CryEngine, and I realized how similar it looked to CGI movie effects. I started comparing films to video games.    I asked myself, "How can a film be more interesting than a video game if a video game is so interactive and keeps the player on the edge of their seat?"      Anyway, long story short, what are some nifty writing and editing tricks to keep the film vibrant, exciting, and interesting?        I was thinking Christians would feel good because you know, your hurting Satan, the ultimate sinner. Yet games such as the Diablo trilogy and Darksiders have created controversy.   Looking for a place to download the engine used in Quake. I'm designing a retro game.   Does anyone know where I can download the engine used in Quake 1?  I think it's id tech 2 or something. Anyway, I'm making a retro game, so if y'all could help me find this engine, that would be great.     One side of the planet would always have day light, another would always have constant darkness.   Okay? Where do I start? Where do I begin making an agreement with Nintendo? Also, do you have to own a company to become a dev?      I think R/ Nintendo would know better than anyone else.  I know you need to have an agreement with Nintendo, so where do I start?  How do I acquire a devkit? How do I publish my game for the Wii U?      https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5AvCxa9Y9NU      Seriously. They're releasing two games in 2015. I'm worried for CryEngine.    Voxel farm is a Voxel engine. You make shit out of billions of tiny voxels. The more voxels, the better and more round a model can be. This is supposed to solve the problem of games not being able to render enough polygons.    With voxels, you can have unlimited detail, and according to Euclidean, not have to worry about hardware specs.    So I'm trying to find an equally good Voxel engine without jew prices.            https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4SUNWOVxVmk    I'm a cryengine dev, and I want to know if my tech works with Wii U.        Seriously. Valve doesn't know what the consumer wants. We have our standards too high. If Half-Life 3 came out, what would you want?        I haven't seen any good one in a while. Working on a film and need some good footage for inspiration, btw.   I have a quiz tommorow and I'm having much difficulty.      Oh! Never thought of that. Thanks for the advice!   Also check out another primitive shot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Le3q4UVr8E              Do we think they will release a free non-commercial version of it, just like Pixar did with Renderman?

 Has a team (other than us) ever been ranked 6th in both human polls and unranked in two computer polls this late in the season? Ridiculous.   How has Clemson underperformed? they're 9-1 and their only loss was to us. But VT, yeah, no argument there.   INORITE?   Has a team (other than us) ever been ranked 6th in both human polls and unranked in two computer polls this late in the season? Ridiculous.   *2-2, against the #4 team in the nation. Nice try though.   There are a couple that I think would be awesome to be a part of; but because I can't see who's modding it I don't know how to request admission. Is there a way to somehow do that, or am I SOL?   You think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's best film?   This is really sad and awful. How often do ambulances come on to the field?   9 tackles for loss on 12 run plays so far.   Bad feeling: has.   FSU starting niiiice and slooooow. I'm not okay with this inside Lane Stadium on a Thursday night.   EJ may have underthrown both bombs so far, but to be fair, he was in the process of being tackled during both throws.   VT fumbles hand off. Still gets first down. Behold the power of Lane Stadium.   Highest rated kicker in this years class. I don't see it happening. It's okay though, we have another awesome kicker waiting in the wings.   When was Varajao ever selected as an all-star while he was on the team with Lebron?   That last outfit; do you have any idea where the parts are from? I love it to death.   Yep. Sexual assault =/= assault. Not to mention a lot of jurisdictions have blended the two torts together anyways so assault could have been a valid here absent the sexual nature of the offense; even though the whole point is moot because it's all American law and they're not in America. Not to mention we're all talking in colloquial definitions and not strict legal ones anyways.   1984 at number one made me skeptical, Lord Of the rings at #2 made me very skeptical, then I saw the hunger games and stopped taking it seriously. Then I realized 50 shades of grey was ranked above Madam Bovary and I stopped considering it a list.   ITT: we're getting downvoted by angry Lakers fans.   All of this plus one little thing- that knot looks bad because it's so small. Try going for a full windsor.   I'd just like to point out right now that our 7 man rotation currently comprises four shooting guards and three power forwards.   Hrmmm. You win this one.   That's one of the least specific majors you can possibly get.   Notice how I didn't compare them to FSU in any way, shape, or form?   Still. They've played 3 teams this season with winning records, and lost all 3 of those games.   Me too. But I still understand what a joke is.   I love Pale Fire, and I think that's amazing. I'm honestly shocked Lolita isn't higher up in this thread though.   As an FSU grad who grew up in Orlando, this man would bring more happiness to me than you can imagine.   Excellent. Thank you.   Is there any chance you have the screenshot + beaker background?   Meh. The Vegas over/under on their season after Harden is like 35 wins. They're up with Minnesota/Dallas on that "punchers chance for the 8th seed" level right now.   And even if it's acceptable, it looks bad.   You learned this from Mad Men. Be honest.   Who's projecting us to lose to Florida again?   To be fair. That sounds like one of the most logical reasons possible for a man to want to commit suicide.  "I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison *and* my family is going to die poor *or* I can commit suicide and they'll at least be well provided for.   I basically pulled all the probabilities out of my ass.   Do you know that, with Jonas Jerebko, Monroe, and Villanueva, he'll get 30 minutes a game? Something rookies *rarely* get, especially ones that are as raw as he is.   *classic* ACC style football.   I just did a rough calculation of our BCS title game chances. Assuming   1) Alabama wins out, including UGA in the SECCG (%75)   2) We win out (~60%)   3) no team behind us is going to jump us   4) KSU, ND, and Oregon need two losses for us to jump them.   5) we pass USCe after our win over florida + ACC championship game  There is like a 10% chance KSU gets at least two losses and a 15% chance Oregon gets at least two losses. There's about a 12.5% chance that ND loses two more times.  If we assume (incorrectly) that all of these are independent probabilities, that puts our title chances at .75 x .6 x .1 x .15 x .125 = .085% and that's being very optimistic   :(   Heh, I didn't say it. I'll be rooting for you guys, the enemy of my enemy is my bro.    This is one of those "it's so far fetched you shouldn't even feel offended" scenarios.   Sagarin's overall rankings are made up of two formulas. ELO_Chess only takes into account who you've beaten and who you've lost to without regard to by how much. Then Predictor, which only takes into account margin of victory and completely disregards whether you've won or lost. The two are averaged out somehow, and comes up with his ranking, which is still a bit quirky, but pretty good for a computer.   The BCS decided to only use the ELO_CHESS portion of his formula for their computer ranking. I don't know the reason, I think the idea *might* be to correct for the amount of human bias pollsters can put into their rankings or something. It's a very weird decision though, IMO.   I know, I was playing along.   Or Kansas State winning out.   Be honest though, how far down the list did you really look?   And when you beat South Carolina and we beat UF that will eliminate a bunch more :D   It should also be noted that computers completely disregard MOV (I think, if they do, then it is to a negligible amount). So for instance, Texas moved up on you guys this week, because Kansas is rated higher generally in computer polls than Colorado is.   Computers don't GAF about margin of victory though.   The fact that they are still only using Sagarin's ELO_CHESS computer has been, and always will be, goddamn retarded.   His rankings in *Week 9* when computers are supposed to actually start making sense.  1. KSU   2. Notre Dame   3. Florida   4. LSU 5. Oklahoma   6. UGA 7. Alabama   8. Oregon   9. South Carolina   10. TTU   11. Oregon State   12. Stanford   13. WVU   14. Arizona   15. TAMU   16. Texas 17. Washington    18. USC 19. Nebraska 20. Iowa State   21. Miss. State.   22. Oklahoma State 23. Michigan   24. Louisville   25. UCLA    With Florida State, Clemson, Boise State, and Louisiana Tech unranked.    South Carolina in 8th is hilarious. Other than that, no real complaints.   Dude, bleacherreport. That simulation has us behind UF in both human polls, but we're in front of them in both human polls.   TBH I am confused to. I don't think anyone knows for sure exactly what happened (i.e. Dwight may have said he would refuse to resign with the Rockets which was a condition of their offer, maybe our front office hated the idea of having Brooks Lopez's max contract on the books and making us better enough to hurt our rebuilding draft chances). Ultimately I am confuse as well.   Uhh, we resigned Jameer because we needed a starting PG, and with JRich and Dwight gone we're not worried about cap space, and they're both still serviceable players. There is nothing wrong with letting them both play out there contracts while we start acquiring young talent.   Then... why are you posting this in the coaches poll thread?   Wait. Where are you seeing these BCS rankings?   Right. Bounces = fumbles lost v. fumbles recovered.   We are the tattoos worth it?   Rob Hennigan wasn't involved in the trade, it was executed by the Magic's CEO/President. Also, lol at linking to the bleacherreport as proof of anything ever.   Nobody seems to be mentioning it, but this isn't surprising at all, nor does it mean the Thunder are losing him. It's part of the negotiation and the Thunder are probably going to up the salary + other incentives that don't count against the cap (i.e. bonuses for making all-star team, making the finals, winning 6th man again etc.), which is exactly what they did for Ibaka.   and they would all suck from the comparative lack of activity.   gyro?   Jeff Driskel??  He's averaging 132 passing yards and 1.14 touchdowns a game.   I think he's surprised they're still so high.   Typing this from a phone so forgive the errors and brevity-  I love this film because there's a perspective here that a lot of people seemed to miss: I see this story as told *through the lense* of the main character, a 9 year okd boy scout.  Think about the characters. The girl's parents are lawyers, so what do they do lying in bed? They talk about boring adult lawyer things. Edward Norton is shown as having an immensly crisp routine as scoutmaster, because a young boyscout would see his scoutmaster as being comparatively a robot. Notice how resourveful he is when they're travelling through the woods? He likes to see himself as a person caoable of surviving in the woods, and her as some silly girl who doesn't now how to pack or prepare for real wilderness. Notice how 'social services' is represented by a cold, mean old lady? That's exactly the kind of personification a 9 year old would have of a social services worker. Notice how innocuous the afair was represented? It's because that's what having affair is to him.  I see this not as an objective story with a caraciturized cast, but as a story told through the imaginative mind of a young boy.   wat   I'm struggling because on one hand this really isn't the spirit of truereddit; but that was a goddamn excellent relevant lyric.   This article was, as a whole, quite sloppy. The comparisons to Venice  were very weak as well.    Just out of curiosity, why? He's an incredibly talented "game managing" quarterback for a conservative play-calling offense. He's not a Geno Smith hand-cannon by any means, but he's a very solid decision maker.   Ha, okay. I guess you clearly have a well-painted picture of how good FSU is in your head already so I won't argue with you anymore. See you Nov. 24th.   Sure.  We're 6-1 with our only loss coming by one point on the road to a team who's 4-2 right now. We've beaten a team that's currently ranked (13th USA, 14th AP).  We have the 6th best scoring offense in the nation, (you can point to the fact that we've played two AA teams this year, but I'd rebut by saying one of them ended with 20 minutes left so it someone mitigates stat-inflating). We're ranked 12th in the nation in total offense (23rd passing, 16th rushing; so incredibly well balanced). Also our quarterback is currently ranked 4th in the nation in passing efficiency.   We have the 4th best total scoring defense in the nation, allowing 11.6points/game. We're ranked 3rd in the nation in total defense; including being 5th overall in rushing defense and 3rd in passing efficiency defense.   Our strength of schedule isn't great, sure, but it's not awful either. I'd say collectively that's a resume of a top-25 team at least.   Yeah; because ignoring margin of victory is **so** logical. And "we were supposed to be really good" is clearly the only argument Clemson and FSU have for being ranked in the top-25.   Both ACC teams received perfect .000% in the computer polls. I fucking hate the computer polls.   Yeah, I was looking at the AP, ah well.   FUCK.   I wanted us to move up though :(   NERLENS NOEL aka Dwight 2.0 aka Shaq 3.0  *the cycle continues*   Okay... fair. He gets no love from FM/AM though. I heard Lay Lady Lay on a country station about two weeks ago and it blew my mind, it was I think the first time I had ever heard him on air.   I absolutely love tax law and I'm so glad I don't have this problem.   Dylan definitely does not get a lot of radio play.  /someone who listens to lots of radio and is an avid Dylan fanatic.   So if you've determined that the anecdote had nothing to do with this thread... why did you post it?   That's *really* stretching 'stacked' territory. We have the quantity, we're lacking in actual quality.   No way on earth Magic get to 35 wins this year.   I've just started studying for the REG portion of the CPA, my first section. I've never filled out a tax form before, I don't know how to use excel very well, and I the Wiley book I'm reading from doesn't give me much help in the way of how to perform a search SIM.  What are the best ways to prepare for the REG exam in these areas?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71wCKbjU8Q   Just out of curiosity, does anyone know generally how often callbacks lead to offers with the big-4? Or maybe any sort of literature on the subject itself?   Isn't it still going to be used to determine the who goes to the playoff? Or am I way wrong here.   Yep. Would not recommend pulling the trigger on anything like these.   1. Your one loss is no longer to a top-3 team  2. It took really really late in the game to pull away from GT; a very bad GT.   Except he completely missed Final Fantasy IV, VI, IX and X; all of which are considered to be 'classics'   Nice sloooow starts, all around.   no!   Clemson, come on! You are our one claim to legitimacy right now. You **CANNOT** lose this game.   Given the hours and pay of the legal profession, especially for younger lawyers (and excluding biglaw about the pay part), you really have to love it or it will eat you.   At the high school level...   1) there are so many things so absurdly more important than Wickard for a government class; to spend 3% of the entire school year on it is a horrendous misappropriation of time  2) like you said, I doubt it's even on the radar for the AP U.S. history exam  3) Inasmuch as a high schooler who's just now learning about the governent is concerned; there is probably about 10-15 minutes worth of good substantive teaching that they could understand about it.   There's a very good argument that Miranda rights are prophylactic anyways.   Spending a week on Wickard in high school would make his class one of the worst AP high school classes in existence.   But then he would only win it like 40% of the time, which gives brings the expected payout of his scheme over time down to $200 per trial; which means that in the long run he only makes like 200 bucks doing this.   fffffffuuuuuuuu   I have a couple of interviews coming up this week with the big 4, and I really don't have much of an idea how to research pertinent information on a firm. I'm specifically interviewing for tax positions, and so I'd like to be able to bring up relevant facts and/or recent accomplishments.  Can someone point me in the right direction?   Awesome. Thanks!   Just about all the scores are messed up. It says FSU is 3-0 when they're 5-0.   Is that an ESPN manufactured controversy I hear brewing?   Is he the same guy that made a post consisting of nothing all his shoes and shoe-cleaning equipment, and announced that today he was going to be cleaning his giant collection of nice shoes?  If yes, all I have to say is this guy is way too proud of his curious life priorities.   Somewhat related- but one of the things that MFA seems lacking the most is good taste in ties.   That was fun while it lasted :/   The name Jacksonville State gives me nightmares. Those were dark times.   Our lack of ability to play shut-down defense right now is really annoying.    I'm going to start wearing a mink fedora    Oh god.  I have to start dressing like an adult    You're off on the wrong foot then  my goal is to be as sharp as possible    The really really wrong foot  while never having anyone look at me thinking "what's going on with that guy's outfit?"

                            yes, I enjoy this sort of thing as well even if I did leave the Church at 15. One of my favourites was the treasury of St. Marks in Venice. Incredibly rich, and it's interesting to contemplate that almost every object was acquired by theft.      I know there is a lot of tax-dodging, and many workers, especially migrant workers from the countryside, are employed in the black market. Where do the foreigners come into this ? Obviously there is something that I am in ignorance of. What countries do these people come from ? What sort of industries do they work in ? How do they pull it off. It seems the government would be hot on the trail of the lost tax money.         Old news granted. One thing struck me however. I guess that there are foreigners working *outside* of factories in China. Aren't a lot of them employees of multinationals ? Ho does Chinese legislation apply to them ?               I guess that might sound contradictory.                                  Great source. There is another subreddit, r/anarchisthistoryporn , that bears a look. It is, of course, far less extensive than the Labadie collection's is.                                             Interesting essay. It's been a long time since I've read anything by Mattick. Without addressing the full article I have some doubts about the first part. The author seems to conflate the private views of Marx and Engels ("Progressive and reactionary nations", etc.) with the views and actions of the socialist and anarchist movement as a whole. I don't think that pre-WW1 social democratic parties acted in a way consistent with the views of Marx and Engels.         I'm afraid not. I believe they are from France, but beyond that I am unsure.                     I wouldn't be able to comment on members of police forces. I am sure it varies from time to time and place to place. As to the military I don't think there is a great difference from the normal population in general terms in countries where there is conscription. In places where there are voluntary armies I'd suspect that the greatest incentive is socioeconomic. Good idea or not a lot of people think the military is a way to "better their condition".                  I can hope so, though the 'lead-on' from this sort of thing certainly hasn't given birth to any great wave of 'what next' in most leftist places.   I certainly hope to in the last 100 years. Gives a new meaning to 'stinky goche'.                                                                                    I recently read this, and I'm curious as to what others think'. The authors' explanation in the article  seems 'fishy'. Ammonites were in decline for some time before the K/T boundary, and I pretty well certain that no fish has ever occupied an ecological niche once occupied by ammonites. I am also doubtful that there were enough marine reptiles to account for the freeing up of niches or reducing predation pressure on fish. As to the latter the loss of reptile predation should have removed a selective pressure and led to *decreased* speciation. Finally, why do shark species remain more or less stable ?                                      In 'New York Times speak' it does, and so unfortunately it does in most public discourse in the USA. How 'class' is spoken about varies from country to country and even within countries themselves. I would personally prefer the term "working class". In speaking to the average person I would truncate that to "workers' especially in the USA. The way "middle class" is used in America is quite unique. It actually seems very 'Mom and apple pie' when it comes out of the mouth of a politician, and I think it is like the use of the word "family" in a lot of cases ie without much content. I'd never use the term myself, but I am very much of a minority in this matter.  So, I actually agree with you, but the NYT is the NYT. The way in which the term is used in the USA would sound very strange in say Britain. Over there the 'Middle Class' doesn't carry the positive associations it does in NA. It is often used to describe people who in other countries would be called 'capitalists'.   Thanks. I've never heard that expression before, but it is a good one.      I don't know. I understand he is a fairly good amateur pianist. Not musician grade for sure. He won't be following in the steps of Glen Gould anytime soon, but it's still an accomplishment that I find praiseworthy. That rules out "complete".   I had to pick some word for the title. "Chart" seemed appropriate though I'm sure there are other words that could be used, some of them better than the one I chose.      If it was North America I might quip that keeping up one's clothing styles and proper vegan diet requires a fairly significant cash flow. Different thing in Greece though.  If almost certainly wasn't planned, but I would say it would have been brilliant if it was. The police, of course, are already on the highest alert possible. Starting a rumor of anarchists attacking ATM would be a work of genius. The mind boggles at the number of police officers necessary to properly protect all the ATMs in a large city.                           There is a more extensive [history](http://libcom.org/history-black-guards) of this subject at Libcom. That history also mentions one of the weaknesses of the Black Guards, if only to note that the Red Guards contained similar criminal elements. It was the refusal of the anarchists to disavow this minority element that gave the Bolsheviks their 'cover' for the suppression.                                  I'd tend to agree with you. There is a great tendency to try and define as much of normal behavior as some sort of "pathology". It keeps a very large industry humming away, and big-Pharma that people try and blame is only a minor part of it.   I guess we are about the same age. Both my parents have been dead for some years as well. Take care, and my sympathy about their bad attitude.            Sorry I messed up the link to dpac' s website. It's been corrected.

My dear friend the late Anwar Sadat summed up people like you very well when he was describing Muhamar GaddhafiDuck. There is crazy. There is fucking crazy. Then there is "100% insane and possessed of the Devil". Keep counting your toes. You'll never know when the Illuminati may remove or add some because you are "in the know".         For some reason that seems to make a vague connection in my mind as well. I know there's been quite a bit written about their presence in temples there. I'm going to have a look.                                                OK you'll get what you want. The matter of "more than that" in terms of Zinoviev comes from a speech by Leon Trotsky against Zinoviev at the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks/Communists as quoted by John Bunyan in 'The Origin of Forced Labor in the Soviet State 1917-1921', John Hopkins Press, 1967. Bunyan quotes Trotsky as saying that Zinoviev gave a number of **99%**. This is probably exaggerated by Trotsky though it is hard to judge for reasons I will be explaining below. Leonard Shapiro in 'The Russian Revolutions of 1917: The Origins of Modern Communism', Basic Books, New York, 1984 gave the quote as **90%**. Bunyan's quotation is more reputable, but I downgraded it because Trotsky, as a representative of the extreme right of the Bolsheviks at the time, was obviously partisan.  Here's the trick. Until some historian with a rather limited field of interest manages to dig the **real** minutes of the Congress out of the Soviet archives  rather than the falsified ones presented by the USSR government we won't know the exact number for sure. The Soviet government, of course, had no reason to preserve the words of Zinoviev himself. He was murdered one day after his 'trial' as part of the 'Trial of the Sixteen' on August 24 1936 to preserve the 'proletarian power' of the torturers and their bosses with dachas on the Black Sea. You don't preserve the words of so-called 'traitors' - especially if they are right.  Now here's the important point. It is not **my** scholarship. It is the scholarship **of the world**, at least that part of the world outside of a sect degenerated into a cult. I am not an academic. I am merely an ordinary person with an interest in Russian history, and just because I know far more than a true believer doesn't mean I am an expert in any sense.  If you wish to educate yourself beyond the realm of slogans I would suggest looking at 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War 1917 -1921: An Annotated Bibliography, Chapter 18`. The title of this chapter is `Popular Hostility to Soviet Rule`, and it runs from pages 334 to 340. Pages 337 and 338 are missing in the version available on the internet.   It is hard for me to judge if your lack of knowledge is legitimate or a sophomoric debating tactic. In any case you can educate yourself in regards to any legitimate study of the economic history of the USSR. Start with Carr`s history of same. He makes a heroic effort to discern fact from the fantasy of Soviet `statistics`. You can then consult Lenin's own works which are, more or less, publically available in terms of the debate about the NEP as well as pretty well *every* legitimate study of the period that isn't special pleading for the developing new ruling class.  As I said, it is hard for me to determine if an American sectarian in the 21st century is really under the illusion that their world of so-called 'actual numbers' of public opinion surveys ever existed in other times or places or if this is, once more, sophomoric debating. In a country as per 1921 Russia where conquered areas such as the Caucasian republics and Central Asia were under military occupation and where large areas of the country such as the Tambov area were in open rebellion and where dissent could mean death there is no American leftist "actual number". Especially as the new ruling class was nowhere as developed as it was later in 'Stalin's war against the peasants' in the early 1930s.  In a situation where there was widespread opposition to the new ruling class amongst both the working class as evidenced by the strike waves of 1921 and *especially* the dozens of peasant uprisings the Bolsheviks had to repress there are no 'actual numbers', merely the use of poison gas to exterminate peasant rebels in the forests of Tambov.  Once more there is a world of real history, not "my" history, outside of the world you have decided to enclose yourself in. In comparison to your world the Catholic Church is honest.      As I said you are not a moderator. Your errors have been plainly pointed out, once more to the tune of 406,000.  Are you really so childish that you think that somebody will obey your orders just because you say so. Take it to the real moderators and stop your false fronts. Your habits of deception are pretty obvious.  If you don't want to be attacked 'personally' don't play act and make false arguments just because you think they are amusing. Others have a different concept of reality ie that there *is* a reality.         It is, of course, **not** "rehashing the other story that it quoted as is plain from the text. It obviously added to it and presented its own perspective. The whole context as pointed out to you to the tune of the 406,000 previous references is pretty obvious, and your claim of 'originality' for the source you quoted is absurd. The facts are obvious as I have pointed out. Your claim as to originality is not connected to reality.  I have to admit you had me going for a little while. At the first I thought you were some sort of monitor of this subreddit as you seemed to imply. Just like I thought you were somebody from Oklahoma familiar with the story in question rather than an argumentative Canadian. You, of course, are not either one. I forgot the level of deception common on reddit.   Then I checked your comment history. At the first it seemed like you were part of the Bugs Bunny Political Correctness Brigade. Then I went further and you were nothing more than an ordinary right winger. Given the mentality of both reddit  marching columns I have little doubt that you can be both at the same time.  Seems like you are just somebody who likes to argue and provoke. Trust me. It is gone when you are 25 for well over 99% of the population.   Believe it or not there are adults in this world who take opinions seriously. Hopefully you will eventually grow into that.                  I checked. The 'Oklahoma's Own' article is as much an 'primary source' as the 'Alternet' one is. This has been an ongoing story that has been reported in *hundreds/thousands* of sources and dates back to 2014 or earlier. The reports of the passing of the Bill date back to February 2015. A Google search of the story shows... 407,000 hits ! I'm afraid that the 'Oklahoma's Own' story is certainly not 'primary' is any sense either temporal or in terms of content. It is very much a 'public domain' matter where 407,000 people, not all unique granted, have commented for over a year. I think you should revise your opinion. The 'Oklahoma's Own' story is only 'primary in the same sense that a report on a Presidential speech repeated in 100,000s of places is primary because it was filed 2 seconds before others. Less so actually as the story you mention was predated by tens of thousands of others.  OK you are entitled to your opinion, but in my view your opinion is 'grossly' inaccurate to the tune of hundreds of thousands. Can you point to *any* unique matter that was posted in 'Oklahoma's Own' that was not mentioned thousands of times before and which 'Alternet' can be accused of copying without attribution ?  Just as an incidental point as neither 'Alternet' nor 'Oklahoma's Own' can claim to be "original" what infinitesimal percent of news stories either in print or on the internet can claim to be truly "original" ?  I'm sure that a lot of local news actually is, but for anything outside of that I think a thousandth of a percent may be an overestimate.       I don't think so. First of all neither the 'Alternet' source nor the 'Oklahoma's Own' source are blogs, and I am certainly not connected with either one. Second of all the 'Alternet' source is *not a copy of the news story that appeared in Oklahoma's Own'*. It is a rewrite, and I'm sure that somebody connected to the original *could* complain about the lack of attribution. You have to understand that the audience of the two sources are not comparable at all, probably to the tune of 1000 to one. A general reader like myself is much more likely to encounter the story on 'Alternet' than elsewhere. Also, did it appear in *other* more local sources as well ? I'll try and check.  You may have cause for complaint about AlterNet's policies, and I can appreciate your concerns. Perhaps you should take it up with their editors.         Indeed. As I said to another commentator on a different place: I definitely would never shop in such a place myself, and neither would anyone with whom I come in contact with on a day to day basis. The clientele of such places tend to be of a higher socioeconomic status. Personally I live in what might be described as an unfashionable mid-working class neighbourhood. In the town here I live the highest proportion of customers of such places would be in the two neighbourhoods known as 'Hippy Heaven' (where good hippies go when they die) and 'Trendy Town'. I'm sure there is lesser but still a fairly high concentration out in the suburbs as well. Perhaps I get carried away with the snark at the pretentiousness of pseudo-progressives sometimes, but I have to get my little dig in now and then.  There are, by the way, labor issues connected to Whole Foods (Hole Foods ?) as well, but I can't write a manifesto for everything.      Ok. Sorry about the mistake.   It depends on what you consider anarchism to be. If you think that it involves the continuation of the commitment of the vast majority of the movement to rational thought then it is one more brick in the edifice against 'mystical belief' in some vague idea of natural. If you hold to the traditional belief of the vast majority of the movement in the exploitative nature of the market then you should be right at home with this little further tidbit. As I said, it all depends on how you conceive certain things that the worldwide movement has always held to and still holds today. I admit it is trivial, but most of the world is trivial.                 	199
 weedwizard420   How can trees be real if our eyes aren't real?   i hate "I HAVE INSOMNIA" no you dont you just didnt get much sleep the past couple of nights...   How much IP do you get at the end though? if it's the same as normal bots games that'd be pretty lame      he is actually correct i once had a friend who saw 60fps for 5 seconds and his eyeballs exploded :/ he is blind now.   Or 6. The number 6. Think about it six has 3 letters, 3 x 2 = an upside down 9. 9 is the prime number of 23, 23 is equal parts 2 and 3. 2 x 3 = 6. Coincidence? I think not.   Man, remember when this shit would show up on summoner showcase? :( those were the days   but do u play c8, m8?   yeah! exactly like i was really really exhausted and was completely done with the world, and if my bloods didnt stabilise when they did we wouldnt be having this conversation. I just hope there arent diabetics out there that are depressed and dont know why :/ it's such a simple cure   damn :/ Thank you though :)   Ive got an insane number of things happening in my life that'd depress anyone but ever since i started insulin 3 months ago my depressed rather suddenly came to an end, and i never really found out what caused it or for that matter, ended it. So i was wondering, did anyone else get depressed BEFORE finding out they got diagnosed, due to high blood sugar etc?? and did i then go once starting insulin? Just curious   ah TIL. Im here in the UK :P your system seems more accurate though   are glasses paid for by the NHS if needed?   can someone explain? i only recently got diagnosed and i was ignorant before .   I got told i had diabetes a few months after a pretty severe car crash (which is believed to be the cause) and i remember waking up on 2 occasions feeling INSANELY hungry along with shaking and other low symptoms. Is that normal? was it caused by the diabetes???   my mum and sister use this one on me all the time! it drives me mad! My girlfriend has yet to do so which is pretty nice, but i hope that one day she'll pick up on the signs that im low, might save my life one day who knows xD   btw folks a normal person's blood sugar is meant to be around 4-7 so you can imagine how rough these guys where feeling. Diabetes sucks, I wouldnt be here if i hadnt gotten diagnosed when i did, not because of the diabetes itself but because of the depression it caused. If you're depressed, peeing a lot, drinking a lot, get cramps, etc then get it checked out you could have type 1.   Hey man, it's rude to talk with your mouth open.   I THINK HE SAID HE LOVES IT WHEN REDDIT TURNS INTO A RICH CUNT   I don't think that's possible, sir.   You need a bigger desk.  	22
    Berkeley. I'm sorry, but this is one of the most common errors and it's infuriating. It's Berkeley.         Incredible summary--thank you so much for taking the time and thought!    Haven't been there but my favorite in Old Town is Miner's Gems. They have a lot of very fine stuff to browse--higher prices, but higher quality.    The only ones that are "easy" to polish by hand are softer sedimentary rocks. You'll have quite a bit of trouble with the obsidian by hand, even with the toughest of all sandpaper. Actually, one of things that has made polishing more fun on the ones I do by hand is using diamond files. They sound expensive--it's just synthetic grit with a handle. Much quicker and more fine-tuned than sandpaper or a sanding sponge. I have many crinoid and coral fossil specimens in a softer matrix and they clean off very well with diamond files. I cleaned matrix from a garnet (garnet schist) with the diamond files well too.               I agree--I've seen a few similar crinoids from northern michigan pieces I have. They often look like something far more interesting when cemented in at certain angles but that's what it is.   This is quite old and wouldn't work, I am imagining, for the few systems there are, which have custom languages developed already (D-Wave's systems anyway)... great find though!      Based on your other finds, which are all marine, I would agree that that is a large scallop.   Beautiful--where is this located? Generally, that is?   Given the low quality of the "silver" material I would guess it's glass with some additive. These are common everywhere. If someone wanted to show off a piece of even non-gem quality sapphire they wouldn't dishonor it with that mounting.   I have not had luck with these in a tumbler and don't recommend it. What's really fun is hand polishing these--very rewarding if you have the patience and some elbow grease to spare.   Agreed, lucky, lucky you....this is a dream find.   This is one of my favorites of any posted here. Never seen it before...doesn't look real (although I know it is).      Sir Terry Pratchett made one. This is a rather badass thing; digging up his own ore and working with an ancient metalworking expert. http://gizmodo.com/5643189/sir-terry-pratchetts-meteorite-sword-is-the-closest-we-get-to-excaliber   It looks like a highly polished stromatolite. The only strange thing is that the edges are rounded off as much as I would expect if that were the case.      Intel has been clear though, to their great credit, that onboarding is easier than with GPUs. Still, actual users of the first-gen Phi say that optimization is still a very long process--sometimes in the end just as long as porting code to run on GPUs. The upside is that when they do that they by default get better performance on their regular Xeons.    NVIDIA is afraid...in this space (at this point for this particular type of large-scale systems that MIC was drawn for). They owned the concept of accelerated large-scale compute but the addition of on-package memory, the ability to swap between coprocessor/plain Xeon is the only thing like it, and they have the x86/programming ecosystem. CUDA, OpenCL are great--NVIDIA GPUs offer way higher performance, but the ease is the real crux here.    Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance).   Yeah that likely didn't come from NC....      Can you let me know what state/region this was found?                     See, when I see something like a sink buried in the middle of the woods posted here the "backstory alert" clangs. Those grim, grim possibilities... Or yeah, they just didn't want to pay for the trash pickup. Far less interesting story prospect.                  Found something similar near Apache Junction AZ some time ago and indeed it's hematite.   To be honest my first (grim) thought was that it might be a ceremonial object for covering grave dirt.   There is some serious backstory here. That's all I can say. What's on the coin? Does it burn your fingers when you touch it? *shiver*      "Hush a bye baby" -- my god that is a chilling discovery. And very awesome. Congrats. What country/region?                           Well then it's definitely from the moon! Congratulations!  	56

 At first I did. I really really did. I sobbed for hours just thinking "why did I go in". I spent days on the couch wishing I could see her standing over me.   But ultimately, I don't think I can regret going in.   I know that Diane must have been a very pure soul to achieve something like that, almost pure enough to attain Moksha (in Hinduism, it's freedom from rebirth. An extremely perfect state. Its *way* better than rebirth, but it's hard for we who aren't very spiritually advanced yet to grasp).   I can't help that I wish I could see her again. But I also fear that her attachment to me could hinder her on her journey.  I'm sure that when she departed, she took birth in much better circumstances than in our house, worrying about me.     Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss, and I also sometimes feel guilty that Diane and I got to, essentially, say goodbye when most people don't.   I don't think it's a matter of you being unlucky, though. I don't think this was given to me because I deserved it, but maybe because I *needed* it due to my spiritual immaturity and weakness. I do know that Diane deserved a chance to say goodbye though.    That's so very sad, I can't even stand to picture my wife in that situation. I wish that coupled had gotten the last moments together Diane and I had. When I first learned learned her death was caused by an aneurysm, it seemed like something that must be incredibly rare. But now when I tell people about it, it feels like everybody knows of someone who's died this way.    Really? I wasn't on here back then, can you link to it? I would be interested in reading about similar situations.     Thank you.   	5
 Grrrrr      I tried and my pinky muscle instantly was strained!   I'm 22 and my ex is 37. We never found it strange. I got along better with him than any guys my age.   Now you're forced to wash you hand you sickos...      It kinda looks like a foot    YAAAAASSSSS!   I've always had a crush on 50, now I'm in love with him.   Hims kinda cute    Lmao it's because your hair is so corse and so much. But PENIS THUMBNAIL LOOK ALIKE   Glorious.   Thank you for your service!    Gotta love Krogers   What if you got really drunk one night and ended up going home with him. Drunk like you have long passed blacked out...you wake up in the morning at the not tattooed side of the face is laying on the pillow next to you. He then rolls over..... OUT! DONE!   Idk why that was the first thing that came to mind when I saw this post.   Damnit Ohio- after that big win then you pull something like this!    I have done this since I was about 13, I used to go after school with my homework and layout.    Face...   MISTRESS!! She's smart..   Well I'm sure it's nothing you haven't heard before..sometimes we need a little reminder lol   The Gods did us women a favor when they created you!    Lol OP I used to work at Nick   Jimmys! Hahaha   That is glorious!!    Bass..........head   Thanks everyone. I know he won't see this, I'm not a complete moron- but I think it's important to always say what you feel. Even if he can read it there are other people out there who can. And who knows, maybe one day he will.    Right on! Kills how crooked this world can be. 419  	26
 I just felt there was very little substance to it. Very little happened. She plodded along - met Adam (who then disappeared sharpish) and plodded along some more until the finale of the book. And that was it. Not a bad book - just...I expected more from McEwan I suppose. Especially after *Sweet Tooth*.   I would recommend *Sweet Tooth* over *The Children Act*. I really enjoyed it, but it did again feel a bit overlong in places. No worse than Atonement. But yes, it was a really good read.    I found DA Origins to be the worst for this.  Also a steam game called *Legend of Grimrock*. The spiders in that are huge and they jump at you. Their bodies fill the entire screen as they lunge. They make the scariest noise and they just attack randomly so it's super difficult to expect. Also very difficult to run away.   Does Bloodborne count?  I've played horror games. Slender. Amnesia, etc.   But when that damn werewolf broke out of that door three paces ahead of me I've never jumped so much at a game in my life.   That is perfect. Thankyou very much :)   50 Shades from Christian's perspective. *gag/vomits.*   Well played, sir :)   Grey   Mostly I'm thinking of the kind you get through the door. But email spam is also useful. Any kind of crap you don't want to receive, that isn't quite a letter, and just goes straight in the bin.  It's all for research. I promise it's not as weird a question as you might think.   I haven't read *Enduring Love* but I really want to. *Saturday* as well. *Atonement* was great but I felt it was a bit too long, parts were too dragged out.  Did you read *Sweet Tooth*?   You should read *'The Cement Garden'* by him. That's an uncomfortable read. On Chesil Beach was just awesome.   Doesn't the Wii U have Gamecube compatibility? Not something I've ever had to consider so I don't know...   It actually did! :)    Literature does that ;)   Then make it big enough. That's the point :)   I suppose so. But with the gameplay being so different to any other MOBA I feel like it doesn't quite fit into the genre. It looks much more interesting. And I don't really like MOBA's.   Thankyou for this. My life is a better place with this in it.   I remember when I first got my original Xbox. Way back when. I really wanted to play the first Halo game. I'd heard great things about it, but the person who sold me my xbox had lent it out, and was waiting to get it back to give it to me.  I thought I could wait, and not play my xbox till I got Halo. But I got a pile of games with it. Midtown Madness. A Rayman game. A few others. But, most interestingly of all I got a game called...  Morrowind.  I didn't know what this was. The cover was a title and a symbol. And I refused to play it, waiting for Halo. I put it off. I would go over and pick up the case and look at it. For some reason I was strangely drawn to it. There was no reason for me to like it. I was young, mostly new to gaming, never really played or heard of anything like this. Didn't know what an RPG was. After a while I thought *"Dammit, I'm just gunna play this game. I can't stop thinking about it, sod Halo"*  It. Was. Amazing. It still is to this day one of the best RPG's I've played. It changed how I viewed and played games, what stories I wrote and how I wrote them. Introduced me to the concept of games being more than racing, or platforming.   I never did get Halo. I didn't play the first one until the MCC came out on XB1.   Also Fable 2 on Xbox 360. The only reason I got a 360, and fuck was that an amazing game. My mom got me a really good 360 (there were about two dozen version (at an estimate guess) and I was worried I wouldn't get the right one). But my Mom pulled through and got me the best one, and my Grandma got me Fable 2. First Christmas I didn't spend with my family, I was playing Fable 2.  Also Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. My parents tricked me and my sisters and pretended we had nothing. Then unveiled it. I got Space Jam. My little sister got Casper. And my big sister got Crash Bandicoot. This was in...'96?? From that moment on I've been a gamer.  Tl;dr: Morrowind for Xbox. Fable 2 for 360. Crash Bandicoot for PS1.   Here is the showcase of the gameplay in action, showing you the core gameplay system, and it is just...awesome.  [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp3NKQlJPuo)  And another video, about the game in general.  [Clickity 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiwzcurrhAY)  The first video is more exciting. Watch that first. :)   Not if I'm planning on having 90k by the end of the year. It's taken me too long and I need to knuckle down :(  But thanks for the encouragement :)   I was meant to work on my novel today too. I'm just coming up to 20,000 words in my own novel. Making piss-poor progress.  I was meant to work on my game today. I didn't. Thankfully my lead isn't too demanding just yet, and I still have time. Though I think the workload is going to smack me, and hard, when it comes. This is just for the demo. This isn't even the whole game.  Ooh! I did get to play bass. Didn't quite learn a new song but I perfected two I had been practicing and started a third.  I nearly went out a bought a ukulele for the shits and giggles - because secretly everyone wishes they could play the ukelele. Right?  About 75% less productive today than I wanted to be. I got an assignment for my *other* game today, which isn't too hard, so I hope I can chuck that out tomorrow...  *walks off grumbling about productivity*   Inspiration is a BS lie. If anyone worked only when they were "motivated" or "inspired", nothing would ever, ever get done.   Fine I'll introduce a caveat: as good as, if not somewhat better, than what most people would expect from a contemporary AAA release. No game is flawless.  But my own experience, on XB1, was, and is still, perfect.   I saw gameplay. I've seen the core function of the game. And that in itself looks awesome. I'm certainly skeptical because the inherent flaws are immediate, but I'm willing to give them a chance and see what they've done to sort them out. I don't trust expo demonstrations, I really don't. So I'm going to keep my eye out and see what happens, and how it expands, and, most importantly, on what they have to say about the gameplay.  Otherwise, it looks awesome.   The Elder Scrolls - the three main ones.  Why absolutely no nudity? I really have to ask. Because The Witcher ticks *every single one* of those boxes.    0.01% inspiration.  99.99% GET OFF YOUR ARSE AND DO SOME BLOODY WORK, LAD!   I got into the beta for TESO. That game was dead to me before it's release. I know enough to be cautious about games, and I rarely ever buy games on the day of their release. For obvious reasons.  I just want to be so excited for this game.   Buy a Wii u. Backwards compatibility, after all.   Sorry, bud =]   Computer Science. Will shoehorn you into programming, as a lot of science is programming languages...(as far as I know.)  Also, as pointed out, even if you don't go into gaming you'll find that with a Computer Science degree, any other job will almost definitely earn you more money.     Memento.  Hey, see what I did there ;)   *The Virgin Suicides*, by Eugenides. And,  *On Chesil Beach*, by Ian McEwan.   Because they are the two strongest openings to a book I have ever encountered.   Support the industry that you love. Flaws and all.  I think that's the crux of the argument.   That's a fair enough statement.   A release date would also be nice :)   This is totally dependant on where you live. I live in the UK and there are caveats that allow people to not be paid - assuming that the person doing the working doesn't mind working voluntarily.  If you're american it might change state-to-state. Or anywhere else. I know the UK government does supply the info, and can be found on their website. Otherwise, any governing bodies for films should have the information somewhere.   Either way the answer is a Google away.   400M into advertising. Thankyou Activision.  100M into making the game.    (Extremely rough estimates)   Given the spate of absolutely abysmal releases recently (or not-so-recently), when a studio like CD Projekt Red comes along and does everything perfectly, they're praised. Rightly so, they even included a little slip inside the game thanking people for buying their game. That's how you do a game release right.   Then on the other hand you have a game more typical of a AAA release: buggy, unfinished, poor quality. Complaining is the gamers way of striving for something better than what we have.   TW3 proved that it can be done, and be done perfectly. It's easy to slate a bad game when a few weeks back we had one of the best releases in recent memory - and for a truly excellent game.   As for frame rate issues for TW3. I got it on XB1 and I've hardly ran into any issues.   Don't blame devs, devs aren't to blame. Devs want to put out as good a game as they possibly can, but that's not up to them. It's up to the publishers. Blame the publishers.   You run around and shoot things.   Physical books. Because a library on a device can't even compare to a library on a shelf.   I know I am. That game looks amazing. Who else will be getting it when it comes out?   For two weeks every summer I used to go my Nanna and Granddads house. It was massive, absolutely huge. Had a swimming pool and a jacuzzi. They used to rent out the bottom floor to holiday-makers during the summer-period, that's how nice and big it was. There was this tree we used to climb (my siblings and many, various cousins). About 2-3 acres of garden just to run around in and play. It was amazing. Really great time.  Anyway a few years back they moved out - the place was too large to look after and my grandparents were getting on. Next thing I heard it had been knocked down and a block of flats put in. That sucks.    That's fair enough. Whatever works better for you. You just have to be on top of your word count and progress. And I know how slow it can be going when you aren't sure what your characters' next steps should be.   I wrote my first novel spontaneously. I prefer to say organically, because it grew organically as it went.   This one I have a plan for. And I think maybe a plan is better. Certainly this second novel has more depth, and more is happening underneath. The characters come together and intertwine better than in my first one. Purely because I've got it all planned out what exactly my two main protagonists are doing. Even when they're not together I know what they've been doing in the absence.   Haven't not completed this novel I can't support a structured plan entirely - but the way things are going, I'm happy to endorse a plan.   Maybe write a decent structure, and a proper plan. Then, when you only have time to write a page or two, you know exactly what you want to write for those two pages. Best advice I can give. Keep you on track. Heading in the right direction. Less turning around and rewriting and seeing what was happening, and if it makes sense and is leading in the right direction.   I'm making a list of things to watch/listen to/read that'll help me write when I'm not in the mood. Anything you can contribute is great.   Not a horror novel. Horror elements. But not in the orthodox sense.  You got a decent plan for it? A structure to follow?   I should have guessed that. Ah well, I answered another question for you for free :D  This novel it's about malevolent spirits. I'm heading towards a very difficult scene, that I've been slowly working my way towards sentence-by-sentence for weeks. I'm there now, just a few more details. So it's been slow progress.   You sound like you're already aware of how bad it is to rewrite, rather than just finish. So I don't have to warn you about the pitfalls of rewriting constantly. Whatever you write you're not going to be happy with it. It's not meant to be good. It's not going to be good. It's never going to be good. Leave it be, that's how it is with everyone. It doesn't matter how many drafts you write it's still going to be the same, and you'll never like it. You have to edit it into shape. That's where it all starts to come together. When you edit it. Not when you write it.      Progress wise? About 25k words, aiming to finish at 90k. Nice round number :)  And yours?   I'm pretty much the same. Progress is super slow. Almost at a halt.   To keep my life on some kind of track:  * Read (this one will never end)  * Complete The Witcher 3  * Finish writing novel  * Finish work on video game x 2  * Put poetry on Figment/Reddit for feedback (done - awaiting feedback)  * Convince others to start YouTube channel with me.  * Find short story competitions and enter  * Check Shooting People [film jobs]  * Check IndieDB [indie-game jobs]  And that's it. Just do all that and my life will head in the right direction. Not. So. Easy.       I'd say you could possibly come back to DA after The Witcher 3, but I just think it would be so flawed after playing TW3 - an unadulterated masterpiece.  I'm sorry to have put you off DA. It started well, but didn't hold it. I wanted to like it but couldn't, so I know what it's like to have to drop a game. Let's just say - if you do drop it - I'm saving you a few hours that will only end in heartbreak.   Story is better. Combat is better. Protagonist is better. Quest system and quests are better. There isn't as much variety within the biomes - and I have to give Inquisition it's due, those dragon's were impressive. But The Witcher has better gameplay, and a more polished look. There's also less time sorting through your party to see if the trousers your mage has on is as good as the one in your pack. You only have to look after Geralt; infinitely easier. The story in The Witcher holds together tighter, even when you're away from it for a while doing Witcher-y things and side quests.   This is all The Witcher 3, Witcher 2 is somewhat different. But if you're playing 2, finish it, it's a great game. Then move sharpish onto 3. Which is an amazing game.   Just wanted to say thanks for this. I've come across Grist before, but not poetry. It's nice to see poetry isn't dead in England.   I find that games like that are so long you'll never get one or the other finished if you don't just concentrate on one. I recommend concentrating on just one. And I recommend concentrating on just The Witcher.  I'm sorry. They're such good games.   Don't write a strict outline. Write a basic one, a bare one. Chart down the major points, and nothing in between. This gives you absolute freedom to do anything in between. You have the main points down, and those are the turning points, you just head from to the other to the next. If a new character comes in, there's space to do that, if one dies, there's space for it. If something totally significant happens that you hadn't counted on, that's fine, just as long as you're heading to your next key point, you're on track.  Then *edit edit edit edit edit edit*.   Whilst I enjoyed Inquisition, I tried really hard to finish it, it just got to a point where I couldn't do it. It just wasn't working out.  I recommend saving yourself the trouble and just swapping it out for *The Witcher 3*. Which in a few hours proved better than the 40+ I put into DA before giving up.   What's wrong with the public domain name Loki?   I've got another one:  Somebody called me pretentious once. I was so outraged I spat out my latte.  Ah, coffee related humour.    Yours to have =]   Times like I wish I had played  * Any of the Mass Effect games  * Any of the Uncharted games  * any of the Just Cause games.  Iyam behind.   What you meant to say was: "Another greedy, money-grabbing attempt to subvert what was hitherto a decent escape from a declined, capitalistic culture too concerned with shit tv."  Mostly it's the "shameless, money-grabbing, leave no survivors (especially, ya know, art) attitude.   You just wanna get the specs. HD, LED are your main concerns. If you can push into 4K then why not. Sony do overall make good TV's but don't entirely discount the other good TV brands. (My kinect is covering the maker of my TV, I think it's a panasonic. I dunno I got it from Tesco).   So like a mo-cap suit?   Sounds feasible. My only issue would be power, having a big ole' battery strapped to your condom-suit somewhere.   Ps4 I think is meant to be technically superior. But being as the only decent exclusive PS4 has is Bloodborne - a gothic, low-lit game - then eh... Killzone looked good, but I have no idea if the game is any good.  The E3 footage of Horizon looking stunning, however.  What really matters is this: graphics don't make or break a game. Now what's an amazing game? Shadow of the Colossus. Not the best looking game. But it's one of the best that will ever be made.   That explains the parentheses in your title =]   Why did the hipster burn his tongue?   He drank coffee before it was cool.   Game is this?   Ah I really loved The Maze Runner, though it was fantastic.   John Dies is a good book, a touch long, I thought, but actually a very good book. I got into it fairly quickly.   Sounds like you want an Xbox One then.   From your list: Evolve is a very good game, but I don't know how many people play it now. Ori is meant to be a spectacular game, but not a very long one - though it is the cheapest on your list. GTA5 might be a good shout, people will still be playing that online, and you can get a good few hours out of the campaign.  Otherwise, The Witcher 3, hands down, is the best way to go.   Hands down :)  Best movie of all time, imo.    Well, this is perfect.  That's it, I'm done. There's nothing more I can say. I few itchy word choices, but that kept the tone low and somber, rather than edgy and sick, which is what I would have gone for.  The pace is good, the style and narrative is spot-on, absolutely perfect.  But I think the first three lines aren't as strong as the rest of the poem. I think you use those to find your voice, and it doesn't come through until the fourth line. That's my only critique.   Thought I'd return the favour for *My Dreams are Fire* but this is kinda so perfect it belies critique.    Thanks, friend. I wrote this a good number of years back in an emotional rage, and only recently came to and tidied it up. So it's good to hear some positive feedback, that it isn't just a messed up piece of shit. So thanks. I'm glad to find you liked it.   Appreciate you putting so much thought and effort into this, I really do :)   The Prestige. 'Cause Nolan.   Thanks, that was great feedback. It's always nice to hear what others think, and it was pretty awesome for me to read too. Thanks, stranger =]   Well I guess the only thing I would need - were I to set out on my own venture - is advice on promoting. I've promoted stories before, sometimes fairly successfully, it's just a bitch. A lot of back scratching. For someone successful it would be worth getting an insiders view. All I need is a story I can either serialise, or work into a full novel.   Thanks, this was great. I will rewrite it tomorrow. Seems I'm going to have to elucidate some of this vagueness.   Horse Armor. It doesn't matter where it started. That's where it went to shit.   Bray-vo! En-core!   Ahh, I see what you did there! hehehe.   Let's talk about something positive. Turn that frown upside down! Whoo!   Ah, it'll take a lot more than a touch of negativity to make me regret ever receiving a fantastic little orange envelope.   Yeah I made a thread, on the gaming subreddit too, got a fair bit of negativity. Y'know I expected some people to not agree with me, but I also expected someone to agree with me - at least a little bit. Nope.   It's worth it to read to expand the world, and the Underthing most of all. It is worth it for people who Rothfuss's world and writing.    Dopamine.   Yeah, I got all that. I've never seen a call for a query that doesn't include a bit of information about a book - a blurb, in essence. Everything else I have. A synopsis too. Enough to cater to individual agents requests. Just want to tidy this up, the rest, I think, is ok.   Trying to find a balance between vagueness and information. Don't know if that's a good idea, though.   Also no, this isn't all of my query. I have a cover letter too. But that's its own demon.   Care to lend an experienced hand (advice)?   It's a query letter. Part of the requirement. Just a short synopsis to describe the book, and get a feel for what it is. Blurb is just the best way to phrase it.   This poem is a few years old at this point and I only met you this afternoon. ^^ =D. I've always put a lot of time and editing into this so it wasn't good to start with.  Thanks =]   Bloody Fallout 4 first. I'm pretty sure that after that it'll be the next TES. I mean, they can just sheer off a small team to remaster Morrowind, that's all I'm asking for.   No, no...I didn't misspell 'fourty'. English...English spelling.  I'm going for vagueness, and I'm just trying to find the balance between information and vague.   Have some happiness =]   One, thanks for that :)  Two, yeah, blurb writing...not a talent. Trying to fit a lot of information in a short space, not easy.   Thankyou, and I absolutely understand what you're saying about there being too many phrases. I certainly missed that one.  You're second blurb is absolutely perfect, except I want to mention his...they're not humans, I guess the best way to say it would be homunculus - and I want to introduce that there is one of those who manages to catch up with him as well.   Thanks for typing back. I'm glad you enjoyed the critique. I always like it when people put back saying they were grateful rather than just telling to F-off and leave their poem alone.   As far as the poem goes, it really was excellent, and thank you for letting me read it.    A game as excellent as Morrowind being the exception, of course. :)   I'm going to start pushing trying to publish this soon, and would really love a polished blurb to go along with the book. I would appreciate any advice, or insightfulness you have.  The novel is called Loki:  Loki is a born and bred survivor, having been chased for fourty years he is confident his abilities will keep him alive and out of their hands[*]. A shocking death and a surprise ambush from one of his old kin may just knock everything he knows out from under his feet. His pursuers are growing more and more desperate, and he might finally have to resurface to face them once and for all.  *generally don't know what to do with this. Their hands is too vague, but I'm trying to not be too specific.    I'd ask you more questions but then you risk becoming my blog/serial guru. And you don't want that.   Thanks for everything =]   Meaning you're getting back into it? Or not?   Whoa, thanks so much that's an excellent reply. Really great information.   Also well done, impressive statistics. No longer active, why's that?     I have heard of Skywind, I meant to look into and totally forgot until just this moment.    Anyone else agree? I would love to get a chance to play that game on Xbox One or PS4.   I'm sure you know, but just to warn you TSRoST is nothing like TKKC in general. Really not even similar anything between them. Just Auri.   *adds Ready Player One to 'reading list'*   No problem on the feedback. And that's a great solution. 'Though' probably wasn't the best choice but I think you've found it of your own accord (certainly better than my suggestion). Awesome. :)  And you continue the alliteration - you, yours. Double-win =]   That's really interesting. And I knew absolutely nothing about it. Mind if I ask how one would go about starting up one of these? And maintaining it? And promoting it, how you seem to have done.   He's a selfish prick too preoccupied with his own survival, and too wrapped up in his own conflicts.   Thanks man, that's perfect =] I love it.   That is the best trilogy of books I've ever read. I cannot recommend a book more wholeheartedly than I recommend The Amber Spyglass. It is fantastic. Amazing. Perfect. Just...finish the trilogy. I can't put into words how good it is.  	112

He hasn't played all that much for Atletico Madrid has he? If he plays like that in La Liga this season then Simeone will be a happy man.   Edit: Yes, I know Mexico is not from South America but they play with the same kind of style and verve.   If he would have punched it then it would have been a Dino-sore.

 What?   I loved the cinematography. Robert Elswit is one of my favorites, he shot two of the most beautiful looking films of 2014: this and Inherent Vice.   With example.  Thanks!!   His career, oh man his career. It would've gone places.   Wow that's pretty neat.   Hello again.  Pretty much most of the films on the list, out of the ones I've seen anyway.      Nope, who knows maybe they'll put him in right at the last second.   Great movie btw         Can somebody tell me a little about this character?   AWESOME!!   It's playing here in Perth.    Please provide examples as well. Thanks! (I'm new here)   Also, can someone please give a better/more appropriate subreddit to post this on, thanks!   Deepthroatin'    Holy.......fuckin shit.      A Paul Thomas Anderson collection.   That is hilarious.   He was fired? I didn't know that.   My dad was telling me that when he was in Germany, he was in this souvenir shop and this american guy was trying to buy all this merchandise with American dollars. He kept arguing with the woman who wouldn't take the dollars and saying how he needs to convert the currency to Euros. The American didn't understand and kept saying (in a typical American accent) "These are American Dollars! You gotta take the dollars GODDAMN!!"   Maybe. But Star Wars The Force Awakens will be.

Also if you enjoyed that one i recommend you check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkTbO78L5k) trailer as well!   wow, that was a surprisingly effective response.    Have you seen the trailer?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics  Go down to the bottom of 'other potential projects'. I stuffed up the wording, they haven;t announced it yet, my bad.   Well I actually just finished watching Into the Wild. I cried my fucking heart out okay? I'm not going to explain why, just watch the film and you'll find out. That's twice I've cried today :'(   The Batman Arkham games? Fuck yeah   Ummm why all the downvotes?   Fuck, I forget to mension shutter island. Awesome movie! Underrated!   Fight Club   That first teaser for the last airbender had me fucking stoked.  Also the Man of Steel trailers, although MOS was not as bad as people say it was.   I actually held my hand in front of the screen at first. It didn't fucking help.   Holy fucking shit!

Yes I agree. I've never heard echoes or wings for marie, but I will check them out.  With me, I melt away when I listen to 'Breathe' by Pink floyd as well as the rest of the album.    I feel the EXACT the same way you do. I have a similar first experience with this song. I was in Germany with my family visiting my grandparents, I remember getting Love of Gold for my 10th birthday (Yes, I was way a head of my age with music, books and film; I still am)  and I remember waking up at exactly 7:00 in the morning and walking into the out onto the front porch  with the CD. It was beautiful outside, the sun was rising and the snow was gently melting off the grass and trees; it was beautiful. I remember sitting down and putting the CD in the player they had on the porch. For the whole 14 minutes I was blown away, just sitting on the porch to my grandparents house, looking out across the grass and forest. I'll never forget that day, after that I would listen to the song every morning. It is unarguably one of the best songs ever written and performed. Words can't even describe it.   Fuckin A      Dont downvote this, it's pretty cool    I bet the picture of the joker and this pic of bats are exact reactions to eachother.   Fucking love this movie, I can't even describe what it's about. I didn't even know what the fuck is going on half the time, but something tells me you're not supposed to...   Noooooo that annoying little kid from Hugo? Seriously?    OP, what's actually happened?   Wow, awesome video! What's your favorite of his?   Now THAT was an excellent fucking trailer.  Sold.   Hell yeah!   Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before. I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.  For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book.  The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.  I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman. Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.  Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant.  Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.  TL;DR - I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen  edit- of course all of you know what Arkham Asylum is! Duh! (stupid me)   Let's not forget that the guy who re-wrote Batman v Superman has won an academy award for best adapted screenplay (Argo)   The Heat I thought was pretty decent.   Wow, I had no idea insomnia was a remake or that the prestige was adapted from a book.   Roger motherfucking Deakins. The man is a god.   An original film. Like he always does.   OP, you're a hero, but you seriously need to get rid of that job and find something you actually enjoy doing. I wish you all the best.   I agree. David Ayer nor Zack Snyder are perfect directors, with that said they have done VERY good movies in the past. End of Watch is one of the most underrated movies of the decade and, personally, I enjoyed 300, Man of Steel (although far from perfect)and Watchmen. I'm hoping they don't stuff up the iconic characters they are dealing with. Both films have potential to be really bad, but they also have potential to be really really good.   Just need a little help, I saw on the cover of Death of the family, where you can see the Joker's face, It says "Volume 2". Do I need to read Vol 1? Or any of the crossover tie-in stories?       FTFM   What  The  Actual  Fuck   That guy seems to be enjoying it...   My father once called me a "fucking little cunt" when I was about 12.   Just post it to imgur and link it below! Also, please explain why it's your favorite, thanks!      Awesome! Let me know your thoughts after!   How?  Wow, thanks for all the downvotes!   ^   Well, IMO, this is the best thing Marvel have done. It is (**IMO**) better than the first. It is slightly better than Daredevil, but I think it's a little unfair to compare those two as they are completely different.   You get to spend a lot more time with the Avengers as characters, the humor is more present and a lot better than everything Marvel have done, the action is better handled than the first, the villain is much more interesting and funnier than Loki (not to say that he was a bad villain) and there's more Avengers- Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision (ESPECIALLY Vision) make great additions to the team. It improves upon everything!     I fucking loved it, one of the best films of the year already.  I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. They really fleshed out all the characters, especially Hawkeye. I was surprised that Ultron was so funny...in a dark but good way.    The soundtrack hits hard. It was modified by Danny Elfman and that really translates onto the screen. It's great, and they use it at the most appropriate times.      One, and it's fucking epic.      They announced that Thanos would NOT make an appearance in Age of Ultron.  Sneaky fuckers they are.    No I'm afraid not.  Whaaaaaaat thats so cool! I need to find this now!!  The hunt begins!   FINALLY! an aussie collector.  Where did you get that version of dredd?   Yeah, it had just never been posted on here before, which I found surprising.    Hahaha true true   This sounds like a story. It is a leak from one of the crew members? "an acclaimed actor" are you sure it isn't DiCaprio who was fighting with the director?    This just may be it.   and PTA? what do y'all think about him?   Yeah apparently they can only shoot a few hours at a time because the area where they are shooting is (mostly) untouched by man. Where did you learn that he's being a dick? Do you have a source on that?   Yeah I was a bit surprised to learn that they were shooting in NY. I also read somewhere that they are shifting the timelines as well, so that the childrens story will be set during the 80's and the adult story will be set in the 2010s.       Spiderman: That's right Sony, Fuck Off!   What the fuck!? They're shooting the 'it' remake in New York??? WHY? WHY WHY WHY WHY. This is my favorite book! Why are they setting it in the city??????????? It wont have the same effect as if it were set in a small town!   This should be pretty good. I hope so.   Exactly like murder. Why didn't I say that?   It means kill. So a snuff film is basically a porno except at the end, they kill either the man or the woman. Like they genuinely kill one of the actors in the porno. Sometimes they fake it, sometimes not...   Oh, I was under the impression that in some point during the film the tribe just randomly attacked the crew. Man, that is a fucking weird movie.   Sorry about all the questions, last one!  Did the tribe go apeshit when they found out the crew were hurting animals?  I'm too pussy to look this shit up, I'm afraid I'll see what you were talking about D:   So this tribe, are they friendly at first? You mentioned they go ham, I thought this meant they were ok in the beginning.          What the actual fuck. That's not even a movie.   I haven't seen the film what happened with the turtle   the monkey?   I dunno, It's just a thought.  Maybe when you exit the womb, you gain consciousness, so at the same time the life has left your previous body, it enters your new infant baby body.   *reincarnation    NSFW just in case.     Wow, your collection is fucking amazing. Some great movies there.         What are your thoughts on the film?   This film is going to be biblical.    well....it looks kinda....fucking terrible.   Wow Depp is playing a normal character for once. This looks incredible.      OP, do you know if this girl is in the shit w/ her parents? How did your friends sister react to it?   I agree. He just starred in a gritty crime drama called 'A most violent year' and now the guy is about to be in one of the biggest films of all time (Star Wars, yes I'm calling it now) AND then he'll go on to star as a villain in a superhero movie! And that's just what I know of!   Both of the Antagonists in those films deserved their end.      Well, It'll make more than Skyfall did.  I think it may be better than Skyfall, as Mendes said that this will top it.   I really don't know what to say. Like......fuck....   Why must Scarlett Johansson be so goddamn hot?  Anyway, I'm pumped out of my mind for this. If only it wasn't produced by Dreamworks they could go for a much grittier tone, more true to the original.   Not an action movie but Fight Club is up there with the great 90's films.   That interviewer, what a fucking idiot.  I've seen him before and I've never liked him, this just cements by opinion of that prick.   PLOT TWIST: The cookies are....evil.  I don't fucking know, alright?   GHOST IN A SHELL ARRRRGHHHH YEAHHHHSSSS   Could you elaborate on the first sentence?   I forgot this was coming out. It'll probably be terrible.   This hurts.   Birdman or American Sniper?  Or Whiplash   2010 - Inception  2011 - Drive  2012 - Django Unchained  2013 - Prisoners  Guess anyone?   [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/z2ybobW.png) from the trailer sold me. The first time I saw it, I thought to myself, THAT is Star Wars.    Is this just for America? Are there posts like these except for australia???   Without giving too much away, how was Vision? Does he kick ass?   I actually agree with you there, I have always found villains to be much more interesting.        	137
 Early celebration for this win over jNWU   I just lost the game    Thor   I saw the thumbnail and thought, "who's the black stark?" Then realized I'm retarded upon enlargement.    Would have been great if it was a 5 that saw the imaginary number.   I know the company, Brooks Stevens. My brother works there. Lives in Milwaukee, great company to work for. If this is the one anyways...   Originally from Allenton, PM me if you have questions.   Tommy Lee Jones disagrees...   Love these guys, seen them in Milwaukee twice.  Great on-stage presence.    To be fair, it says "unlimited drinks", and that can be quite appealing for customers interested in the more expensive specialty drinks.     I forgot that, as American's, we are one entity.  We act and think as a whole.  Oh wait that makes no sense at all.  Just like you and your ignorance.     Account for 7 minutes.  You are a piece of shit.     McCarthy signed with Arizona last week.   14 with Maryland and rutgers now.  Go Big14!   Now u do know that's true.   There is only one "The U." and it certainly isnt located in Minnesota.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MapmxTJ6mvg   He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal.   Saw you in Milwaukee, President Obama!  Count on Wisconsin goin' blue!      http://www.mpp.org/states/wisconsin/  At least there are some movements and glimmers of hope out here in Wisco.  But as long as we have a Red, State Congress it will never happen.     	21
 I deserved that.   I'm not really whining about it just explaining a possible explanation. Yes other countries get shat on, the US just happens to be the biggest target with lots of skewed perceptions which are easily mocked(fat, loud, proud bible thumpers), as well as it's cultural (and geographic) isolation from the rest of the world (American football, imperial system, military expenditures/incursions, healthcare system, tipping, not showing sales tax in the price, ez cheeze, etc.).  On top of all that, it's been the preeminent world super power for the past 70 years. The USSR was close militarily during the Cold War(really a wash because of nuclear arsenals, though with conventional weapons it lagged behind), although it lacked the economy to ultimately compete;  China is currently even economically (or a little bit stronger) but lacks the military projection that allows the US to dictate a lot of policy they wouldn't otherwise have the capability to pull off.  So you've got all these factors rolled into one country that's honestly just a big, easy, slow moving target for global mockery. It can get tired,  and it's like, we're exempt from sympathy because "we're like the rich white guys complaining about persecution".  The best part? When I respond in kind I'm just an ignorant, boorish American.  Oh well, I guess it's the price you've got to pay for your country's disproportionate influence on global affairs since the end of WWII.   My bad homie.   Oh well then thanks for doing your part to assure that the site continues to pump out quality content. You're a fucking warrior, bro.   Could you imagine everyone else in the world constantly shitting on you? Your country's shit, your country kills babies for oil, your country is full of fat people. Imperial system? Hur hur morons!, etc.  Our pride is a defense mechanism. It started as blind patriotism after WWII, but has since morphed into a defense mechanism.   cheers!     Whining about karma is even lamer.   If I wasn't friends with anyone who called everyone in my country the worst people in the world I wouldn't have as many friends as I do. Sometimes you have to educate people with wrong views (me in this case), otherwise we're just a constantly divided people fighting over our respective borders and their contents.  I actually like Scotland and have never met a bad person from there, but sometimes when you're drunk and you're challenged on your aggressive drunk comments, you double down instead of correctly accepting your mistakes.   So here I am, apologizing for the comment I made about your country and countrymen and hoping that we can bury the hatchet in the name of friendship.   that's as many people as my city.   So... friends?   Not ordering enough to have left overs is what's plain wrong.   Scotch is good. OK, I coneeded a point, now you need to conceed a point about America.  This is the only way we can grow as people and learn to love each other :)  I'm willing to hang up the hate hat if you are.  Friends?   It's pretty standard but a lot of places will also do like "3 meat combo with 2 sides", that kind of thing. Still by weight though.   Nothing better than the left over BBQ smorgasbord sandwich the next day.    Is a scot really trying to play "whose country has had a greater impact on today's world" with an ignorant yank? Bro, your country peaked in 1298 after the battle of Falkirk. Your most famous cultural attach is Willy the Groundskeeper from an American TV cartoon. Golf is nice to fall asleep to on a Sunday afternoon though, I'll give you that.    I'm pretty sure you buy by weight at Franklins. That looks like 1/4 lb of sausage, 1 lb of brisket and 1 lb of ribs. Certainly could be a single serving but just as easily could be for 2-3 people.   Serving size may vary*   My favorite pizza topping is hyperbole :P   I'm pretty sure I said something to the effect of "scottish people are the anglo-world's equivalent to the runt of the litter".    OMG! He's using a linguistic contraction that developed in a localized culture over a couple hundred years! Let's point out that he's different than me and isolate him because of it!   If this is something visitors are concerned about when they visit the states, perhaps it is something that visitors could spend 20 minutes researching before they arrive as to avoid any potential confusion.  I'm know I'm going to learn and respect the cultural and commercial architect of the countries I visit and I expect others to do the same in my country.   This is a funny comment because I simply believe that we are different, and get frustrated that the way we do things is considered the "wrong" way. I don't think either system is inherently superior, they boil down to a divergence of extremely trivial cultural developments.  I've never said "not tipping is so STUPID how are you supposed to get good service if the server doesn't have the incentive of a nice tip" nor "including taxes in the sticker price of goods can create a misunderstanding and dissonance between the actual value of goods and their taxed rate".  Meanwhile I responded to a comment saying that "the system of tipping *is* bad, and an established living wage salary without tipping is a superior system", and "america is backwards for not including taxes on their sticker prices".  I was drunk and feisty in my responses, granted. However, even if I was exhibiting the dunning-kruger effect, how were you not?    but some things like alcohol, cigarettes, and gas have an additional tax in some counties or cities.   These taxes are different than sales tax (they're 'vice taxes') and are already added to the price.  For instance, NYC has a very high cigarette tax but the sticker price reflects that from the get go.    lol drunk redditing comes with it's share of hazards I guess :P   I dunno. Drunk redditing comes with it's own hazards.  freakin cobweb.   Ah the old 'Second Launcher' theory.   Right I just think it needed to be bridged better. For instance, "if you made it past child birth your life expectancy increases x amount and if you're male and make it past 21 it increases by x amount more."  Pretty pedantic on my part but how else are you supposed to drunk reddit?   Thanks mate and apologies. Drunk and belligerent redditing is good value :P yelling at strangers over inane crap is kind of cathartic in doses, especially when it diverges from your usual MO.   "well, and my brother greg."   Left Hand Free is like if Alt-J and The Black Keys had a song baby. I like it. Different than their usual sound for sure.   The thing with bone injuries, especially ones that severe, is the mental battle as opposed to the physical one. It's gonna be a slug fest against every instinct In his body saying "stop" before he gets to full speed.    "You get chased out of restaurants if you don't pay it"  Sounds like a solution to your problem?  "Sales tax vary"  Wahhhh, spend 3 fucking minutes of your trip planning on learning the sales tax of the states you'll be in. Americans get grilled for not being educated towards visited countries and yet we have to deal with this bull shit.   Fucking god damnit it's not complicated. Fucking Australians are such shit for brains. I can deal with Brits lording over us but fucking Australians? Y'all are the Arkansas of the Anglo world. Honestly Scottish people make y'all look like New Zealanders.    I'm extremely empathetic towards suicide and persons who see no answer but it, but suicide can definitely be a 'selfish' act. I can honestly only speak for myself but dealing with depression, accepting it and so forth, the contemplation comes when you have narrowed your field of vision to such a sliver that honestly all you can think about is yourself. "Where do *I* fit in? Who am *I* really? Am *I* really worth it?  That's the thing I think, it's not selfish in the traditional sense of 'taking an extra slice of pizza when there's not enough to go around' but in the 'wow I'm so miserably self absorbed right now'.  But then seeing it first hand and it's reverberation through the person's family and friends; no matter how low I feel, how insignificant and inconsequential, no matter how inward and introspectively down I get,  I can always count on the sudden burst of 3rd person awareness that takes Me out of me and allows me to not be selfish.   It's a fucking battle, between you and yourself, where a part of you that wants to die and it's selfish enough to try to drag the whole with it.    I'm just drunk and in the mood to argue to be frank.    Ideal circumstances with a light launchee and a heavy launcher and a perfectly inflated (not too full not too empty) blob for sure. The blobs kinda small though and the launcher looks average weight and from a relatively low jump spot.  Source: I blobbed a lot    No I know man you just presented your reasoning in a broken way.   Bitching about sales tax not being including boggles my mind. Do you honestly add everything up at a grocery store and have an exact figure in your head for what you will be spending, and then if you do, what the fuck is the difficulty with doing some basic multiplication with that basic addition? Y'all just bitch to bitch because it's not what you're used to. Fuck. Seriously infuriating. Y'all act like god came down from the heavens and declared tipping wrong and we're the only ones who ignored his sacred proclamation. You pay 4 fucking times as much for a pizza in Australia verse the US and you twats still have the nerve to whine about an expected *BUT NOT REQUIRED* 15% service charge. Good god you whiney fucking cunts.    I think you're under thinking it.    10m still isn't 50' ya dumb cobweb.    "This is reddit, where I go to postulate."   While truish, 50' seems like a "I was there you shoulda seen it" exaggeration. She looks about 30' tops. Still some serious air.   And yet you ingrates still fucking bitch about having to tip on the larger and less expensive meal.   Yah but zero is your first name day so 14th name day is 13 years old.    You say infant mortality is the reason then you say if you made it past 25.    If you made it past infancy you could expect 60-70 more years on average.    We beat the Titans once last season doe. It was the last time we won a game. It was almost a year ago. Lol.   Dream big or move to Tennessee.    Is it crazy that I believe we are going to win more games than we won two seasons ago?     More like a death tarp.   I mis-read it as a combination of peanut butter, Nutella and the powder.  Just pictured a bowl of those 3 ingredients with a banana on top. Ta-da! Healthy!   Check out seapoint farms roasted edamame products. Great snack because a serving actually fills you up. High in protein and fiber. Wasabi flavor is good and so is lightly salted. 4.5 grams of fat, 14 grams of protein, 7 grams of fiber in 1/4 cup.    On the spectrum of pork products it's one of the less healthy choices however.    Hummus has protein but it doesn't have a ton of it. Talking like 2 grams per ounce.   He said healthy lol. That's like 80% fat and sugar.    Or it's a reaction to a helicopter getting shot at.   Tilt!   Maybe statistically but they were exposed big time when Ibaka was out.    My arm-chair meteorologist theory is that Ike left a huge pressure bubble in Texas and as a result storms have been unable to form or move through the area. Seems like it's starting to return to normal.   A story on the internet is not admissible evidence in court.   Right - just saying that generally there isn't any math to do at the supermarket.   I've only ever seen price per ounce unless it's one of those dry food stuffs self bag by weight in which case it's by pound.    Should probably incorporate food in there somewhere though!   Not that I don't think it's outrageous but how is it *illegal*?   When you get your confirmation from uber/lyft you get the drivers name, picture and car make/model/color though? And how would you steal a fare with lyft/ubers system?  Could see this with a taxi service, a la the bone collector though.    Actually, a couple years ago the Rockets were the little underdog team that everyone on /r/nba loved. The dichotomy in my interactions on this subreddit between now and then is crazy.    How is it entrapment?   In the article it mentions conservative/GOP support for uber and lyft.    Failing to see the irony.    Feel like this will hit harder at home than against it's intended targets. Russians rely on cheap imports which these sanctions will impact. Yes it will hurt the West economically but the quickest way to lose a population's support is to come between them and feeding their families.    Yeah I was at the last win last season. Sprained my ankle leaving the stadium. Pretty sure I cursed the team.  Sorry, everyone.   *puts on gun*  Actually, *pew pew pew*.   True but technically it was also 2-10 at one point.   What an awful year for Mr. McNair. 2-10 and a battle with cancer. Glad to hear his health outlook is sunny, hopefully his team follows suit.  Outside of Kraft, there aren't many owners as generous nor humble as McNair.   *puts on milking frock*  Actually, tipping a cow causes it's utters to plug themselves due to gravity and general cow stuff, greatly decreasing it's milk output. Though fun, this is not an effective way to milk a cow.   You're on the right, right?    *tips hat*   *Puts on cowboy hat*  Actually, they have both. Most rodeos are attached to livestock shows, of which cows are a big part, with the best ones often out earning the top bull riders for their owners.   You're brave for saying that though.    Yeah I don't like yellow cab drivers. They're bad at their job. Glad a better service is getting a shot at dethroning a nearly monopolized service. So, kinda the opposite of bitter.   edit: seems like everyone else here is bitter.   You realize you're comparing a movie that hasn't come out to a movie that is out, which is what you were whining about in the first place, brah?   Putting words in his mouth. He said he thought Intersteller would be his favorite movie this year, it still is in the running but now it will be competing with GOTG.    You could just bookmark it.   Well then I guess you'll have a continuing user base once the better product wins over the majority.    I meant poor people.    Maybe they've updated it since my last use. Regardless, I didn't switch to exclusively uber/lyft because it's a worse service.   And yes you could enter the address but I was saying that the address service wouldn't be able to find a lot of the addresses I was using.   And from one anecdote to the other, I constantly had drivers try to swindle cash over card. Sorry bud, you're required by law to have a working credit card machine.   HailCab was nicer than calling for a cab but the app pales in comparison to its lyft uber counterparts. It's location service was unreliable and often wouldn't be able to find the address you entered. Compare this to uber/lyft which utilizes GPS (or you can manually enter an address) and you are automatically paired with a driver which you can see in real time in the app. Also I found that every time id ask to pay with a card on hailacab, the driver would claim I put cash even when of show them my confirmation ticket.  It's just a superior service in every way.  Source: I use(d) lyft/uber and yellow cab 4-5 times a week.    Or he's just one of those guys that doesn't trust "institutions".    A simple solution like a dedicated uber/lyft card similar to transit cards. Honestly though not many people utilize taxis anyways because they're expensive for the mile to dollar.   The new Spoon album is soooo good.    While I get where you're coming from and kids missing that long *rarely* return home alive; they *never* return home alive if they're found dead. If it's not a hoax she's dead, if it is a hoax she's *maybe* still destined for a happy ending. No matter how small the probability it's still astronomically higher than someone coming back to life. That's why I hope it's a hoax.    I mean, I agree, and you say that, but I wonder, how many, side bar pictures are a result of those photog,raphers   Nah like a figurative push in the right direction.    Curious why Houston is The Netherlands most popular NBA team. Can't think of any Dutch in the NBA and esp. not on the Rockets.    "steal" lol. same people who think that's stealing don't think piracy is stealing.   Menil Park and check out Rothko Chapel. Great quiet and chill spot.    Double Trouble is great. My rail stop is right there and I'll go grab a Drink and chill after work once a week or so. Get a Suffering Bastard.    Also Mercantile. Usually way less crowded, good coffee, beer, wine and other treats. Plus they have a swing inside so there's that.    I know :(  Ah what could have been.   Excuses? They're not excuses, they're reasons.    Still would have had to have gotten past (the spurs I think?) in the WCF.   Sadder than Derrick Rose tearing his ACL in the playoffs 2 seasons ago only to come back and do it again the following season?  Hope he bounces back this year, he's a humble and hungry super star. He deserves a healthy rest of his career.   God I fucking ***LOVED*** Von Wafer. Went so far as to name my indoor soccer team 'Von Wafer'. He came in after T-Mac went down and just fucking balled so hard.  That team had so much fucking swag it made swaggy p look like just regular p. Artest, Scola, Lowry, Wafer, Hayes, Yao, LANDRY, Fucking DEKE!, Battier.  Honestly think if T-Mac was healthy, Deke didn't end have a career ending playoff injury, and Yao was healthy (though he finished the series with the Lakers) they would have gone to the finals. Shoot I think even with just a healthy Deke in the Lakers series we could have pulled off the upset (took them to 7).  That team and the 22-win streak team the year before have a very special spot on my heart. What made me grow to truly love basketball as a fan.   Easier for the viewer to differentiate if each one has something decidedly unique about them (although they seemed to do that by making them all such different ethnicities).    Assuming he's talking about soy milk.    All smaller chains/independent stores are more expensive. I have a Starbucks and an independent store close to me. Independent store is 3.00$ for what costs 2.50$ at Starbucks (iced coffee). Granted the independent store is higher quality but outside of the gas station you're not gonna find a cheaper(cost) regular brewed coffee. Starts getting expensive when you order coffee milk shakes but those are expensive everywhere.    Mourning has been. Curiosity got the best of me. Just him, Hardaway and MJ.     Do the Heat have any retired numbers of their own? Alonzo Mourning? Hardaway?    I don't like you anymore.   	107
    She sounds hideous   Actually, according to Marx, socialism is the step before communism. Marx envisioned a continuum that begins with agrarianism, then to Capitalism, then socialism (by means of Progressivism) and finally Communism.  Your analogy is incorrect. Fascism is a form of socialism. The Nazis were the National Socialist Worker's Party. Hitler was a socialist leader and writer as was Mussolini.     Any positive accomplishments by Progressives such as child labor laws and worker safety are commendable but that does not change the fact that the ultimate goal of Progessivism is not "what ever works" but a rigid path towards ideological socialism.   Please read this link that explains Progressivism. The link is thinkprogress.com so you can't say it's biased against the Left.   http://thinkprogress.org/election/2013/03/22/1761431/what-it-means-to-be-a-progressive-a-manifesto/                               Can you please explain to me where I am wrong? The term "Progressive" certainly does not mean a desire for general improvement of society and the condition of the people. It is a very specific ideological path that ends in socialism.    But are we forgetting the part where he was a Progressive? Conservative means something. So does Progressive. They don't mean the same thing.  Progressive does not mean a general desire to make things better and improve people's lives. Progressivism is a rigid, ideological path to socialism. Dissent is strictly forbidden. Even in TR's time, Progessivism was a rejection of American individualism and personal freedom and the embrace of big government involvement in every aspect of people's lives.    Obama                            Come on man, you've gotta be kidding me if you dont see that tea party attracts those nuts.  Attract does not equal embrace and support.                If the data supported your view you wouldn't need to insult me.    Redstate.com is like Fox news.   But can you refute the data the link provided as being false? It linked to a demographic study of the shift of the Southern Democrat voters to the GOP. Can you refute that study?   Am I a liberal? No, i am a republican that is embarrassed that the Tea Party exists.   I looked at your commenting history. You support Elizabeth Warren. You are simply being deceitful here. Why can't you admit your political beliefs? Are you embarrassed to be a Liberal? Or are you only interested in dishonest demonization of the Tea Party as racists?  The Tea Party is a reaction to  big government, big taxing, big spending politicians of BOTH parties. The Tea Party did not exist when Regan or Bush were president.       Don't link redstate.com as a credible source. ever  Can you refute the data and proof that article on Red State links to?  Can a Rightist not assume everyone is a leftist because of a disagreement?   Are you in fact a Liberal?  "The Tea Party opposes big government period. Race has nothing to do with it" Then why did it not appear during Bush years, and appeared right after we elected a black president?  The Tea Party began as a reaction to big government spending. The Bush administration stoked the fire and the Obama administration caused the fire to explode. Obama's policies such as the ACA and deficit spending of 1 trillion dollars per year were the fuel. His race had nothing whatsoever to do with the rise of the Tea Party. If Hillary or Liz Warren become president you will see just as loud opposition to their policies.    Your quote does not explain or prove that the GOP has racist policies, leaders, or members. There is a difference in the parties' political philosophies. Liberals favor big government Conservatives do not. That does not equate to one side being racist and the other side not.   The South has had a history of racism. The South today is not monolithic politically and in its views on race. In Mobile Alabama, blacks and whites live in the same neighborhoods. In Boston Massachusetts,   blacks and whites live very segregated in white or black communities.    Wrong. It's called the Civil Rights Act, and it coincides perfectly with Republicans dominating the South.  The scholarly proof shows that the Dixiecrat migration to the GOP was gradual. http://www.redstate.com/2012/07/11/the-southern-strategy-myth-and-the-lost-majority/  Why did they not have a problem until a black man became president? and not when George Bush increased federal debt/ spending a shit ton? Or when Reagan did also? Or when ANY FUCKING republican president did it?   The Tea Party began as a grass roots reaction to free spending politicians of every party Bush, McCain, Obama etc included. The Tea Party opposes big government period. Race has nothing to do with it. If Hillary, or Liz Warren, or Bernie Sanders becomes president, the Tea Party will be just as opposed to their Leftist big government policies. If a big spending Republican like Jeb Bush became president, the Tea Party would oppose him too.   Edit: Have you EVER taken American History? Your knowledge is lacking severely.  Can a Leftist ever have an adult debate without insulting their opponent?    No none denies that racists are a small percentage of all political parties. The Democrats refuted racism and everyone applauds them for it. I just don't see the logic of the conclusion that just because the Democrats refuted a position that the opposition must then embrace that position. Isn't it possible that both parties now don't support racism? We can trade examples of racist behavior by random members of both parties but that does not prove that such an attitude is indicative of how each party feels about racism.   The claim of GOP racism by the Left is a tactic to stop debate on issues. If those people who don't care about politics and who get their political information from watching Jon Stewart on Comedy Central can be lied to and convinced that the GOP is racist then those voters will never vote Republican regardless of the issue.   You can't deny the long and sordid racist history of the Democrat Party. They were the party of slavery and fought to preserve it. They created the KKK, poll taxes, segregation, Jim Crow etc. It was only after the Civil Rights act passed (by members of both parties) that the Democrat Party finally shed the last vestiges of overt racism as an official policy.   The point of the article was the false claim that the GOP switched with the Democrats and embraced racism.       Rather than simply parroting something you heard and don't understand, can you offer anything factual to the debate? Can you refute anything I have written?    This has to be the most unscholarly article I have read in a long time. The author writes that the two parties flipped during the 60s through the 80s with the racists Democrats renouncing racism and the GOP embracing it.   It is true that the Democrats moved to the Left and renounced their long history of overt racism after the Civil Rights Act was passed. It is not true that the GOP in response decided to embrace racism are a policy. The entire article is based on an interview of Lee Atwater nearly 50 years ago. In that interview, Atwater laid out the so called Southern strategy that the author claims proves the racism of the GOP.  First of all, an interview by a political consultant 50 years ago does not speak for the millions of GOP voters  of today.  Secondly, the migration of the Dixiecrat voters from the Democrat Party to the GOP was a gradual transformation that occurred over the course of 40 years. There was no sudden switch in racism from Democrats to GOP.  Thirdly, what Atwater stated is often misunderstood. He was saying that appeals to racism were not necessary as economic issues were far more effective in attracting disaffected Southern Democrats who had soured on the Democrat Party's move to the Left politically.  Fourthly, no party would embrace a  policy such as racism that would attract an insignificant portion of the voting public while at the same time offending the vast majority of the voting public. It simply makes no logical sense.   Finally, the Tea Party stands for three ideas:  Lower taxation, less regulation, and smaller government. Race, gender, sexual identity, religion have nothing whatsoever to do with the Tea Party. Nothing whatsoever. The Left lies about the Tea Party to demonize it so that debate on the ideas never takes place. The Left lies in order to squelch any discussions.   Everyone should Czech it out               So we are left with conflicting data.  As the song says "Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong"  The bottom line here is that Ted Cruz and the Right base their climate change suspicions based on data. We may be wrong but we are sincere and being scientific.   Shouldn't this issue be determined using the scientific method of experimentation and reproducible results? Politics has polluted the issue and thus actual facts are often difficult to find.  How could you be against continued experimentation? Certainly scientists do not understand climate science to the point that we can simply stop exploring.    The graph clearly shows that the average temps have not increased statistically during the period shown. I don't know what else to tell you if you can't see that.     Yes you are a Liberal because you are incapable of debating without insulting your opponent.   Liberalism is an unwavering ideology. Those that adhere to it follow that ideology religiously. Being a Liberal is central to the debate on climate change. Why? Because the solutions proposed by Liberals involves raising taxes, increasing regulations, and empowering elites. These solutions are extremely expensive and promise very little in the lowering of temperatures if successful and do not guarantee any results at all.    I get my data from here http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/ (UAH MSU)  Here is the key data graph: http://blogs-images.forbes.com/warrenmeyer/files/2012/02/15yr-temps.gif  As you can see, the temps have remained statistically flat. This is in direct conflict with all of the models you cite.  Bottom line: if models conflict with actual data then the models are wrong. Period  I will not debate you if you continue to insult me. I will not debate teenagers    http://blogs-images.forbes.com/warrenmeyer/files/2012/02/15yr-temps.gif  Here are actual temp records from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/  The data shows that over the past 17 years the temps have remained statistically flat. These are actual temps. If they differ from any models then the models are wrong.   BTW I will ignore you if you continue to insult me in your responses. I refuse to debate with teenagers    The models have predicted temperature rises and that's what has happened.  Temps have not increased thus all the models predicting an increase have been wrong.    I am saying that all of them were incorrect by a great margin.  Can you offer anything to refute this? I tire of Liberals unable to debate anything factually and resort to attacking the person with the opposing viewpoints   Can you provide proof that indeed the temps increased .15 degrees per year over the past 17 years?   I asked anyone to produce any climate models that have accurately predicted temperatures over the past 15 years. I am saying that all of them were incorrect by a great margin.       http://i.imgur.com/pl0FJs9.png   i hope you aren't doing this to incite an emotional response.  No. Why is it that those on the Left can't fathom the fact that people can have differing views without being insincere or being trolls and racists?  i'm not sure what you mean by this question. focus less on what the temperature should be and more on what the side effects are if the temperature reaches certain points.  No the average temps historically are important because they show that temps have varied greatly up and down over the past 100,000 years. This is also true for CO2 levels. What that means is that it is normal for the earth's temps and CO2 levels to very with or without anthropogenic influences.  If we disregard those facts and focus only on possible side effects then we fail as scientists. Using your logic, we should encase the entire country in a steel shield to protect us from meteorites   Your climate models end at the year 2000... the start of the pause   The point is that throughout earth's history, CO2 levels and average temps have gone up and down. In light of that indisputable fact, a temperature increase of .7 degrees over a century is statistically and scientifically insignificant.   Volcanoes produce massive amounts of CO2. They should be increasing temps according to the climate alarmists not lower temps.  Can you name any climate model that predicted increase in temps that is correct? The fact is that no model has matched actually observed temps.  Conservatives doubt climate change harmful claims because:  1. Climate science has become polluted by Leftist politics  2. Climate models have been totally wrong.  3. There is no such concept as scientific consensus in the study of any scientific field and claiming a consensus runs contrary to the scientific method.  4. The proposed solutions to climate change are to raise taxes, increase needless regulation, and empower elites. The solutions will be very very expensive and the results are not guaranteed or likely to reduce temps by any appreciable amount.       Can you tell us what the correct temp for planet earth should be?  Can you explain the 17 year pause in global warming?  Can you explain why the climate models predicting temp increases have not matched reality?   Telling date "wow you f*ck better than my wife"   Frankly, I think she ultimately lost                           Dear RedditPope,   I apologize for my response to the other user. If you look at the comment thread between us, you can see that the other commenter was trolling me first. His trolling tactic (which is often used in Reddit political discussions) was to engage in an insincere political "debate". His goal was to ask for proof and citations for my positions. When I provided them he would ask for more, When I provided those, he would ask for still more. His goal was not to engage in a meaningful, honest political debate. His goal was to trick me into doing meaningless research and wasting my time so that he could mock me and my views.   He was in fact the troll in this encounter. My response was simply calling him out on his trolling tactics.   Thank you.        I knew you were a phoney and a chicken. I have played that game with Liberals so many times and you clones act the same way every time! I will let you in on a secret, I have a list of Obama links saved. I reel Liberals into my trap and then it gets sprung on them...every single time.

Thanks!   They may have been attracted to the potato the video was shot with.          As I said earlier, I have played this Liberal game before. You request proof. I provide it. You want more. I provide it. You want more. I provide it. The bottom line is that I could literally, LITERALLY provide you with a video of Obama stating that he is a socialist and that he intends to destroy America and you would make up some excuse for him and still think he was the greatest president ever.    Can we at least agree that Obama lied about Obamacare? His comments are on video. Can we at least agree on that?

The EPA was established in the 70's and they did fine work then. Today the EPA is polluted by Leftist political goals of destroying American business, raising taxes, increasing needless regulations and empowering elites.  You state the typical Liberal fallacy that if one is opposed to any part of anything they are against everything. I am against the EPA abusing their power and destroying whole industries for the sake of their twisted ideology, Everyone is for clean water and air.   Socialism stands for control. Control over the people by self declared elites who think the people are dumb and need to be led like children.    You live in Albany? My how you have endured so much   Phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range                  I've played this Liberal game before. There is literally no evidence or proof I could show you that would sway you in the slightest. Leftism is a faith based political system. Facts are irrelevant.  Ideology is all that matters.    Obamacare. EPA regulations of energy sector, coal ,fracking , pipelines etc. Ever read a news website?   Healthcare. Energy. Remember with socialism government  controls not necessarily  owns the means of production   At least i admit it. I am against all socialists. Period   Hahahahahahahahahahahhahahhaahhaahhhahhahahhahahaahahajaahahahaahhahhha   Drink some more Kool aid. There is literally  no proof, facts,   or anything  else that would get you to change your mind about  the Messiah Obama    Gave the queen of England  a recording of his speeches. Refers to himself endlessly regardless of the subject. Every and i mean every picture he sends out commemorating any holiday, event, or person always includes a picture of himself   Racist piece of shit   What about the IRS scandal, the VA scandal, Obama's unilateral pronouncements on illegal immigration, on the EPA, lying about Obamacare etc etc   If you did get banned from r/politics for that statement then I condemn the mods there for censorship. Everyone should be free to express their opinions without fear of being banned.    Your comment had nothing to do with the article or any of the comments preceding yours. Hence it made no sense. Maybe you posted in the wrong thread?    Personally, I vote based on the candidate's positions on the issues and their character  rather than on their looks or joke telling ability.     You Liberals are all the same. Such clones..... You get so angry when anyone challenges your faith based religion.    Here is a typical lunch menu for the Obama girls at school. Now compare that menu with the one served at the schools in your community.   http://www.scribd.com/doc/106895587/Sidwell-Friends-School-Lunch-Menu-September-2012  The 1% live privileged lives. Thanks Obama   Our current "president" does not act presidential. He is a terrible leader. He has terrible policies and is  narcissistic, ego maniacal,  and thin skinned.      I keep track of the number reddiors who make the exact same comment you just made. Congratulations for being the same as 197 other people. Now put on your helmet and get to school    Glad we share common ground on what is obvious to every educated thinker.    You must realize that Progresivism is not a general improvement of things, society, and the condition of the people. "Progressivism" and the policies of the Left are nothing but a rigid ideology based path towards socialism. Dissent is not allowed. Expressing contrary opinions is not allowed. Anyone who opposes the Left is evil in their eyes. The Left, AKA Progressives, Democrats, Liberals want to fundamentally change America from a Jeffersonian representative democracy into a socialist system where self appointed elites boss the common people around and compel them via intimidation and force to comply with their ideas of what a perfect society will look like.  The GOP (Grand Old Party) AKA Republicans is made up of various factions.   1. Establishment Republicans (sometimes called RINOs- Republicans In Name Only)  are old school Republicans who favor big government, immigration amnesty, and are DC insiders.  2. Tea Party Conservatives are interested in smaller government, less taxes , and less regulation, They look to the founding fathers and the Constitution for guidance in making policy. The Left often demonize the Tea Party as being racist but no evidence whatsoever has ever been produced by the left to back that false claim up. The Tea Party just wants less government interference in the people's lives. Race has absolutely nothing to do with that.  3. Libertarians believe that the government should not be involved in anything except  a very few services. They favor no drug laws, no taxes, and they want the freedom to live their lives without government interference.   I encourage you to watch Bill Whittle's Firewall series on Youtube for a great primer on politics in the US.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bill+whittle+firewall  Good luck!   Obama is the worst president we have ever had.    He would certainly be an improvement over our current "president"   Obama girls eat hot dogs.

Establishment Republicans support immigration reform aka the Dream Act etc. The Tea Party and other Conservatives support immigration reform only if the borders are secured first. Obama has refused to do this.  Tea Party Conservatives are against currently proposed immigration reforms because;  1. Obama refuses to close the borders.  2. Obama refuses to enforce current immigration laws.  3. Obama has unilaterally causes hundreds of thousands of new immigrants to illegally come here from Central America and Mexico.  4. Past promises of sealing the borders and enforcing current immigration laws have been ignored by the Democrats. Remember the immigration reform act passed by Reagan?  5. Obama and the Democrats want open borders and huge increases in illegal immigration so that any reform law would immediately allows millions of new voters to change the result of elections for decades.   The race of Obama has nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with the GOP opposition to so called immigration reform.  Can you provide any proof that the GOP is in any way more racist than the Democrats or any other large group of Americans?               I am curious, what is your level of education? Have you taken any history or poly sci classes?   Hahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahhahaahahahahahahaahahahhaahhaahahahhaahahhahahahahahahaahahhahaahahahahhaaahahahaahahhaahahahahahahahah    Conservatives oppose any Leftist, socialist, progressive, anti American policy by any politician.  Obama's policies tend to be Leftist, socialist, progressive, anti American thus we oppose his policies.  The fact that he is proposing them is irrelevant.        Asking for proof of such a switch is like asking for proof Rome existed, it's self-evident that it did.  Sorry but simply because you believe it does not make it true. Can you offer any policy statements, candidates' positions, voter outreach, advertising, or anything else to back up your claim that the GOP is racist or embraces racism as a policy.   Please realize that simply because we Conservatives are opposed to the policies of Mr Obama that does not equate with being racist. We Conservatives oppose any Leftist policy regardless of the race, sex, religion of who proposes it.   BTW the Nazis were socialists so your knowledge of politics seems to be a little suspect.     Again, Nixon offered an opinion 50 years ago that unhappy racist Democratic voters would shy away from the Democrat party and vote GOP. That's it. Nowhere does he say that the GOP should become racist, offer racist candidates, or racist policies.   The migration of the Dixiecrat voters from the Democrats to the GOP occurred over a 40 year period. During that period it is safe to say that the percentage of any voters for whom racism is a deciding factor in who to vote for has fallen sharply. In fact that percentage of voters is probably insignificant at this point.   No party would embrace racism because the rewards would be miniscule while the harm created would be vast.  The Left demonizes the Right with this false claim for one reason: to silence debate on the issues.       He was sharing an opinion almost 50 years ago. How does that quote equate to the GOP embracing racism as a policy? Nixon only said that as Southern racists get turned off by the Democrat party they will likely turn to the only other option which is the GOP.   If that is all the proof you can offer then the only thing you have proven is that the Left is prejudiced against anyone who is different from them.                   Can you provide any proof of such a switch? All that happened was the Democrats rejected the overt racism that they had embraced in the past. There is no proof that the GOP then decided to embrace racism.    If I am so dumb then how come I provided an argument and you could not do so?   You should vote Tea Party then.   This whole switching sides meme is a false claim by the Left. I agree that the Democrats renounced overt racism that they supported up til the civil rights movement but nowhere has it been proven that the GOP, the party of Lincoln and Ike who sent federal troops in to desegregate Southern Democrat states switched and embraced racism as a party goal or platform. Logic proves this: voters who are overt racists make up a tiny percentage of the public. Voters who would be offended by racism make up a huge majority of voters. Why would any party embrace a tiny group for support at the expense of a huge support group? It makes no logical sense.    The Dixiecrats did start voting for the GOP gradually over 4 decades but how does that fact make the GOP racist? If a pedophile votes for Obama does that make our president a pedophile? Of course not.    Typical liberal. You can never respond with facts. I guess you do that because the facts don't back you up.    Can you provide proof that the Tea Party is racist? Do you realize that Democrats favored slavery, segregation, Jim Crow laws, and formed the KKK?    Yes because the spam service has copies of email that Clinton claims was deleted. This is important because Clinton put US security at risk, used unsecured server (which is against the law), and then lied about the whole affair.  Are you saying that honesty, following the law, respecting national security are not important qualities for a president to have?                     Blasphemy will not be tolerated         Watch Austin Powers last. That movie is much funnier if you have seen the James Bond movies first.                                    He lives on the doorknob. You assume too much    How do you tell the difference?       Sample menu from that location:  1. 1/4 LB Filet-O-Fish  2. Big Mackerel   3. Fish Fries     The stereotype that GOP members, voters, leaders, candidates are more racist than any other subset of society is false. That false claim can't be proven with facts. It is a false claim perpetuated by the Left in order to squelch debate on issues. If you can demonize your opponent as racists then many will not even take the time to even consider their arguments. If the KKK had the best education plan ever, no one would even consider it because who gives a shit what racists have to say on any subject?   Possibly, but in a tiny percentage no greater than exists in any other political party   That the Tea Party, GOP, Conservatives are in any way racist  	199
 Fewer threats does not mean more secure   After working in college tech support for students, I found that Macs were not more secure, just malware writers didn't give a fuck about them because they couldn't make as much money because there weren't enough of them. That slowly changed during my time there and we had to figure out how to remove viruses on a Mac, which didn't have anti-malware like Malwarebytes   The short answer: no because the air is so dense that the ship would burn up. Also they don't go up as much as horizontal in the end from what I've heard  The long answer I'll leave to an aerospace engineer or someone of that expertise   FTL and the Binding of Isaac are 2 of my favorite, more modern ones   I saw that. He's been spot on with a lot of stuff lately.   Sounds more like a voting problem to me   Did RoosterTeeth's success with getting a film funded influence your decision to go this route and use IndieGoGo (at all and vs another crowdfunding source)?   I'd say industrial hygienists are safe (workplace safety) but that can possibly be included in HVAC as they do a lot with ventilation   Nadella is much better. Get users using it on any mobile device, then they need the paid for version on their computer. Which costs money, ATM.   Sorry, this is long, but here goes:  Recent grad here, just finished my PhD in Biosystems Engineering and found a job in industry (on the other side of the country, it's snowing. It's not supposed to snow in March.)  Anyway, I probably had a very different graduate school experience than you are having, but let me tell you about what I do. During my undergraduate time I started working with my advisor (academic) and told him I was more interested in working in industry than academia. I continued to work for him as an undergraduate for about 2 years before getting my BS. I was planning to go to graduate school. That was always part of the plan.  The work I ended up doing in his lab my senior year ended up carrying into my graduate degree and that helped me get through it a little quicker. My first year I had some crazy hours. Shitty pay, that never improved. One calendar year I received a full graduate student in engineering stipend. After that year, I settled into a rhythm a bit and got started on a new project. Which was good, as I was over the one that had carried on from undergrad.  After about 2 years on that project I was fucking done with it too. It was going nowhere. Another guy in my lab had been working on something similar for about a year before I started and his seemed to work better (from a fundamentals thing as I was working the alternative design). Finally we got enough data (we thought) to publish mine and that would represent my 3rd paper (I'm leaving one out because it was a side project that ended up working really well.) My committee decided I should graduate in the middle of June and I defended at the end of July. July sucked. A lot. All during this my advisor was very results oriented. He knew we got paid for 20 hours. He didn't care if it took us 10 hours a week of work to get something done if the results were real and what we were hoping for. Sitting around reading meaningless papers is a waste of time  I eventually found a job while working on some random stuff in my lab and helping them move from one building to the next. I was lucky, my advisor was willing and able to pay me.  The new job, me in a totally different climate, going from hot as balls to cold as fuck has been very different for me. There still are proposals, but your role in that can be as much or as little in the writing process as you want. Backing up a little, I work for a small company now that relies largely on SBIR grants and that sort of thing. The goal is to use one or more of these to get something that works to market and sell infinity and drop the mic. It scares me a little (scared me moving 1800 miles) but they're attached to a slightly larger company that's been more stable as they've been around for 30+ years. Now, at my new company, I'm expected to work 40 hours per week. Not 9-5 or whatever, just 2 weeks that average 40 hours. I have a ton of flexibility with my schedule. Meetings are expensive, especially when there are 7 PhDs present.  A few things to keep in mind: Your advisor sounds crazy. I have a friend in BME who has an advisor a bit like yours (mostly with the random fucking e-mails). Basically you have to get across to him that you plan to do what he asks, in a reasonable time frame. Him expecting you to have work done at 11 that he asked about at 9 on a Sunday is not a reasonable time frame. If it were a weekday, sure, maybe. 2-3 meetings a day is incredibly inefficient. Do everything you can to cut that back to like once per week for 2 hours if necessary. Why do you feel the need to keep the same hours as him? He gets paid a lot more than you do. You get paid for 20 hours/week (usually). Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that you need to get your work done to graduate, BUT without killing/burning yourself out. In my experiences working with PhDs from industry (we got more industry backed funding than anything else), you get a bit of both worlds. You have some who absolutely dont take their work home and some who obsess over it. Both are successful.  TL;DR: Post academia can be pretty much what you want it. I had a reasonable advisor and managed to find a job that gives me flexible scheduling. Your advisors an asshat who doesnt know how to manage people.   Start looking for a job now. Dont necessarily tell him cause he might freak out    True story. Mine got boosted from 50 to 100 mbps and only cost like $60 with cox   too bad we can't/haven't sent a telescope/explorer with the imaging quality of Hubble out that far (or have we and they just operate differently where the one we sent takes one picture while Hubble uses lots to make this image?)  Could get better pictures that way, not that these are bad   I recently moved from Arizona to Ohio. It's good. This shift is meaningless, though at the moment I'd prefer "savings time" rather than standard time just because it's not quite sundown when I go home around 5.  	13

 Systems that organically integrate with the world helps this.   3 traits help combat? not necessary, have 1. Its one clear system.  But maybe theres a platforming system so tie a trait to that.  Maybe there's a dialogue system - another trait.  Make them distinct and related to a single system, then design a game that really interweaves those systems.  Instead of interweaving traits in skills that stack up over one system:  E,g. Combat = int, agi, str, const etc. Dialogue = cha, int, str,   Is it coming to pc?   Tetris music was amazing back in the day.

Specifically related to physical contact with NPC's (non-violent contact).  www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ossk41vamBk  I love little details in games! Makes them so much more immersive and varied in the experience.      Can't wait for this on PC, I think it's really cool how much they are changing up for fans as well as new console players.   Just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words, I'd thank you all individually but I don't want to spam the thread. Really glad I could communicate a different way of tackling it.   Haha, wow, thanks I think!  :)                  Hes a tragic villain, but becoming the monster we see hinted at in the games is still becoming a villain. Even Solid Snake didnt see himself as a hero. His father with his PMC and his vendetta against the world that fucked him doesn't make him anything remotely good.  Can't wait to see it unfold though, each game he's gotten worse and worse this is gunna be really fucking sad and horrific. Even sadder when you see what his mentor chose in peacewalker.         Big Boss is turning into the villain though, so it's likely his character arc will make more sense to play more lethally. There may even be forced killing missions??  I'm okay with that given we are playing a character we KNOW is a villain and the series has always said something interesting and critical about war. It's not got the jingoistic tone of say, Splinter Cell Blacklist.      The guy is a master of languages, I'm sure he could pick up Polish for a Witcher film.   He really is a great choice, I totally agree with you. Stunning actor and he's not typical American/British/Australian choices you might see for this kind of film.  	22
 Cupcake   Damn, she's old.   How can someone not love Baymax! :D   Saw Big Hero 6 :D I absolutely loved it!   That Nexus is certainly fake. Nothing happens to a real Nexus.   Not Hangouts   **MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS**   For me, the most refreshing drink is water :P   Not knowing how our Lord's name is pronounced.   Yes!    I just used that casually, not like a sad thing :)   None of my friends use it...   DuARTe is all forgiving.   No. I don't.   Yes, I do think of it as an art...   He told me on /r/India once...   I just don't listen to it.   By tunes like that, I mean that it's the only one I rarely listen to...   I am just not interested in it...   There used to be a time when I did like it, but later I just lost interest... But very rarely, I do listen to soothing tunes like 'Come September'...   But Material is the latest, and should be loved more.   Ummm... I don't really think so... I attribute it more to the fact that I anever really had any interest in music, I always preferred to do something else rather than listening to music...    Thank God, I am not alone!   butters up   Don't insult Project Butter!   Then make it Materialification Nation!   I love Disney movies!   Something that I just don't do... I don't know why, but I never listned to it.   I am going to watch Tangled now on my laptop :)   Is music really that necessary?   That's even hard to imagine for me, never ecxperienced it... So, what are you planning to do now?    There have been droughts in areas around my city as well. And the droughts here are bad. Like, water only once a day for the villages. But the cities get a consistent water supply.   No, the rains are okay here... What about your place?   No. I don't listen to radio, and there's no elevator music here...   I hope rain comes here, too :D   At 106 even the AC feels ineffective :(   85 is really good :)   Yeah, it's kinda good here... What's the temperature at your place?   And that's what you've RES tagged me as well... :P   India...   That's the normal summer temperature here...   Yes, no music at all...   41C/106F :'(   Well... I don't listen to music, so people find me weird...   It's horribly hot here :(   I am too damn bored today...   But getting rarer :(   Yeah, Mountain Dew is refreshing, but I try to stay away from such drinks...   Drinking cold water. It's the best way to relax :P   India. Horribly hot here. 41C/106F.   Thanks for the info!   You can flash ROMs? Does the iOS bootloader allow that?   But you cannot flash ROMs/Kernels on a jailbroken iPhone...

 The name sounds familiar, but I can't seem to find it with a yellow layout in the early 2000s. Perhaps I used this too.   I read your post history and man, you sound lonely and depressed. This might sound weird, but where do you live? I'll be your friend if by sheer chance we live nearby - or at least give you an honest shot and put up with your awkwardness (for all I know you're an asshole :p).   Have you sexed her boobies yet?   Why is this getting downvoted? Not only does gender effect social perception on virginity at that age, but also the statistics show that there is a difference between proportions of virgins in each gender.      This might also be further exacerbated by deliberately picking smarter/more studious children and adults who are less interested in general knowledge.   This. Oftentimes I get a little annoyed I can't remember something I know I knew a long time ago.   Videogame website: It was a website for videogame cheats, popular in the early 2000s. One of my main alternatives to GameFAQs. It had a yellow layout at the time and I strongly believe had "cheats" in its title.  Where's Wally: I've seen mirrors of this screamer since then, however I'm specifically looking for a webpage/site that hosted this and ALSO had a hatemail section where people sent in their grievances after having been tricked by the screamer.  Thanks.   Yes      Grow out of it? I think I like ogling women more in my kid 20s than I did in my early 20s      Can your standards get much lower than 'every girl'? There's literally no standard there.   I want an explanation that assumes the turn based battles are CANON.  Why do they take it in turns attacking eachother? Especially mindless monsters like Piranha?   Possible, but unlikely. Why would they bother combining the screenshots (and so precisely) when they could just crop a whole new one.      It doesn't matter how God thinks or what God is. His actions caused people to not believe. But they're still his actions. It is still his fault.   Jesus Christ.

Hell, they could probably beat up three villains in three different towns before Batman can put on his mask.      What became of all the 2012 apocalypse believers?

Do people that move up tend to have much experience in IT before getting the role? I have no formal experience and can't say my skills would impress anyone already working in IT.   Currently regretting going into my current field. Saw some jobs for call center roles. They often mention career progression. Is this a realistic possibility? Am I likely to actually develop skills to progress, whether internally or by applying elsewhere with the experience/skills I develop?   http://www.xnxx.com/video178197/mother_fucks_daughter   This is true for all 'witty' zingers and one liners.

Is Dr. Phil really exploiting anyone? I think people know they aren't going to go on the show and get proper psychiatric treatment. But Phil usually sets them up with a professional at the end of the episode. They go on and air their dirty laundry and in exchange get free psychiatric help.  It's not exploitation, it's an exchange.   But only 8 of those 26 are good.   Gotta admit, those jokes were awful. Thank God he isn't a comedian.   Yeah, delusion.

Get your mod  I really don't care where my mods come from.   Lose some weight you fat fuck.   I don't know why, I've been trying to remember this game for months, but it literally just hit me then while pouring a glass of water and thinking about something completely unrelated: it's called [Phantasia](http://www.phantasia4.net/)  Having said that, I can't actually get the game to load, I wonder if it's dead =/   I hate the slippery slope argument to be honest.  Would you be saying the same for abortions? Would you be saying the same for euthanasia? Everything is 'on a slope' already, you've got to draw it somewhere. And it most cases, it's already drawn too close to the conservative side. Let's do a little line shifting.   Dude, that's literally everyone. No one is going to think you have low self-esteem.  Look at any young couple: the majority of them are within the same 'attractiveness' range. It gets a bit distorted as people get older (limited options, being together for a long time and one partner letting themselves go, etc) but generally it holds true.   What the fuck? Why is this even upvoted? Nice figure, great tits, great ass, cute face. What is wrong with you?   I think part of the joke was that 'nice guys' tend to vilify attractive people. If he's good looking or works out he must be a jerk in their minds. I think it's suiting.  It adds to the comic because the whole nice guy mentality is that girls overlook nice guys for good looking jerks. But... Maybe the good looking guy is the real nice guy.   What do you mean?   Dude, they're subsidiaries of a larger company, they'd have completely different management, ethics, corporate culture, etc.   Other than Jonah   Pretty off-topic, but I recently stumbled upon this thread you made some years ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/125m05/welllooks_like_im_not_going_to_find_a_public/  I'm in a similar situation now and I was wondering how things turned out for you and if you have any advice.

None of your business, sorry  The same thing can be accomplished without being a dick.   It doesn't take much imagination to see how overlooking this sort of thing will lead to sex trafficking.  This is a non-issue in Australia where prostitution is perfectly legal. All it's lead to is much, much safer sex, since prostitutes need to be medically examined consistently and operate out of licensed venues.   Shark Tank shootings also go a lot longer than the show implies. Some pitches can go up to an hour.   Now try and surprise them by losing some weight.   $$$   There is a reasonable expectation that if you enter a relationship with someone that they're NOT going to go and help a bunch of other guys get off...   I'm pretty sure he was making a joke.   He said what WOULD happen, not what should happen. Let's be realistic: there is nothing wrong with the ad with the current genders or if they were switched, but the uproar would be much greater if the roles were reversed.   That is a global average, so it's probably bought down by underdeveloped countries. Average in the United States is 5.6 inches.  Even then, that surprises me. Not trying to brag, I'm only 6 inches, but I guess I always expected mine to be below average since I'm really short.   Can you provide an actual citation?  You make it sound like the male and female brains are completely distinct though. Isn't it more of a continuum. If so, where do you draw the line for 'feminine male who wishes he was a female' and 'male who actually has a female brain'?

Edit: I guess I'm getting downvoted because I wasn't clear enough. Consideration is required by both parties for a contract to be considered legally valid. Because he donated the sperm for free, it is not considered a valid contract. What he signed is not legally binding.   are mosquitoes pointless enough that it's okay to eradicate them anyway, if we don't have a way to eradicate just the malaria?  And the answers seem to be yes, and we don't. They spread a lot more diseases than just malaria too   The point he is making is we can eliminate malaria, and still address the overpopulation problem by helping to develop the rest of the world.   We eradicate diseases. You have no problem with curing AIDS, I'm guessing? So why not eliminate malaria too? Because that's what they're trying to do. There has not been any evidence put forward that this would have a negative consequence beyond the non-existence of a pretty weird insect.   Do you have any sources or anything at all to back up your claims? Any expert I've heard speak on the subject has pretty much said they have no positive impact on any ecosystem.    Back then, an obese lady/man was considered attractive, not because of reproduction instinct, but because it represented wealth and status.  This is outright contentious, there is no academic consensus. Yes, fat people might have been more SOUGHT after. This does not make them more ATTRACTIVE. A supermodel hanging off the arms of an 80 year old billionaire, with 50 other girls after him, isn't necessarily more sexually appealing than a normal, young guy with just five girls after him. They could be willfully overlooking how repulsive he is for the money.  I guess this comes down to the definition of attractive, but I believe we're talking physical here.  Also, as specific traits become less correlated with wealth/power (fat people and skinny people are in all classes), these things matter less. I wonder if we care more about our 'primal' attractions now than for most of recorded history.   and the fat chicks were the supermodels.  This is highly overstated and only arguably true for some societies in very small periods of time. More importantly though, it's the result of the implications of their fat. Fat = wealth.  It's hard to even argue that it's attraction (more like fat people being more desirable for their wealth, while their suitors pretended to find them attractive to get in good with them). There's a lot of debate around this among historians.  More on point though, as society grows and everyone has access to the same food and exercise choices, the same medicine and the quality of life increases across the board, it might become more normal to play of our basic instincts of attraction rather than societal standards. If most mind find large eyes on women attractive because of a natural response, then it's unlikely to see that disappear without some highly unpredictable shaking up of social order.   1,000 years is a long time, but if the quality of life keeps improving and physical attributes continue to correlate less strongly with wealth/power, it's hard to see that happening.   So you think microscopes make things smaller?   So you want frat boy tier villains?   Does every 'fun' movie get a pass? Are romantic comedies good because they're supposed to be fun? Why doesn't Jack and Jill get to play the fun defence?  It's such a cop out to say someone can't hate a movie because it's fun.   Lina is genuinely bad and has been for ages.

It is a very character driven franchise. Voyager's character's felt so homogenised and boring.   A few episodes in, yes.   He didn't whine, he asked why he was being downvoted because he thought it was a reasonable post. Maybe he wanted to know if he overlooked a subreddit rule or something.   He was in the negatives, then he made the edit, a few people responded and the upvotes poured in.  I mean, even without seeing it happen, couldn't you have worked this out yourself?   Dude, that's a completely different case.   Wrong story.   I guess you could say... he isn't alive anymore.   Yes he was...   [And this year Paul?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_cXBINgd1A)   Have you seen the full video? It's equally as cringey.

An ice cream store in my hometown had a very identifiable name and made amazing ice cream you couldn't get elsewhere. Their name was used by a competitor in one of our major cities, without permission of the owner's. When the owners went to expand into the city, they were thought to be the knockoff. They managed to force the other store to change their name eventually though.   Cold call electricians. If they say they can't do it, ask if there is someone they know who can or if a different profession might fill this request.  You could also call the manufacturer of the grills and ask who supplies the heat coils (they make not make their own) and then contact them and ask for a custom made one. They probably won't take small orders but it's worth a shot.   It's not hard to understand. What point are you trying to make? What physicists have you been speaking to that can't understand that?   Stupid question, but what networking opportunities does LinkedIn actually offer? I thought it was basically just a bunch of profile pages to link employers too. I always overlooked it tbh. (on mobile atm so can't make an account).   Congrats! I expect a field report tomorrow, good luck.   I will watch it and see for myself with context, but I agree. It doesn't sound funny at all based on the quotes in this thread   Why can't they just test the strength of the balls in the first place? Why can't the balls be supplied by the league officials instead of teams?   Regarding the 40% cut, do they often inflate the amount you are suing for to account for the lawyers fee, or are you just automatically 40% out of whatever you should have got if someone commits a crime against you?  For example, if I'm suing someone for damaging my car for $10,000, will I sue for $14,000 to cover lawyers fees, or do I pretty much have to accept that the moment damage is done to my car that I'm at best getting 60% of it back?  I'm not sure if you'd even need a lawyer for the car example, so if not replace it with something you would need a lawyer for.   The law prevents you from making any statements that would incite public panic.  The entire crux of that joke is based on the fact that he knew the listening audience would interpret it as being a dangerous gas.  Yes, it's stupid that people don't do a quick Google search to see that he's joking. But he made the joke PRECISELY knowing that they wouldn't.  It doesn't matter if it's true or not from a legal perspective: make a statement intended to incite panic  face the punishment.   Tax seems like the easiest to get a job in due to a ton of small Tax firms in my area, but I have been considering auditing too. Basically, I'm going to see where Grad programs take me, they tend to give you a rotation across various fields. If I don't get one, I'll probably get into Tax.  Good point about the auditing though, makes me feel a little better.   He is more of a science/engineering genius though.  Who am I kidding he'd be good at this too.   Struggled with anxiety all through my teens and early 20s. I'm 24 and graduating midsemester. I've improved dramatically (only get specific anxiety trigger now, rather than the constant feeling of dread and unwillingness to leave my house).   However, one thing I haven't had much area improving on is formal/professional interaction. I feel I may be a bit too laid back, and what few attempts I've had to interact professionally have always been a bit awkward (not knowing when to shake someone's hand, or wrap up a conversation, my voice gets really weak and quiet randomly in conversation's I'm not comfortable with, not good at saying stuff like "nice to meet you" because I just throw it out in random places for some reason).  I know it's weird, but I just go from 'fake it til you make it' mode that I put on in casual meeting to 'complete awkward mode' once a level of formality is introduced. Probably a fear of being judged?  Anyway, the important question: how do I get over this bump? I feel like it's my last step towards feeling good about my future.   Damn, never heard any of that. What a player.   Those are ports of recent remakes though. I'd imagine porting a Playstation game to PC all these years later would be much more difficult than porting a 3DS game that was released within the last 5 years.   And does the same apply to other subscription based services (ie. Netflix)?   labrador joke   but on the side he got the best poon Hollywood had the offer.  Huh, I remember recalling in some behind the scenes Seinfeld stuff that he wasn't really involved with women during most of Seinfeld's run, then he got married towards the end. I think that's exactly what sparked the gay rumors in fact.   I think he's stand-up has grown less appealing over time, but he still seems really funny just making off the cuff comments.   I still feel sorry for her to be honest. I imagine she feels how I feel when I try to act professional in the workplace, while secretly wanting to throw up on every client I meet from nerves.  Cringe nonetheless   In his explanation of the events, he says that that seat was reserved so it was obvious she was trying to get attention.  I think he just acknowledged her because he new if he didn't, she'd interrupt more anyway.   She clearly tried to get a nice face shot, but missed the camera entirely.   Creature building also was entirely meaningless. Many were expecting it to affect things like chances of survival and actually requiring you to build a ,functional creature    Right. But what does quitting resolve? You just lose yourself a job. The simple fact is, to an extent, they can lie and you can either take it or quit.   What kind of job would help you get experience in programming though? That really feels more like something you'd learn at Uni though or by yourself, right? I'm not in IT so I'm not contradicting you, just curious.  Also is programming more specialized? Or are you just talking about very fundamental programming?   So if I miss the tree I go to prison?   My best guess: we won't find out. People speculated for months about how Sherlock killed himself and we didn't get an answer. I'm guessing we'll get the same with Moriarty.   I find this hard to believe, but will happily be proven wrong. My main issue with this is the fact that if it were so cheap, why doesn't a competitor just slash 5k off his car and get all the market share. Eventually other businesses would react and cars would be cheap. Product differentiation only answers part of the story, there would surely be huge markets for cheap high quality cars.  Is it possible whoever told you this failed to factor in marketing, administration, sales %, salaries, R D, etc?  An alternative to OP: it's a promotion expense or they're making money on average by getting people through the door and buying other things with their free item   Wait, what happened?   Maybe your girlfriend has a loose ass   That's /r/fantheories for you   There's also the fact that his friends were about to be shot, perhaps Sherlock just quickly wanted to make the call to Watson and save everyone ASAP.   So let me get this straight: you're suggesting that Moriarty, at the climax of his plan, among all the emotion and tension in the air, just suddenly goes "wait a minute, I want out lol".  And on top of that, Sherlock just willfully let's the criminal who is about to kill his friends go, despite already having a plan to fake his death that would save his friends anyway (ie. he doesn't need to co-operate with Moriarty in the first place. There is no reason for it).  I really believe Moriarty just straight up faked his death and pulled the wool over everyone's eyes the same way Sherlock did. I would not be surprised if Moffat pulls the same stunt of not explaining how he did it either.   u hsbr have to consider lisa simpson is the is always where simpsons but not snopsins but she does anyway   Correlation =/= causation, you're right. However you're being retarded if you think you can use that claim to dismiss basic reasoning. There is no definite word on why he left Twitter because Joss hasn't spoken up. And even if he did, he could very well lie in order to keep things 'cool'.  What we can do it speculate, weigh the evidence and form conclusions. It seems like he left Twitter precisely because of the backlash.  You could post that stupid picture in response to any number of commonly held beliefs about historical events or figures too, by the way. They're often based on finding evidence based on the timing of events (eg. seeing the rise of iron coinciding with the fall of the Minoan civilization has linked the two, even with no direct evidence). A smart person does not fall for the correlation = causation fallacy. A smart person also doesn't use correlation =/= causation to dismiss evidence and reasoning.  But this is all greatly overanalysing. We're talking about a man quitting Twitter. Around the time he was getting attacked, over a subject he has expressed great personal belief over. It's not a leap to conclude that those two events are linked.    but I wonder how much of this is anger because he stated he is excited for DC's films and would love to direct Batman.  Almost none of it   We saw it happen with Wil Wheaton  We did?   Fat bodies   I think it's OK to make a fair assumption considering the timing.   This is what gets me. She's fine for three movies, then she does a few things in one movie, and people act as though this is the entire character. It's classic tumblr cherrypicking.   No problem!   It wasn't split, it was unanimous. He scores weren't even close. I wanted Pac to win, but he was trounced, he took a couple of rounds tops      This is why we have boxing gloves.  If you're suggesting that boxes gloves aren't designed with damage the face in mind, I think you'll find you're wrong. What that common TIL often leaves out is that the gloves distribute the blow of the punch more evenly, leading to less facial damage than if the gloves were smaller. It's part of the design to not damage the face too much while also enabling you to hit the face in the first place.   Q from Star Trek could just make Manhattan disappear.

Gazelle sighthounds are found all across the middle east and northern Africa.

They are from Madagascar, perfect companion dogs for the hot weather with light feather like coats and reflective color.

Every now and again, I'll reheat veggies or steam veggies in the mic, but other than that (and a very occasional bag of popcorn) I don't use it at all.  Funny story, though. I had a small economy mic in my kitchen that probably bounced through two or three different places that we lived. We had some friends over for the weekend, and a friend of a friend broke the little latchy thingy that closes the door, rendering the microwave inoperable. By the time I got downstairs, she was already gone to the nearest big box store to replace it.

My wife and I have an active and exciting sex life. She is my porn star. When I get bored and surf the web for porn, I don't look for the "normal" porn, I like to check out the extreme stuff.

Muschamp is playing against the tape. He's wily.       No, not really. Most of these types of laws are called "Blue Laws"; they're just holdovers from a more prudish time. Our American system of law doesn't make it as easy to repeal laws as it is to pass them, so these laws are still on the books, but not really ever enforced.  Saying that, there have been times recently where these laws were used to arrest people, most recently in Texas, where a male couple were arrested for violating state sodomy laws, but the judge threw the case out of court.   The first couple years are adjustment years, and that's tough because the first couple years are also the busiest and hardest couple of years. Talk with your SO, make plans to set aside a small amount of time (baby comes first, dad) for yourself. When the kid gets a little older it becomes a little easier.  I also am a musician, and had to give up the stage for fatherhood. While I miss it terribly, I now have a home recording studio, two great and curious kids that see me in the studio, making music daily, and am making plans to attempt a comeback to the stage.   Good luck, dad. Make time for baby. Make time for SO, make time for you. That order for the next couple of years.   I think a phone call or two is reasonable.

Saying that, I almost always just google what I'm looking for, because not every site is going to have what I want, and I've just got enough experience to know which sites I prefer, and will look for them in results first. But I use what I have to to learn what song I'm looking for, even OLGA...lol, even youtube for that matter, a good source of video lessons.  Happy hunting.   [Here you go](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=acoustic+music+tabs)   Good on her for reading well.  That said, one of the biggest problems that I have with our education system is that we treat each kid as exactly the same. Each kid at this certain point should be able to do A, B, and C, and if they don't, they're falling behind.  I don't feel that our kids are interchangeable pieces in a puzzle, and both my kids read above their level, but my older child's comprehension is terrible. So does that mean that I should be happy that he knows big words, or concerned that he doesn't remember what they mean? We can't keep shoehorning our kids into pigeonholes that we want them to fit in...  Saying all that, if she's reading that well, you're probably doing a good job at home helping...keep it up. Raising an intelligent child takes more than our manufacturing model of a school system that teaches little else than blind respect for authority and the ability to memorize useless trivia and recall it on demand.  "Education should not be the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - William Butler Yeats   Game could be a landslide...   You want some Siracha? (0 - 7)  Edit: You know, just in case. (7 - 7)   I was just talking about this here...also, Muschamp may be trying to load the tape, get Miami looking at a bunch of stuff they don't need to know. He sneaky. I like.    We're getting to a point where a lot of teams are a whole lot better than one would expect. I think that because of the increased TV coverage every year, it makes more sense to be a starter on a "bad" team than it would to be a second- or third-string on a "good" time. I enjoyed the Toledo/UF game.  Go Knights, BTW.   I was surprised...happy...elated....drunk...that was a good Saturday.   Oh come on now....I like the Bulls, I like the Golden Knights, hell I'll even watch a Miami game every now and again....and my local II school, Stetson Hatters, won a big opener....first game in almost a hundred years!   Heh. Yep.    It was difficult my friend, it was difficult.      I was the GM of a large restaurant right off campus. Owners were huge boosters, both alums. Did catering for the QB Club, game day sales were huge. Lots and lots of fun.    It is Labor day....    That's why I'm here. After our weak (IMO) performance against Toledo Saturday night....well hoping to see some holes. I think our D can slow Winston down, but can our O score against the Noles D? Hope to find that answer tonight.   Hey hey hey. Stopping by to check out the competition.  As a Gator fan, I suppose it's expected that I give out a mighty 'GO PANTHERS!!' but I just don't have it in me.  I lived and worked in Tallahassee for a decade, and my job required my attendance at several games. I enjoyed, and still enjoy, Seminole football...just not in the last week of November, and any time that the Seminoles losing means we win something.  So for the first time this season, and perhaps only time, (depends...I think I'll be rooting for the Nation to take Clemson down!) let me give a hearty..  GO NOLES!!  - Tomahawks wildly in his living room, knocking over beers!!  WOO!!                     Short answer is that when the punting team is the first to touch the punted ball, the ball is dead. If the receiving team is the first to touch the ball, the ball becomes live, and can be moved upfield, recovered by the other team, or, when it rolls into the endzone, touched back.                        Correct. They wouldn't need one of those dedicated sound cards with the connections (and bells and whistles), but if they are buying an off the shelf PC, they might want to consider a soundcard upgrade for sound quality. (Especially important for sound reproduction which makes the mixing side of home recording a whole lot easier.)   This happens too often.   Collect to go menus. Rip the restaurant names off, fold up and put in a jar. No restaurant picked in two rounds, pick out of the jar.   Welll.....I can say that now, because frankly, I've put my dong in crazy enough times to know it's never worth it, and got lucky enough to come out the other end with a good woman.   First, all of your questions can be answered at [Tweakheadz Labs](http://tweakheadz.com/). Learn. Learn more. Read. Read more. Reference. Great site.  1. Two schools of thought. Dedicated computer for recording is gonna cost half a buttload, with high end sound card with dedicated recording connectors. Or, any decent off the shelf with a soundcard upgrade. (I use a PC straight out of the box, with a soundcard that cost about $200)  2. You need a DAW (recording software) and yes it must be compatible. There are many out there. Some free. Some thousands.  3. Connections depend on the interface. For an amp recording, in general would be amp - condenser mic - A/D interface. There are many other options though, check Tweak.  4. Cable control! It will get worse before it gets better, learn to tame the cables. Use cable ties, and label them.  5. Read the guide man. It probably came with paperwork. If not, google the product name and number, you can  usually find it online.  6. I've been a musician for 25+, and a home recorder for a decade. I spend more time researching than playing/recording. (To be fair, most of my troubles are in the mixdown area, learning how to engineer a decent sound out of what I just recorded.)  7. You should also check out r/wearethemusicmakers here on reddit. Pros that don't (usually) mind answering noob questions.   Zero. ZEEEEE-ROY Jenkins!! Zip. Nada. Nil. None.   I'm not happy with the name, will take suggestions.   Might add that to the list.   Combine this with the recent reports of what's happening in the Pacific after the Fukushima event in Japan, and it paints a pretty terrible picture.   Yeah, mine too, but now I get points for it!   Funnies: Before match play, the group comes up with a selection of scenarios. Things that can happen on the course, but are rare enough to be unique.   Examples:  * Hit a tree on the drive, still par * Out of bounds, in bound shot for par * Chain out birdie, still par  It is only limited by what you want to imagine, and the group assigns points to the individual "funnies" . (You can even have bonus multipliers like hit a tree on the drive, still par for three points, tree drive and birdie, double it for six.)  Get creative. We score it by total points + strokes under par (or minus over) for total win. Put some money on it and make an interesting disc golf outing.            In between Orlando and Tampa is a whole lot of woods, and a whole lot of rednecks. While stopping in any of these small towns can provide a *certain* type of entertainment, I wouldn't bring my sister with me.  Saying that, Tampa (and the metro area) is one of the larger cities in the Southeast, and offer lots of things worth doing.   I used to live in the area, about a half hour south of Clearwater, but I live on the East Florida coast now, so some info may be dated, but I get over there often enough.  First and foremost, in St Petersburg, south of your destination after leaving the Tampa area, is the [Dali Museum](http://thedali.org/home.php). Worth the trip. (If you're going out of your way, check out [Fort Desoto](http://fortdesoto.com/) an early Spanish emplacement.  In Tampa, there are museums and galleries and historic places galore, but what stands out in my mind is [Ybor City](http://www.yborcityonline.com/), the old Cuban area of downtown. I know you already did your shopping touristy thing, but the afternoons and early evenings are for checking out the artsy little shops while you figure out which awesome restaurant you want to eat at. Stay into the evening for great music everywhere.   Clearwater itself is kinda boring. It's got great beaches, so definitely get your feet wet, and you should also know that Clearwater is home to a large [group of Scientologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida#Scientology) who were trying to take over the world.  If you play discgolf by any chance, Clearwater is a hotbed of disc golfing activity.  Enjoy your trip. And one final note. As you come into Tampa on I-4, to merge into I-275, your most likely route, do be careful. It gets just a little insane through that area, and play your driving to NOT be in that area during rush hours.                   It's not exactly what you're talking about, but you should check out the doc section of [instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com/genres/130). I love this site for my Netflixing. So much better of a UI.   Think on this.  If you know the notes of the guitar, the scales up and down the strings, and you know the forms for F and Bm, then you know barres.  The notes on the E string, E(open) F (1) G(3) A (5) and so on right?  The full barre form of the F chord, from the bass E, is 133211, right?  So, looking at the root of the F barre, the first fret on the bass E is F, right?  So if the next step up at the third fret on the bass E is the G note, then it stands to reason that the same form that is an F when the root is on the first fret would be a G when the root is on the third fret. (3355433)  So as long as you know the notes up the E string, you know the barre forms for all of those chords. This also works for most barre variants. The Fm shape (133111) played where the root note is on the 5th fret on the bass E would be an Am. (355333)  Same theory applies to the Bm barre form that's played on the second fret on the A string.(x24432) One half step up from that root B is the C note, so that same form slid up one half step becomes a Cm. (x35543)  Does that help?   Get rechargeables. You will save a ridiculous amount of money this way. Also be choosy about toys. There are so many toys out there that make noise just because they can. They don't necessarily add any education/play for baby or older, they just are loud. We personally choose to stay away from most battery operated toys, preferring to let our children's imagination decide what that fire truck should sound like.                        Obviously high guitar player.   Used this handle in one form or another for a really long time....first AOL account..., shit, has it really been almost 20 years? Fuck me.   Testing for everyone, and scrubbing the locker rooms and practice areas by a professional cleaning service.  It's always something with my beloved pewter pirates, it's always something.                  Umm.  Reddit is an amazing source of news, current events, and social concerns. There are great minds having great discussions on subs all over this site. It truly is the front page of the internet, and an amazing tool.  Reddit is an amazing source of boobs, current beaver shots, and gay porn. There are hot chicks posting pics of their hot bods on subs all over this site. It truly is the first place I go to wank it, my amazing tool.  You did both, I think. If you proctor his time on reddit and introduce him to the right things, and don't let him on without supervision, and guide his front page customization, you might be alright. But the porn will happen anyway, and Reddit isn't the worst place to experience it.   Yep. You can get a lot of respectable distance out of a forehand, but kinetic chaining is how you get the real long distance; that comes from the run-up and the cross step...things that are eliminated with the forehand to a certain degree.   I hope so. Nice to meet another dye-er out there. We have a good group on Thursday mornings, about seven of us regulars...you could prbably beat six of us...   The brown spots on your skin look like a fungal infection....similar to athlete's foot. Before an expensive trip to the dermy, try showering with an anti-dandruff shampoo. Use it as a bodywash for about two weeks. If they don't clear up, you're only out the price of a bottle of head and shoulders...lol. (Experience? My dermatologist wrote me a scrip for something that looked very familiar, and then the nurse told me to try the anti-dandruff shampoo first. Never filled the scrip.)         That was the one that I was familiar with.   That's part of why I switched as well. At 41, I could feel it staining my elbow.                     Favorite so far.   It is crap. Utter crap. But, and this is important...*they're reading*.  Think about that for a second.  Even if only one of ten, hell even one of one hundred, continue to read, they will move past this crap, and hopefully become well rounded adult readers.  Isn't there anything you read as a kid/teen that you might be embarrassed to admit to?  Saying that...jesus christ, two shelves of that shit? Garbage.  Also, not WTF.   I also considered a "clusterfuck of customers".   In the vein of better names for customers, runner up here in the restaurant was a "munch of cattle", tied with a "cuss of old ladies".   My vote would certainly be a "bitch of customers".   This works for me.  I cup my chin in my hand, with fingers facing forward, and use my chin/jaw to move my hand more than focusing on my hand. That way I can focus on technique, and have the added digital stimulation.   [instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com/). So much better for search, and when you find something you like, you can click through direct to Netfllix (if you watch on PC). Sort by new, expiring, or genre. Search by star. Good stuff.   I started this game as a forehand player. I had a respectable drive forehand, hitting just short of the 300' wall, but I knew that I needed to add backhand to my game. I focused on it, and months all I could throw was about 250'.  First major thing to look at is disc selection. I dumbed my discs down. Threw midranges as my drivers until I could crank them a bit. Reason behind that is that shorter/lower speed discs are "easier" to throw; simply meaning that if you are out there trying to throw a speed 13 400' without good form, you are going to have trouble getting good throws.  Second, just focus on form. Keep throwing it right. It took me a few months, but once I could throw lower speeds closer to where I knew they should go, I went back to my drivers, and was able to send 'em out far.  One year of dedicated practice later, I can send my speed 10 beasts an easy 300-325, and getting better every time I play.  Stick with it, keep practicing, and throw the right plastic.  Good luck.      Hmmm, well, I've got this big bucket over here to hold all the downvotes, so....  Dubstep and its ilk are not music, it's sound.   Well organized, well mixed, interesting sound, but not music.   Music requires instruments, and skill on them, and if you making dub makes you a musician, then me having a microwave makes me a chef.               True enough. I just said *less* slant, not non-existent. Even though I've enjoyed much of Moore's docs, I don't know if any of his would be on my personal 100 best...just too slanty.   I've seen most of these, and I think it's a fair list.  But...  Moore's Sicko in the top 25? And not Bowling for Columbine? Sicko was decent, but BFC was done with far less slant than Sicko, and far more powerfully done.  An Inconvienent Truth barely breaking the top 100? It wasn't the best cinematic piece, but I think the importance of that doc will only increase over time.  That being said, I'm so happy to have seen most of the doc's on this list, that I'm gonna pull my Prius over and sniff my own farts for a minute or two.   I assume that the Gators candle is going to smell like the jeans shorts crotch of a sweaty co-ed, with a bit of cheap domestic beer thrown in, with undertones of chewin' tobaccy, and a slight hint of regret.            Yeah, I play in FL, so it wasn't the best decision, but I put a big black military star on it, and it's surprisingly easy to find, midrange too, so I'm not hucking it out 300' and trying to guess where it ended up.   The new formulas of RIT dyes are on the shelves, and they don't work for dyeing.  Well, sort of.  I've had some luck stipling (spotting) discs with RIT dye black and getting really interesting changes on color. I stipled a white goldline River with black RIT and got blue speckles. I also made a paste of RIT black and used it on a bright green Innova champ Shark to get a military/olive green. Both of these were using the powder packs, with no water, just enough acetone to make mud. I haven't tried the liquid RIT.  I've used the Idye Poly line, without the color conditioner, and I get bright vibrant color quickly, with little to no problems.  My. Two. Cents.            Yes, obvious to most of us, but I was surprised by how many folks I spoke to today had never heard of Snopes.   In talking to my coworkers about a few things that are patently false on the internet (surprise!) I realized that many people apparently do not know about this place. [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/) is a great resource to find out the truthiness of just about anything that you find on the internet.   Best way to get over a girl is get under a new one.    It could happen.     Won't: Got to get through a few tough games to get to the SEC championship, where, if we got that far, we would lose to Alabama, or possibly TA M.

 Wait for her to menstruate so you don't end up having sex with a pregnant slave and believing her child is yours while it is a child born out of ~~shirk~~ zina.    People said the same thing about the fact that Iran was on the same side as the US during the last 2 wars. On many, many occasions. They've just slipped our national consciousness. Iran seems to keep finding itself beside the US, a country the Islamic Republic's founder described as the Great Satan while Iran was part of the Axis of Evil in Bush-era rhetoric. As an example, here's an instance Iran's little known role in [Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_uprising_in_Herat). But American journalists don't tend to have long term memory, and that memory doesn't shape national narrative the way contemporary soundbites do in any case. Everybody but us, and some of our allies, is caricatured as a monolithic entity - our stated 'enemies' in particular being solely ideologically driven and pragmatic. So naturally in a year, Iran will again be on the same side and we'll again be bewildered.   How was this removed under rule 0 - there is a pretty clear and obvious attempt at humor and everybody fuckin loved the post - 4k Karma in 2 hrs. Shit mods.   Every decade has one - And every decade they grow more tan. Watch out Muricans.   Exactly - nothing to see here - [just an isolated wiki edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congressional_staff_edits_to_Wikipedia). Just some dumbass on the hill. [Not like anybody's got a mass set of false social media personas](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks).   but lets not pretend that the claim doesn't have at least some validity.  It would have some validity if there was some doubt as to whether this was torture or not. There isn't. This was torture. This is not a matter of connotation and whether to call a fat guy a 'heavy set man' or 'obese'/'fat'.   Well the internet IS a series of tubes, so...  So basically, the internet is a bunch of tubes. YouTube, PornTube, YouPorn. Basically the internet is porn.   It's sounding about right in other places as well. Even if you don't give up, you're up against lobbies with millions of dollars and brain-dead imbeciles that outnumber you and who can be tricked to vote against their own self-interest. The system is just so broken all around...   OP is a account meant to appear like a virulent anti-semite. I'm all for calling out Israeli transgressions or the pondering the reasonable conspiracy theory - but this guys post history shows that's not what he's about. If you remember bipolarbear0, you won't support people like OP even when they post good material.            EDIT : sheesh, atleast tell me why you are downvoting   Downvoted for providing facts that disprove an aspect of the circle-jerk.   Girl marrying outside is considered apostasy in Islam and apostasy is punishable by death.  False - its not apostasy. Its considered adultery since the marriage is illegal. The punishment, in Islamic law, for the girl is 100 or so lashes if she's witnessed by four witnesses having sex with the man. You don't need to editorialize what went down with false claims to make it seem more wrong than it already is...   Which is the exact purpose of OPs account      Read the article - it gets worse. It appears grand juries have been held for 160,000+ civilian trials while only ~80 grand juries were held for cop crime cases.   Thank you - I'll explore more in that direction. I was limited by the data set since the USGS set completely ignores non-US quakes of these lower magnitudes if they aren't felt in 2010 onwards.   I appreciate the info!   50% of America will be disgusted. .50% of America will be fapping.   Even if they are American citizens, Americans will not give a shit. Whatever happened to Anwar Awlaki and his 15 year old nephew?   My money's on cocaine and dead hookers.   If it is true, if crimes were committed, then it is time to reorganize the intelegence structure and allow prosecution of those responsible.  Don't worry. They'll find low-level CIA suits that nobody else at the office liked anyways, you know, those fuckin 'well that's not the correct procedure' asshole co-workers' to lock away as patsies.   Or shoot himself multiple times while handcuffed over a minor traffic stop.   I was tinkering with some data here (for fun):  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/year/eqstats.php  Note that I'm aware that I'm looking at data for 23 years of a planet much much older than that so the sample size isn't even great.  Based on the number of global Earthquakes in 3 categories (magnitude 4.0+, 5.0+ and 6.0+), can we say though that there will likely be more of these noticeable Earthquakes over the next 10 years? Statistics is more of my strong suit than seismology - is this question not even valid (are past trends of Earthquakes not predictive of future events)?   I also noticed that there seems to have been a substantial jump in the number of 4.0+ recorded Earthquakes from before 1994 to after 1994. This is in spite of the fact that ("Starting in January 2009, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center no longer locates earthquakes smaller than magnitude 4.5 outside the United States, unless we receive specific information that the earthquake was felt or caused damage."). Is this because we're using better tools now, are detecting in more places, or has there legitimately been more Earthquakes after that point consistently?   You've got a badger, you tell us.   They're not saving them out of humanity. Unlike the idiots at ISIS, they understand that captured enemies provide intel...   That's true, but there isn't any video or statement from their group that they're actually using the kids to fight. They're training the kids, sure, but its not much different than videos that previously surfaced of Shi'ite children in camo doing the same thing. Or white boys taking their kids out to play paintball in full camo with Osama bin Laden shooting targets.   ITT: The same people who criticized IS for executing Shi'ite enemy combatants defending the same exact behavior by Shi'ite Militias.   I like that you guys can take trolling w/ a sense of humor!   You seem to have good knowledge. Does this issue not interest you? I will try to Google and see if some scholars have commented on this marriage and what the views are of the various schools of thoughts on how this marriage happened, and if it happened a certain way, is it permissible for Muslims today to emulate it since it is Sunnah.   I just know a few things - this issue doesn't particularly interest me. If the Prophet did something, and it was not exclusively for him, or it was not something initially permissible that was later abrogated to make it impermissible, than it would be good to go. But that's where fiqh comes in, along with tons of context/research.  In this case, I don't know that this nikah procedure actually went down the way OP said. From my understanding, the majority opinion in all four madhahib have witness requirements. My understanding is that witnessing is also required in the other mainstream sects (Ibadiyya and Shi'a Zaydiyya). I think the only group that allows marriage without witnesses as a majority would be Shi'a Ithna Ashariyyah (but I've never even seen a 12er quoting this story as proof for the belief).   So for most fuqaha across the board - they clearly aren't giving credence to the riwayah OP mentioned. I can also completely understand why a Muslim man in the first 300 years would've concocted a riwayah like that since it would tend towards legitimizing adultry. All you have to do is secretly say "we're married" and you can sleep together, with none of the formalities, protection and restrictions of a proper nikah. If you get the woman pregnant, you can deny that you were ever married or did anything (no witnesses), which nullifies the principle of legal protection.    Are they issuing camera tickets for HOV violations or anything like that?   Yes. It says, [15/9](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=15 verse=9) - quite explicitly, "Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian." I.E. God protects it (albeit through human agency of what Muslims consider the best generation of mankind, the Companions of the Prophet).   Hey guys,  I'm gonna be up in Seattle for a while and I'll be using their 520 toll bridge. Has anybody else gone up there? Does their bridge recognize our plates? Do you get the bills in the mail? And if that is the case - is there a better way to pre-pay?  Thanks!   I don't know enough about the topic to comment - I was clarifying your high-level criticism of Ibn Kathir's criticism of some earlier reports in deference to other early reports / lack of reports. If you can provide me with the relevant athar, I can help validate it - but that's about it for this issue.   I dunno bout you but I lol'ed   What motivation would the early scholars have to fabricate a story like this about Allah's Apostle? Wouldn't the claims of earlier scholars hold more weight than the likes of Ibn Khatir, who were born a long time after the life of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?   Earlier scholars didn't fabricate stories - that's completely simplifying the issue. The issue is one of how they got their information. People like Ibn Ishaq for instance didn't have any trouble gathering stories from individuals who weren't particularly reputable in the field, and from non-Muslims. He also often failed to provide colophons. The end result? Some recorded stories without sanad that may even have found their way to later collections and aren't true, are likely not even recorded by Muslims. Early Muslim scholars don't have a motivation to fabricate stories, but when some of these historians failed to be rigorous in how they collated material, we're naturally going to get conflicting stories - some of which don't line up with those gathered from more reputable sources.  Ibn Kathir btw is not a primary source. He's not providing new information. He's literally combing through the reports by the early historians and pointing out which ones are more likely true than not. Which ones are more likely untrue than not.   Okay - fair enough, thank you   Happy to answer your question - I'd appreciate if you would now would care to provide some elucidation on mine as to how your group deals with the different Qira'at? Particularly, my question: In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. **So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word does mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?**  Firstly let me ask you this, according to your belief who will be the last prophet present on earth? Jesus or Muhammad (sa)? If it is Jesus (and we know it is) then how do you reconcile this with the Qirat last...The point I am making is if you believe in the verse as 'Last of the prophets' in every sense, then there can be no Jesus to return.  Jesus will be last on Earth. There's no resolution  needed imo .. since the ayah isn't about who the last Nabi to walk on Earth is.  The point you're making can only be made by interpolating the ayah to read something like 'khatim al anbiyya **fi dunya**' (last of the Prophets in Earth). The verse doesn't say that - it simply says, "last of the Prophets". Pretty much every early sect believes Jesus is alive and was alive (Ahlus Sunnah, Shi'a Ithna Ashariyya, Shi'a Zaydiyya, (Kharijji) Ibadiyya) - ergo he was Nabi while the Prophet was Nabi, so your analogy is wholly a strawman. Since the vast majority believes Jesus is alive, it follows that your analogy should read more like the one I provided: Man A of the Letters family has a son B, and no other children. Son B dies without having any children. Man A lives well after his son. **The last member of the Letters family was therefore A, not B, according to you?**  You don't get the desired results by analogy of what we actually believe that you would with your analogy (which doesn't fit the situation as you add additional clauses).  The verse doesn't say 'last person to *become* a prophet'.  If I say you're the last person in a family, do I need to explicitly say you're the last person to be given birth to? Or will 99% of people understand that to mean you were the last person to join that family (to be born into it) by the obvious rendering of the statement?   I just want to add that so you don't think all I have got is one argument.  I'm sure you have other reasons to believe what you do. That's fine - I'm here though to understand specifically this topic. There are different Qira'at, how do you resolve that the ayah literally reads 'last' in one qira'a - which implies that it means 'last' in all the other Qira'a.  We don't believe this about Ahmad either so it is not relevant.   It isn't relevant in terms of what you believe, but it is directly relevant to the analogy you presented. Your analogy would require Sunnis to believe either (a) Jesus ceased to be a Nabi at ascension or (b) he will return with new wahi to displace old wahi. Neither of which Sunnis believe, making your analogy inapplicable.   However, if in the future somebody declares a physical war against Islam then the Muslims  So essentially, fighting does not become permissible in your religion until somebody explicitly says "I declare war on Islam"? If they invade your country without saying that and decimate your family - defending yourself against them is not jihad than?   I guess it would still be parthenogenesis, but I'm thinking about species that where the female gave birth to males - so I don't see how that would be literally a clone?   Okay - thanks for the clarification.   I don't think the colonel is self-proclaiming that he's a "truly great Muslim" - I'm sure if you guys talked directly to each other, he's a fine guy. Just very Pakistani in his way of delivering a pov :)   Ahmadi leaders said fighting against the British occupation in India was not jihad, because the British largely offered freedom of religion to Muslims...  I appreciate the historical information - but I'm pretty sure Ahmadis believe there's a monopoly on jihad by the Amir of Ahmedis (or the amir of w/e subsect you belong to) so by extension, any jihad that the Ahmadi amir hasn't legitimized is a false jihad. Correct?   [Sources of Waswaas and Accountability](http://islamqa.info/en/39684)   You didn't answer my question regarding this - I want to know how you guys deal with the Qira'at and I'd appreciate an answer if you're knowledgeable enough about your religion to provide me with one: In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. **So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word does mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?**  That's a completely irrelevant argument because you have already begun with the premise that Z is last (because we already know it is last in the alphabet).   Reworded just for you: Man A of the Letters family has a son B, and no other children. Son B dies without having any children. Man A lives well after his son. **The last member of the Letters family was therefore A, not B, according to you?**  There is a room, let's call it earth. J enters the room. J leaves the room. M enters the room. M leaves the room, never to return. J reenters the room. Who was the last person in the room, subject M or J?  Your analogy doesn't work - nubuwwah isn't about walking around in a room or on Earth. Nubuwwah is about receiving wahi. The statement from the Qur'an is that Muhammad is 'khatim al anbiyyah' (the last (khatim) of the (al) [people who] receive wahi (anbiyyah)). Are you saying that Sunnis believe 'Isa will come with new wahi that will displace the recorded wahi of Muhammad? If so, do you have evidence to support the assertion? Also - are you saying that though Jesus is alive, nubuwwah was lifted from him and he ceased to be a nabi while he's alive in Heaven (another logical requirement of your analogy)?  Muhammad also left the world during Isra and Miraj (or do you guys believe something else about that too?). During the night he left, people would've died who hadn't accepted Islam. Since Muhammad was not on this Earth, there was no Prophet on the Earth, so it was a period of fatrah. Will the people who died on kufr that night be held according to Islam or according to the people of fatrah - since per you, absence of a nabi on Earth is the absence of nubuwwah for that Nabi? Did Muhammad cease to be a Nabi for the night of Isra and Miraj?   We accept the word can mean last.  In this qira'a, the only meaning is 'last'. Unlike the other Qira'at, it can't be construed as 'seal'. If all of the Qira'at that have tawattur are valid, then by extension, 'last' is the meaning implied in all of them. So you're accepting that this Qira'a is a valid Qira'a of the Qur'an and that the word **does** mean (not simply 'can' - but does mean) last?  Bear in mind, Sunnis also believe Jesus will return. So they believe another prophet will come. Our belief breaks the seal of prophethood not even an iota more than the Sunni belief. In fact, if anything it is the Sunni belief which breaks the seal.  Man Y of the Alphabet family has a son Z, and no other children. Son Z dies without having any children. Man Y lives well after his son. The last member of the Alphabet family was therefore Y, not Z, according to you? When you draw a genealogical tree, you put Y after Z? Sounds like logical/linguistic gymnastics to me, but if that satisfies you and you're honest with yourself in saying that, then we're obviously at an impasse.   A rich person of the time of Abu Jafar As Sadiq sent his slave to ask him about the pleasure of finger to the woman. Abu Jafar replied and said it is permissible as long as you are using your own body parts and the woman allows it. In other words you cannot use any other tools to give pleasure to her. He was an old man so the young woman wasn't satisfied from him so he improvised.   Source? [To clarify - do you know the primary source of the narration?]   You do realize that 99% of Ahmadis aren't on Reddit and that I didn't say it was 99% of Ahmadis? I simply asked a question...   He's saying that this Qira'a has **khatim** not khatam, which leaves no room for ambiguity. His point is that in this Qira'a there is no "alternative meaning". Is your resolution of the issue to just reject the Qira'a (which also has tawattur) or did you just misunderstand his argument?   They're entitled to their view so **we just made our own separate sub and myself and most the guys just keep away from here** to avoid all the arguments and creating discord.  Than what's with the spam bots that Ahmadi spam bots that hit people up by PM...   They're a group who believes Jesus went to India, that there was a new Prophet and that fighting against British occupation over India (when the religion was created) was conveniently a sin.   Aisha was never a slave. She was the daughter of Abu Bakr, a free man.   repressive religion represses sex  By providing boundaries and a legal process in the event that a partnership doesn't work out? Is it repressive to allow something only in the confines of a contract that has weight in a court vs allowing everybody to fuck around willy nilly and then footing the bill for their abortions, orphaned children, psychological trauma, STDs, non-working/unskilled partners and all the other results of the 'sexual freedom' direction your society is moving towards?   Social conservatism, religious or not, doesn't exactly require religion to back it up - and its pretty strongly supported in many countries where religion isn't even as dominant anymore (China, Russia, etc.)    Because it's social justice. When we let people run amok, we're partially responsible for letting it happen.  The Prophet explicitly said He was not responsible *even for Muslims* living outside of his dominion. If you want to spread something to non-Muslim societies, focus on tawheed. Spreading rules/regulations is a distant second in terms of importance.   It would refer specifically to the Muslim community where Islam is dominant. Non-Muslim society, and minority communities in Western countries aren't what's being talked about in these sort of traditions - otherwise, as you mentioned, even in the Prophet's time, you'll run into that having been the case in many parts of the World.   Good luck getting that labeled as a 'terror attack' and reaching front page on any of the news subs unlike the attacks by the Palestinians.   I find it interesting that we look for explanations beyond the obvious for stuff like Sulayman talking to ants, Mary having a virgin birth, Isra and Miraj - at a time, when science has shown many of these things literally happening. Scientists have found ways to communicate with certain ant colonies. We've observed rare virgin births in animal species. And we can now travel at the speeds necessary to have completed Isra and Miraj. And yet, Muslims seem to have become more, rather than less, skeptical about these things being possible in the past.   feminism and queer studies and transgenderism   Why? Queer/transgender studies don't always result in what the LGBTQ lobbiests want to hear (see basically anything out of John's Hopkins for instance). But we need this information to address real issues that these people experience. Simply prohibiting castration/homosexuality and ignoring isn't enough in a time when these things are becoming widely accepted, and you can't understand these issues until you talk to the people experiencing them.   /r/worldnews isn't representative of Reddit imo. It's a very popular sub that even the Google feeds pick up. If anything, that sub is subject likely to be [more subject to shilling](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) than any other sub on the entire site. Take that, coupled with the fact that people who frequent the sub are barraged with negative anecdotal international stories and simple people turn anecdote into statistics.   Yup. There is one. That Aisha was much older than is widely presumed. Several academic scholars have questioned the veracity of the claim.   I don't know how an "academic scholar" would question the veracity of that claim, if by academic you mean a Western Historian. The argument of "truth of embarrassment" is a pretty established historical method for verifying statements (essentially that if a community is embarrassed or needs to engage in polemic about a saying it produced - that saying is true since the originator wouldn't fabricate something embarrassing/attackable about his own community/self). It's a bit of an anachronism for this topic though since Aisha's age wasn't even part of anti-Islamic polemic until modern times. Early polemic was actually critical about Muhammad's marriage to Zaynab - I'd be legitimately surprised if you can find any pre-20th century polemical criticism of Aisha's age of marriage.  I find it hard to believe that marrying a 9 year old at any point was acceptable.  Than you've got a very short term understanding of history. The very first thing OP said was "the tu quoque fallacy (pointing out that other people did it too)" - it's because there are countless examples of people in the past marrying at much younger ages than us. Arbitrary ages (18 in America, 16 in Europe and various other numbers) are based on essentially meaningless numbers. Have sex with a girl over 18 - you're good. Have sex with a girl that's 17 years and 365 days old, you're a sex offender and a pedophile. They have nothing to do with the development physically or mentally of an individual, life expectancy, etc. And they don't even compare to arbitrary (and non-arbitrary) marital restrictions of past communities. In other cultures, people were married and the marriage consummated (the married woman goes to live with the male) even before they had a period (see Biblical/Talmudic accounts of Rebbeca and Isaac as an example of 3 a year old getting married). I remember even in recent times a big hub bub about young marriages (post-Bat/Bar Mitzvah - think ages ~12-14) in Israel.  There is absolutely zero chance in my mind that the historically accepted age of 6/7 has even a 1% chance of being true.   Then you're arguing emotionally (even if you are able to cite an academic after the fact). You need to step outside of the issue if you want to look at it objectively. The question isn't whether this is strange to us, but whether or not it is more likely true than not. And the tasheeh of certain narrations over others suggests that it is.   If the people will continue to sin no matter what, then the Qur'an says they will be punished after death. Killing them early doesn't save them because they have already sinned anyway. So killing them isn't merciful, it is taking away their last bit of enjoyment before an eternity of torment.  You don't know that they're going to Hell - or that they're going to Hell for eternity. All we know from the nass is that they were destroyed on Earth. Unless there is a specific statement of their eternal damnation, in Islam, you're taught not to speak of it. Statements on punishment are not immutable - the intended purpose is to warn people away from sin. If God simply said, "I encourage you not to do this" - people would take less heed than if God says, "doing this leads to Damnation" because of our nature and the effect of fear of a thing being more meaningful than a suggestion against a thing.  And even when there are statements of eternal damnation, its not necessary that the damnation will actually be "eternal" for the parties. The example is the saying that (at some point) everyone with "a mustard seed of Faith" will be pulled from the Hellfire. If they are continuously going to sin, and increase in sin, then when their life is cut short, they have less potential to sin further into the future - which in turn reduces their suffering in an afterlife (or increases their reward in case they skip Hell altogether). The children they would've had otherwise, who would've had the same influence, never exist. It is definitely a mercy to die if the alternate is that in your future, you would only have become a worse human being. It's also a mercy on future generations, that through that reminder, are vividly discouraged from engaging in sins.  Having said that, your point that Allah is not "ever-merciful" covers this, if correct. Can you supply a verse?  I can't point you to a single verse, but you have read the translation cover-to-cover I presume so you've seen countless examples where Allah acts with Justice, or Wrath. I suppose you can read "tabbat yadda Abi Lahaban wa tabb" (roughly destruction on the hands of Abu Lahab and Him) and the rest of it to the end. The entire Surah is about punishment. From beyond the Qur'an, the textual evidence is His Saying "Verily, My Mercy prevailed over My Wrath." (or preceded over, etc.) - it's evidence that mercy and wrath are mutually exclusive innately, that one precedes the other and that God can act with both.  However, I then find it difficult to accept the virtue of mercy at all. One can be merciful without being "ever-merciful", but I don't think the wrathful killing of an entire city/generation is compatible with any level of mercy.  We'll just disagree on that than. In Islam, when the life of a child is naturally taken away - that doesn't come off immediately as a mercy either with the outlook you've presented. Because how can 'death'/'destruction' be merciful? It is a fact of life - innocent children die all the time, and the Creator is also Malik over everything that happens on Earth. But the death of a child is a mercy on the child (in Islam) by automatic entrance in Heaven, the saying "the Child will open the doors to Heaven for the parents it left behind" and so forth. It's a bit simplistic to say that 'death' or 'destruction' is automatically not reconcilable with "any level of mercy" imo   ... I think I'll stick to paying the tribute.      Let's do this thing!

Read more here: http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article4299890.html#storylink=cpy  not white.   Killing them for sinning or transgressing does not seem very merciful  I was always taught that if I see an animal suffering and effectively dying, to put it out of its misery. Killing those animals was mercy. You can't take an action (like killing in this example) and attribute a good/bad, just/merciful to it, separate of the doer of the action and context in which its done. If there is a community so engrossed in sin, and God knows they will live on only to have a ridiculous bad-deed:good-deed ratio, its merciful on His part to save them from themselves.  That said, Islam doesn't teach that God is ever-merciful either. Being al-Adl (the Just) is also an attribute of God. Islamic tradition teaches that 'his mercy precedes his wrath' - but that doesn't mean He can't act with a different attribute.   No paranoia, it's all an act for Beck and there's money to be made in nailing easy victims to the cross.   20 minutes of running doesn't involve taking it up the ass   Damnit, is there a proper double blind done on this topic by an accredited institution than? Don't leave us ~~hanging~~ erect...   But I think this question is still valid purely because we are playing with definitions.   I don't think this is simply playing with definitions, we're talking about whether God is one way or another way. That's more than definitions for us, that's asma wa sifaat.  The key point is: If God is unbounded, how can God not exist within the creation? Otherwise God is bounded to a realm outside creation. If God is unbounded, It has to be panentheistic.  Islamically, we can't say something about God - unless that something has proof in the text - and even than, it's not quite so simple. Per textual evidence, God exists within the universe in that God can 'see' what happens, God exists in the universe in 'his knowledge', and God exists within the universe in that God has complete control over everything to a sub-atomic level, etc. In that sense, God exists 'in' the Universe. We also say that God does not exist in the Universe in that God is not a thing subject to its rules, God isn't a substance being acted on by time or events like us etc. In that sense, God exists 'outside' of the Universe.  My understanding is that you're suggesting that God exists in the universe in some other way, and since Islamic text doesn't naturally read to support something like that, I can't really comment on it one way or the other - especially since I don't know precisely what you mean by unbounded. If you're suggesting that God is a substance, and this substance pervades space/time and beyond, than we don't define God as a substance where part of God can be in space/time, and part of God is subdivided outside of space/time. That is the Islamic criticism of Pantheism as Islamic scholars confronted it.   This is the only online academic source that deals with the question specifically and thoroughly imo:  http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/   As far as I know, we know that this is not the case at all. So basically I'm asking, why would he say that when it's not true?   As far as you know? Let's start there - can you link to academia and what modern consensus is on this issue - if there is any consensus on it?  I believe there's a paper written on this topic in particular. Don't remember what journal. The tradition you're referring to says              .            It isn't necessarily saying 'whoever ejaculates first determines it' - it can be read as saying that it depends on the dominance material from one gender had over ( ) material from the other gender leading to a closer similarity to the paternal uncle (in the male scenario).  We can nit-pick wording, but at that point, we'd be criticizing people for saying the sun rises. I think the meaning and motivation behind such sayings is more important.    It definitely needs to be more understood. Especially since a lot of people that will use this to save a penny or two are precisely those that can't shell out for a last minute ticket to get to where they actually need to go.  I dunno that it isn't understood - most people who know about this site and this sort of stuff are generally well-informed about what they'r trying to do. I agree on the premise though, the guy behind the site should be more clear in warning people about risks associated with his tool. That said, he doesn't actually make money off of it as of yet.   I fly once a month at least, only occasionally for business. If I'm saving $400 on a hidden city (example - any popular route) vs the contracted flight, and I'm being rerouted once a month - I'll accept losing one budget ticket a month. And even when storms do kick in, in my experience, delays have always put me through the same cities and canceled flights were all but one time compensated with a later flight following the same multi-stop path. It's anecdotal, but at least in my case - stuff like this is beneficial.   He could - but this is not his actual job. Just a side thing.   I assumed all the price comparison sites had to have agreements and pay fees to be able to get quotes and compare them.  Actually, those price comparison sites are mostly built around ITA. Building a tool like what OP's done is not impossible, or even hard. It's a matter of simply doing it, taking the risk (and potential corporate bullying as in this case), putting up any necessary capital while you operate in the red for the first year or so, etc. etc. etc.   I think he intentionally broke his site due to the lawsuit atm.   bingo   It's not much of a for-profit yet - doubt it's even in the green yet...   Not really - he suggested that there is an automated cancellation process by airline companies in general - with no proof...  Can they cancel if you miss a stop on a multi-stop route? Sure. Will they? That part depends. If they've overbooked or sold your seat to someone else after you failed to show for the first flight - you'll be told that your booking was canceled for a no-show. If you're a regular abuser or you've been flagged for other dishonesty, again, they can pull the same shit. If you do this once or twice in 5 years while only going in one direction - you're not on anybody's radar.   I highly doubt any systems, let alone all 'airlines' will do this automatically - its one thing to identify and penalize a repeat offender by bans or freezing their points. It's a whole nother thing to have a carte blanche automated cancellation process that can have plenty of issues adversely affecting honest customers....  Check out flyertalk - this has been discussed many times by many different people...   That's one of the potential downfalls of using a service like this. At the same time however, without concrete data, there's no reason to believe this happens often enough and in such a way as to be impactful to most of the people who've been using Skiplagged (successfully) for a while now. The fact that people had been doing this for ages in the not too distant past (without the use of tools like SkipLagged) would suggest it works out more often than not.       Having a lot of accounts open almost always lowers your score.  It quite literally does not - I just demonstrated by analogy how extending your credit line has the exact opposite effect given the part utilization plays in score - you know, based on how credit scores *actually work*...if you can't control yourself and rack up $20,000 in debt, than it's not having credit that ruined you but your own inability to control your impulses. Just about *everybody* on /r/churning has tons of credit - and nobody there is even remotely in bad debt...   [Shapeshifters!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3wco9zVao)   SHIZEN - DER EWIGE JUDE   Not really. If you apply for a card today and another one a month later, the company you apply for your 2nd one at will know about your first one. Depending on your credit score, getting a bunch of inquiries simultaneously is actually a good strategy. Your score drops down all at once but it will pick up. Meanwhile, in theory, the companies extending credit to you only see information that's been posted to date. In my case, I apply for all the credit I want every several months since I usually get instant approvals once my credit's back in the +700s. It takes a quick drop, but goes right back up over a short period of time. Rinse and repeat.   Say you have 3 cards, with the maximum balance offered by each bank below:  Chase $5000 BoA $5000 Barclays $5000  You have credit available at $15,000 and you only use $5,000. If you now open another account, Amex $5000, your max available is at $20,000. You just brought your utilization down to under 30% from over 30%. Utilization plays a factor in your overall score. Hence, having more credit available is almost never a bad thing.   I've got a 770 with over 20 credit cards, and about 7 years of credit history. Only reason to have only 3 credit cards is if you can't control yourself to not max them all out.   UN: Israel please stop bombing hospitals and destroying entire apartments.  Israel: *bombs more hospitals, schools and apartments*  UN: OK. In that case, please stop owning nuclear weapons.  **Stay tuned to find out how Israel reacts. The next episode may be a shocker - don't miss!**   They will sue you, but if you have a good lawyer and you can make a case, you can get away with not paying the excess after the repo. You credit rating will tank (will start to get better after 7 years).    That's very interesting, because the end effect would be that a lender has no benefit to lend to strangers...thus there's no capital for anyone. Does that mean it's nearly impossible to move up out of your social class in that country?  Does taking on interest-bearing loans help people move out of their social class? With the exception of anecdotal risk takers and owners of businesses that became successful, it seems to keep the majority of people tied into their social class - keeping in mind that the anecdotal successful risk taker / business owner is one out of every 10 failure entrepreneurs and budding venture capitalists.    The type of arrangement OP describes is quite common as it complies with Sharia law.  It doesn't actually, traditional fiqh books would consider this as constituting interest since deliberately precomuting interest over the base is simply getting pegged with a fee you would not be paying if you had the capital up front. But it is common. Muslim establishments in Western societies will find a work around for every inconvenient law - and in this case, at their own expense.   Well, back then, i was Muslim - and heavily forbidden to use interest. So, my dad, as i was 20 at the time, spoke to the dealership for hours. Thinking we won a deal, they gave us 0% APR, BUT added all the accumulated interest to the loan. Basically, a car that was work less than $20k, was sold for $30k with 0% APR.  This has nothing to do with being Muslim and entirely to do with being an imbecile. Islam prohibits interest because of alleged exploitation associated with usury. Allowing somebody you're buying something from to convince you to pay 50% of value as an upfront added interest payment over the base price in lieu of periodic interest is just semantics, and is still interest/riya in Islam.   Here is a poll that's shows 51 percent of Americans have anti black views http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-poll-majority-harbor-prejudice-against-blacks. So you are saying this poll is also a direct reflection of American society because numbers not personal experience tell the truth?  That's not a survey of the number of people who consider blacks a cancer or would like to use violence to expel them. Read the questions - the 51% is anyone who exhibited racial prejudice of any kind, it was the surveyors rendering of in-explicit racism. Quite different from 52% of a sample population calling a subset of the population a cancer, with 33% calling for violence - both explicit, I can't even imagine what a measure of implied prejudice would look like over an Israeli sample....  And yes, that's an accurate and reproducible reflection of prejudice in the United States that's been tested through multiple surveyors with several samples reflective of an average accounting for wealth disparity, education and political affiliation in the United States...the survey and others like it have been reproduced with roughly the same numbers and similar questions over the last several years with mutually exclusive samples each time....  So you are saying this poll is also a direct reflection of American society because numbers not personal experience tell the truth?  Yes...because statistics and statistical extrapolation trumps mindless anecdotal extrapolation in every way...      Historically, the Virgin Birth stems from  Virgin birth stories were pretty popular beyond the OT in other religions as well. It's equally possible, more so even, that rather than a misreading of Isaiah 7/14 leading to the development of a virgin birth story, there was already a virgin birth story and it was later justified by casting it on re-understanding the OT. The same way as was done for many other things like crucifixion or abolition of the laws, etc.   Also is there anything in the Qur'an that is similar to the Book of Revelation?  No. Also though, the book of revelations is one of the fully contested books and not even attributed to Jesus or any of his immediate disciples. Its visions/prophecies of one sect of Christians later in the era that became mainstream - and you've had several prominent figures question its canonicity (Martin Luther for example).  There are Muslim prophecies of Jesus coming back, how it will happen, and what he'll do. These are collected in different books of ahadith, but most such reports I can think of are inauthentic by Islamic standards so it'll be hard to find any scholarly work with them translated into English (unlike established hadith books).   The Islamic equivalent of Jzus coming back is quite literally, Jzus coming back.   The article doesn't have to be directly about Islam in order for it to relate to Islam or Muslims....jeez talk about being anal though...   I can only say from personal experience  Sure, and in my experience over the last 2 years, I've observed cruel racism by Israelis (not directed at me). I've also observed a small number of marginalized Israelis who've opposed it. Neither my experience, nor your experience, are a legitimate basis for drawing an over-arching claim about Israeli society. My experience, like your experience, is anecdotal. The studies by the Peace Index and others, demonstrating prevalent and virulent racism, however are not.   people looking for a better life in that area make the journey to Israel ( they bypass Egypt because they will get shot to death).  They bypass Egypt because Egypt doesn't have a great immigration policy. You can't really beat being able to call it Aliyah and getting citizenship in a high GDP country by simply claiming Jewish ancestry...  It is not about blacks https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uBFN91t2z28  A YT video of a couple of responses, that may well be cherry picked, isn't quite the same as an academic study or a widely respected poll...the author of the video above has a very specific agenda while the Peace Index is well-established...   Study shows that MIGRANTS are cancer  If Israel had a problem with migrants, it would have a problem with most of its population and the immediate ancestors of almost all of its population. Re-read the poll - they specifically have a problem with black migrants....   It's settled - I'm moving.

About time someone gives us assholes some fuckin credit.   Can't tell if troll or proper retard...   *facepalmpalms*   Pull the tampon out of your ass hole my fabulous shining white knight friend. Trolls don't care about gender at all. If their victim hadn't been a female, than they'd make jokes about you being a fat lonely neckbeard (for example - neckbeards being gender specific to males). It's not "hate" for female gamers - it's trolling. Trolling is universal and not bound by gender restrictions. You're just an idiot.   Pretty refreshing to see a group of top comments written by rational, intelligent people in /r/gaming for a change.   It's funny though. Had the right person in /r/gaming seen this thread while it was still rising, they would've posted a demeaning one-liner with epic karma and this thread would've taken an entirely different turn. Missed opportunities.   Yup. There's multiple sub devoted to women (and men) fucking dogs. Multiple. Subs.   So it's basically a /b clone now eh   Reddit: Applauds doxing as long as its not against redditors.    So she deserves to die for her past mistakes?  Strawman. All I did was excerpt a statement from the article. I said nothing about anyone deserving to die...but keep doing the over-dramatic white-knight junatic bit, I like it.   Rephrased your defense of this convicted criminal who used to exploit dying old men and women to fit the narrative of a hypothetical young Jihadi girl in ISIS  You have absolutely no details how she was involved in that ~~scam~~ movement, for all we know she wasn't informed of the full details or had a very minor role, people fall into working for ~~scams~~ terrorists all the time, ~~pyramid schemes~~ terror campaigns prey on the economically weak and naive as well, sometimes people get caught up in the wrong influences when they are young.  So that maybe you'll see how retarded it sounds to minimize her crimes as if they were nothing so you can continue to deify criminals because they choose to fight people you don't like. You lot are taking the 'enemy of my enemy' to an amazing level.   Make of it what you will.      Or did he die in 1996 like they said in 1999?  He's like Bin Laden. Only Bin Laden had a final death. This guy will come back to life for the next 20 years as needed.   What German newsmagazine was this? Does anybody have a proper citation given that modern journalists don't seem to give two shits? Thanks in advance.   [Black Immigrants] settled in a very specific place, kicking out the original inhabitants and terrorizing them. Of course they would feel that [hatred]  I hope the irony of your statement isn't lost on everybody who sees that...  But regarding this claim - that its not racism, just anger towards a specific decision made by the black immigrant community as a whole - that the pale faced European Colonists only hate black immigrants because the naughty blacks chose a poor location to settle is a bit hard to swallow... You don't [forcibly sterilize a vaste swathe of people of a particular pigment and heritage](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots.premium-1.496519) because a subset of them ruined your view. That's institutionalized discrimination, and deliberate racist control of demographics.  Keep making shit up if it helps you sleep at night.   never call...    I guess you never did any mistakes in your life...you're quite pathetic.  I've never preyed on the weak and elderly, unlike your hero.         People are downvoting you to hell, even though [studies show over 50% of Israelis consider blacks a Cancer](http://www.timesofisrael.com/most-israeli-jews-agree-africans-are-a-cancer/) - you can only imagine how they feel about Arabs...   You're either completely uninformed or deliberately providing misinformation. Haaretz has almost *no* market-share in Israel itself and is a known left wing paper. No shit you're gonna find comments by rational people. But it's not a representation of the general vibe in Israel which is what was at discussion here and what you have literally zero clue about unless you're intentionally trying to sugar-coat things.  Check the same story on websites people in Israel actually use...like ynet or even jpost.  From [JPost](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Bilingual-Hebrew-Arabic-school-in-Jerusalem-caught-in-flames-383176) version of the story:  First comment criticizes **the general vibe in Israel**: Welcome to Israel circa winter 2014-15. Racist laws , an ascendant far right that would make Le Pen blush...  Second top comment is conspiracy theory  Third top comment: I wish the media would stop carrying the lie that there is a "palestinian" people. They're just arabs that were kicked out of Egypt and Jordan for bad behaviour. It's why the rest of the arab world wants nothing to do with them and gives them no aid. You're SEEING that now. They can't be civilized, they're savages. It's why Egypt and Jordan kicked them out.  Fourth top comment: The muslim terrorists will never change. Not until they have succeeded or they are dead. Lets try to help them achieve the latter outcome. Rip the bandaid off clean. It's about time. Then we can move on.  Fifth top comment - conspiracy theory.  Etc.  And I don't remember Ynet, especially the Hebrew version of the article, being any better.    And is not the first staged media event Pallywood has produced.   Yes, just like Baruch Goldstein. Just like Irv Rubin. A bunch of false flags. It's all a giant Muslim/Arab conspiracy against peace-loving innocent Israelis. /s  Dumb Ass.   Might as well be a quote from the Book of Genesis      She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.   Pretty much everything in the Guiness book of World Records?   out of stock :(   why then did Abu Baku initiate an unprovoked war of aggression and conquest against Byzantine?  Do you have proof it was unprovoked? Islam doesn't just exist in a political realm, are you suggesting that converts to Islam within Byzantine territory were allowed freedom to practice? Are you suggesting that possible self-determination of Byzantine Muslim subjects would also qualify as a 'war of aggression'? There are a lot of possible provoking factors that don't require an all-out Byzantine invasion into Mecca to justify Abu Bakr's incursions. But this isn't a history sub - you likely won't find your answer here, unless you're more going for the question of whether or not Islam allows for political expansionism absent any provocation...    For dhu al qarnayn we don't know who/when/where he was.  Look up classical tafasir on it. You can argue that fact about a lot of individuals in the Qur'an - but the mufasireen shed some light on some of the named individuals/places in the Qur'an, especially from outside sources.  IMO - you won't have any luck with this topic. The primary context the Qur'an and ahadith use to speak, outside of themselves, are israeliyyat, and the sayings of then contemporary Christians and pagans. It wasn't particularly necessary for Islam to discuss the status of people like Mani (not being a real prophet) or potential prophets in China and Africa in order for the basic tenants of the religion to spread to those areas, in the time of Muhammad himself. In fact, Islam did just fine in most of these areas without any specific references to the revered personages of those areas.  If you're super interested though, I'd suggest an in-depth History like Tarikh at Tabari which will cite many Muslim sources for the so-called 'history of the world' which is more likely to fill the void you're looking to fill here.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/17/darren-wilson-lock-your-ass_n_6170746.html   Rather than having a discussion about the absurd militarization of the police in America, we were distracted by the race and character debate  This.   Link?   Well - from the video itself, it looks like he's deliberately making fast gestures which don't register while when he does it slower, it seems to work. The other criticisms of the device already mean I wouldn't drop a penny on it - but this particular criticism seems a bit self-wrought to justify how much he focused on it.  	140
 So guys what is your dream track no matter how unrealistic or unfeasible it seems. Mine would be Mt Panorama at Bathurst   Seriously this soundtrack needs to come out right now, I can't wait until the 18th.   Murdoch says no.   I can't ever see this happening to ND since they aren't a publicly traded company. Plus after The Last of Us, Sony are most likely giving them free and creative reign over their future games.    My download speeds also fluctuate especially if I pause and unpause to see if it changes   So was the bad guy in Quantum of Solace a legit threat now?   Hopefully they fix the download speed issue, that's my only issue I have had post 2.0.   This is really good man, keen to see more of this!   Honestly after watching World War Z, i'm surprised that bikes aren't common sense.    Yep same here, it's either BMW, Merc or Audi.   I'm pretty sure its taken from the [Force Unleashed 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umX_8cllRc0) commercial.    Damn I was actually starting to like this show :/   I gotta say the opening [Battle above Coruscant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWoGkrt5Upg) in Revenge of the Sith still to this day makes my jaw drop.    fuarrk dat music.     I feel if I owned this car that I would be way too terrified to just leave it parked on a street.    This post kind of reminds me of the Batman Arkham games. The amount of damage Batman does to these people, they would have to be fed through a tube for the rest of their lives. Just remember Batman doesn't kill, he just turns them into vegetables.    Great work. Is it common for a 335i to not come standard with navigation or the screen at least?    [Seeing it in this bad boy on friday](http://hugontour.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dsc02331.jpg)   Pretty sure that this is the least of this film's problems.    Well in a recent Star Wars rebels episode it is shown that a lightsabers length can be adjusted on the hilt.   Yeah this playlist has outstayed it's welcome. Not only did they lock it to German cars but they locked it to like 4 german cars.    I think it will sell well, obviously won't do the same as the last gen version but I still expect it to be one of the top selling current gen games for the year.    Are they releasing a stand alone film in between Ep 7 and 8?   You realise you just spoilt the film as well, thanks.    Thanks mate.    [Put it in H!](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78503/2672773-3570061943-tumbl.gif)   We really need private lobbies so we can just race friends or do proper club v club races..    I am not really tech savvy on the animation side of films but can you explain why it would be twice the work to render it at a higher frame rate?     Is there a link for this video?   So after seeing both Hobbit films in 48 frames in the cinemas, it got me thinking as to whether 48 fps is better suited for animated films? Would it look to strange? Since there is no live action it can't really look that fake right like the first 2 Hobbit films?   Thanks man, kind of reminds me of the AC2 opening, the music is pretty amazing so far as well.    MS probably want Skype on as many platforms as possible as they would get royalties from it.    Video doesn't exist, is there a mirror anywhere?   Looks like a younger Amy Adams.    Brazilian fear factor had some great plot as well.    The film was apparently way over budget and was completely edited and re-shot at the behest of the studio. The original film had Keanu Reeves in a smaller role and Hirouki Sanada being the main character. Did you notice how the [poster for the film had that tatted up guy holding a gun over the shoulder?](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/47-ronin-freak-poster.jpg) Yeah he's in the film for about 10 seconds, the original director was locked out of the editing room after the reshoots were completed. It's a shame because I think the film has glimpses of awesomeness and fantastic world building but ultimately it was corporate greed that most likely got in the way of a potentially great film.    Wouldn't be surprised exactly, after all we got a teaser for Intestellar pretty much a whole year before release, it seems way more likely than a Batman V Superman teaser since that film comes out in 2016.   The film should be viewed as is.   Sorry if I missed the explanation but how is Gordon able to afford living in such an expensive looking apartment/penthouse. Is it Barbara's penthouse?   What the hell, my game doesn't look that bad...Here are some direct captures from my PS4.   [Image 1](http://i.imgur.com/dPp4c5S.jpg)  [Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/DFy703Y.jpg)  [Image 3](http://i.imgur.com/YdU3PUJ.jpg)  [Image 4](http://i.imgur.com/vfYaZbM.jpg)   You will find that almost all racing games have reduced image quality in the mirror since they essentially have to rerender an image twice as well as keep the textures in place from popping out as you drive along.    Where are you from OP? I just turned 23 this month and am in no hurry at all to settle down. I guess it also helps that everyone my age or around my age feels the same, hell my brother who is 28 is in no hurry to settle down either.    Seriously how do people not save their work in this day and age? How is the auto saving not working for these people?   The fastest way for me is still using my phone through the PS app.   Does anyone here know of EVE Online? It's a massively online multiplayer game made by CCP games. Basically it's a huge sandbox universe in which the stories that happen in the game are basically player created. Basically the events that have happened in the game combined with the rich background lore would essentially make it the Game of Thrones of sci fi shows. Here's a link from [Variety](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=2 ved=0CCMQFjAB url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2014%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Fhow-the-eve-online-tv-series-could-become-the-next-game-of-thrones-1201088301%2F ei=2d9NVLWCM-XvmAW6vICABA usg=AFQjCNE64EaRrCvoMjp_E8RNGK73AACayQ sig2=hKdhYogOI1vquWr5fckE0A bvm=bv.77880786,d.dGY cad=rja) explaining what I mean.    The one with the Rock. The Legend of Hercules was supposedly rubbish.    A completely CG animated film would be quite expensive. Look at Final Fantasy Spirits Within, that was completely animated and cost a boatload of money and performed very poorly at box office and basically undid Squaresoft and forcer them to merge and become Square Enix. Now this was back in 2001, so maybe CGI has gotten cheaper to produce but I think the investment is still too much compared to that of a live action film.   So do you guys think that a main entry AC game will ever be set in a  future setting. Navigating a busy metropolis or perhaps a very futuristic city. It kind of seems like Watch Dogs was more of the present setting with Chicago but I think a good AC game can be made if they set it in the future. Picture a city like [Coruscant](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080610031227/starwars/images/5/5c/Coruscant_at_night.jpg) from Star Wars and sneaking into a super tall skyscraper to take out your target. Just a thought I would be keen to hear your opinions on an AC game set in the future.    You're not alone my friend. That is the only film to this date where I felt incredibly empty at the end, not in a bad way but a that's so fucked up kind of way since nothing good happens at the end.    I wonder what story idea they were going with in [This](http://i.imgur.com/GLf8cFh.jpg) concept. The star destroyer crashing onto Mustafar.    Man I loved the opening title credits for AC2/Brotherhood and AC3.   Damn I graduated from Macquarie Uni in September and it won't accept my email.   I think BMW have been outselling Merc and Audi.   Tron Legacy  Oblivion  Gravity Edge of Tomorrow  Avatar  Star Wars Episode 3 Prometheus Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises  Make sure you check out the Blu Ray versions of these films.    Don't worry our man Jeremy Clarkson already punched him for us.   So am I just missing it or has there not been that much marketing for the final Hobbit film? We only have one trailer and the film comes out in less than 2 months. Compared to the last 2 films at this time of the year, there was tons of marketing for both films where as this film still only has one trailer out.    Is this in Sydney?   Wow that was a surprisingly good teaser. Looks really cool.    Just adding my 2 cents on the topic of Borderlands' sense of humor. The very topical, reference-based, irreverent, self-deprecating, over-the-top style is definitely NOT for everyone. For my money (and personal sense of humor), Borderlands is the most genuinely funny game series in existence. I think it's funnier than most 'funny' shows and movies. Absolutely brilliant writing, IMHO. You can tell that the team at Gearbox LOVES games- there is just fan service after fan service littered throughout  Yeah they love games so much that they just outsource the ones they don't want to make to other teams and pretend it wasn't their fault.    Yeah sorry I am going to have to disagree with you. Most of the humour is either just a reference to pop culture or shoe horning some meme into the game. It's a fun game but the humour is not the best imo. The funniest game I have personally played is still Portal 2.   It does seem like they have decent trunk space, at least the coupe does I think. They seem like they are one of the more practical luxury cars on the market since they aren't super low or have huge body kits and they also happen to be super comfy inside.    It really is! Michael Mann is for me one of my all time favourite directors and his choice of music is spot on in every single film.    afaik the xbox one version suffers the same issue as well. I think the PC suffers from it a little bit but nowhere near as bad as the console versions.    [God Moving Over The Face of  The Waters by Moby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTunCVWzkFA) for Heat (1995).   And the exact same plot almost.    [Stark Salvation by Geoff Zanelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SajsLpKU7s0) :)   Same here brother, I just want to see Daft Punk. So i'll probably be 40 by the time they tour again haha.   I love that he became the CEO of Sony.   Anyone here from Chico that can explain why I can't bring my friends to Chico?   Does the fancy looking dash and instrument cluster actually work?   I wouldn't call this a feature but the UI is so smooth and snappy that it pretty much made me like my purchase. Of course the games are great but having a UI that is reponsive and doesn't lag makes it worth while.    I quite liked the film as I really enjoy these corporate conspiracy types of films. The cinematography is truly amazing as well. Great wide shots of buildings and architecture to make the corporate world truly look imposing. All in all I felt it was film that may have been overlooked when it came out.    Yeah I am really hoping they put private lobbies in soon, I just want to race my friends only, not these muppets who spin you out in the corners.    Love the piece, I really love the idea of futuristic races. Wipeout is a great inspiration for my imagination when it comes to that topic.    Driveclub makes it fairly loud, the last game funnily enough to do it was actually AC4.   Damn, upper Hengsha would truly have been glorious to look at :(   I remember Spielberg being attached to direct this at one point, he would have done an amazing job. Especially if you look at his Minority Report which has a slightly similar aesthetic.    Spec Ops The Line   It very well may be coming since most of the online functionality is restored I think.   God damn why couldn't this guy have written the screenplay...   What was the repair issue if you don't mind me asking?   Hey all I was wondering how to ONLY race my friend in the same club. Not really up to racing with 10 other people, just a classic 1v1 race.   Sick run, congrats! Haven't played the game in a day or 2, it's nice to see that the leaderboards are functional now.   Is there a gif set for the Jedi code?   Just play Colonial Marines, huehehehe.   Just curious as to why you are selling it?   It's worth it, I only drove on it myself for the first time on Saturday! Make sure to drive through the Royal National Forest and through to the bridge.   I literally drove on this for the first time on Saturday, truly breathtaking.    As blatant as it was, it didn't really make me cringe since his character is known to play games to unwind.    Wait really, I thought every country had power switches...   Same, played through it all to see what the fuss was about and it really was nothing to go and proclaim it as GOTY material. I don't even hear it brought up in many discussions. I guess for me it was the equivalent of an oscar bait film.   [Better quality of how it looked in film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLy7wZeqa4) I think the F35 actually looks quite good in the film, especially when it hovers in under the overpass to block the truck. It looks quite real in that situation, not that it would ever happen but at least they went to the effort of making it look real with the model instead of using CG.   GT is designed more for a wheel in mind than the controller.   "One of"   Fucking love everything about this film. One of Cruises best performances.    Damn what a dissapointing film that was haha, great teaser though.   dat enigma soundtrack...   Haha no worries, I was in Year 7 of high school when I first saw that teaser and to this day it was still my most re-watched teaser.   Personally for me it's a toss up between [Star Wars Episode III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKZMI5tYq3s) and [The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA). Such awesomely edited teasers that really got the hype train going.   Bought the PS+ upgrade since it was the cheapest  for me $56 AUD   It's kind of frustrating for me as someone who actually caved and bought the PS+ upgrade as the servers still are fucked. Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed the game a lot but those servers being down really dampens the experience.   I'm just curious as to how you figured the cost out that it's $9k/hr. Not doubting you, just curious is all.    What do you think this means for the future of BMW? Can we see more crazy cars coming from BMW to compete with newer cars like the AMG GT?      I would say the Grey had a very misleading moment in a trailer. I don't want to spoil it but it's pretty crazy.    Mines attached to a card and it shows the same shit as well, so annoying.   So strange seeing a holden with a vauxhall badge or chevy badge.   I meant the PS+ version delaying it for a while then releasing it with an explanation afterwards.    Damn, at least the came out and said it straight. Better now than saying that later after it was released.   Gonna need a source on this.   It could be the EU versions of the game which tend to have more languages files.    Kind of what I was expecting, still picking the game up regardless. It seems like a game someone is either going to love or hate, much like Alien Isolation. I think that's fine in my opinion as the game is aiming to capture a specific audience of car lovers rather than appeal to the more open world type of racer that's quite common these last few years.   	112

 Fair enough.  And if you want to really outsnob the Beefheart fans, tell them that Lick My Decals Off Baby is better than TMR.     I've been listening to it for decades, and think it's brilliant.  I don't see why I can't enjoy both outre music (Captain Beefheart or Ornette Coleman) and power pop (the Kinks and Matthew Sweet are a couple of long standing favorites.) In different moods I want to hear different music. You don't have to take a side.   Education is only mandatory through 16 in most places, but every state I know of provides free education through 18 (or completing high school.)  It's generally held that it's in society's interest to provide education beyond the age when you can drop out of school, and as the world demands more skills, I would argue that extending that further would be in our best interest.  If Walker is saying that public investments will pay for themselves, like helping finance a public stadium, it seems  that education returns the investment several times over.  Look at the relative incomes of places like Mass or NJ , which spend many on education, vs Mississippi or Alabama, which skimp on it. (Funding public education is really one the oldest debates in US History. Places like New England have always favored spending heavily, the southern states have always opposed it. I don't know the details of the endowments, but places like UW Madison are also (research centers)[http://www.warf.org/about-us/background/history/history.cmsx ] At least in Wisconsin, it looks like there is a pretty good return on the money.    That's hilarious.  Although I'd change it to read 'A wholly owned subsidiary'.   50 years ago baseball was the national pastime and boxing was highly  popular. Tastes change.   Sure we have a number of unnecessary regulations.  But what's really gone wrong with America's economy is  the movement of wealth and income to a small minority at the top.  This is a side issue and a distraction.      After feeding them and taking them to the doctor, I think providing an education is the most important thing a society does for its young people, and for the society's continued success.  Cutting education funding is a foolish economy.  An uneducated society is not likely to be a thriving one.    Most of the cost is tax credits, subsidies, or near cash assistance.    Sure, why should we listen to the scientists about science, when we can listen to vote and money grubbing politicians?   Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's tradition of fine public education!   He seems to have his own [budget problems now](http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-faces-billion-deficit-heading-into---budget-cycle/article_5a3d6933-5937-5b23-8cd7-3bc16bf07edb.html).   Republicans complaining about income inequality is about as convincing as adult film actors complaining about pornography.    If there is one key lesson from the shale revolution, it is that public investments in technology innovation can bring a huge benefit for both the economy and the environment, said Michael Shellenberger, the president of the Breakthrough Institute, an advocacy group for sustainable development, in Oakland, Calif.  But since we have a political party married to idea that the government can't do anything right and "the market" solves all problems, good luck with this in the future America.   Please, please, please.   A weakened IRS is yet another way to push income taxes down.  If business owners and investors are routinely able to understate their income with little chance of an audit, their effective tax rate falls. Income earned through wages is harder to hide, leaving them taxed on their true income. Why the Democrats never make an issue of how Republican anti-IRS policies enable tax cheaters, I can't understand.   Wait, this guy can make Republicans shut up?  I don't care what his politics are, that's a needed talent.    Yeah but he was quoting Reagan misquoting Lincoln, so it's OK,  Cause it's Reagan.   They're mostly Fox news viewers, who share that level of awareness.   You can currently get [40/1 odds](http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/us-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=791149) on Bobby Jindal winning the Presidency,  Anybody else think this is a ploy for attention and funds?   Don't set standards you can't meet yourself, Ted.   Mitt Romney might not be awful, but who knows?  He's reinvented himself so many times,I have no idea what he'd do once he got into office. But I'd take my chances with him over any of the other current aspirants.  (Except possibly Rand Paul.  He seems a bit of a wild card as well.)   Americans for Prosperity is for the prosperity of a very small number of Americans.    The rest of America truly needs to live more modestly.  We have billionaires to support.   Hope you're wrong. Suspect you're right      Nah, he's got a sense of humor and realizes that his side can make a mistake.  He's not going anywhere in the Republican Party.   We have a responsibility, said Representative Jackie Walorski, an Indiana Republican who wanted the legislation rewritten, to protect the most vulnerable among us and ensure that women facing unwanted pregnancies do not face judgment or condemnation. She has a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee.  Holy crap, a Republican Congress member who doesn't see every moral issue as black and white. Maybe she'll start a trend.   I doubt she's going to make getting rid of subsidies 'in a fair fashion' one of her priorities as a Senator.  I expect she's going to remain 'philosophically opposed' to subsidies,do absolutely nothing to upset the Iowa farmers, and find other government handouts that must be curbed.  I'll be happy to be wrong (thrilled even), but I ain't worrying about it.   Talk about your 'no-go' zones.   He's got a point.  Here are some more of [God's Laws](https://www.gci.org/law/sct01) we're neglecting.   If that were the typical conservative response, I would have less of a problem with it.  But usually they claim to be champions of free enterprise, but find a reason for an exception for themselves or a favored group.  (Paul Ryan on the bank bailouts is a particularly egregious example of this.)  And when something they don't like gets a subsidy, say alternative energy, they throw a fit about favoritism and crony capitalism.  (And I realize I'm generalizing. I'm aware that there are reasonable ,thoughtful and unhypocritical conservatives.  But you can hardly hear them because the Rush Limbaugh , Fox News etc conservatives have taken all the air.)   Just look at what has been the first order of business for Republicans after they won full control of Congress for the first time in eight years this past fall. Its not expanding the earned income tax credit, but rather pushing a Wall Street wish list for tweaks to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.  Somehow, I'm not wholly convinced of Ryan, Romney, etc's newly found concern for poverty and the middle class.      But that's different ... because conservatives always claim their government handouts are 'different'.   To think Wisconsin used to be known for clean government ... Scott Walker has sure turned that around.   Still, I don't think it's fair to call these 49 Senators anti-science. I'll bet everyone of them believes in gravity.   OK Rand, put up or shut up.  Get some legislation on the table and vote on it. See how much support you get from your Republican colleagues.   Not being a scientist is not an excuse for being an ignoramus.    Guess those English speaking Americans can't be told the truth.   I think there will be a political problem for the Republican Party going into 2016 if we dont define what we are for on the environment, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Roll Call in November. I dont know what the environmental policy of the Republican Party is.  I thought it was saying, 'I'm not a scientist'.   Looking at the accompanying chart, I'd say the American public needs to get a clue.  If it does, I think changes will follow quickly.   Paul Ryan, please take special note.   "For the most part, they are conservatives who have criticized other Catholics in the past for disagreeing with definitive statements in papal encyclicals." said David Cloutier, a theologian at Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland who specializes in the environment. "They're scared that the document is going to say something definitive that they can't agree with. That will put them in a very difficult situation."  Soon as we get a liberal pope, conservatives start challenging his opinions and authority.  Who saw that coming?      How about Claudius?  After all, none of the other Roman Emperors managed to get their own [television series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Claudius_%28TV_series%29) .   I think the goal here is not the tax cut for the middle class (which isn't going to happen with the current Congress), but forcing the Republicans to show who they're truly concerned about.   A bad memory seems to be the first requirement to be a modern day Republican leader.   http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/paul-ryans-poor-memory-fails-him-again  http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2012/05/15/mitt-romneys-memory-hole http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/10/22-things-dick-cheney-cant-remember-about-plame-case  That and claiming an inability to understand science. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/why-republicans-keep-telling-everyone-theyre-not-scientists.html?_r=0       When at the center of the system there is not anymore man but money, when money becomes an idol, men and women are reduced and simply instruments of a social system and an economy characterized, indeed dominated by deep imbalances. -- Pope Francis  Heart of the matter indeed.  -      Don't be too hard on yourself. I'm certain that Britain, Spain, and France  would have figured out how to exploit Africa, Asia and the Americas even without Portugal's good example.   [Congressional GOP candidates are cashing more checks signed by Wall Street than ever before.](http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/03/investing/election-donations-wall-street-republicans/)  I'm thinking this is not a coincidence.   Low wages are not structural, they are not inevitable  they are choices, Tom Perez, Obamas Labor Secretary, said at an AFL-CIO event last week.  If every populist, liberal or conservative, understands this, we'll start seeing real changes.    It seems to me that Obama has had at least as much 'real' job experience as Paul Ryan, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means , who is the Republican's leader on tax policy.  Check out [Ryan's job history] (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/a-look-at-paul-ryans-career-on6eh4g-165824706.html).  The one job he's had that isn't in government or politics?  He was a 'consultant' to Ryan Inc.   Every time liberals propose something that improves wage earners situations, the right wing press and politicians always argue that it will  reduce the number of jobs available or reduce their wages.        While wages and incomes have stagnated in the United States (as well as in Japan and large parts of Europe), they have not done so everywhere. In Canada, a broad measure of incomes has risen about 10 percent since 2000, even as its fallen here. In Australia, its up 30 percent  .... What are Canada and Australia doing differently? For starters, they are doing a better job with mass education. They have near-universal preschool, and they both do more to get low-income students through college. In Australia, college is free. Increasingly, the report says, a college education is similar to the high school education of the past  necessary for a prosperous life.The efforts to create a more skilled work force in Canada and Australia (as well as Sweden and some other countries) have led to better jobs  and stronger pretax income growth. Beyond education, these other countries do more to intervene in the free market on behalf of the middle class and the poor ...Middle-class stagnation is not preordained. No country has found a magic bullet, but many are doing some things better than the United States  and have the better results to show for it.  So which party in the US supports these changes to end middle class wage stagnation ? Doesn't sound like the Republican Party platform to me.     Why does anyone believe [anything](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/statements/byruling/barely-true/ )  Paul Ryan says?    His argument to his former supporters, says one who spoke with him, is that he came very close in the last election against an incumbent president with a good economy. ... (Romney ran against Obama arguing that the economy was terrible; now its health in 2012 is part of the case why he should run again.)   Can anyone explain to me why we should believe anything that comes out of Romney's mouth?  Or Paul Ryan's for that matter?      Most community colleges include 2 year programs that are aimed at specific careers, and those programs are [included in the proposal](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/01/08/president-proposes-make-community-college-free-responsible-students-2-years).  I'm not sure if it's true nationally, but every place I've lived you can leave school at 16. But we've decided to offer free education a couple years beyond the compulsory minimum, because we think it's worth doing. Adding a couple more years would probably help our economy even more.   Damn.  Just when you think you've seen the limit to hypocrisy, somebody pushes it out further.   Republicans are opposed to wealth redistribution.  Unless the direction is up.   No, I think it's more of a cultural division.  For centuries the Northeast has always been a high tax/high service approach to government and the South has taken a low tax/low service route.  You get better schools with the former approach.   The fact that he backed off with some boilerplate statements doesn't really change my mind. In the Senate we have had an [unprecedented obstructionism](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/) of Presidential nominee, which doesn't indicate that the Republicans in the Senate where bent on co-operation.   In the House we've a Representative yell "You lie" during the State of the Union Speech, and  the Republican majority used defaulting on the national debt as a negotiating tool, which is well outside the bounds of governance. I'm not arguing Obama is a saint, but again I simply don't see that where the blame is all on one side of the fence.    The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.  I don't recall any recent Democratic Congressional leader saying anything like this.  If I've missed it, please direct me to the source. Regardless, I fail to see where Obama has been any more unreasonable in his dealings with Congress than any other recent President.  And it seems to me everyone , Democratic and Republican, always complains that the failure to compromise is on the other side.   No argument with you, but unfortunately headlines tend to eliminate nuances.   What exactly has he done to alienate Congress?  And when the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal was to make Obama a one term President, why would you think all the source of conflicts are on Obama's side?    Not to mention the NorthEast provides a much better education than most the country. Why some many people can't understand the connection between wealth and income is beyond me.     That's an impressive accomplishment. I doubt I would have done nearly as well in your situation.  But I fail to see what the advantage is in charging tuition for community college, any more than to charge to go to high school.  There's a pretty good argument that "both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy" ([Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/upshot/the-roots-of-obamas-ambitious-college-plan.html). We need an educated workforce, and we should be doing every damn thing we can to make one.    [Or maybe not](http://reason.com/archives/2011/07/14/the-redblue-paradox).   Many community college students are juggling school, work and/or family responsibilities, so they may not be able to put the time in to earn top grades. At Community Colleges the 18-19  year olds attending on their parents' money are the exception.     Like most conservatives, all in favor of local control until someone passes a law they don't like.   But both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy.  Skimp on educating the young and you'll pay the price several times over. Cutting education funding is both mean spirited and short sighted.        Say something of merit or piss off  Excellent advice.  You should be following it yourself.   I'm curious.  What, specifically , makes me a Marxist?

My Reddit user name is a [company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shelbys-foot-jewelry-laguna-beach). I made it up as a play on the name of the novelist/historian [Shelby Foote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Foote).  Guess someone else had the same idea. Or someone named Shelby decided to sell toe rings.   Two questions we should ask politicians' who use this dodge. 'Since you're not an economist either, why are you offering opinions on that subject?'  and 'What other important issues are you incapable of understanding?"   Nothing wrong with that. And let's add the Blind Willie's to the list, McTell and Johnson.    Not to mention Buddy Guy, Magic Sam, Peter Green, Ry Cooder, Jimi Hendrix, Duane Allman ...    Didn't meet the standard set by George W Bush, I guess.   Scientists?  Economists?  Don't listen to them.  You only hear the truth from vote and money grubbing politicians.   One of Bin Laden's aims was to [weaken the US's economy](http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/).  Who knew a Republican Congress would work so hard to help him achieve his goal?   No, it's correct.  He just left off an adjective, it should be 'alternate reality-based scoring'.   Keep pushing and the conversation can change suddenly. Income inequality was hardly a topic before Occupy Wall Street.    If you need to tell us that something is "reality-based", it ain't.   Republican economic prescriptions have often seemed timeless in the Obama era, in a bad way.  By the way, this article is not some liberal snark, but by the executive editor of the National Review.    I believe they're sulking. Typical behavior for disappointed adolescents.

Private charity couldn't handle the needs of the poor in the U.S. for many years prior to the Great Depression.

Karl Rove defends rectal feeding ... Some jokes just write themselves.       ...dismal wage growth is not just a sad but inevitable outcome of an efficient economy. Instead, its the result of a bundle of intentional policy decisions that were made precisely to shift economic power away from low- and middle-wage workers and towards corporate owners and managers.   America - it's a low wage, high profit paradise.

Jesus, is the Wisconsin electorate really this gullible?      The author didn't include the environment in the list of winning progressive causes.  Which is probably the most important one of all.   Meanwhile Democrats, who should naturally have the upper hand in any honest fight for the increasingly populist American electorate, were too busy running away from President Obama to embrace the effective aspects of his agenda. As Andrew Sullivan wrote on Election Night, If you wonder, as I do, why Democrats never actually defend their policies or even achievements in power, and run solely on some poll-tested social issues, then your bafflement will likely only increase tonight, as mine has. The New Republics Alec MacGillis noted that in the three states that saw the biggest coverage gains under ObamacareKentucky, Arkansas and West VirginiaDemocratic Senate candidates shied away from pointing that out. And all lost badly, MacGillis tweeted.  Do you think the Democrats will ever offer the electorate a real choice?  Or are we in for more years of 'not quite as horrible as Republicans' as our alternative?      Yeah it  was pretty goddamn disappointing.  Do they really think it's not worth their while, or do they really think there is no difference?  But there's nothing else to do but keep trying to get them to show up.  (More of them will in 2016, almost assuredly. ) They'll vote more when they get older (everyone does because they realize how much politics impacts their lives), and hopefully won't turn so goddamn conservative when they age.  Or maybe something will energize them.  Minority vote was low for a long time, and now it's picked up (some places African American voting participation is higher than among whites.  I also try not to put too much blame on anyone group. A whole lot of the democratic coalition didn't show up, not just younger people.  Why working class whites never figure out they're electing their worst economic enemies and keep voting Republican, I'll never understand.  And why the Democrats don't draw the contrast between themselves and Republicans in sharp focus, I don't get either.  If they did, they might get a few more young people excited about voting for them.       In the collected tales of AE Coppard (can't find an online link), when Johnny Flynn prays 'Oh God, make him give me a penny tonight, only a penny: make him give me a penny, please God. Amen.'

I didnt know my name or where I had come from. I saw strange boxes all around me, creating shapes of things that I knew to be familiar, but with dimensions that betrayed the sense of form that was buried somewhere deep in my memory. As I wandered I became aware of the delicate nature of the world, seemingly shifting from towering hills to sprawling desert and blackest jungle on a whim.    The only constant that remained in all of this was an ever-present symbol that stayed in the center of my vision no matter where I went. It always seemed ahead of me, yet I could not believe that it was something I had envisioned. No, it was a beacon, a guide, a powerful force that showed me the one place that I could have any control over the world. It was my guardian, my protector, and my shelter. Without it I would not have survived the night and the creatures that came scratching, bellowing, shooting, and teleporting in numbers far greater than I could have guessed. I owe it my life. This symbol has given me everything, and to it I now build this monument, a cathedral to stand the testament of time.       	10

He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing. Zog landed at night in Connecticut. He had no sooner touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the terrible danger they were in.

Even when my cards seem to make no sense to me initially, after a minute I'm always able to apply them in some new way that forces me to use a different viewpoint.  I don't really believe in fortune telling, but I do believe they're a valuable psychological tool.    I have no idea why there is so much discussion on "female-condoms," they have a higher failure rate and I've only ever even SEEN one in sex-ed class.  Probably a jokeshop gag/10.    Urinating.  I can't be the only person who laughs to themselves when they nip off to have a piss.  I think it's probably only enjoyable because you get a moment alone to laugh about how much fun you're having.    Well up until that point, I'd been going to my family doctor.  At that time I weighed about 95 pounds and I'm only 4'11.5"... so my doctor would use the smallest speculum she had.  This appointment was at a Planned Parenthood a state away.  Those duckbills were fucking comparable to a damn Swingline stapler before they were even open... I'd never seen anything like them before or since.  Also, I'm not quite sure what she was doing down there, but it didn't seem to me to be business as usual.  It felt like she swabbed me (read: scratched the hell out of my cervix) at least four times.    During the worse pelvic exam of my life (I felt like my organs had been rearranged for three days after), the GYN said "Your cervix is a nice bubblegum pink color... it's beautiful!  DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?  I have a mirror!"    Like no, you crazy bitch, take that speculum out and let me slink off to cry in my car.    [The hand.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/94/6e/11946e7cde1c46bf18dd2eea7d1ad18d.jpg)   I went into some sort of minor obsession with this damn picture in which I would save it to my phone and then delete it like five times a day.  Just when I thought I'd kicked it, my mom picture mailed it to me.    [Messiah of Evil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071396/)  This is available on Amazon Prime.  I have two versions, one was included in some 50 Horror Movies compilation and the other was the directors cut.  Of the two, I like the grainy one... It's that poorly mastered version you'll find on Amazon.  Hold onnnn to lovvvve!    This re-press is actually from Germany, not the UK as was theorized in /r/vinylreleases It's pressed on 180 gram vinyl.  There are no liner notes, but it does come with a digital redemption code.  Considering the original is about $250 on discogs, this was definitely exciting for me.  I hope this helps someone! :)      Every time I re-read "Far From the Madding Crowd," I find it gets funnier.  Hardy is so prone to flowery prose that I only recently got just how often he's speaking to us with his tongue in his cheek.  This novel was never a school assignment for me, but I can definitely say after four read-throughs, I get more out of it each time. :)   I was scrolling, there were flowers and pictures of food and then all of a sudden there was dead Chris Farley.  Now I am sure that a lot of my distaste had to do with being ill-prepared for that moment, but when you see someone that you felt you knew and liked looking like that, it's a much bigger shock than some random person you never saw alive.    Nah man, I added you to my friends list.  You're pretty consistently angry sounding with a dash of sincere and well-meaning.  I mean, how often do you post on some unoriginal question some smart-ass crack about how often you've seen some variation on that question 12x today?  I think you do it on average five times a day or so.  If you don't believe me, click on your username and imagine you're reading it all for the first time.    Say the words "You're right, I was wrong."  Not to me, but you know, if someone says that and means it, especially in the workplace, it counts for an awful lot.    Well, and I was clearly wrong, but I thought so because I remembered you posting something about being a Vietnam Vet.  Now clearly that never happened, but you know, the grouchy persona doesn't help.  You're cranky like a much older man.  You're also very well written and sharp as a tack.  You don't see that too often during the early twenties... It typically comes later.    Watch it pal, you'll be my age in three short years. ;)   Do you mean "A Serbian Film?"  What the hell is a Syrian Film?  Is that about oil?    Not anymore, young'un.     What was that stupid movie about the guy trying to track down the source of some dead guy's snuff movie?  Whatever it was called, it would make a hysterical musical.  Would watch/10.   Obviously you would send them [the hand](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/94/6e/11946e7cde1c46bf18dd2eea7d1ad18d.jpg).   Are you for real?  I'm OLDER than you.  It's a good thing I admitted to running Mac OS after all.     Is it bad that my first impulse was to NOT tell you that I am running Mac OS so you wouldn't find me even less attractive?  Because it was, and I am.    When I have new updates, it slides out a little sign over my other windows, that's not the weird part... the weird part is that right in that box it asks me if I want to just never update my OS again.  I hate that window so much I almost do it every time.    This is so fucking honest it's actually heartbreaking.    My mom would always get put out if we paid too much attention to her when she first came home.  I totally know that feeling now.  Like, let me set my stuff down and take my shoes off!    Go forth!  Spread the gospel of the downstairs mixer! Ahahaha!    Goodness, do you think so?  My intention was to insinuate that you would never be so shallow to take a trait such as extreme flexibility as the biggest asset in any relationship, and the assumption was that no one who had ever snared such reluctant quarry would let him go.    If you had a girlfriend who was flexible enough to tie herself up so severely she needed medical intervention, I wonder why on earth you ever left her?  Did the novelty wear off?  Or are you insinuating she was a light-weight?    I want to hear anything you have to say to me. 3    I call my lady bits my "downstairs mixer" which is a bastardization of the "downstairs mix-up" of Old Gregg on the Mighty Boosh.    If you actually said to me that you were going to make me love you, I'd probably laugh in your face Bathsheba Everdene style.  I want a man who can tame me, but I don't actually believe that's possible.  The only way I would be upset with a man for saying such a thing would be if he was panting.  Or had broken in.  Otherwise, I'd admire his pluck.    Technically I could be a catfish who likes angry old men because I am one.  You never can tell.     I'm going to make you love me.  Anne Boleyn is my spirit animal.    I'm glad that no one disputed this is the perfect crime.   Probably because you're capable of playful DnD banter with historical references, but if a gal says "throw it in reverse for thirst" (A stupid Sprite commercial reference), you curse her to a life of celibacy.  We can't be all things to all men, sir.    Guess I failed that bluff check, should've put more into Charisma. _   Why, yes!  Yes, he was!    *shifty eyes*   /r/advice   Anne Boleyn's Cloak  +2 Diplomacy  +2 Bluff  +1 Perform   Just in case you were lying awake wondering what ever happened here, it turns out I need a new motor. Thanks for trying to help. :)   [If you Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG4mmjeunC0) by Tal Bachman.  He's just fucking strolling around all happy with his girlfriend... the song is about visiting your SO in a mental health facility after a suicide attempt, with the eventual outcome that they succeed a second attempt.  What the hell record company?!    That was pretty hostile, man.  You don't have to call me a dick.  An alternative would be to educate me.  Novel, huh?   Jeremiah Johnson:  Goes to mountains, family dies, kills a ton of Indians, gives up.    I'm not a dad, but I am a mother to a seven month old daughter.  My husband had no prior experience with babies, in fact, the extent of his interaction was to hold his niece one time for about three minutes.  But he is the most wonderful father I've ever seen in real life.  He is always asking me to show him things and explain them and then he just runs with it.  He's more patient than I am, he takes photos constantly, and he brags about her to anyone who will listen despite being shy to the point of never speaking in most situations.    The fact that you're worried just goes to show that you're going to do a wonderful job.  If you were a bad father, you wouldn't care.  Congratulations, daddy!    If they were a toddler, I wouldn't even hesitate.    Okay, now I have to ask... I've seen you around, and I've typed this question to you three times and deleted it each time... Is your username a reference to the Stephen King short story?  I think it was called "Strawberry Spring...?"   Did you just guilt gilt me?  I mean, I'm like, super excited, but wow!  You didn't have to do that. 3   Warren Zevon.   Absolutely! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A.  Edit: Sorry, use this one, more to the point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._(song)   No, it's really not!!!! It's about how we mistreat Vietnam vets!  You guys!   I think you need to rethink this... maybe read the lyrics once.    elliptical    A sports talk radio station (or as I like to call it, AM Radio Lite), I don't really watch television, but maybe the Discovery Channel?  As I understand it it has a lot of variety these days.  The artist would be Ryan Adams or Neil Young.  Both are so prolific I can't imagine getting sick of them or not having new stuff to listen to several times a year.    "Oh my god, Whatever, Etc."   It's not too complicated, you just mix a bit of olive brine in with your cream cheese and add sliced green olives. :)  I don't put anything else on there, but some folks like a little mayo.    When I sneeze, I say "bless you" to myself.  It's important to also be polite... so I thank myself too.    *Sneeze* "Bless you.  Thank you."   Cream Cheese and Olives!    I'd say my mother in law, but the truth is that I only think about drinking... I don't need to give her another reason to subversively criticize me in front of my spouse. :-/   Copy-Paste from another comment I left, I think it applies here too:   I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys. Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process.   Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified.   I didn't actually have any sort of conversation about this, I was just being awkward to amuse myself.    I'm not trying to be a contrarian, but "separation of church and state" is not part of the first amendment.  It was the causation for the meeting as noted in a letter by Thomas Jefferson that resulted in the drafting of the first amendment.  The phrase never made it in, it's not nearly so explicit.    High Fructose Corn Syrup   Right, he's either making an in poor taste joke about god topping or he's saying we're all supposed to be a unified and invested in each others' happiness... without clarification, there's no way we can answer...    Josephine - The Wallflowers - 506 plays.  :-/   THANK YOU.... Now I'll be able to sleep tonight.  You're the best! :)   Look, full disclosure, I don't even get the joke I made.  I have no fucking idea what is going on today and how June 3rd is related to the PS4 or any other damn thing.... but I think I might have answered one of those questions seriously... it was vague, like "It's June 2014, what are you mad about?"     This doesn't bother me in the least, it's that the people I love will stop existing.  You never know another person completely, so when they die, all those things and all that potential dies too.  You're not going to care when you are dead, you will be dead.    Well, I should clarify, I guess... I'm not actually against bonsai, I was just pointing out that a lot of people thing it's something it's not, namely miniature trees.  They are full sized trees that have been manipulated.  I was just joking with that suave /u/satnavtomington  Do what you will! :)    Don't speak to me, tree mutilator.  AT WHAT COST, I ask you?   How has your life changed since June 3rd, 2014?   A bonsai tree is essentially tree torture.  Dwarf trees are pretty much a myth.  You just hack a normal tree half to death and then manipulate it if it survives.  If you want to learn about building a hobbit house, google "fairy gardens."   Yeah, absolutely.  Love is respect is a fucking cliche.  While you probably have both love and respect for people most of the time, you can absolutely love people you don't respect.  People who are lazy or victims or whatever.     Kind of lame.  I mean, I'm sure it depends on who you're with, but my particular fwb wasn't at all invested in making things awesome for both of us, only him...Thank god I come easily.  He also seemed to think I was at risk of falling in love with him at any given time, so he went to a lot of effort to talk about his ex-girlfriend.  Seriously man, I just want to get laid, I don't need to write a book on your ex.  That's not what I'm here for.  I have no idea what the hell he was worried about, I don't know a damn thing about him save for what he studied at school and the stuff he told me about Dana.    Obsessively read about this forthcoming thing.  Like the Jawbone UP3... I pre-ordered the damn thing back in November.  I googled it daily.  :( for those in the know.     The Late Night Grumbler is right... the last time I saw this, I threw it in reverse for thirst.    I just want to put this out there: I'm almost 30, and I'm more intelligent than my mother, but I'm still not willing to best her in any way, shape, or form, because she was so successful in ingraining me with respect.  There have been things that she has said to me that I know in my heart aren't true, but I still grapple with because she was the one who said them.  I truly believe that your parents are the closest thing to a God you will find on this earth.    I absolutely think at my age I should be held accountable... but prior to 23 when your brain is done maturing?  I'm not so sure about that.      100%.  Being a man in a man's world would be amazing.  I have a whole list of things I would do.     And where were you when I was 21?!?!   It was actually because her husband had very bad insomnia and had to get up at 4:00am.  It didn't really bother me, I still had a choice in the matter, you know?  It just tried my ingenuity from time to time. ;)   Two songs:  [Fred Jones Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJDaKDpva2c) by Ben Folds Five  [It's a Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJNB8fXje3I)  by Neil Young  For the same reason, they're about how we're all shuttling on towards irrelevancy/death.     When I graduated from high school, I immediately moved out of state.  I came back two years later and lived at home for the summer before I started college and lived on campus.  During that summer, my mom had a rule that I needed to be in by 10pm or out until after 4am.  All my friends would go to sleep by bar close, so I spent a lot of time sleeping in the back seat of my car in the driveway or going to the casino or walking around Wal-Mart.    Man, this only applies to those of you not struggling with an existential crisis.  I WISH it was a matter of putting out or making food, that would make life very easy.      GREAT QUESTION.  My favorite dead word is "Ready-Made."  These days, it is much more common to smoke a "ready-made" cigarette than it is to roll your own, so no one points out that what they're offering is a ready-made, that would be redundant!     While you might be right technically, your contribution assumes that you want these rights.  As a married person, I can tell you that the tax differential is negligible at best.  You just need to do your paperwork.  If you have a Will and a DNR worked up, you don't need a marriage to ensure your SO is taken care of or has a say in when to pull the plug.  As for parenthood, I'm 100% sure you can find more women who want to have babies than you can men.      I'm totally confused by this question.  Like, not to be a smartass, but there is no logical reason for a non-religious man to marry in these United States.  The way I see it, it is the men who want to get married that are in demand, not the other way around.  Sex in the City confirms this suspicion.    Confession: If I had a penis, I'd never even date exclusively.  What would be the point?    Nothing that can help your girlfriend, just things to help potential victims.  Post on your local Craigslist about what happened, put out a PSA on your Facebook, that kind of thing.  A lot of the people who are responding to this don't have a lot of money so they are desperate to believe they can live in a nice home with low rent.  The game is to steal identities, not money.     I had this total asshole of a boyfriend in my younger years who wore a specific cologne.    Our new training assistant wears the same one.  I have to make a conscious effort stop myself from being short and rude with him.  I never talk to him for more than two minutes if I can avoid it.      I have a bit of experience with this kind of thing, and I have to tell you that in all likelihood, this person isn't based out of the US, you would probably be wasting your money.  The guy I was dealing with was working out of Nigeria.  This is the 2015 version of those e-mails we used to get in 2003.   Ryan Adams.  Even when he's being a total dick for no reason, there is a hilarious wit in his way of insulting people.  This morning I laughed until I cried reading what he had to say about Jack White's role in Cold Mountain.     Well, I've heard it said that your same-sex parent will set you straight and hold you accountable, while your opposite-sex parent will believe you can do anything and that you're the greatest thing ever.  I would imagine if I'd had a father (not my father, he was an addict and died when I was 12, but you know, a normal one) I wouldn't constantly be grappling with the self-doubt I got from my mom always telling me I'm wrong or that I'm confused or that I'm bringing things on myself.  I'm grateful she did, because I'm very successful and I have a strong sense of right and wrong, but I wonder what I would have been like if it had been tempered with a little of that blind faith that I'm amazing.    Well, the tallest thing was this derelict ski jump.  That thing was so tall when you looked down, you couldn't make out the faces of the people on the ground.  It also swayed in the wind and was cold as fuck up there.  The craziest thing isn't so crazy if someone hadn't seen us and called the 5-0, so we had to hide up there for the better part of an hour, lying down, trying not to giggle.  We used one of those round cement smoking waste things to climb up a lower overhang on a hockey shelter and from there managed to get up on the roof.    Look, I know this isn't anything special or original or really anything else, but any time someone sarcastically or seriously posts "You're the hero reddit needs" or "You're the hero reddit deserves," I usually start crying for laughing so hard.  I've upvoted that damn movie reverence all 23 times I've come across it.    I had to tell my 17 year old cousin that his mother had committed suicide over the phone.  He reacted with shock, saying something to the effect of "Nuh-uh...."  He went quiet for a bit and then asked me how it had happened.    You just don't know how you're going to react.  I had spent almost a day trying to find his contact information, I found it and made the phone call and the moment he answered, I started shaking uncontrollably.      Heck yeah, get up and GO!  If I were a man, that's exactly what I'd be doing!  The truth is that you're a smart and talented individual who has drive and self-confidence.  When that is who you are, you will always land on your feet.  On you deathbed, I highly doubt you'll look back and say to yourself "Man I'm glad I never followed through on traveling more."  Go out and have fun for the both of us! :)   Don't panic!  You're troubles are probably 100% related to nerves.  Think about it like those couples who can't have babies.  They go to the doctor thinking there is something seriously wrong with them, but the truth is that they're both fine.  They just want to have a child so badly that their bodies are resisting due to stress.  It's probably just the same here.  You said you needed advice on what to do and what to say.  Here's what to do: practice being present.  Tonight in your room try meditating.  Sit down, close your eyes, focus on relaxing your whole body starting with your feet and moving up.  Tune out everything, all your thoughts, all the noise in your house, just feel what it is like to be in your body.  Notice everything, but focus and think about nothing.  I'm sure you've been having racing thoughts while you're with your girlfriend, the point is to practice in a low pressure place how to be in the moment.  Here's what to say: She's probably going to be hurt no matter what you say to her.  Go to the extra effort to tell her how sexy you find her and if she wants to talk about your troubles, I'd try to make it out that you're just so worried that something will go wrong you're sabotaging yourself.    Good luck, I hope things work out better for you... just try not to worry, okay?  I'm sure there is nothing wrong with you.    	101
 So you can spend the whole game ganking Miss Fortune bot, right?   I agree, its the only limited edition skin i have (regret not buying bewitching Nidalee.). At first i was worried that this skin would be better and i would have to buy i it, but from the looks of the splash art my wallet is safe.   Maokai mid, good burst with his combo and his saplings are a 100% ap ratio if you hit with both parts of it, and if you go against karthus your passive will be up a lot. Cho'gath is another good mid because i believe rupture is also 100% ap, and feast is good burst when part of q w combo.  	3
 Alternative title: How to Piss Off r/baseball in 5 Steps   In a playoff game too! Is this the same Clayton Kershaw?    I'll always remember him as the promising young second baseman for the Yankees. I'm 22 now and some of the players who broke into the league when I started following baseball are starting to retire. It's an odd feeling. Kind of like I'm losing a part of my childhood.    I just bought a slow cooker and have been using it a lot. I'll share my most successful recipes. Here's the buffalo chicken I made tonight.   Chicken breasts (I used a little more than a pound and a half)  One bottle of buffalo wing sauce  One pack of dry ranch dressing mix   Put the chicken in the slow cooker, pour the bottle of buffalo wing sauce on the chicken and then sprinkle the ranch mix on top. Cook on high for 4-5 hours, then shred with a fork.   Next time I make this, I'll probably use less buffalo wing sauce, maybe 3/4 of a bottle.    I've never used a pressure cooker, so I don't know.   I used a pound and a half, but more would have worked fine with the same amount of beer.   I put chicken breasts, a can of beer and some spices in my crock pot on low for 7-8 hours. That way I can shred it and save some for future meals. I made burritos with chicken, beans and cheese. Just wrap them in foil and put them in the fridge or freeze them.     Give /r/gainitmeals or even /r/gainit a look. They're going to be high calorie meals because they're designed for people trying to gain weight, but people in those subreddits love meals that can be cooked in bulk and eaten later.   Get a slow cooker. You can get them at thrift stores for cheap. If you get a big one, you can prepare a week's worth of meat at once.   I'm trying to prepare meals in advance and I also just bought a slow cooker. Yesterday I made chicken breasts and put them in burritos. It was delicious, so I wanted to share the recipe.   Place chicken breasts in slow cooker.  Add one 12 oz bottle of beer. I used Stella, but anything should work.  1/2 tsp of paprika  1/2 tsp of basil  1/2 tsp of garlic powder  1/2 tsp of salt  1/2 tsp if black pepper   Cook it on low for 7-8 hours and then use a fork to shred it. From there, you can do all kinds of stuff with it. I just made burritos with beans and cheese.   If you're like me, simplicity is the most important thing in a recipe. If something takes more than a handful of ingredients, I'm not going to make it. You could easily do this with just beer and chicken.    Are those the originals or reprints?    CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NL WEST CHAMPION LOS ANGELES DODGERS!   2014 is the sweetest. I've never felt as sick after a game as I did last night. That low made this high all the sweeter.    Dynasty!   Never seen him look even slightly interested in anything.   He's good and all, but he's no Bumgarner.   Someone turned the pitching sliders all the way up sometime in the 4th inning.   If my first kid is a boy, I'm naming him Madison. If it's a girl, I'll also name her Madison.    A good ol' fashioned pitchers duel with neither starter finishing the 4th inning.   George Brett finally getting around to reading Game of Thrones.    Ya know, I'll be fine with KC scoring one run for the rest of the season.   To be fair, the Giants' DP *was* spectacular.   In that commercial, there are 5 guys and one 6 pack of beer. No way that dude couldn't have driven home.   This has been the only competitive series this postseason.   Post history. You're one of the few r/Dodgers subscribers that I recognize by username.    I never thought I'd see the day when you, of all people, would be the voice of reason.   Clerks?    Time for Hudson to pitch the game of his life and ride off into the sunset with one of the greatest farewells ever.    I've never been this nervous for a game before.    Dude, that'd be gay.   When I read it, I imagined who I would cast in a movie version. Woland would be played by Johnny Depp in a combination of Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka. Ivan would be a young Matt Damon.    It's only the 5th inning and I've already gone through the stages of grief.    At this point, I'm just hoping the Royals shoot their wad tonight and have nothing left for tomorrow.    Where was she during the last 29 years!   7 days old? She wasn't even alive when this series started. What a bandwagoner!    I'm back in nor cal now, but I went to school in San Diego and went to a lot of Padres games. Usually when they played SF, but not always.    Seriously! He just hops on the hot player and goes to town. It's like rubbing salt in my wounds.   Ryan needs to help move that fridge.   Panik is the first evolution of Tyler Colvin.    It all started with a one out walk...   I'm curious about previous winners of this. Is it a good indicator of a team's future success?    EBay for things that can be easily shipped. Craigslist for large items.   I'm super happy for Juan Perez. Erin Andrews was reporting that he was crying in the dugout after hearing the news about Oscar Taveras. Huge moment for him.   That's what happens when I eat Taco Bell.   DAE Bumgarner???   I should become a professional baseball player...   THAT'S THROWING LIKE A GIRL!   Kershaw better be taking notes at home.   Perez and Taveras are both Dominican. They were probably team mates at one point.   I just read Moneyball and he mentions players watching film of earlier at bats midgame. It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in the tunnel who told them or if someone checked their cellphone.      How much contact with the outside world do players have during the game? Would they know about Taveras yet?    They've had interviews every game this postseason.    Seriously, why can't he just smoke pot like a normal kid?   I'm sure they do by now.   Confirmed by whom?   In an earlier thread someone said Steve Perry probably has no friends and only comes to games to get high fives from strangers. I still laugh when I think of that.   THAT'S THROWING LIKE A GIRL!   I never thought I would say it, but I'd go with Strickland here. That means he probably won't pitch tomorrow.   I was feeling so down a few innings ago. Now I'm feeling on top of the world. Baseball will do that.   ...he's not   They either get super cocky or annoyingly fake humble.    DAE BIG 4???   Why stop at 2010???   0 rings since '89 is why we mock you.   I've had that feeling for 2 1/2 games.   Is anyone else annoyed by how Mo'ne Davis gets so much louder when she says, "That's throwing like a girl!"   Cain saved 90 feet there.   It's raining so hard my satellite signal is out.   ...and a(t least one) World Series ring.   It's a difficult game to win if you can't pitch or hit.    That's probably the last time we'll see Vogey pitch, at least in a Giants uniform. He had some great moments here.   That's what speed do!   Blanco has really stepped up in Pagan's absence, especially in this series. He's been getting on base and playing great defense.    The suspect is Marcelo Marquez, b. July 20, 1980.   The search seems to be narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents are not allowed to return to their homes. SWAT teams are searching homes.   This is right by my house and I went to high school at Placer, so I know the area well. The neighborhood behind the school has narrow streets with a lot of trees. It would be very hard to spot a suspect from a helicopter. Past the homes is the American River Canyon. This is really rocky terrain that would be difficult to maneuver quickly. However, large portions of the area do not have trees due to the once planned construction of a dam. If he wanders into this area, it would be game over. Crossing the river would be nearly impossible without being spotted by one of the helicopters.    Same here. Police blocked of an intersection right by my house.   Well, what happened?    Definitely northern California.   One officer, Danny Oliver, is confirmed dead.    The search seems to be narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents are not being allowed to enter the area.   The search is focusing on Auburn, CA between I-80 and the American River Canyon. Road blocks are set up all over town. All Auburn schools are on lockdown.  Update: Carjacked vehicle reportedly recovered on Riverview Drive in Auburn. Residents reporting gunfire. This is several miles away from the high school, but very close to an elementary school. 2 suspects believed to be on foot.    Update: One female suspect in custody. Second male suspect still at large.    I live in Auburn very close to where the police are searching. I'm on high alert right now.

I'm looking out the window half expecting to see the suspect.    Brothers, I come to you in a fit of rage. I had heard the fables, but until this morning I had never personally encountered a gains thief.     I was doing warm up sets of deadlifts, hopefully working up to a new PR. When I sat down to rest between sets, some jerk comes up, doesn't say a word to me, and takes over my barbell. I'm sitting just a few feet away when this gains hog thinks he can just overtake my setup. He was pretty big, built more like a powerlifter with significant body fat, but also very strong. I was dumbfounded. So speechless I couldn't even stand up for myself. I just sat there, mouth agape and watched as this guy took the gains that rightfully belonged to me. I managed to take a picture of the guy. Hopefully he sees this and realize what a punk he is.    http://imgur.com/HMLmOQe   The trash talk is between KC/BAL and SF/LA.   Timmy will always be a lot of fans' favorite Giant. Not just because of what he did from 09-11 or in the 2012 playoffs, although that certainly helps, but because of his attitude. He's never complained about being sent to the bullpen or not getting enough work. He just works and pitches when he's needed.    [My gamer dog is not enjoying this one](http://imgur.com/RVVnBKi)   I've never seen a player who has struggled on the field yet be so loved by the fans as Timmy is.    Lincecum like "that's how you pitch in the post season, Clayton."   I still have to get a lifting session in tonight. Looks like I'll have some anger to get out.    Strickland is just garbage.   Maybe the Dodgers should build a better team then.   Dodger tears are not PEDs.    Catcher    *Boorrrn free*   I'm still trying to find a tasty one. I put olive oil and seasoning on the chicken and bake it @ 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. For the rice I just use a rice cooker and add a little soy sauce.    $5 pizza night. Only works on mediums.    I don't think Yogi left a lane for the runner.   Poop is gains leaving the body. I don't bother.    I'm celebrating with [3 pounds of chicken, 3 cups of brown rice, 3 medium pizzas]( http://imgur.com/J3zU4Um) and leg day (not pictured). May the gains be ever in our favor.   This is probably a stupid question, but I'm clueless in the kitchen. Do you put anything else in there with it or just plop 5 pounds of chicken in there and turn it on?    I have about 3 pounds of chicken that I need to cook and I'm wondering what the best way to do that are. In the past I've baked it and I've also experimented with grilling. Do you have a preferred way of cooking chicken?   Edit: I'll contribute an answer to my own question. I just baked 3 pounds worth at 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. I put a little bit of olive oil and seasoning on as well. It's pretty tasty when mixed with rice.    Who at the KC Star rejected "A Giant Disappointment"?   Prime Lincecum?    I feel like Hosmer was the kid in high school who was more popular than you, better at sports than you and got better grades than you, but you still like him.    Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^goodnight   I gotta stay, the Giants fans in this thread are super annoying.   I know. Getting excited after a homerun in the WS? Sheesh...    Let's not compare Bumgarner to God. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Madison Bumgarner.   	108
 If he's over 80, I think he's allowed to do that.   I thought the same thing during the theater scenes in Inglourious Basterds.   It made me realize how McCarthy-esque the whole series has been.   These interviewers sound like huge douchebags too. Apparently they only asked sex-related questions and ignored her music.     Oldboy   Burn After Reading is the best movie about nothing. And almost everyone dies.   Everything Wes Anderson.   Is the black guy the one that played Tracy's son that was older than him in 30 Rock?   I bet Jonah Hill's having a nice weekend.    Phoenix did an incredible job, but he's also been very verbally against the Oscars, which probably doesn't help his chances with the Academy.   RocknRolla, IIRC.   Carrell won't win. I doubt he'll be nominated. but even if he was, it'd be for best supporting actor, right?   Yes.   Uh...yeah, that's okay. I guess.    I....I can't tell if you're joking.   ....   Might wanna NSFW this.   I'd say it's pretty out of sight.   Don't be such a faggot   Note to Self: "Mantis Cannibalism" - Possible band name   Or that time he was a contestant on the dating game.  ^^^that ^^^one's ^^^obscure ^^^as ^^^fuck   You won't regret it. There isn't a flawed performance in that movie.   RUFIO - RUFIO - ROOF - E - NO NO nonononononono   I got an early screener   Eh. Leave it.    Thank god. The pilot was atrocious. I watched it completely shocked anything that bad could've come from someone as brilliant as Mulaney.    Lets Play: Is It Racist?   Dude, Funny Games. How has no one said this yet? If you're cool with subtitles, go for the original, not the remake.   ...aaaand now he's listening to Katy Perry and fondling himself.   Finally, a crouch button.   Overlooked, not underrated. I believe it's on IMDb's top 250.   Phoenix - A$AP Rocky   i thought so too, but damn that picture makes it uncanny.   Anyone wanting to see one of the most amazing performances of last year (or 2012 depending on location) should see *The Hunt*. Mads Mikkelson is incredible in it.   Actually Kevin Smith just lost a shit ton of weight. He looks great.   That was great.   I'm trying not to judge, but I just don't get how you can think that.   What happens if you punch the shit out of a gypsy who tries to pickpocket you as a tourist?   Oh shit.   S/O to YMS.   Watch out, Ferret. You might get hit.   Cool. I don't care about my notoriety, so I am now Hitman Pearce. Fear me.   thx   Does "her" count? I think "her" counts.    I dont know how much time you spent writing that, but it was too much.   It doesn't on PS4   Art.      That's a few episodes of *Legit*. You should watch that show. Funny as shit and surprisingly touching.   i think so, as far as dark comedies go. It's hilarious. And super meta if you're into that.   Death At A Funeral, Fargo, Payback: Straight Up, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Man Bites Dog, and Three Kings are all dark comedies with the theme of death. Happiness is the darkest of dark comedies.   Ehh. Not really a comedy.   To be fair the original Saw was pretty good as a standalone horror flick. Once the original writers (who are doing this movie) left, the franchise turned into torture porn.   You should watch the movie *Downfall*. It's a German film about the fall of Hitler. It affected me in the same vein as this image, but 100x more potently.   I've always considered Casino Royale far superior.   I feel ya. It felt like an extended YouTube action short.   That was fucking cool. Hey OP, how drastically does your Reputation meter change? Can one lengthy police encounter seriously affect it?   The NPC's behavior in this is impressive. People getting their picture taken, checking their shoes for gum, scurrying in the rain without an umbrella, having realistic conversations and phone calls, all with just the right amount of population and street traffic.   People who have it already, how repetitive is NPC behavior? And does their number increase and decrease with location and time of day?   No   The hair over the mask is the icing on the cake.   /r/ShitCosmoSays   Also just don't watch it if you have a penis.   Speaking of Cop AI, how is the wanted system? I hate to continue with the comparison, but is it similar to the GTA 5 star system?   You have really unique handwriting. I like it.   How's that inbox?   He does a stellar job in "The Hunt" as well. That movie is too damn tragic.    YMS did a great job explaining why he thinks it's a shitty horror film. I agree.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4-z-sbLOo   That's actually someone's remix of the final product.      I love The Veldt.   Although to be fair, that would make more sense in this game on account of ctOS and all.   Holy shit.   Why   I hope they can get some real talent involved.    Autonomous Meridian Response Syndrome   Basically it's a community of content creators who make videos of sounds that give people a non-sexual tingling sensation (similar to goosebumps, I guess). However, one of the most common an popular "triggers" of these tingles is an up-close whisper, which causes quite a few creepy comments on YouTube videos of girls attempting to help people relax.

          so you don't like British humour then, do you?   "I'm going to fucking murder your ass."   True. Mexico is also more obese than y'all.

Edit: heres  [$100$] now answer me, guy   caught ya whackin', eh?   It's hardly a binge if you're doing them 1 a day ;)   Yes, that's true. People respond to incentives. But, a worker is going to resent a boss who is mean and therefore put in less effort, meaning said employer will not benefit. A, maybe overly, kind employer will be well liked and workers will be more willing to put in effort, both parties benefit.  See Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People   If he is a good employer, he'll give you a raise or a bonus or something. Employers that treat their employees like shit get shit employees as a result.   arm chair gynecologist, back to /r/theredpill with you...   This has nothing to do with gender, I never disclosed mine   am not who you directed it towards, you'll need to write up a unique diagnosis for me, Bartlett   you're obviously not socially awkward then, that's the point i'm making. who told you you were socially awkward? also don't call me names, this is a civil debate   arm chair psychiatrist    same thing    some girls are attracted to socially awkward guys, just like some guys are attracted to socially awkward girls.  You're thinking of "quirky" people, not socially awkward people. The two often get confused.

 Tell the owner to go fuck himself.   Add Salazar above all else   Yeah there's plenty: Salazar, Hughes, McCarthy all solid. Pick up Tajiuan walker before tonight's game in case he goes lights out and there's a frenzy for him- you can always drop him if he sucks again. Keep an eye on Hutchinson for when he turns things around this season.   Yeah the imgur link you posted dosnt work.   I think he can, he's talented, and has power to hit 30 bombs. Problem for me isn't with him but with the brewers. The lineup just doesn't have a lot going on, without protection I can't see him succeeding. It says you're in an 8 team league, if that's what this is in reference to there's no way I'd roster him.   Then we're like-minded individuals. The name still carries cache though and there's plenty of ignorant owners that would deal for him thinking he's a good buy-low.   Sure, I'd take it   Hellll yes. Mets have a great rotation this year going to have many more save opportunities.   I think there's still trade value in Latos. He's in for a bad year, sooner you deal him the better.   I'd rather have the Edwin side. Edwincano and colegray. You'd def be upgrading over granderson, but overall I wouldn't do it.   Relax. Maybe check out r/meditation. Seriously differing opinions about this shouldn't get you so worked up.   See my above response to the exact same question you asked. I came to my conclusion using projections, I'm not claiming to be a fortune teller, just offering my opinions. If you "don't see valid reasoning", than by all means pick him up.   Projections I'm looking at have a line of 61/12/44/.287/6.  Assuming OP is in a league with 12 or less teams, he'll easily be able to find someone comparable if not better. Russell could turn out to be great, but it's his rookie year, right now he's just a hot name.   Owner A wasn't on top of his shit. It's not like this is a blockbuster trade. I agree it's unfortunate but vetoing anything outside of collusion is just babying the owners.   More than two weeks. See what sabermetric sites like fangraphs say about their success. Usually a pretty good indicator if their getting lucky or not. I don't know what Volquez's peripherals are like this season, but given how he's been pretty much every season before this, he's due for massive regression. Every year he starts out hot, gets a lot of Ks, everyone points to that one good year he had, mostly he just has a great baseball name. But the implosion is inevitable. I'd sell high, but who knows, maybe he'll live up to the name this year.   Knew about 1st base, but wasn't aware of LF. That'd be pretty huge, though I can still see him being benched against righties.    No. At Russell's best this year he'll pretty much be even with Elvis. Drop someone else for Russell    Yesssssir   Points league? Send him to the gallows!   Unless Rosario became an outfielder last night this pretty much has no effect on him   I don't think Crawford's turning anything around, and he's likely going to be platooning all season, dodgers have a notoriously crowded outfield. I'd rather have Davis in the OF spot. What other OFs are available?   It's not that bad, some people are super high on Wacha this year. Vetoing should only be used for collusion.   Chris Heston. That start at Colorado this week? He's gonna get clobbered. Plus Shoemaker will probably still turn things around    Not really. Volquez is pretty awful, and Russell isn't better than anyone you can get off waivers. You're essentially trading Trout for Stanton straight up. I'm sure there's some people that like Stanton more than Trout this year, and if that's you're thing than go for it, but otherwise he's just throwing trade fodder at you.   Trade   He's a mediocre player that moved to a completely deflated offense in the NL, no reason to own him in a mixed league with 12 or less owners   It's an illness, probably has diarrhea   Nope   Bingo!   Yes!!! Thank you!      Dude 100%   Scooter looks terrible and batting 8th in an NL lineup is a death sentence    Would rather have Ross 100%   Buy buy buy   Signed in just so I could say how insane this is.  C'mon don't play dumb, might as well slap the other owner across the face.   Taijuan Walker, Jason Heyward   Start him   Fielder in a heartbeat   Don't do it. You've potentially got a top 5 1st basemen for the next three years that's not something you give up. Felix is great don't get me wrong, but as a general rule of thumb pitching is way deeper than hitting and easier to replace.   You're right. Since I made the post I looked up some analysis on him, turns out I'm severely underrating him.   I'd rather have Grilli. Cishek isn't very good and neither are miami's pitchers.   That's because you probably have a lot of experienced owners that have the long-term baseball mindset in place. Peeps get cold feet pretty quickly always worth capitalizing on it.   Tough choice.  Walker certainly has more security, there's no chance of him losing the job. That being said, I'd probably go Travis simply because he's in such a superior offense.   He'll definitely keep the starting job if he keeps performing like this. 2B is pretty horrible this year, and travis is in the perfect offense to succeed. Start googling him there's been a good amount of posts written on him. Optimistic he may be moved to the 2 hole, which would mean Bautista, Edwin and Donaldson would all be batting behind him. He's probably in the best position to succeed out of everyone at 2nd base  Edit: grammar.   Mind posting who's on your roster? You could probably get some opinions on who to add/drop/trade. Not that you have to act on anyone's advice but it may be helpful just seeing the type of logic people use when evaluating these players.  Best advice? Follow some fantasy baseball blogs. Should only take 10 minutes out of your morning just reading recaps of the night before. Great way to get used to the lingo, stay on top of current player trends. (Razzball.com is my favorite. Great analysis but also funny/well written).  For deeper analysis check out fangraphs.com. Take some time and search each of the guys on your team on their site, and usually there will be some current articles where they're mentioned. Great way to get to know the players on your team and get a gauge on what your expectations can be.  Good fortune!   EovaldiGallardoLewisJimenez.  Opinions on these guys are gonna vary quite a bit. My suggestion, look up some fangraphs articles on them and just roll with the two that seem most intriguing to you.   No benches   I'd make a big effort toward trading him, maybe package him in a deal. The name carries too much cache to just drop.   Tomas isn't going to start and Oakland historically keeps guys in the lineup who are producing    Canha is playing everyday in the 2 hole and mashing- totally worth riding the wave and seeing what he's made of. As long as he's hitting the A's will play him. Not only is Tomas a bit question mark but the diamondbacks manager came out and said they're using him as a bench player. Let someone else waste a roster space on Tomas   100% take him. 20 team league? He still most likely WILL break out his season, plus his next two starts are against bad offenses.   I'm starting him. And honestly expecting him to get lit up. At the end of the day it's a game and it's worth tossing the dice on guys you believe in. That's my rationalization anyway    Wow...you're my Santa today ak759   http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/trying-to-solve-the-alex-guerrero-problem/  This gives a pretty comprehensive explanation of the situation. It's unfortunate because if he was on any other team he'd be playing every day, the dodgers simply have too many talented players.   The reason to be optimistic is that these guys are going to get injured as the season goes on, and there will be more opportunities for mattingly to squeeze him into the lineup.    Can't drop anyone else for segura? SS is pretty thin I'm sure you could find an owner that would want to trade for Andrus.    As much as I love segura this year I think you may be jumping the gun. Didn't Andrus have a homerun and steal last night?   Yeah unless you could somehow trade him I'd say he's definitely worth a drop.  No love for Pujols? He's at great value this year   There's no leash, this guy shouldn't be owned in the first place.   Think about how great you'll feel if he kills it? Risky move but nothing feels better than taking a chance and having it pay off.   Yikes, apologies for giving you a thoughtful response.  The most I would give up on my team is Melky Cabrera. That being said, it's an utterly arbitrary question considering how subjective each owner is in evaluating players.   This early in the season it's kind of hard to value guys, and an unfortunate consequence of that I find is that you can only really value them on the round they were drafted (as far as having a good shot of making an even trade). Let's say for arguments sake Tanaka got taken in round 6 of your draft; scope around who you drafted in rounds 5-8...if it's anyone you're willing to part with that the tanaka owner might want, give it a shot.  I realize you're asking for a specific list of players, it's just too broad a question for me to answer without knowing the context of the league/teams/scoring.   Relax it's two weeks in, just bench him. Some guys take a while to get in the groove when playing for a new team.   1) stop panicking he's had two starts.  2) drop him? Are you kidding me? Trade the guy if you don't want him. If you drop him you will be deservingly the laughingstock of your league.  3) pick up Archie Bradley just drop someone else   Definitely worth holding on. He'll be in the rotation in the next month or 2.  	64

 I am a little worried about the balance = weight variation.  I guess I could go on and off of it a few times to get an average?   Very cool, thank you for your input :)  My old scale showed body fat % but I like how aria shows lean body mass.  I'm lazy about it too.  Although I log my weight daily, I don't log all the other numbers.     Thank you for your reply!

I've been using FitBit since launch and love it.  I've been looking at getting FitBit's Aria but wanted to know how you guys liked it.  How accurate do you think the scale is in general?  I had a scale once that would change the weight every time I got off and back on... ehh.. lol.   How accurate does it measure the body fat % + lean mass%?  Any help would be appreciated :D   Kale chips are so delicious! But.. I find that I get digestive problems if I eat too many.

I'll order almost anything on the menu if it had aioli I'm it.  Dipping fries in it is like heavennnnn   Aioli!     I love this idea and the look of it.  My concern is that the swinging opening cover won't be completely spill proof and must be kept upright.  I would love to be able to put it into my bag like a thermos.   Thank you so much!  Yeah Mango (cat) is Neo's big brother.     Tell me about it.  I gave him 10-15 treats and then had to move him off so that I could close the treat bag lol   Thank you!  This was actually part 2 of the gifts I received from my SS.  I posted everything here. http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/sharknado-house-pic-heavy/      It looks like it's quite the workout.   Um... Why is he fisting the male elephant?  I'm so confused...  Is he stimulating the elephant's prostate?   o.O   No matter what you do the rest of your life, you'll always be trash.  Go Lois   Awww look at that face :)   Because usually, they aren't kept clean.  I do think that for most people, long nails = feminine.  For me.. it's the cleanliness factor.  Applies to both men and women.   " Santa " wrote me a note with our post-it.  Then I noticed that his handwriting looked like my Dad's.  7 year old me did some interrogating and came to the conclusion that Santa was fake!   Awww her paws....too cute   A strong, reliable, and clean toilet.  The horrors you see when you travel.  Eek edited for bad grammar   The little mermaid!  Just watched it again recently and the ending still made me cry.   Having someone enjoy something I've made or food I've cooked.  Amazing feeling :)   I'm a good listener and can make people feel comfortable around me very quickly.     Deep breathing.  I start to take longer and slower breaths.  Dark curtains help a lot too.   Try using Tend Skin after you shave.  Also make sure you gently exfoliate the area as the hair grows out.  If you have really curly pubes it might be harder to get rid of bumps :( Try using Magic shave on it instead of a razor!  The silver sensitive can works quite well.  	41
 As someone who is dyslexic this is amazing   This is amazing you should also post in r/woodworking   I teach high school history and I have gotten some great simulations off of tpt. To me it is worth it to pay three dollars than to spend hours creating all the things I would need. But sometimes I just browse it for ideas, and don't buy anything.   So I should preface this with the fact that I taught the civil rights movement all week, but I had a dream that Malcolm X broke into my house to rape me , but I was totally into him so we had consensual sex and then I made him pancakes and we talked about environmental protection.   I love that I work with people who are intelligent and able to have an open debate and not get emotional or take statements personally. I love that I teach 155 kids about history , and I make it as interesting as possible. I love it when I tell a joke that only half the class gets and then 30 seconds later the other half gets it. I love seeing awkward freshmen bloom into young adults. I love it when a kids speaks their mind for the first time, when they have really thought a bout a subject and come to their own conclusion. I love that my job makes me want to be a better person everyday. I love that I get to be creative, that I push myself to do better than the day before. I love my VP who works his ass off , and checks in on the teachers, I love our guidance counselors who bend over backwards to get kids services, and make sure they meet graduation requirements. I love going to the beach on a random tuesday during the summer with a book. Teaching is an amazing important beautiful wonderful job, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world somedays    My first year I put in 12 plus hour days most days and worked weekends, but I had 3 preps so I always figured that was the reason   I have 3 in my classroom, but I teach high school. When kids look sleepy or figdety during class I will ask them to sit on the ball, I have lap desk that go with them. Students love to grab them when we do partner or group work, overall very successful I will buy more next year    I very rarely drink coffee but when I do I take it black, simply because I don't want to try and figure out the suger cream ratio. Because if I am drinking coffee I am too tried to think.   Math science and sp ed get forgiveness and can teach anywhere , anyone else can get forgiveness if they teach in a high need area meaning a title one school.    Yes as a teacher this is true. Kids mix up numbers and letters all the time it is no big deal at 5.If you are concerned about how the teacher is working with your child call the school and ask to come observe for  a day.   Always pee before...always    Just breathe and know it will get better. Sorry for your pain   Allure salon, if you are more into pretty long hair, article 5 salon if you want something more funky , both are on king street.   I am teaching honors US history for the first time I have been giving my honors kids additional assignments, but I don't feel like I am giving them a deeper understanding of the subject. Any advice would greatly appreciated.   I teach at a small high school most teachers have 3 or 4 preps , but yes a new teacher should never have more than 2   We had a first year teacher this year with 4 preps and no prior education experience. I think he had a degree is bussiness and was teaching marketing type classes. He quit 6 weeks in he didn't realized what teaching would be like and   he didn't have the skills or support to push through it. It isn't for everyone, that guy was a smart, good guy who will be great at someone's company he just wasn't meant to be a teacher. The same way that I would probably crash and burn at a marketing firm. What others have said is helpful too take a day off ask for help, see what is on teachers pay teachers on days when you are overwhelmed with planning. It gets easier , but if you don't like it and it,s making your life miserable then getting a routine down isn't going to make you love it all of the sudden. Best of luck whatever you decide to do.   Maybe adding a bit more sugar would help with the yeastyness and help them produce more fluff. Just an idea, sometimes it helps when I make vegan bread.    For clarification, I wasn't suggesting that they were the same thing I was posing a question more about people's attitudes toward them. The vast majority of people now think slavery is wrong , I was asking if people might also feel that way about eating meat in the future.   This is a well.thought out responce. I teach US history, we are doing a unit on slavery and there are just so many parallels . Especially how abolitionists were seen as extremist, and mocked for their beliefs. I think that the move towards veganism will happen out of necessity of saving resources, rather than moral issues. But who knows the movement is gaining traction everyday and it is becoming more mainstream, so here is hopping.   Let me know how it goes      He looks like frank from donnie darko   Wake up at 6 at school by 7 class from 830 til 4 leave school at 6pm come home eat dinner grade or tweak lesson plans for an hour or so ...go to bed at 10   I teach us, government , and economics. For government check out the following websites I am on a mobile or I would link them icivics, the national archives, the library of congress and cspan. Start my government classes off with a news clip and we discuss the governments role in it. For us and world check out the reading like a historian website, they have some good lessons, also check with your media center to see if the have dbqs that you can use. Contact the socail studies person from your district and ask them to come observe you one day and give you some suggestions. I do a lot of hands on stuff but it kind of just comes to me as the year goes on. I had world students hold 30lbs and take a lap aroynd the room to simulate armor that a night wore. I had boys and girls put on high heals when we talked about foot binding. In us I have them make artifacts from the 13 colonies out of play dough, they build shanty towns out of cardboard boxes when we study the great depression, we simulate trench warfare when we study WW I . For govermnet you can run simulations of passing a bill by breaking students into groups and having them vote and make changes as they see fit. Hope that helps a bit, I didn't have much help my first year trust your judgment, experiment some days will be awesome sometimes it will be an epic failure, but you monitor and adjust and move forward.   What subjects do you teach?  Are you the only history teacher in the school? Part of your department head's job is to help you grow also reach out to other teachers in general they can give you some ideas you can tweak , good teaching practices can be applied to most subjects.   This most people know I am vegan , but will forget and offer me something non vegan I just say no thanks a 9 times out of 10 they remember why I don't want it and apologize. My friends are really accepting of my diet.   Omg I haven't had biscuits and gravy in so long thanks for posting   I am very lucky in the fact that I never much cared for steak, but if I smell a chicken biscuit or mac and cheese my mouth waters . I am from the south after all.      A high quality stapler, it sounds silly but it makes a world of difference.    As a graduate from the citadel, it is his class ring, the class ring at the citadel is more than just a ring it is proof you made it through four crazy difficult years. It opens many doors, cadets look out for each other it is a political tool for most graduates . Cadets always wear their ring , the school actually pays for 51% of it so if you disgrace the school they can legally take your ring away from you.   I have dyslexia and they look exactly the same to me   I teach high school and I convinced my students that Bill Nye the science guy name was really Bill Nye the science man.    Can confirm was a bartender for 6 years a rocks pour is 2.0 or larger depending on where you work, so it cost a bit more.   I find the difference of ideas between the founding fathers fascinating especially Jefferson and Hamilton. Ben Franklin was a bit of a scoundrel, so talking about him and peppering in some funny antidotes about his personal life would keep the lecture interesting. Like others have said know your audience.   	35
 Stafford has megatron back you can't be not excited about that.   Oh wow! Good find. you!   Stay away from Sanchez. Have trust in Russ. The giants don't have a good secondary. Wilson should be able to expose it.   Matty Ice is that guy you need. Especially with those bonuses. Ryan has one problem and that's his offensive line. As long as he can pick up the rush and get it out quick he will have another big game against TB.   Peyton is Peyton. You can only debate one QB over him right now and that kid is on a bye week.    Romo. Better weapons, weaker opponent and better quarterback.   Matt Ryan. Has huge potential for scoring here. Only problem is that offensive line. I like going for ceiling in close decisions like this. I think wilson is safer, but Ryan could score a lot.    Yeah I think Denver's D is underrated and Seattle's is overrated. Eli has been solid-good this year and I think he can keep it up. Surprising he hasn't dipped without Cruz. As a giants fan I can only wish Cruz never got hurt.    After this week Andre Williams. I just hope no one else grabs him up.   I would trust Eli here. I think he can the Seahawks secondary with OBJ.   Romo if you're looking for higher ceiling. Better weapons and going against a weaker team I think.    Go with Kaep. He was the better matchup with better weapons. It's close though.    Stafford. Calvin is back and that Tate/Johnson duo could be amazing.   Giants secondary is not good. Wilson will be able to expose it.   Orton. He's a much better QB than people think.    Vick was seen with a limp. Don't pick him up. Go with Eli.   Seattle's secondary is over rated I would go with Eli.   3-6 you need to take a risk. Sanchez is so bad in my opinion he's less of a risk and more of a sure failure. Go with Cam.   Cutler, yeah he's struggled against the Pack, but he has some damn good weapons.    Higher ceiling is Matt Ryan. Better weapons by far.   Honestly I like Romo here even with so much going against him. He still has the running game to protect him and Dez Bryant.    Stafford. Tate and Calvin on the field at the same time with Stafford and Tate's recent hookups could do wonders for Stafford.   Go with Ice. He is going against a weaker defense, he's the better QB and has better weapons.   Yikes, I like Carr, but Romo is the better qb even when hurt and has more weapons. It's an even tougher call when you consider that Romo had to travel to London. I go with Romo here.   Peyton. Peyton by miles. Andrew Luck is the only quarterback I think you should consider over Peyton.    I would go with Wilson. Yeah Matt Ryan had that huge game early in the year, but that was at home. Ryan has more weapons, but significantly less time to use those weapons. I don't think you can go wrong though.   Wilson. More skilled in my opinion and going against a worse defense.    Wilson, the giants are weak in the secondary and Wilson is the guy who can take advantage of that.   I would go with Cam. I think with Romo's injury Cam has much better upside.    Martavis Bryant at the Jets or Allen Robinson vs Dallas   Thanks, that what I was thinking.   Jay Cutler at Green Bay or Big Ben at the Jets   Should I drop Travis Kelce for him?   Denver at Oakland or Baltimore vs Tennessee? Standard ESPN scoring.    Bring Me Down by Kanye   We only veto trades that show collusion not one person drastically over valuing a player. It helped that he actually sent me the trade! He told me he wanted Lopez and I told him I wanted a point guard. He offered John Wall.    Traded Robin Lopez for John Wall last season   This will sound weird, but I definitely think strange clouds and adventures are better albums overall, but for some reason is only like a few songs on it whereas on Underground Luxury I really can listen to a lot of the tracks and really feel and relate to each one on some sort of level.     B.o.B isn't a top 5 rapper in my opinion and might be borderline top 15, but I really loved Underground Luxury. It had everything I really could hope for in a modern rap album. I think I'm gonna have to say Underground Luxury, but Illmatic, Food and Liquor and Graduation are certainly up there.     Nas   Kanye West  Lupe Fiasco  Tupac  T.I   4-5, third in my division going against second place who is 5-4. He has Bernard I have Hill. Looking good!   Peyton Manning for Doug Martin in week 5   I'm 4-5, riding 4 game win streak. 1 game out of second place in my division. Tied for second place in my division is the Gio owner. I have Hill and I face him this week.    Anal Farieds      	45

 Man I wish I knew how to do custom covers. Those custom Harry Potter covers are sick!   It really sucks how the UK gets all the cool steelbooks. Really wish the US would get some.   Why? Out of respect? If so, why? I mean, it's not based on the Malaysian flight. Hollywood doesn't seem like the kind of business to really care about anything but money. In fact it's weird that they don't want to capitalize on it. Besides, this is a movie that probably wouldn't be released for another year or so. I don't disagree with their choice but it's strange.    Whether it be by telling you how it ends before you saw it, or pointing out something that you can't unsee or hear.   What movie was ruined for you by someone else and how?   Honestly, I only think two of Kubrick's films are great.   I'd love to hear why you think Inglorious Basterds is one of the worst movies you've seen.   I agree with all of your points. Also, Tree of Life is one of my all time favorite films.      "Then I woke up."      I only know this from An Extremely Goofy Movie.    Haha well I just got off work so I'll get in contact with you in like an hour   You know what? I just might skype you. Are you available after 8? Cause I really do need someone to walk me through it in real time.

Now I have to create a new project and drag the sequence into a new time line which combines everything. I can't adjust single clips and what not. How can I fix this? I don't want to re-edit the entire thing all over again!     FCP 7. I don't know what my sequence/project settings are or the export/master file settings.  I have run into another problem though. So on this project I have put 30 hours into, I accidentally closed the sequence timeline. Now the timeline won't open for this specific project unless I create a new project and drag the sequence into this new timeline. Problem is, when I do this it makes it all one big sequence where I can't see the beginning or ending of clips. I also have to re-render everything which will take two hours.  How can I fix this mistake? Can I even fix it? I just want to edit independent clips again without having to re-edit every single thing all over again. Did I royally screw up?  Edit: Never mind about the timeline thing. Fixed it! But I do still need help exporting. How do I check the settings?   So I shot something in 1080p 24fps. I've edited it and I'm ready for exporting. The problem is no matter what I do, it ALWAYS IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!! The aspect ratio is distorted and the image is blurry/pixelated.   I've watched so many different tutorials about exporting, all with the same result, Bad Quality. For some reason I just can't get it to work. It's so irritating.   The worst part is that I've exported a video that came out in high quality before, but I can't get this video I just did to come out in HD at all for some reason.  Can someone please, please help?    But you should watch "Them" which is a French film from like 2007 I think. Basically The Strangers in France however it is much much scarier.    What is this from   Links are more than welcomed!   I was thinking about this while I was listening to the live version of Dave Matthews "Crush" and finding that I loved it more than the studio version.   What are some of your examples of this?   Links are more than welcomed and are encouraged, but don't worry about it!      Spy/secret agent films. I love love love these kinds of movies. Unfortunately the only good ones we get now are really just Bond but I love this genre.   More specifically I love mountain climbing movies like Vertical Limit and A Lonely Place to Die. We rarely get movies like this though which is a bummer.   Someone already said this one so I won't go into detail, but I absolutely love crime movies. I'll almost always pick a crime movie over any other.       Honestly, Terrence Malick. He makes beautiful films with beautiful people. He's probably the only director who could seamlessly transition into that industry.       I personally just felt that it was very mediocre compared to the first and had bad cgi, bad cinematography and often hammy performances.   The first one felt like a masterpiece whereas this one felt like a cheap direct to dvd sequel.    It was basically a four square shot of a stand up comedian's joke about Tiger Woods claiming to be a sex addict. The post seems to have just vanished   The majority of people think Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt is better?   Too bad it's also 10% as good as the first one.    It's weird we have to learn to protect ourselves from the very people paid to protect *us*.    So there was a story about I think a WWII pilot who was flying in the Bahamas and disappeared. They then found the wreckage off the coast of Florida and never figured out how he got there.   I could be remembering all the details wrong, but that was the basic gist of it.    I didn't mention it but you are so totally right.   The first 300 only really used cgi for the background, blood, and the cases where that's the only option(like the army of millions of Persians and the creatures) but even then it wasn't terrible. The cgi in Rise of an Empire felt very fake and a lot of the time unnecessary.    So I'm definitely in the minority here based on the rest of these comments.   I found this movie kind of boring. I don't know why but I never got into it at all.   The blood looked super terrible. I think it might have been worse than the blood in the first one, which evaporated in the air. Like it was very distracting how bad it was.   The cinematography was mediocre. You know how that show Spartacus felt like a cheap rip off of 300 when it came out? That's how this one felt, a cheap rip off. I found it very hard to tell what was going on at any time because of the either too dark lighting, or too bright and bloomy lighting.   I feel like this isn't hardly half the movie the first one was. I was more interested in this movie when it was called Xerxes and was about his origins which was only 10 minutes of this movie.   All in all I thought it was very poor and a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite movies. Again, I know I'm in the minority here but these are just my thoughts on it.       If /r/truefilm seems intimidating, /r/casualfilm is a great place. Easily my favorite subreddit.    I was wondering when someone would say this. I've seen just about all the movies people have said in this thread.   Martyrs is possibly the darkest and most depressing movie I've ever seen. It made me feel ill.    I really love movies where a character is constantly being hunted or is hunting someone else throughout the entire movie. I find that these types of movies make for some really suspenseful and thrilling experiences.  What some good movies like this?   I was thinking about this at work today. Are the some good movies where the good guy(s) and bad guy(s) end up having to team up for some reason? Maybe fighting a common enemy?   Yep this is it exactly   So this dude came into my work looking for crystal rocks and metal shavings. He goes on to tell me about the "____ in the air" How it's in the snow and rain and is like fiberglass falling from the sky.   Anyone know what this is? What it's called? He kinda sounded crazy so he might not be accurate but when he said this one word, the word I'm looking for, I knew what he was talking about. He said, "Have you heard about ____?"      Wow this was totally my idea in the first place as a joke, but I'm happy someone is actually making it happen! Exciting!  http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ze5f8/official_oscar_thread_2014/cfsxtux?context=3   I honestly don't think anyone could do Archer. What makes Archer Archer isn't his looks, it's his voice, which no one could do.    Note: I have not seen Dallas Buyers Club.   I would have given it Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor as well as Best Director. That said, I'm really happy Jared and Matthew won in those categories because I really love them and wish them the best.    It's just that exactly. Hype.   It's not as great as all the hype and awards would lead someone who hasn't seen it to believe. Much better movies have won less.   Children of Men is a better movie and got no oscars   Children of Men is better and won no oscars.   It won't   Honestly I didn't even know it had music until the final scene.   That's still hoping for a lot. I loved Her but hype is a powerful thing. As much as I want Her to win, I wouldn't be surprised if it lost. I hope I'm wrong.   See everyone says this and I think it doesn't sound like the compliment people mean it to be. You say it with good intentions, but it's actually a knock against a movie if it's not as good in one format as it is in another format. Anyone who says "see it in theaters" or "see it in 3D" are basically saying that it won't be as good on a small screen or in 2D unintentionally.   Yeah Lubezki did and is a fantastic cinematographer   That movie was robbed of its cinematography award.   AMA for the pizza dude   He even gave it to someone else just like the real one would do.   So sort of like Ridley Scott with Alien. How he managed to not only create a movie, but an iconic universe as well?      We've seen threads before about who we think are great directors, writers, actors, etc., but what do you think *makes* these filmmakers great? What makes a great filmmaker?      But how difficult is this to do as someone with little to no audio experience. Just figuring out what I'd need seems like a big challenge.   That's fair. I should've said that while on Amazon it says $600, I actually found one on sale somewhere for around $350, which I guess, is still more.   Are they bad simply because they *are* actually bad? Or is the Bose actually good but you're saying it's bad because there are better options?   I just simply don't have the time to learn about audio and have an entire day or more of trial and error figuring out how to make it all work.   I'm not saying your input is bad, any and all input is greatly appreciated, I'm just trying to figure out if the Bose is a decent sound system, not compared to something I could build better, but as far as packaged home systems go.    So we got our tax refund and we want to buy a sound system for our home theater. Right now we're deciding between these two. I was wondering if I could get advice on which is better because I know very little about audio.

Still fits and looks great. It's olive green and has a nice taper in the sleeves and waist. I've had it for close to 10 years. Very very durable. It's been through a lot.   In the spring/summer it's black basketball shorts. That's what I wear *all* the time when it's hot. Not really fashionable, I know, but because they are solid black they look decent for these hot summers my city's known for.    It's like 6-10 hours depending on traffic and stops   Yeah Dallas is kind of far for me to drive unfortunately but it's the closest she'll be to me the entire tour so it's worth it   I might end up going alone if a friend can't go. It'd be nice to hang out pre show or maybe, if by some chance, our seats are near each other, during the show. Concerts are always weird by yourself. At least for me they are. Anyway, just curious.   I really love Born This Way. It was the first song of hers that I heard and really loved. Before that I had just been a casual fan who listened to her on the radio. I also love Bad Romance, Monster, and my favorite might be Dope. I love how personal and reserved it feels compared to most of her songs.   It's hard to pick just one from Artpop because that whole album is more my style.   Thanks! Another question, how worth it is general admission? I know this is more of a personal preference sort of thing but how much more am I going to get out of the show if I do GA vs regular seating? Is it worth waiting in line all day, to you personally? It's just that I've never done GA before.   You also said if I showed up later, I'd get the back. How terrible is the back of GA? Last one, is there a chance that if I showed up late for GA that they'd run out of room and I wouldn't get in?  Again sorry for all the questions. You're very helpful!   So I have a question, does this mean I'd have to wait there all day to get in? Like, for example, if I get there at 8 am, do I have to wait there in line until like 8 pm or whenever it starts, to get in? Or can I chow up at 8 am, get a ticket, leave, then come back when the show starts? Also, how much are GA tickets?  Sorry for bombarding you with questions, you just seem like you know. Thanks in advance!   I cried during the last scene.    I can't even comprehend this, it's so great.   I think *Gravity* is *way* too high up on this list I think it's the most surprising one. I kind of expected it to be on the list, but definitely not that high up.. I can't believe the movies that it's ranked higher than. Should definitely be in the 200's at most. I know this list is less about "best" and more about "favorite", but even by that standard *Gravity* has to be one of the more overrated ones on this list.   Naw the song I'm looking for is far more recent.   It was a female singer. Obviously she didn't really say "something", but I can't for the life of me remember what the lyrics are or what song.   Any ideas?   Lights out!  Guerrilla radio!   Yeah he's still young and impressionable. I'm sure him seeing all this stuff must really mess him up.    I choose a movie based on what my mood is at that time. Like am I in the mood for crime, action, comedy, etc. as well as sub-genre stuff like dark movies, violent, gritty, depressing, fast paced, light-hearted, etc.  A good way to find subgenres is Netflix. You can find a vast list of sub-genres or you can find a movie you've seen that is close to what you want to watch in tone and Netflix will say "This movie is: Violent, dark, etc." and will tell you what tone it is. You can then click on, let's say "dark" if I wanted to watch a dark movie, and Netflix will list all of the movies it has for instant that are categorized as dark.    1993 - either Jurassic Park or Schindlers List. Probably Jurassic Park.       Like when something happens in a movie that you've been waiting or wanting to happen. Or when a character dies or when something happens in a movie that you just find so satisfying.    Its just always fascinated me how a games graphics could be so heavily improved but I don't understand how it's done.    It's like Russian roulette for your mouth.    The food storm in Kazaam. When Max wishes it will rain junk food and it just French fries, burgers, candy, and pancakes everywhere.    I completely agree that sequels work for comic book movies. It makes sense. I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a huge fan of sequels.   And as for comic book movies taking over original films. I guess I just meant adaptations and remakes in general. As the years go on, the number of original films are getting smaller and smaller. Everything is based on a comic or book or a remake or sequel or reboot. I can't say I blame Hollywood. If I knew a specific thing would sell, I'd make it too.   And again, adaptations of comic books and remakes and what not wouldn't bother me if they did something interesting with them. But they all feel the same which makes me feel jaded towards them.    I dislike the Godfather a great deal, but I recognize its a great film.    I can honestly see Shia making a comeback in like 5 or so years. Just imagine it for a second. He makes a huge mistake and decides to roll with it. For the next five years he disappears from the public eye. And when he does appear, everything he says is a quote from someone else. Then after years of being hidden he comes out of nowhere starring in a film with a great director and blows us all away.    I'm not really into them honestly. They aren't bad though. I really love the Nolan Batmans though because they didn't *feel* like a comic book movie, if that makes sense. When they first made an impression in like 2008 I liked them but I feel like now there is just such an over saturation of them. Honestly for me, my main problem is the fact that they are sequels and adaptations. It sounds shallow, but I'd much rather see an original film than another Marvel or DC movie. But it wasn't this way like 5 or 6 years ago because there weren't so many. We use to get super hero stuff like every two years or so. Now we get them every year. Sometimes two or more a year.   I also don't like, and this is more a flaw with Hollywood than super hero films themselves, that producers are just looking for properties and franchises to adapt or remake simply because they know it will sell, thus creating less and less original content. These days, comic book movies are replacing original films. It used to be adaptations were made along side original films. Now it feels they are taking the place of original films. Again though, this is more a problem with Hollywood.   I'm not totally against super hero stuff as long as they change it up or do something interesting with it. That's why I loved the Nolan Batmans. But now, every Marvel movie looks the same and every DC movie looks the same. They all look and feel the same. That combined with how frequently we see them makes them feel super dull and dry to me.   Like 10 years ago, I'd be so pumped for the next super hero movie. Now, they just aren't special anymore. At least to me it feels that way.    This is actually pretty true! I went through a bunch of guys with their penises all out then they would leave immediately when they saw I was a dude. Then this one dude didn't leave immediately so we started talking and had a really nice conversation. Turned out to be a pretty cool guy.   [http://imgur.com/a/5UGml](http://imgur.com/a/5UGml)   And we're just the maggots inhabiting it.   X gon give it to ya   And the best thing about Jurassic Park 3.    Mayo?   I don't think Beyond the Black Rainbow is particularly great, but I do love that movie.    This is seriously a fantastic movie!   I honestly don't remember anything about this movie but I *do* remember liking it.    Wait, Dancer in the Dark is on streaming? I've always wanted to see it.    This is sort of why I hope Gravity doesn't win best picture, not that I think it will, but hype is a powerful thing. Especially in an awards show that has slowly become a popularity contest. I think Gravity is really good, but I've always thought that best picture should be reserved for timeless films. Films that are just as great and just as powerful no matter the format, no matter the screen size. I agree that Gravity will lose a lot of its powerfulness with its transition to small screens. The same happened with Avatar.    I'm subscribed to a few youtubers who do reviews that I trust. I also look at the discussion threads on /r/movies that they have every week. I find that I trust the opinion of the general public more than a pro reviewer. I don't know why, I just do for some reason.  For the most part though I generally don't look at reviews. If it's something I want to see, then I'll go see it. If it's something I don't really have an interest in seeing, then I'll likely stay away from it for the time being.    What if there's no IMAX near OP? And if there is, what if it's not playing? Will he/she have a lesser viewing experience?   I'm not really into ghosts or possession movies, but I love creature films with physical creatures or monsters. What are some decent ones besides the classic ones like Black Lagoon, Wolfman, etc.? Like more recent ones?  Edit: When I said classics I should have been more clear. I meant the ones people always say as well like Alien and the Thing. I meant more recent and more obscure creature films.    I'm looking at a bunch of steelbooks and about 90% of them are region b, or the UK, or only just Europe. Is there a reason for this? Why doesn't America get them as well?   I want to find more rare editions or limited editions of movies, but the thing is, I don't know which movies have other versions or editions. Is there a website that list them or I can use as a resource?   I watched Punch Drunk Love, and I was wondering if you guys had any favorite unconventional love stories in movies. It doesn't necessarily have to be a romance movie either.    I really *really* love the big forest scenery in movies like The Hunted and even the Twilight movies have nice forest scenes. Are there any movies that take place predominately in the forests of Washington or Canada? Or even Alaska? Or other forests/wilderness like the ones found in north eastern America and Canada?   What are your favorite box arts or covers? Whether they be special editions, steelbooks, or just regular covers, which are your favorites? I'm a big fan of the box art for [The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Thin-Line-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBIRA/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv ie=UTF8 qid=1391655340 sr=1-3 keywords=the+thin+red+line)   See I disagree with this because everyone has *their own* problems. All of my problems *are* relevant to me. That's what makes the *my* problems. If they were irrelevant to me then they aren't my problems. Everyone's problems, no matter how big or small, are relevant to them. Maybe not to someone else, but to them they are. My complains and problems may be less important than someone else's but that doesn't make them less important to me. Like when I was younger and I would complain about having hard homework and my mother would make a comment about third world children not even having a school. I understand that it's a big problem, but it doesn't make my homework any easier, it just puts things into perspective.   I watched a movie called [Three O'Clock High](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094138/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I love love *love* this movie. It's about your average high schooler, Jerry Mitchell, who finds himself challenged to fight the new guy, Buddy Revell.  Buddy is the new guy who, according to rumors, is a psychopath. He doesn't like to be touched. The last guy who touched him had his arm broken. Buddy is your typical bad boy. He wars boots, jeans, black leather jacket, and a white t-shirt. When Jerry Mitchell introduces himself, he puts his foot in his mouth and can tell he's making Buddy angry. In an attempt to fix the situation, Jerry asks if they can start over and gives Buddy a nice friendly pat on the shoulder. Psycho Buddy warns Jerry of what he's done and tells him that they are going to fight in the parking lot at 3 o'clock. Jerry then spends the movie trying to get out of it by any means possible.  This movie is exceptionally well made. The pacing, directing, and camera work are all absolutely fantastic.It's such an easy movie to watch because of how well paced it is. We constantly aware of what time it is and how much time Jerry has left. I cannot stress enough how fantastically well made this movie is. It's so much fun.  The thematic elements we see and hear throughout the film are really well done. For example, Jerry is in Biology and watching the Wonderful World of Insects. We hear the narrator describing the grasshopper who is going about his day and is preyed upon by the large crab scorpion. Another instance in English when we hear about the gladiator battles.  All in all this movie is great. If you're a fan of movies that take place in a day, this is one of the best ones. It's well made with fantastic direction and the pacing is great. It's an immensely fun movie and I highly recommend it.    So just yesterday I watched [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=nv_sr_1) which is about a group of people who are all competing for a high ranking job at a top of the line company. They must decide whether to work together or alone in order to figure out the simple yest complicated test they are given that puts them to their limits.  This film is a very tight psychological mystery. It opens with eight applicants who enter a testing room. They are greeted by their test giver who gives them a few simple rules to follow. They are told there is one question and only one answer. However they must figure out what the question is as well as the answer in under 80 minutes.  We spend the movie in an almost real-time fashion watching these people trying to solve this strange mystery. It's hard to describe without spoiling it, and this is not something you want spoiled. The acting is mostly good while occasionally, but rarely, coming off as hammy. The writing is pretty tight while rarely being cheesy. The stand out in this film is the story.  This is a very interesting mystery puzzle of a story. Why are these people here? What's the job? What's the company? Why is the application process like this? What's the question? What's the answer? Over the course of the movie we watch them slowly try to solve these questions. The writers did a great job of creating this quasi-futuristic world and the conflicts it faces. Again, it's hard to talk about without spoiling.  While watching this I got two vibes from it. Cube and Reservoir Dogs. Two very different movies.   I seriously recommend checking this out. Especially if you love a great mystery. It's on Netflix instant.       A few days ago I watched [The Iceman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1491044/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in which Michael Shannon plays notorious mob hitman Richard Kuklinski.  I thought the movie was very interesting. I had never heard about Kuklinski before I saw the movie so it was all new information for me which made it that much better because I didn't know a thing. The writing was pretty good as well as the directing, but what really stands out is the acting. Michael Shannon, as always, is extremely powerful in this role. He is seriously one of the best actors working today. Shannon is joined by Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, and a surprising David Schwimmer. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The stand outs were obviously Shannon and Chris Evans, or at least for me they were. It was nice to see Schwimmer in a *very* different role than normal. However, I kind of chuckled at Ray Liotta. Not because he was bad, Liotta is solid in this. I chuckled because Ray Liotta has to be one of the most typecasted actors today. I'm sure 90 percent of his career is gangster/mob stuff. Not that I'm complaining.  It's easy to overestimate an actors performance, but this movie is great because of Shannon. Without him I think it would have been just good.   I got a Zodiac vibe from it. Mostly because they are both period piece crime films that take place over a decade. Which brings me to the other thing that stood out to me. The costume and set design. I totally felt that I was there in the 60s and 70s.  All in all I strongly recommend checking this out if you haven't. It's seriously a great film that really shows how powerful Michael Shannon is on screen. His presence is almost God-like in its power. It's on Netflix instant so give it a watch sometime.    Why what were you going to say? Please continue to contribute!   This is actually *exactly* what made me think of the quote from the movie I'm looking for. When I saw that ad I turned to my cousin and said, "It's just like in that movie when the kid is told to run home and runs to his actual home saying run home, run home."   Yes! This is it! For the past few days I've been saying this quote to myself trying to figure out where I heard it and whenever I typed it into google, all I got were home run videos. Thank you so much I can sleep now!   So yeah there was this baseball movie where a kid is told to run home so he runs to his house saying "run home run home"   Dude again I never said it was a bad post or it should be removed. I like it! No, image macros suck. Mods already said that those are pushing it. It may be half gaming related but that means it's 50% irrelevant as well. My first comment was downvoted because I made an observation. Then my second comment was downvoted because I was simply saying that I did like the post but just thought it'd be better suited somewhere else. I'm not being disrespectful to anyone.    I know we're pretty lenient with the rules around here but I'm sure this interferes with rule 1 somehow. I'm not saying this post sucks or it should be removed. I think it's hilarious! But I think it's better suited somewhere else like /r/Funny. It *barely* has anything to do with gaming besides the background and coloring.    The comments here suck   But don't people only do dangerous stuff for the adrenaline rush and to look cool? Like skydiving or free climbing?   I thought that the PS2 one was based on the movie Narc   Kind of related question, does anyone know the release date for the second episode of The Walking Dead Season 2?   Wow. A post about a movie character made it on the front page of /r/Gaming.    Mim looking for movies that are like Children of Men or The Road. Like movies where a character or group of characters have to travel through and survive either a war torn country or post apocalyptic world. Like where it's more about a journey the character(s) have to make through that world in order to get to a destination.   Can you think of any movies like this?   I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great choice.    [Smokin' Aces (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/?ref_=nv_sr_1)  When a Las Vegas  performer decides to testify against the mob, they put a hit on him that brings together all sorts of crazy characters and assassins. This is a very fun action/thriller.   It's not the best, but I really *really* love the opening scene of [Narc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xfrmlcIQf4)   But I feel like this one is going for a comic book feel way more than Spiderman 3. So I think this one can get away with it.    This was my huge beef with GTA V. I fell about 50 feet and only lost about half health. I did a front flip down some stairs and died instantly.   Like for example, the hero is driving a car and the bad guy shoots at him and we, the viewer, see bullet holes and shattered glass. Do they put charges in the glass, or what?  I know when they do squibs, or blood hits, the actor wears an explosive blood pack. And wall hits are just pockets in the wall with tiny explosives. But how do they do glass?   And that you have to be an experienced professional and not just some dude. Thought I could just apply to be a gaffer but it looks like their looking for bigger pros.    Yeah it have a lot of respect for Heder. It must be so hard to be an actor and Mormon. Having to turn down roles. I respect that he sticks to his morals. There are quite a few famous actors who use to be Mormon but stopped practicing in favor of roles.    Not really any movie in particular, but I love on set b-role footage. I also really love special feature that look at how a movie's special effects were done. And I prefer these extras to be lengthy and not just a short 5 minute montage or compilation. Like the in depth on set footage or SFX stuff.  Spider Man 2 had literally hours of behind the scenes stuff.    I'm don't read comics but I had it spoiled for me when I looked at its IMDB.   I don't mind Bruno Mars and I think he's talented, but man I was so bummed when I realized it was Bruno with special guest Red Hot Chili Peppers and not the other way around.   Wait, so Bruno Mars is the star and The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the special guest?! Screw that   Can I get a gif of the "jazz hands" from the two dudes from the Seahawks and Broncos? Anyone know what I'm talking about?   Eli looked like Scar up in the box watching his brother Mufasa.   This is sad. It's a cold reminder that actors are still just people and they won't be around forever. It's always a weird feeling when you realize that you won't see someone again. It's always shocking and never easy to believe when someone dies. He was easily one of the greatest actors. He won't be forgotten.   Spy films. We really only see James Bond and we only get that like once every five years or more.   Also noir. Like good classic style noir. Nicolas Winding refn is bringing it back in a way, but there is still a lack of it.  Lastly, hard, cerebral sci-fi. Today so many sci-fi movies are all about cgi, huge explosions, and lots of action. We don't really see sci-fi that focuses more on world building and story. Her was a great step towards getting back to hard sci-fi, but we need more of it.   I really liked how classic rock was used in a Knight's Tale. It contrasted with the times, yet it worked so well.  Another recent use I really loved was the use of The National's song About Today at the end of Warrior. I won't go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil this fantastic movie. But it perfectly captured that moment and broken relationship between two brothers and their father.   But that's sort of what I'm getting at. Movies *are* a visual media but I don't think that should mean visuals should come first. I'm not saying that Gravity's visuals come first, but it sure appears that way when the visuals drown out the story. Story is important. Especially if we're talking Best Picture. It's perfectly okay for a story to be simple. But there's a difference between simple and shallow. Children of Men wasn't even nominated in any acting categories, best picture or director. I may be in the minority here, but I believe Children of Men is a league above Gravity. Best picture should be a well rounded film, which I honestly don't think Gravity is. But again that said, I still think Gravity is a technological achievement in film.    [The Thin Red Line](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/?ref_=nv_sr_3) (1998), Terrence Malick   I never criticized Gravity's story. I never said it was bad, I just simply said it was similar to Avatar and American Hustle in that the story wasn't the best part.  The thing about Gravity is that it's okay to have a simple story. But it felt like the story wasn't important. You could tell that the tech was more important. When you have complex and bombastic tech and visuals, it overshadows the simple story. The story wasn't just simple, it was kind of flat. A story can be simple, but I feel it needs depth. Great stories are not determined by how complex or simple they are, but how much depth they have.    So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking. I found Gravity to be one of the most technically impressive movies I've ever seen and it is an accomplishment. But I can't help but feel that it's a little over-hyped.  I find myself reminded of Avatar. Avatar is a technically impressive film of the same caliber as Gravity, I feel. Yet Avatar's plot was "meh". I feel the same about Gravity. Again, it's a technically remarkable film, but I feel that that's really all it has going for it. The acting is good and the plot is also kind of "meh".  Today, Avatar is a movie we don't think about to often, and while impressive on a big screen, it loses a lot of that impressiveness on a small, home tv. Going back to the awards poster for Gravity, one of the quotes says, "A groundbreaking film that must be seen in Imax 3D." Which is exactly like Avater. I worry that Gravity will not be as impressive on smaller screens resulting in a less powerful film because Gravity does rely a lot on its technical aspects.  I'm also reminded of American Hustle in a way. The general consensus here is that American Hustle has great acting but a "meh" plot, and a film shouldn't be considered great based on just one aspect of it. I think the same could be said for Gravity. The strongest, and really the only thing it has going for it, is its technical achievements. Now, I do realize that Gravity and American Hustle are two different beasts. And I do want to say that I'm not hating on Gravity because I think it's a really good film that has made incredible leaps in its technology. These are just observations I've made.  Edit: Just wanted to point out that Children of Men wasn't even nominated for any acting categories, best picture or director.    I have to say Napoleon Dynamite. I think it's so different from any other comedy. I love it's weird dry sense of humor. It's easily one of the movies I quote the most.   So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking.

Because /r/gaming is one of the worst subreddits.    I'm Mormon and I'm late to reply, but I can decide that it's just a game. I play M rated games and watch R rated movies all the time, even though we're encouraged not to. The way I see it, it's not influencing me. I'm able to separate my life from a video game or movie. In the case of GTA V, my character murders, breaks the law, drinks, goes to the strip club, etc. This is all happening in the game, sure I'm making him do it, but it's just a game. I'm not doing these things in real life so why should it matter. Same with R rated movies. I'm just a spectator, not a participant.   Dude...Kill List is in no way a comedy. Probably one of the darkest movies I've seen. I didn't feel good afterwords. Loved it though.    /r/movieclub does this every week. The community chooses based on upvotes then they watch and discuss. I'm not against having it here, but just FYI incase there are people who want to do this but we end up not doing it here.   	153
 Yep, pretty much everything here is Japanese but with simplified Chinese eg. Kiss Me is written as  (pronounced tchi-shhhh-may) however the MG masks are Chinese and they work really nice for me, but that Neutrogena cleanser is super drying, as with a lot of Chinese cleansers (Pond's too OMG my face) probably due to the high pH.   Oh wow, the C20 seems worth a shot then, I may as well apply it like lotion   So due to RRS's revamp and subsequent sale, I'm thinking of purchasing either the OST C20 or the It's Skin Power 10 VC, although I am leaning towards the C20 cause I'm using a SAP from Instanaturals and don't seem to be seeing any results.  It does seem that most people find C20 to oxidise quite fast so perhaps maybe I could use it on my back to treat acne scarring?  Has anyone else tried using Vitamin C serums on their body and how were the results?   Its so much easier to use the search function as well, it took me ages to figure out how to use it before!

I'm sitting on another AB order and this is exactly what I need to make a final decision!   I've had some of Mario Badescu's stuff which an online SA recommended after I described my skin type. I have the Cucumber Cleansing Toner: it did absolutely nothing for me, I now use it on my back before applying my Benzoyl Peroxide just to use it up. The Glycolic toner is quite good, especially if you're new to AHA's as its fairly mild, although I'm not quite sure what concentration it is.  I would say Fig   Yarrow have a similar philosophy and products to Aesop; I've tried their coffee body scrub before which was nice, but I felt like I could make it myself with used coffee grounds.    Yeah I've heard that its a great dupe for the Hourglass Ambient Light Pallette   I haven't eaten red meat for the past 4-5 months but once I got here like 2 days ago, I have been chomping food down like mad.  The lamb was so crisp like lamb chua'er and so tender, well marinated and the soup was very light with a mix of silken and frozen tofu to give it more texture. Could definitely taste all spice, cumin and cinnamon in the lamb. I also spooned some of the stew with my rice to mix and it was really amazing.  Best part is, that dish cost like 40RMB, which is like 4!!  	22

 Yes I went on a week rampage on reddit being racist its true. If you would have got your teeth knocked out by some ghetto black I'm sure you would feel a bit racist also.   Oh sorry. The detective said they are really busy this time of year but he guaranteed he would be in prison by new years. I personally don't feel like he should have the luxury of being able to spend Christmas with his family after what he did.   It will cost 5000 to replace those two teeth and it is a 5 month process. The police have his information and should be making the arrest after Christmas.   Yes I should have put that in quotations, in reference to what the news was calling it.    Satanist, from what I have heard, are kind of extreme. They have rituals that involve human sacrifice.   Why don't they sell this fruit fresh in america.   I really missed this repost also. Fapable post indeed.   Dot live and you dnt need this shit.   Robots are being made to replace workers soooon!   What happen to the electric guy Jamie fox was playing?   Psh who jungles anyway with heart of shield   Fuck this item. I'm tired of playing vs teemo and nasus top   Damnit, now there's like four blue whales left on earth.   Repost lame  	14
 Thank you.   That is your opinion.    If it can't be patented even better. I will just raise awereness for this mrsa treatment idea. I do believe I am the first person to use a hydroponic grow bulb to produced the 400nm light necessary to treat my reoccurring mrsa infections. Google hydroponic bulb mrsa   Because nobody has ever used a hydroponic grow bulb to produce this 400nm light. If it can't be patented even better. I will then just raise awereness for this MRSA treatment method.     Maybe. Could turn into an interesting  court case.   They don't. Don't even know the people who run this website.    Someone has some common sense.   This is why I am posting information. Would like the scientific community to research my mrsa combination treatment.   This combination therapy combines known infection methods to produce an effective respose to my mrsa infections Also, I am the first person to use a blue spectrum hydrolux  hydroponic weed grow bulb to produce this 400nm light. This bulb is new technology.  Google hydroponic grow bulb mrsa. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438385/   I don't think this is a guaranteed to work. Would like idea to be tested and hopefully replicated in a lab. Then idea could be submitted for peer review.   I hope so. I am a nerd not a lawyer.   No alcohol makes mrsa worse. Will provide link in a min.   True. If my idea works may be an interesting court case.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438385/   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438385/   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438385/   Give me a minute. I will provide links. Also my friend is a retired microbiologist. I have a youtube video where he comments on my mrsa treatment idea   Almost lost my leg. When I was in the hospital they sent me a chaplain because they where not sure if I was going to make it. Last year 700,000 people died worldwide from this flesh-eating eating disease. By 2030, it may be as high as 10 million.   Give me a min and I will give you links. My comments are going crazy.   Google 400nm light infections.     Understand how to read peer review medicial papers even though I am not a doctor. Plus light and radar are basically the same thing just a different spectrum. I am a nerd.   It is already too late. My youtube video's have been viewed in over 60 countries and shared in over a dozen websites.My videos have been even download and shared from Russian and Chinese websites.   You get the idea buddy. I already have over 2500 views on my youtube channel and idea has been shared on over a dozen website.   Because I don't have the 10- 100 k to the  get the medicial patent.    Look at the peer review papers on 400nm blue light then get back with me.    Jonas Salk gave away his polio vaccine patent-free.   Because I am not a doctor.I worked on the AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile radar in the navy so I understand how this technology works.   It is not a cure but a treatment for my reoccurring mrsa infections.   This is not my website. The MRSA foundation just shared one of my youtube videos. Look at the peer review research of 400nm blue light. My idea was to get this 400nm blue light from a hydroponic grow bulb. Hope this helps.   Then go patent it buddy.   Feel free. Just realize I will be your companies worst PR nightmare.   That's the rebel spirit. I guess the system failed to teach you "learned helplessness".   The hospital has treated over a dozen of my mrsa infections with antibotics. After I came up with idea, I have treated three MRSA infections without antibotics. I almost died from this flesh eating disease. I agree it is not science until postive results are replicated in many different people. Would like scientific community too research idea further.   I hope they can figure out what the problem was. All new technology has problems.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca6x4QbpoM This will answer your questions.   This animation will answer your questions. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca6x4QbpoM      Thank you for posting. Made my day.                Good to see an adult with passion.   He is CEO of three different companies : space x, solar city, and telsa. When does he sleep.   Have you ever see the falcon 9 heavy animation video.   Bringing back a stage of rocket from the edge of space will be a little harder. You have to crawl before you walk.   It will all be shot in HD video. Cool indeed.   I bet the amount of data that this rockets computers have to compensate for is impressive.           	51
 Hiding in tunnels and telling civilians to disregard evacuation orders is facing the enemy directly? Oh Lord.    Find me another that says a massive amount of people who happens to be your anscestors witnessed a miraculous event.   Yeah, by a group of people we would call Orthodox Jews.  Yes, because no other Judaism existed. Regardless, your claim about Hebrew being a dead language, only used by the clergy, is incorrect. Again, we don't have to talk about past interpretations; look at the verse in Hebrew now.   A copy of a copy can have no greater than 100% fidelity, and mistakes aggregate and are rare to correct.  Have you looked at the process of copying the Torah? It is extremely accurate.  Still interpretation.  Yes, but other interpretations is not "just as likely to be correct" as mine, because of these rules.  If that hebrew is the same as the hebrew spoken now, why would we have needed interpretation of it 2000 years ago?  Of course it does. What does it mean to not cook a kid in it's mother's milk, and why is it repeated three times in different sections? What does it mean, slaughter an animal as I have instructed you?  But a cheeseburger can be made without even cooking the cheese with the burger, so it clearly isn't prohibited by the Torah itself.  It depends. How do you define cooking?  You don't worship a different God. You don't have a moral standard that allows the killing of innocents. You believe in charity and helping you fellow man. You believe in obeying the laws of the society in which you live. You believe courts are a valid way of resolving disputes. There are religions that disagree on each of these values.  Many Christian sects also agree on all of these, and they are separate. That's what I was pointing to.  Now onto your supposed list of agreement.  All divisions of Jewish faith believes that the messiah has not come.  Not true, and hasn't been in the past. Of course, some would not call messianic chabad Jewish...  They believe that the sabbath should be kept holy, and is on the seventh day of the seven day week: Saturday.   Reform believes you don't have to, and even celebrated it on Sunday in the 1800's!  There are no differences I am away of between newer Jewish practices and Orthodox practices that are bigger than these differences between Judaism and Christianity:  Yes, but I'm not saying that. Judaism is very much different than Christianity. But some of the major differences between Christian sects are much smaller than between the major Jewish denominations.   It's not just that it happened to many people, it's that it happened to many people who happen to be our ancestors.    Hebrew was a dead language for many centuries, spoken only by  clergy  Not true, it was used by everyone for prayer and study, and was also used as a base for derivative languages. It was never dead, unlike Latin. And since it has recently been revived with mostly the same base, it's pretty easy to get a correct translation. I can go over the verse in depth if you want.  As for cheeseburgers: that's your interpretation, don't cook the two together.  No, that is not my interpretation. That is the interpretation of the mishna, which is the recording of rabbi's statements from 100 BCE to 100 CE. This is the only interpretation Judaism has had for at least 2000 years, more if the Pharisitic claims about the Oral Law are accurate, as Orthodoxy holds.  There are other interpretations of what "unclean" means with regards to pork.  Nope, it's pretty concrete. It says don't eat it.  It's all interpretation  But there are rules and bases for the interpretation.   and these differences are relatively minor in practice compared to other religious differences.  Not true. There are significant practical issues in eating in a non-kosher home, for example. In fact, there are many more practical issues with different interpretations than many Christian sect splits.    Is it no drinking and no eating?   It's a moral tale, not a history.   No, it is clear it is not about the dead, because then "for the dead" would be written at the end of the verse, not in the middle.   And if we consider the origin of this command, it serves as a way to distinguish ourselves from Canaanites.  The whole point is that Orthodoxy's view of the laws are they are in effect forever, no matter what the origin is.  Where is it written that a new may not eat a cheeseburger?  "Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk" is interpreted as "do not cook meat and milk together."   Leviticus 19:28   Yes and no. Just don't use either when you are referring to God, and no one will have a problem.   Why a fast if it's a celebration?   Writing Jehovah's Witnesses is fine, just don't actually use that name for God.   Probably about 50% of Jewish male names have God's name in one way or another. The rest are historical.   *shrug* Christianity doesn't make any sense to me either. It's not more well known because there there is no one proselytizing to Christians, and most Christians don't seek out opposing arguments.   That's great! Maybe talk to the theology professor beforehand about your concerns? If they're Jewish, they'll probably understand where you're coming from.  Also, if you're interested, join some of the nerdy clubs on campus. They usually have less of the drinking/banging than the rest.  Have you figured out what to do when people try to convert you?   For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given  This part is past tense, not present tense. Why exactly is an issue of context, but right off the bat what you have is incorrect. Also note that they capitalized child and son to make them seem divine, but there is no such indication in the Hebrew.  and authority/power has been on his shoulders  Government here makes no sense. Settled is an inserted word; the only verb in this phrase is "to be." This is also past tense, not future.  And he has been named  Again, past tense.  Now we come to the names. Hebrew does not have a present tense "is" verb, so this can be taken as a list or "___ is ____". Let's take it word by word.    This is not wonderful, but wonder. It could be an adjective, but properly translated as wonderous.    This can either the verb or the noun: counselor or counseled/determined.     there is no "the" here; mighty God is the right translation. Certain phrasing in English will need the for proper grammar, but not the list form.    Again, not "the." Eternal Father.  -  Either:  * "prince of peace," a quality inherent in the prince; * or "peaceable prince," a quality describing how he acts * or "prince that makes peace," describing his actions.  I think I've demonstrated enough that your translation is inaccurate. How best to interpret it is up to debate.   One final point: Just because the persons name has a quality of God does not mean that he is called God. My name has God in it, but I am not claiming divinity.  P.S. Looking at the Chabad/Rashi, he translates it as the name being -, while the rest is describing God. Also perfectly legitimate. And it makes sense that this is describing Hizkiyahu, because they were contemporaries and this does not seem to be a section about the Messianic age.   It doesn't. the translation Christian Bibles use are faulty.   Just because something is recorded doesn't mean it was the right thing to do.   Not exactly. It has a rotating board of rabbis, but it's something different than a sanhedrin, though they do make halachic rulings.   One last point. It's easy. Reporters no longer go into Syria, but they can easily talk about Syria from within Israel.   If you get me up to 80%+ and you're on the other side of the stage? You bet your ass I'm going to start spamming it. That's your fault I'm in such a good position, and it does take some skill to land it properly.   Just write God. That works best.   Bigotry of low expectations, right here folks.   8:28-29 says that there was a battle against the king of aram. Do you think this occurred?    Eh, there is a point for reform Judaism, but not so much conservative    [That's partialism, Patrick!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw)   If what they say is right, then the stele is saying that their god is better because over time, during the reign of the king who worshiped that god, they prevailed over the objections of those other kings (and their gods), in taking all the land that they wanted to, from them.  Well, yes. It was written by Aram, after the battle with the kings of Israel in Judah. The same battle where the new Israelite King, according to the Bible, slew the two other kings. The king of Aram claims that he killed those kings, in contradiction to the biblical narrative.   What battle? There is no such battle.  Read II Kings chapters 8-11 again. What do you mean, no battle?  They created a new history of Israel to fit how they interpret the inscription, ignoring what the Bible actually says.  Can you describe what history you're talking about? All I'm doing is quoting the bible. The researchers just matched up the half names on the steele to the names in Kings, not made up another history. What does the Bible "actually say"?  P.S. The various other claims of  means don't dispute the spelling, but the pronunciation. Like the Wikipedia article says, those claims are pretty weak.   Proponents of what interpretation? Who rewrote what? This is in the Bible that was canonized before Christianity even existed. What is your alternative?  And yes, Kings and the steele are definitely describing the same battle and outcome, but with two different claims of what happened. That is how history was written in those days -- each side claimed it won (hell, it still happens).   [Not quite.](http://www.zionism-israel.com/ezine/Dscn5049.jpg)   That says nothing about joining forces against Judah. Even so, that is a prophecy of what will happen. To look at the actual events, read II Kings.   Of course it does. Read your Bible - start with II kings 8:16. You will find a separate narrative about the same events.   Apologize to the actual person, if you can. He'll appreciate it even if he never responds.   The "House of David" on the tel dan steele is referring to the King of Judah, not the king of Israel.       Tell that to the Palestinians, who claim that no Jewish temple ever stood there.   I'm getting annoyed at my phone (Droid Razr HD) recently at a couple of things. It's getting hot when I'm not using it and the mobile data in on (just sitting in my pocket), using up a lot of battery power. It is also running really slowly, especially when switching between apps. So I have a couple of questions:  1. Is there any way to view and cancel background programs from running? 2. What might be the cause of using so much power when I'm not using my phone? 3. Is there any way to cancel individual app permissions?  If any of this requires me to root my phone, I would appreciate step by step instructions. Thank you!   He didn't fulfill the most important ones, namely bringing all the Jews back to Israel and ushering in a golden age for humanity. Which ones did he fulfill, do you think?   No, the OT says that Jesus rises from the dead doesn't make him a prophet or in the right. He's not the messiah for different, reasons, namely that he didn't fulfill those prophecies.  I don't come at Christianity with a presumption of Judaism, I come at it with the presumption of atheism  Wonderful, but Christianity itself bases its claims upon Judaism being correct. To be Christian means to accept the OT.      The NT definitely punishes thought crimes,  Alright, just please make the distinction between the NT and the OT then.    The law says "Don't be gay"  No, it says: "Men, don't have sex with men." Homosexuality wasn't even a concept at that point. Nowhere, outside of jealousy, does the Torah ever condemn thoughts.   You said the basis of your faith is that Jesus rose from the dead. But the OT, which you claim is authoritative, definitively says that this doesn't make a difference. How can you reconcile the two?   Next up, they'll have to ban premarital sex because it will lead to more mixed dancing, which "desecrates one of the fundamental principles of Judaism!"   I don't feel like a male thats effeminate, i feel like a woman  What do you mean if this doesn't include body dysphoria?   According to Wikipedia, Socrates was born in 470 BCE and Aristotle was born in 384.   Aristotle is typically put as one of the Fathers of Greek ~~philosophy~~ science. He lived in the 4th century BCE, a little after Malachi.   Why are you not comfortable identifying as male and just acting in different ways?   The fact that the Torah was revealed to all of Israel at once.   In Israel just a shroud, outside of Israel a box.   A human claiming "I am God" is certainly something different -- and rising from the dead doesn't prove it one way or another.   I don't need one. The Torah tells us not to listen to prophets who teach a contradictory message, no matter what miracles they perform.   The Romans, in order to insult the Jews more!   And if Jesus rose from the dead, it still doesn't prove anything.   National Revelation.   No it isn't!   Darkness is chosech, previously in the verse. Darkness is contrasted to light, and evil is contrasted to peace/wholeness. Where you get sin from, I have no idea.   A good discussion is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi)   This will be incredible. But why for only those who purchase both...?   Ok, Huge Pizza Hog, I think it's time for you to begin.   SPECIAL SMASH IS BAAAACK!!   8 player smash confirmed!!!   But I thought that it was the father speaking that line, since Jesus hadn't previously revealed himself at all?  And anyone can forgive sins; someone comes to apologize to you for something they did to harm you and you forgive them. Poof. Bye sins! You have to do the same thing with God.  You still haven't answered me about Isaiah 43. You ready to debate that?     I would assume you think so, that's what your argument it based on, inst it?    You heard (read?) me. By the your circular logic that is true, but if Jesus didn't save anybody he can't be God, can he?    In them two verses God is saying that there is no saviour beside himself, and verses including Acts 4:12, Luke 2:11, John 4:42 , etc declare that only Christ Jesus is the saviour of the world. Thus Jesus is God.  Or maybe those quotes are just...wrong?  Also, Isaiah 53 is definitely not about the Messiah, and certainly not about Jesus. ready to debate that?   Evil is the best translation, as in genesis 3.   [Are you sure about that?](https://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+giant+wasp espv=2 biw=1366 bih=643 tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=xGVJVNPTMYaxyATytIIg ved=0CDAQsAQ#tbm=isch q=japanese+giant+hornet facrc=_ imgdii=_ imgrc=msTgfAU9FsNoRM%253A%3BFv-yKpO5Tyh5RM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fanimalsadda.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F07%252FAsian-giant-hornet.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fanimalsadda.com%252Fasian-giant-hornet%252F%3B2020%3B1335)   750,000 Palestinians were exiled  True.  through the use of terror attacks such as the Deir Yassin massacre  Not true. Deir Yassin is so infamous precisely because it only happened once, and not by the Haganah/IDF.  the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages  Never seen a good citation for this. Dozens? Probably, mostly along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road because they were being used as shelters for the attackers. Lod is another example. But most of the villages were in the Galil, and many were untouched or the inhabitants fled in advance.   Palestinians were bound to retaliate in the following years.  800,000 Jews were exiled from Arab countries, and the inhabitants of the Old City, kfar etzion, and other areas had to evacuate, were expelled, or were massacred. Did they not have the right to retaliate?     Fedayeen, I apologize. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967), if you don't already know.  Also, the PLO itself was founded in 1964, but the groups that make it up (Fatah, etc.) existed before. Fatah, for example, was established in 1959. Many of the attacks didn't come from the PLO of today, but were carried out an sponsored by people who did form the group. ([See here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen))   I see a random list, of which at least 3 at first glance *were* during a war. You still haven't addressed the fact that one list starts at 48 and the other at 68. Look up the ~~mujadeen~~ fedayeen.   Just want to point out that the actual source is Aramaic, where it means "He created as he spoke."   Never made the news? There were at least three articles about it on *this* subreddit alone. And no, it doesn't provide any context whatsoever. Terrorism is never justifiable.    Why the hell are you starting at 1968 for the PLO? The groups that make it up go all the way back to Israel's founding. And the list doesn't even distinguish between military and civilian casualties. If you're trying to make a point, at least give correct information.   Then what are you saying? I have no idea what the attack and the connection is between the attack and freedom of movement.   Yes, a Hamas operative who has been in jail twice was traumatized by a traffic accident where the perpetrator turned himself in. That's why he killed a baby.   If the opponent is dodging a lt, short jump and a turning back slash is extremely effective.   The title is from the article. And I wouldn't be surprised if "settlers" is interpreted a bit too loosely; after all, Jews are classified as "members of an enemy state."      Yes. Are you saying that the fact Palestinians don't have freedom of movement justifies terrorist attacks?   What does that have anything to do with this attack?    I guess that's news to the Hamas driver who was travelling on the highway that goes straight through Jerusalem that serves both Israeli's and Palestinians. I guess it's also news to Palestinians in East Jerusalem that travel on this same light rail all the time between East and West Jerusalem.  **There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.**     I guess that's news to the Hamas driver who was travelling on the highway that goes straight through Jerusalem that serves both Israeli's and Palestinians. I guess it's also news to Palestinians in East Jerusalem that travel on this same light rail all the time between East and West Jerusalem.  **There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.**   Anyhow, more to your point the fact that Israelis can easily waltz across the border and not vice versa is kind of the problem.  The fact that Palestinians and Jews can travel freely in Jerusalem is a problem?   Not true.   The terror attack was literally [right at the border](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail#mediaviewer/File:Jerusalemlightrailmap.png) between East and West Jerusalem, right on a highway, a couple of minutes walk from Palestinian neighborhoods. There could have easily been residents of West Jerusalem, tourists, students from Hebrew University, or Palestinians at the station. Are you condemning these people for simply *standing at train station?*   Are you really asking why people live in certain places? And did you really just call all of Israel a "Jewish settlement?"   Epi-genetic, based on temperatures after the eggs are laid. You can read more in [this explanation](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-temperature-sex-determination-reptiles/) I found.   If you trust them, I'm sure you'll be able to find the original sources, right?   1. A video they don't link or name, and a statement by the obviously not biased Al-aqsa waqf. 2. Full of outright lies, myths, and STILL doesn't contain any information that anyone wants to destroy Al-Aqsa.  3. Why does that have anything to do with Jews?   Radio? Everything I've seen just says that they praise the attack, but don't take credit.   The infant has died while at the hospital.   The baby has died, no news on the 8 others injured.      The part about uncomfortable/not confident people taking up less space is definitely true, as is the converse.   Same as kashrut. These laws are called "chukim" - there are no real explanations.   Are the ones is Gush Etzion settlers? Those who returned to their land after their parents were kicked out and massacred?    But if you know of them, you can much better understand what they are talking about. Take Isaiah, for example. Lots of Christians misinterpret the book because they have no idea in what time or for whom it was written. But if you do know, and read it in the original language, nearly all your points are moot.   And this is why you read it in the original language with knowledge of the authors.      It's a metaphor. Since angels don't have free will, everything they do is God's will.   The snake is Genesis 3 is just a snake, not Satan.   All is under God. Anything else is not monotheism. Is polytheism easier? Absolutely. But that is not what Judaism is.   Opposite. God created everything, including evil. The person talking to you about translation is completely wrong.   There have been two ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2chmoo/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/)) recent threads about this recently. The second had the same discussion about moral evil happening now; my rebuttal is in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi).  Pretty much all I have to say is there, if you want more details/explanation you can just reply to my comment here.   It's amazing how Christians don't seem to know their scripture.   Chapter 29:  24 they and indeed all the nations will wonder, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? What caused this great display of anger? 25 They will conclude, It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 26 They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them; 27 so the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land, bringing on it every curse written in this book. 28 The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is now the case.  Essentially what Christians have been saying for a long time, including you above.  When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, 2 and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you. 4 Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world,[a] from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. 5 The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.  **God will not abandon his people.**   I have heard that it is ok as long as no money is exchanged, barring ma'arit ayin.   Side note: where is the long list of prophecies that were actually fulfilled?  I have never seen an accurate one, probably because very little was actually fulfilled.  once to fulfil the law and once to permanently establish his kingdom.  Why two comings? Why should I believe it? Where in the OT is it said?  We want our spouses to make an informed decision and choose to marry us freely. God wants the same thing - he wants us to choose him freely.   But the Jews are already married to God! What exactly are we choosing again?  He doesn't establish his kingdom permanently yet (the second coming described by all those prophecies in the list) because he wants to give as many people as possible the chance to make the right choice - but in a way that doesn't force it down their throats.  Then why will Jesus ever come back? Isn't it better to continue giving people the choice? If the second coming will remove the choice, then why have it? Won't it make perfection...less perfect?  And you still haven't established why the prophecies should be fulfilled in the second coming. The messiah isn't the messiah unless he fulfills the prophecies. Doing a vague fulfilling the law thing is not what the messiah is supposed to do.  The first of the non-second coming prophecies in the list:  These are refutations of christian theology, not prophecies.   Yes, Jesus fulfilled the law  But this doesn't mean anything. The law cannot be "fulfilled." It is something to do in perpetuity, not something to be done once.  but he also said he didn't come to abolish it. He didn't tell anyone they should stop following the law.   But Paul did. And Christianity has followed his teachings.  He just fulfilled its requirements for all mankind  Again, no such thing. Second, the law never applied to everyone, just to the Children of Israel.    It is impossible for humans to keep the law and therefore everyone is judged a sinner and therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law because perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin.  Woah woah woah. None of these statements follow. Let's go through them one by one.  It is impossible for humans to keep the law  Yes, it is impossible for everyone to be perfect. God knew this when the law was handed down at Sinai, which is why a repentance was established as in option. Coincidentally, we are in the middle of the period devoted to repentance.  therefore everyone is judged a sinner  Everyone has sinned, but everyone can repent. Once you repent, the sin is washed clean.  therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law  One is not condemned to die just because you sin. Lots of people sinned in the Torah, and they didn't immediately die. There are very few sins whose punishment is death.  perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin  This statement doesn't even make sense.   So, everyone is condemned to die  Again, doesn't follow.  unless, someone qualified steps up and takes on the punishment.  And even if it did, how is it justice for someone else to take your punishment for you? In fact, you should feel ashamed for allowing someone else to make the sacrifice you weren't able to make yourself.  The one that takes on the punishment has to be human,   Again, this doesn't make sense. But if it did, why must they be human?  but they also have to be perfect so that they have the right and the qualification to take on the punishment of the imperfect.  Again, why? Even if you would make a substitution for a regular murder, the person who takes it doesn't have to be perfect.  And once the punishment has been meted out  And you think the law is for punishment, and once the punishment is gone the law can be gone? That's an awful view to take for something God given.   the requirements of the law are fulfilled. But the law is not abolished.  It becomes the same thing. The law we are commanded to keep eternally would no longer be followed.  And then they refute that by saying that God is ONE. But they don't quote any scripture to back that up   Yes, they do. Duet. 6:4  d I already refuted that claim in the above post - there are many places in the Torah that describe God as both ONE and MORE THAN ONE. The trinity isn't a foreign concept to the scriptures.  It is completely foreign. But that discussion is for another post.   What did he do, and how did he get farther than Jesus?  [He almost succeeded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) at expelling the Romans, creating a sovereign state, and rebuilding the Temple, returning Israel to it's former glory. Unfortunately, he failed, and that's that.  Prophecies.  Jesus didn't fulfill them.  Resurrection. Healings of the sick and afflicted.  What does these have to do with the Messiah?     Translations are actually rather easy. Look at all the other occurrences, as well as the root word, and see what meaning it could be. You can do it yourself, [here's the link](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5959.htm). Look through each of the occurrences. Where can it mean specifically virgin, of which there is already a word in hebrew, as opposed to young woman.   Above you.   You can think a lot of things. Why do you think this with all the quotes of the Torah going against you? And that doesn't at all disqualify a trinitarian God either if it's all made up?   	109

In a slow cooker, put 3 peeled, cut in chunks sweet potatoes. Carrots and 2 cups of lentils. 2. In a small skillet, heat oil, put some chopped onions. Add some spices: curry, cumin, salt, pepper, ginger root, garlic. Mix. Add 2 cups of chicken broth, stir for a minute and pour everything into the slow cooker. 3. Put on low heat for 6 hours. 4.

Here's **Jamaican Jerk Chicken** from the book: *Slow Cooker Classics from Around the World*.  ----  *Jerking is a method of seasoning and cooking meat that dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. Meat is marinated in a spicy pastelike sauce and then cooked slowly. Originally cooks would puncture the meat with a sharp object and stuff the holes with a variety of spices. The meat would then be cooked in a deep pit lined with stones over burning pimento (allspice) wood, which gave it a unique smoky flavor.*  ----  #Ingredients  * 1 cup chopped sweet onions, like Vidalia *  cup chopped scallions * 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme * 1 teaspoon salt * 1 teaspoon black pepper * 2 teaspoons sugar * 1 teaspoon ground allspice *  teaspoon ground nutmeg *  teaspoon ground cinnamon * 2 whole jalapeo peppers, sliced * 3 tablespoons soy sauce * 1 tablespoon canola oil * 1 tablespoon cider vinegar * 4 pounds cut-up chicken pieces, skin removed  #One day ahead  Place all ingredients except chicken in the bowl of a food processor. Puree, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times, until mixture is smooth. Place chicken in a large freezer-weight zipper bag. Pour marinade mixture into bag. Close bag and massage chicken so that all pieces are well coated with marinade. Refrigerate chicken in bag overnight.  #To cook  Remove chicken from marinade and place in a 4-quart slow cooker. Discard marinade. Cook on low setting for 3 hours, until chicken has cooked through but is not falling off the bone.  Preheat a gas grill to medium-hot, about 450F. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side.  #To serve  Serve with steamed white rice or boiled fingerling potatoes.  ----  *Jerk chicken usually calls for Scotch bonnet pepper, or the similar habanero. These are the hottest peppers in the capsicum family. I have lightened the spice in this recipe by using jalapeos, which are much milder. If you want to authenticate this recipe and love hot, hot, hot, substitute one scotch bonnet pepper for the jalapeos.*   It's kind of a quiz panel, where the host, Fry, asks obscure but interesting questions.

I paved a road, you created a business (pause) you didn't build **that**.  The question is what *that* refers to. The road or the business? If it's the business, then we can argue your point (can the carpenter claim he built the house?) but if *that* refers to the road, then there isn't any argument, because that statement is true. You didn't build the road, the government did, and you (maybe) paid taxes.   Should have used **those**.

Again and again.   So he wouldn't have to kill me.  Overall, when I rewatched season 1, I noticed that Abigail is portrayed (hinted) to be clever, distant, borderline sociopath and definitely hiding something (as Alana told Jack after first meeting her). I think this also explains why Hannibal was drawn to her so much. He knew what she's capable of.   I think that the trauma made her forget the role the she played and the stuff she knew, but as the season progressed she became more self aware.

Those aren't excuses at all. Those issues are the test, and it's obvious to me the US is failing most the tests it's facing. My point is that some countries almost aren't tested, and therefore shouldn't be scored, at least not on the same scale (and that's a good thing for them, really).   Could be, but then again, what are the challenges facing the press in Malta? Freedom of press is tested when the government has things to hide from the people. Wars, espionage, political scandals, unlawful conducts, corruption, riots and so on. Does Malta face any of that? (I'm asking out of ignorance)   People who are claiming short selling is unethical simply don't understand how the market works and what motivates the players.  1. You are saying that short selling "promotes the spreading of false information". Here's the thing, short seller are the only players - ONLY PLAYERS - with a motivation to spread bad news. Companies, long holders, brokers, stock exchange, politicians - all care about good news. All want to sugar coat everything. All want the stock market in all time high day in day out, as long as the inevitable fall won't happen while they hold the potato.    Short seller play a huge roll in unearthing information.  2. Short sellers also stop down trends. They have an incentive to book profit. During panics, they are a major force that actually buy stocks (to cover). Short sellers only profit when they are back in the market as buyers (as oppose to long holders who hold assets and not necessarily have to sell to realize profits).  3. Short selling ban isn't effective. It was stated even by the fed: [Short-Selling Bans Failed to Prevent U.S. Stock Price Declines - Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2012/rp120810.html).  4. Short selling plays a huge roll in arbitrage trading and forcing many financial instruments to behave as they should. For example, the reason ETFs are trading close to the indices they follow is because of short selling. If a certain ETF opens a gap from its index, arbitrage players long one and short the other. Because of that mechanism, regular retail investors can buy ETFs without worrying too much.   So... what are you saying?   It's not the sub's obsession, it's the wrong generation's obsession.

Alright, alright, alright      Well, they did mention that a big part of the feud was because of an incident between Dickie and Raylan when they were children.

Still, not going to happen.     They just chat to dead characters who spew vague bullshit that rarely affects the narrative.  That's my main issue with hallucination scenes. I don't hate them, but they are so fucking predictable and boring.   The hallucination is the Sopranos, after Tony was shot (season 6), was nicely done. It also lasted few episodes and had the right mix of nonsense and coherent plot.     They don't care, as long as production costs aren't incredibly high  The cost is only half of the equation. HBO cares about subscriptions. Their question is: does this show net generate or net eliminate subs? ratings, while giving some indication, don't answer that question. So in that sense, they don't care about them.    I also like to point out that numbers don't mean much without the overall trend (if homicide rate is [in decline for 2.5 decades](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Number_of_murders_by_year_in_Chicago.png), then permits got nothing to do with that).

If you are a stranger in a strange land, you often feel strongly the illusion of freedom. Especially if you have money. It's easy to live when you are off the grid, ignored by the day-to-day burdens like taxes, health insurance, career choices, family, kids.  Edit: another thing I'd like to add is that in free countries we feel unfree mostly because of what we hear by the media. See news and browse the internet looking for freedom, and you'll feel oppressed and depressed within a week. The flip side of it is when you travel to another country and you simply don't know what's going on around you. The dude is visiting China, one of the largest countries in the world with 1.5 Billion people, he's amazed of all the new things he learned, where in fact, it's like going to a safari in Africa, standing by the entrance and say: this is bullshit, there aren't any lions here, why people are so afraid?

Too Many Cooks... Going on Vacation.   I think that people aren't looking for scores. They are looking for recommendations, which don't necessarily have to come in a form of a number.    I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I'm not saying checks and balances are a good thing. And I'm not saying courts are needed.   I'm talking about the definition of democratic. And if courts sit within that definition.   Democracy, is a form of ruling in which the people chooses representatives every once in a while, and those representatives rule the people. That's not my definition. That's the scholar definition. And a very narrow one. So we can work with that. If you go by the even narrower definition of "rule of the people", then obviously even a parliamentary system isn't democratic. That's fine, but we should work off the same base.  Some democracies are direct. People actually vote on laws. Some of the democracies are of indirect form: representatives make laws. Some of the democracies have few degrees: representatives pick other representatives. For example, the people votes for parties, the parties form a government with a prime minister. The people didn't vote directly for the prime minister, but they trust their elected to do so.  Still, all those forms fall within the scholar definition of democracy (again, not my definition, that's really not that interesting).  What I'm saying is that courts are an extension of that process. Same as the police. I elect someone, that person appoints chief of police (so by proxy, it's like I made that appointment), that chief of police goes back and arrests the person who elected him - **because that's what I, the people, want**. All still working within the democratic framework.   Court is like the central bank or the FDA or the military or sub-committees - all extensions of the government and, by the democratic process, of the people. The fact that its power is used as a balance is irrelevant. So that's where you missed my point.  If, for example, the supreme court was going from father to son, or was a private company with no obligation to the general public. I would have agreed with you - it's undemocratic. If a constitution is irreversible and cannot be amended - it's undemocratic. If the king or queen has any role, it's undemocratic.   Also, just to add something real quick: the fact that in some countries, high courts are appointed to life, is obviously undemocratic.     Courts being able overturn legislation is by the definition of most scholars technically undemocratic.  I'm not sure about that. First, in many cases courts are appointed/approved by the an elected officials (or their representatives), so they are democratic by proxy. Second, courts interpret the law, which was also written by elected officials. They don't make up new laws. So that's again democratic. Third, they find contradictions between the law and the constitution. Meaning, they make sure the legislative branch is operating within the boundaries of the law (you can't rob someone, they can't make laws that contradict other laws).  There can be some exceptions here and there (just like a president or prime minister overusing executive power), but the overall structure is still inherently democratic.

Okay, it's kind of a weird one. The husband is a high level manager in a weapon technology company. He and his wife relocated to Singapore for a couple of years to be his company's representative in the east. They lived really well over there. Just few months in, his wife got into coma. I really don't know the exact circumstances of that. She was treated there and he decided to stay (instead of moving back with her to his home country). He was able to get her mom a visa and flew her there also.   A little more than a year passed, probably the longest year in his life,  and she woke up. After 1-2 weeks in the hospital (physical therapy, checks and such)  she was released. However, she was completely different person.  She started getting into mystical stuff, Buddhism, crystals, connection with the after life, tarot reading. She started playing guitar.  None of the things she had mattered to her. She hated the luxury apartment building they lived in, hated that she had a chauffeur and a maid, hated money and hated her husband's job.   It's not like she was ungrateful or resentful. She was simply different. Anyway, that's how he described it. He loved her deeply, but it's like they had nothing in common. Almost felt like an arranged marriage.   I met her couple of years ago (which was about 5 years after she left him) and she was nice, but very hard to talk to. She seemed detached a little bit. Still into that mystical stuff (I guess, because she mentioned something about my aura).  I don't know what happened to her while she was in a coma, and I don't know if other people react like that and how commom this is. But I guess it can change a person.    X post to /r/crappydesign.   Yeah, in Hollywood films the men always have courage when women are involved. I guess they were trying to show something different.       you name it, she will have it  Also, there's no guarantee she'll even want to be in a relationship after she wakes up. I know someone who woke up after a year of coma, and few months after divorced her husband. She wad changed, and needed time to find herself again.   If she'll be in the same situation (who knows), OP will feel betrayed. It will crush him. But then again, you can't really blame her for that.

Besides, telling anything meaningful to anybody you don't know, is mostly stupid.   Yes, but to be fair, OP didn't say: "I don't have money, so I'm not going to spend it on entertainment" (which is a valid statement, regardless of the money you have or the cost). He said: "I'm broke... next month for sure!", meaning he wants to spend $5 on something like that, but he can't do it right now. That's a very fragile situation to be in, and one should probably try to change it as much as they can.      /r/justiceporn is leaking to nypost.

But what if life expectancy goes higher (without enhanced quality), meaning people will stop working at 70 but will live until 140? That's not far fetched, and it's actually the current trend. Or what if less people will decide to have children while immigration is staying low? Japan is facing that problem.   I'm not saying SS is bad by any means, I'm glad societies have nets. However, we can't ignore the risk and the price of those programs. They might stop working.    Expect to subscribe to /r/atheism soon. Expect to unsub soon after. Expect more porn from this point on.   Yeah, that was the beautiful part in that website.    Why can't I pay slave wages to underage boys??   That's usually the time that nostalgic alone sells tickets and sells well. Their original fan base is grown up, has money, and a tour in large cities is booked easily.   From the side bar:    It doesn't have to be old people, necessarily.   It took 35 minutes of self convincing before he decided to "try it out".    Of course, you are right. So the problem is shareholders aren't doing their job and rubber stamp other people's decisions. That needs to be changed.   About institutional investors. This is only partially correct. The majority holders at large firms are institutional. But those are mostly mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity and such). The investors in those funds get to vote, and they even get periodically proxy vote by mail. If they ignore it, the fund will vote for them.  Anyway, saying that CEO get high compensation because of some committee is really putting the blame on the least significant part of the entire process.    Google is a growing company. Their 25+ PE indicates investors also perceive it that way. They expect the company to grow and invest in opportunities as it see fits, and they are willing to pay a premium for that chance. Paying dividends will send the opposite signal and will probably crash the stock price on the long term.     CEO compensation committee  I'm sorry but no committee is determining the CEO compensation. The committee, if exists - not all companies have it - is part of the board of directors and simply recommends the best salary they see fit. The board is the one that decides and approves compensations.  The board is also directly assigned by the shareholders. And many times CEO compensation goes to a vote by the shareholders.  Also, in some countries there's "say on pay" corporate laws, which means that even if the board made a salary decision without shareholders vote, they (the shareholders) are entitled to call the compensation to a vote and change it.  TL;DR instead of blaming the board is we should blame (the far being CEOs) shareholder.

It sounds obvious, but not many people get it: if more roads are built, more traffic will be on them until jammed. So you're right, this route will just buy time.   Hey man, I was browsing on my phone, and I can't even copy a direct link to the comment, so I suggested someone else to do it. Looks like it rubbed your fur the wrong way.   Correct me if I'm wrong, that's assuming you overwrite it every time. What if you manually edit it and add some personal entries? I know I do, the host file isn't just for blocking ads. That makes the update a little more complicated.    To be fair, you want to hire a person that takes his hobbies seriously, yet still keep it under control. OP, you should have checked that one.    Someone should X it to /r/bestof.   You can merge this [file](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip) with your host file.  Also see: [How to edit host files](http://www.sysprobs.com/how-to-edit-host-file-in-windows-8-1-8)  There are several disadvantages of using host file:   1. It's hard to keep the list up-to-date. 2. It takes time to modify it if you want to enable ads (for example, a site doesn't load, and you want to enable ads to see if that's the problem). 3. You can't whitelist sites (for example, you can't enable ads on Reddit). 4. It won't work if the ad is hosted on a legitimate domain. 5. It probably doesn't block YouTube ads (but I'm not sure)   Pucks.            You get interest from the broker, depends on the agreement you have with it (which is the borrowing costs the short seller is paying for the privilege to sell a stock that he didn't buy). The interest rate can be regular market interest or it can be higher for "hard to borrow" securities. Also keep in mind that some brokers won't even tell you they are lending your stocks to someone else. I'm not sure if they are obligated to inform you or even pay you.      Depth gif maybe?   Yeah, but BB just ended last year. in 5 years (at least), which is probably the time between the end of the show and the last book people will discuss spoilers without even mentioning them as spoilers. You'll just see images and references.    As in the famous words of McNulty: Shit never fucking changes.   Oh man, thanks for sharing this. I think I watched the entire show all 20 seasons at least 3 times, not counting all the random reruns. I miss Orbach, and if this is from March 2004, so it's about half a year before he died.    "You look sad, is everything okay?" is better than "I can see the pain when I looked into your eyes, oh and you are pretty".   Why in hell aren't you turning off subreddits' styles? That's the real question here.   Nothing can be assumed safe. For anything else, /r/conspiracy.   Okay, so that's a different point: no culture is really explored. Maybe that's right, I don't claim to support or oppose it. Western culture are familiar to the world (not just to western players), so it's hard to draw the line on where the exploration begins and when the knowing just exists.   For example, I'm playing now Dragon Age: Inquisition. Knights Templar, Chantry, and other similar terms are all from the western christian history. They need little exploration, because they are known. If they used terms from the Yoruba religion, they would have needed much more exploration and explanation.   Other games have hundreds of references to American culture (language, media, style, technology, appearance). The nuances are built in.   [Esperanza Spalding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aRC3YY3svs).   Giving 1 or 2 examples of each region (out of thousands of games) pretty much proves OP's point. The examples themselves are also very poor. Placing a zombie game in Turkey doesn't exactly explore the culture (exactly as Spec Ops: The Line doesn't explore Dubai). It's just different settings.    r / I'm 14 and this is funny   Another twist: the parents hated the house and their life, so they committed suicide by setting it on fire. You get nothing.

Before the ring corrupted him completely.  Edit: here, that's the Hobbit bread, Stoors.  http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stoors   I agree with you, but consider that it's kind of a mystery exactly how the ring affects the bearer. Especially Hobbits, which considered to be special kind when it comes to the ring. That's what defines Bilbo so nicely, he's being the exception here. Don't forget that Smeagol, another Hobbit, killed his best friend just moments after finding it.    For *expectation* of 4% rise in rates, you'll probably see 20-25% drop in LT bonds.   The Idiot is a great book. It's a good start to his work. As always with Russian classics, it's good to read also some brief guide about the major themes. I do that after I'm half way through.    But isn't TC an open source? I'm still using 6.1a and didn't see any reason to think it's compromised. Am I wrong here? What's a good alternative?    Or, and I'm going to through a wild far fetched theory here, maybe in the 50's there were very few cameras and most of the photos we see today were made by professionals to look nice and tidy. Those who looked bad were thrown away. AKA survivorship bias.   That was after Kanye Paul collaboration. It had 1,065 views 2 months ago. I know because it was posted to /r/listentoobscure.

Use BND and BNDX to cover debt. Use VNQ and VNQI to cover REIT. That's it.   Here's the my method of cooking a perfect rice in a pot. It works every time. For me, it always tastes better than rice cooker. So give it a try:  1. Heat 1 spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid 2. Boil water in a separate pot (or use water boiler) 3. Add 1 chopped onion to the heated oil. Saute until soft and transparent. 4. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot. Stir it so it will all be covered in oil. about 2-3 minutes. This will prevent the rice from sticking, and it also hardens it a little. 5. At this point your water should be boiled and ready. 6. Add 1.75 cups of boiled water. Add another cup for extra cups of rice you used (so if you cooked 2 cups of rice, that would be 2.75 cups of water). 7. Stir just a little, make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer (pretty much the minimal heat). 8. Let it cook for 20 minutes, don't touch it. 9. After 20 minutes, the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot. Uncover, stir gently with a fork, let it rest for 10 minutes. 10. That's it.  Now, the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies. It depends on the type of rice (short, medium or long grain, where it came from, etc.). So the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste.   /r/dataisbeautiful      omg it was written about me )):    I wish dates were like this still  Then got out with your date and drink a fucking milkshake in a diner, it's not like it's illegal.

I don't care about the price of the stock, because the share is the same. The broker is just the middleman, helping us meet without knowing each other, and making sure that we both meet our end of the deal.    I am but a simple scientist.   No shit, Sherlock.   For 6 seasons, they were both in each other's business, with separate plots that always cross paths somehow. However, they only meet 2-3 times each season.   That makes each conversation intense without overdoing it. They have this unique blend of knowing one another ("I know him, we used to dig coal together") and still be on the opposite sides, trying to figure out what the next move and what each is hiding.   Don't forget for a second the 47%.   I didn't say easy, I said easiest. Other sides in trading are not only harder but also harder to learn: position sizing, risk management, trade management, portfolio construction, emotional obstacles, biases, big picture, etc. When taking advice from TV (Cramer or others) you never learn about those parts and they never touch it.      He's a smart man and knows the business inside-out (wallstreet, trading and tv), but I wouldn't take stock advice from him. Not because he's often wrong (and he is. Nobody can discuss 10-12 stocks daily on TV without being often wrong) but mainly because it's bad practice. Besides, picking stocks is the easiest part if you want to trade successfully.    Looks like you don't know that English was a Christian tradition, started by Slavic to absorb the Germanic language. Which I find comic as fuck. I guess I'm just a good bad serial person. Soz.   I used to watch that show on a daily basis in the gym. It's great financial entertainment, but I wouldn't take any advice from it (nor would I take from anything on TV). Edit: I was just making a general comment. You picked a good show for OP.   Israel doesn't have a constitution, some states don't (UK and NZ, for example). However, they do have [Basic Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel), which is very close. They define the roles of the government and civil rights [Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Human_Dignity_and_Liberty_(Israel) being one of them). The legislative branch cannot draw laws that contradicts the Basic Laws, or the court will overturn them (it happened before).     hannibal is at nearly every single crime scene  He started going to crime scenes only after he met Will and Jack (and actually wasn't part of many investigations in the first season).

Story of life.   Swedish Jan Guillou wrote the  autobiographical novel "Evil" which movie adaption (2003) got an oscar nomination for best foreign film.   On Topic: He also wrote a trilogy about late 12th century Sweden. Called **The Templar Knight**  **Short Synopsis:** An unstable Sweden before it was Sweden.   In one of families fighting with the present king is Arn who get sent to a monastery as a young boy. There he learn one of the foreign Monks once was a Templar Knight in "The Holy Land".   About a third of books takes place in an around Jerusalem and Gaza. It tells the buildup to the Battle of Hattin and about the major characters involved in that battle.  I recommend both the books and the movies which got Stellan Skarsgrd and a lot of swedish people. Boys and girls.   I think The Trooper is as good a historic lyric as Alfred Tennyson's poem about the same battle.  And the foolish Earl Cardigan spawned out of the aristocratic England still got a mark in history as a frickin' sweater.   Have a nice summer folks.

I would say that is the best playable version of Westeros where you can carve your way as a Hedge Knight to a rich Lord.   The Christmas Carol could work.  Also show her "are you my mommy?"    I hate Mace Tyrell in the show. He's such a bottomless character just put there for comic relief. It wasn't even funny in his first scenes. Can't fathom how they carried it into season 5...   I feel like upkeep costs are higher for the land owning lords of Westeros than it is in Essos. Slaves and such makes for cheap labour for when it's needed. And Wine is cheap.

I enjoy watch grrm talk,  but lately I think George have become a bit of a hypocrite. Some people will tear me a new asshole or call me unfair for criticizing him, because apparently he is God.  But here we go.. All he's ever talked about in interviews is how he like to make his readers feel unsafe when their favorite character is threatened. And I have agreed with him. I did feel unsafe reading Game of Thrones.. At least after Ned's beheading.   But now he's changed perspective completely. Apparently it doesn't matter if you are worried about you characters when you read anymore. Now it's the "journey that matters" nevermind what he has always said before...   I just think it would be more admirable if he faced the problem with his back straight, admitting this is not an ideal situation, but we just have to cope.   Instead of changing his point of view to fit HBO's opinion...    George wrote one verse and the "chorus", correct me if I'm wrong.   And who are you, the proud lord said,  that I must bow so low?

I'd argue saying a word of mouth wheel like this where streams spread the word makes for a tighter community. People watching streams are often active on forums such as reddit.    Same here.. At least for the chill gamez like KSP, Total War, etc.   Since trees are a resource I am sceptical it will be implemented into the game.   You can already place trees ingame though, but not by brush.   Great idea! Land value could be a way of controlling education-level provided.   If they manage their expansion-development mainly focusing on adding more features, leaving textures and modelling largely to the community they could keep this game alive for years with people keep buying expansions.   I don't have a good sense of reference because I'm only active in a couple of subs. But how many subscribers are that for a game releasing in 3 days?    Probably means he's gonna lose an ear.

Are you German or is that word taking root? The English language has been missing it for to long.    I'm ten minutes in, and I find your podcast really interesting!  I admit I haven't listened to many others before, but those I have tried has not caught my attention.   Agree with your order completely!    tuung   I need to see that one. Sounds like me watching the show with my unsullied friends.    The paning through the images feel a bit off sometimes. Try zooming out from faces, keeping the attention on the characters. And the voice the reader does for Dunk is horrible.   Otherwise the moods and everything feels great. I can imagine the process to be quite time consuming, but I could see this as a nice way of enjoying the story though copyright will most likely take it down.     In theory.    I call bs on all news twow that doesn't come from grrm himself.    I think they should wait for multiplayer.. It would really boost sales.    I find let's plays without narrating a bit pointless. But I understand, it's hard to find something to talk about and I think Scott Manley got it right with the "New me" and "Old me". That way you can put voiceover where you blabber about pointless things, say something stupid. Or such :)  Also, fastforward your launches. I get tired by just watching my own, again and again! ^^  Anpther tip is to do a better description. List your mods and stuff and do a short summery of what the episode is all about.   Otherwise I really liked the video and the creations.   Rhaegar were firstborn and therefore heir to the throne, if Jon is his trueborn son by a secret marriage (I doubt it)  Jon would be next in line (if Aegon is fake)    I'd take the liberty to say that the garrison's morale would improve slightly if food came after nearly two years under siege..   I do it to free up my hands for other stuff. It's great to just put on headset and do some dishes while you listen to the battle of the blackwater. (did that today)  Biking to school, grocery shopping. Well. All tedious stuff you have to do becomes enjoyable. I discovered time goes a lot faster while you're concentrating on a book than it does listening to music.   The hour of creature is just common saying. In Swedish for example we have "vargatimmen", or "the hour of the wolf" which is the hours just before dawn.      Short film based on a poem by Terry Bisson.   Two aliens sit in a diner discussing the human race.      Great with a new fleshy interview!   Hey, that was awesome! Both text and music!   You should live here: http://www.acreresidency.org/flatfile/upload/1298964274-picture_11.png   EmergencyAwesome is the most generic and robotlike youtuber I have ever come across. I have seen a lot of his aSoIaF-videos, and wow.  He really is proof that anyone can be a youtuber if you work(edit) hard enough. And I can respect that!   Yeah! I think I noticed that line to when reading the comic. Dunk   Egg are so underrated.   hear, hear.   Yeah, Tyrells are like Italians.    wow.. this will be so lame. as tthorn23 said. Buy the strategy board game instead, prefferably with Feast for Crows expansion pack.      Took me about 12 hours to manage the same. But I had a dude guiding me when I needed some help. Congratulations on your accomplishment!   The amazing feeling you felt when you landed will happen again, and again and again. That's the beauty of this game!   Ari Gold. He would probably be king or the Castle.    Well, it's the three released novellas released with artwork on every page. Not a comic but an illustrated book.   It is known.   	105

 Typing is hard when the disconnected top half of your head just flops around when you talk.        LOL "No dude.. I don't want them to tell me what she did... I just want them to tell me what she did."    its a dumbass a minute here in /r/news....      Too stupid for that realization to have a positive effect on choices.     The question is based off false premise.  I will not be suckered into a dogma trap.   *The debate was about the misrepresentation of the Cuban program and the difference between what Americans think "quarantine" is vs. what it ACTUALLY is.*   That's it.  Your further echoing of the misconceptions is proof that people don't have a fucking clue about what the program actually was or is.  Instead, you try and sucker the debate into, "should we or shouldn't we do this in the USA".... when ironically, we do a LOT WORSE in the USA where we criminalize and punish medical problems.  When on the contrary, this internationally participated cuban program did nothing oppressive and instead lifted people up.     So you can try to obfuscate with hypotheticals all you want but THE REALITY of the situation is that no one was oppressed or punished or abused, harmed, or had a gun pointed in their face.   They didn't round up masses of people who had or were accused of having AIDS.  They simply said, "Come to our clinics, get tested, and if positive we will enroll you into this medical program.   No one marched anyone into those government offices with a goddamn gun. And the public saw how well it was working out for people with a disease that kills millions, that people who got AIDS happily walked into the office and got the care they needed.     I deal in facts... not made up situations and dishonest ignorance.     "What if the cuban government used guns?"    "They didn't"   "no dude but what if.... you know it's CUBA"   "Ok but they didn't need to use guns because the patients came to them on their own free will"    "Yeah but if they didn't want to... cuba guns!"    They don't use guns because the people who don't want to participate simply don't get tested in the government clinic.    But who'd not want all that sweet medical care to make sure this death sentence doesn't kill them?   No one.   Which is why it worked and why they don't needs guns, didn't use guns, and had no plans on ever using guns to enforce the law.      *Laws don't need guns if they actually help people.  Because there is already huge incentive to follow the law if it benefits you in some way.*     But who could blame you, you're so used to living under "You can't you can't you can't" USA laws.      As a gay male I welcome such a show.      Hey, if the majority believes that the IRS is operating deathpanels to victimize this photo of a depressed cowboy wiping his tears with a tattered US flag, then it's really happening.     The MCP didn't exist yet though so no.      He's gotta be planted by Dems.... I can't accept that this is all real.  He HAS to be a trojan horse....  /tinfoil exposure   My tinfoil is showing all over my head....    But does anyone else get the feeling that Trump is working for democrats to make republicans look bad?    The issue of the debate is the misrepresentation of what this Cuba program was.  And how people see the word "quarantine" and they equate it with punishment and abuse.  Americans are so used to punishement being apart of the system that they think it is apart of every system.  It has nothing to do with the USA treating medical needs as criminal acts.  (which is far worse than what cuba is doing with this program). The USA practice of criminalizing and punishing medical problems displays a reality that is... well... sickeningly ironic.  Yet you just keep blabbing about "its criminal".   Which supports my point.     But to clarify: This isn't about that.... this debate was about what this cuba program REALLY was, and how ignorant people don't have a fucking clue what "quarantine" is in real life.     The only thing most of them know about what "quarantine" is, is a hollywood misrepresentation. And this debate proves that because people keep arguing from the false premise that AIDS patients were being punished and that quarantine=punishment.     This is the same misrepresentation that you keep echoing here.   I can abide ignorance... but willful ignorance.  That just makes me sick to my stomach.  I'd feel sorry for you if I didn't feel like barfing right now.    I'm  done here.     I hindsight it was Andy Kaufman humor I think.   It's funny because it's so very not funny....    I never liked andy.   The only thing insulting here is your direct misrepresentation of what this program was and your ignorance behind what quarantine actually is.  But hey, I guess I can't blame you because you've succumbed to accepting that everything in this world is centered around punishment; like many in the USA have.  Good luck being willfully ignorant.  It's so bad it's almost dishonest.   What?   The government wasn't involved. In either case of Cuba or the usa.     Cuba had 2 other international groups involved and the USA the government clinics were the main group trying to help whilst the private institutions fucked over patients.   We're you even alive during this time?    Edit: the discussion was about the misrepresentation of the Cuba program and not if we should do it in the USA or not.  Which we do...  but that's another can of worms.        ^good ^story.   Yeah, no guns were used.  You know there were 2 other international groups involved with this right?   I'm just going to put you on ignore because you're a fucking obfuscating moron.  And you don't even know enough about the issue to discuss it properly.   Gotta be trollolololing all the the way to trollololol land.     Oh okay so in the USA we treat people with a disease as criminals and lock them up in shitty rehab facilities that don't really help them.   Cuba took people with a disease that kills millions upon millions, and is scary as fuck... they take them and care for them, and help with with mental health, with medicine, with education and the results were fantastic.  Oh but because some men with guns MIGHT show up (we don't know that they would) it's all bad.    I'm done replying to you now.  You're ridiculous.      Well let see... that never happened so apparently what they are doing is working for them.     The point is people are making shit up and misrepresenting the facts.  Whilst ignoring that we do a LOT worse in the USA.      They send a mental health professional to convince you to go.  SO you do.   The funny thing is, that the program was so great that no one ever had to use guns.  The patients were glad to go! So I guess we'll never know if they would use guns or not.    How naive you must be to think that's not the case.  But that isn't the case... you just made it up.  No guns were used or need to be used because people go so willingly because it takes good care of them.   LOL.   Just make shit up and claim people are naive for not agreeing with it.       No no....We were discussing purely what cuba did and how he misrepresented it.    No one is talking about doing this in the USA.    The issue was, that he was making it out to be some kind of brutal men with guns quarantine, when it was absolutely NOTHING like that.   And again... the USA quarantines drug abusers all the time.      Fair point.  However, I have to point out that those diseases didn't come with irrational fear (because ignorance), and they also didn't come with a social stigma attached.  If you had AIDS, it automatically meant you were a homosexual and/or drug abuser.  Did anyone stop to think that you weren't either of those two things and that you might have simply caught it from having sex with monkeys?     I joke, but that's what it was like for sufferers during the late 80s and most of the 90s.   It's a joke and it's not fucking funny; but it was the sophomoric reality that people with AIDS had to deal with.   No one with diabetes had to face that kind of stupidity or scrutiny.         Aside from STDs, no other disease really comes with that stigma. The medical community based a lot of its initial reaction to the AIDS crisis on irrational fears rather than science.  The medical community didn't really know what to do and AIDS was scary as fuck.      Good thing that isn't what is happening here.     I'm not talking about white guys who claim to be rasta.  I'm talking about the core of the religion in Jamaica... it isn't welcoming to whites.  It doesn't regard whites as evil.  [It regards blacks as superior and they will eventually rule the world.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/beliefs/black.shtml)    These ideas were developed in part by [Marcus Garvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey), who is considered a prophet by many rastafarians.     These white dudes in the USA just claim to be rasta because some marijuana is used in some rituals and they think it gives them the freedom to get stoned.    We will see fewer and fewer white dudes resorting to these measures as marijuana becomes legal.  There's no reason for the act anymore.... as if a judge would actually buy the "religious freedom" shit about white rastafarians smoking dope at a Big Day Out concert.       ok then.  I guess i don't mind then.      The alcohol religion already exists.  Catholics consume shitloads of wine.      Isn't the Rastafarian church prohibitive towards whites in general?     I love this verse.   Cannabis was used as medicine and relaxation during the bible times.    "For so the Lord said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."  Isaiah ch18 v 4     Isaiah went home to relax and smoke some weed.  God told him to do it.  Edit:  In the next verse he goes on to talk about how and when to properly harvest the purple sticky punch.    *"5 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches."* Isaiah 18v5     So he tells us when to get the PRIMO nugs.   Which is when they are about the size of grapes... as they would have been before modern genetic strains.   The buds would be purple or green and have a sour smell.  And you cut away the branches so they don't dry out and pull water from the buds.     edit:bananas and touchscreens   She didn't mention any of it being in her backyard.   Sarah is smart and grows it inside.      Oh NO!  Would someone think of the backyards!  That's where my children play!         The USA was terrible in its treatment of AIDs patients until about 2000... even then, people could not afford treatment and were forced to utilize the free clinics.   Which did nothing for the patient but send them back on the street with a script for medicine they couldn't afford.     You keep insinuating that men with guns shipped people off.... they didn't.   This is no different than a government mandating that drug users be quarantined to locked down rehabilitation institutions.    Oh But because **"Cuba"** this program HAD to be brutal, with crying people screaming with outstretched arms and spread fingers, as they are stripped from their loved ones, and thrown in the back of a some wagon and hauled away For e Ver.. For e Ver... For e Ver..  oh and the truck runs over a little girls teddy bear on the way out because communism.   Get real....           Your ignorance about what quarantine actually is, is astounding.      You sound like you think quarantine is like what they show on television.... It's not.  Edit: you need to go fucking read about the "quarantine"  of these patients and how they were treated.  They were well provided for and many volunteered go stay longer than the mandatory treatment.   They weren't mistreated in any way  and most of the patients expressed how happy they were to have the service.     They considered what they received as a gift.   Yet you keep acting like they were terribly treated and stuck in some prison dungeon somewhere.   Lol gtfo with that nonsense.  In many developed nations the patient is just sent to deal on their own and rot to death in ignorance.   You guys are lucky.   I never lose myself in my head when I'm high.   I'm usually very detail oriented and I make double sure everything is done correctly.    TLDR: getting stoned turns me into a boring and analy retentive but productive loser.    And God bless a land free of the Harry Reids.    FTFY    Yeah this " evolution" has worked out great for the middle class, has it not?   OK they weren't locked up in a torture chamber Hollywood depiction quarantine.....   they were very comfortable and received mental health care, medicine, and education about their disease.    The headline made it seem like men with guns were taking people against their will and locking them away in torture chambers forever.     They were not. And most of the patients were happy about it when it was over.    Yet people like you keep acting like it was E.T. or outbreak or a zombie movie....    A service based economy, which is essentially economy based on doing each other's laundry, may create jobs but does not create wealth.   This needs to be repeated over and over again.   Then tax the ever living fuck out of companies that do that and give tax breaks to ones that do it here.     Make it so shipping jobs overseas is no longer profitable.  Edit: down vote this all you want.  Continue supporting corporate greed and suffer     Why not?   They are human beings like anyone else.   I wasn't aware that location, skin, and language had anything to do with the quality of the manufactured product    Me and my gilding trophy have joined the team.     A side note, somehow "costed" is in my damn touchscreen's autoincorrect; so I'm willing to give him a pass.   I don't like interrupting conversations to admonish a stutter of words.  Usually others around think I'm a dick if I do that.   Thank you for injecting some much needed sanity around.  Bernie is great.  We are all excited about his campaign; just don't lose your heads.  Bernie's awesomess may make other candidates look undesirable but that doesn't delegitimize their participation in this election.   Yes!  It's because the only gay they are exposed to are the perverts running around naked and doing lude things at the gay pride parade.    So the older generations see this and it just confirms their prescribed view on gays.   They think if you're gay then you're swallowing cock in the alley before shooting up heroin.   Exactly.  It doesn't matter if a quote contradicts the outcome....   That's more like real life.  In reality we've got lots of good quotes from real people that contradicts with the condition of our world.        The thing about  microbrews is, once in a while you get an awesome beer.  But the mountains of shit beers you have to taste in order to find it is not worth it.    Microbrewery beers to seem cool....it's too much effort.      What?  Shutup, dick bucket.   I think it's a testament to his ability to write a dynamic story.   Not every character was the same or delivered the same message.     The quote does not assert absolutes; that it is a certainty that EVERY man that seeks power will be corruptible.  The quote is expressing that power simply attracts the corruptible and because of that you should not blindly trust those who wield it or seek it.    ELI5: Bird feeders attract a shitload of squirrels so don't think its all cute birds you're feeding.         So the quote doesn't really contradict the overall events or outcome of the story.       Oh great... so in conjunction with the mass emails I don't read, I'm going to get a bunch of annoying text messages I also won't read.  After hundreds of shit emails why bother going through it all to possibly find one gem.   So now my phone will be blowing up all day?  I'll just take the battery out.    Hello Universities!  Have topic subscriptions for christ sakes.   I don't give a fuck about the meeting for planning the meeting for planning the discussion on where the "dumb idiots with the frisbees" will hold their "pre-tournament pre-practice exhibition championship first round series trilogy matchup."      And I swear to the unholy dark lord satan sith Paobeast, If I get another goddamn email about the injustice of your stolen-(forgotten)-from-cafeteria laptop and how your entire degree hangs in the balance of your non backup having ass....    Grr... Did you not read the 30 other emails this month from other people that did the same damn thing all over campus?     Oh wait... that's right, no one reads that shit.  Campus email is the craigslist version of reddit.       Most microbrews taste so bad you'll just give up drinking.   Mmmmm cheese layered meatloaf.      Holy shit dude I'm sorry.     I have phantom limb but I'd take that over phantom itch any day.      Mine turned into a hard plastic or glass material after sitting in the back of a Humvee for 7 hours.      It's all right click rotate... right click rotate....  then you're good.     I can't believe, you actually had to spell it out like this, in order for people to grasp the concept.     Who'd wanna kiss these idiots?   Extras got PAID????   AIDs is nothing like those other diseases you mentioned so we can just scrap that part of the discussion into the false premise can.      Who's advocating we lock people up into torture centers?   NO ONE.      But you can send people to a comfortable place, where they can be educated about their new disease, given medicine to prolong their health, and receive an endless number of benefits.   As we are seeing, these types of programs are working and the patients themselves are taking value in them.     Who the fuck here has advocated that we lock anyone into a torture chamber where they receive no care and are victimized?     NOT A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON.    You're right... it's DEFINITELY a dumbass a minute right now.    Fucking acting like people are saying we should lock people up in hollywood's idea of quarantine, never to be released.   Pllllzzzzz.... gtfo with that nonsense LOL    Without a doubt, there should be no choice about quarantine when it comes to contagious diseases like Ebola.     That being said these types of diseases, while super fast acting, sort of snuff themselves out easier.    AIDs kills far more people than Ebola, BECAUSE it is so quiet and slow.  It has the opportunity to spread to more people because of it's silence.      So I'd argue that educational quarantine for new infections is of extreme importance.  Not only is the first 5 years of the disease a crucial treatment period and the victim should be educated about that, but we can also teach some much needed knowledge about what practices are safe and which are not in, in regards to transmitting the disease to others.    Thus, we can help negate some of the exposure to the disease that this virus has gained through ignorance coupled with it's stealthy nature.     Ebola is the crazy loud shooting spree type killer whilst AIDs is the quiet serial killer.       edit: william murderface    Fucking awesome this second link.   I can just make my own and not even have to purchase the erasers.  I'm sure I can tweak the recipe for better performance.  I'm very picky about my erasers.  can't be too hard or too soft.    This means I can buy my daughter a snack to go along with her trips to the Hand On museum.  And I can keep doing as much art as I want.    I... I didn't get YOU anything.      You are proof of my original assertion that people don't have a clue what quarantine means or how it helps people.  Too bad ignorance is not something we can quarantine for...but I guess ignorance is just the quarantine of your mind from reality.  SO....    Good luck to you, friend.     meh... Cuba isn't half as bad as china.   China really does suck.   Ive been living in asia for over a year.  China does a lot of shit that never makes the news in the usa it seems.      China sucks, fuck china.   After finding out such emotional news, I'd certainly want to be more grounded in science and logic.  That could be soothing to the fear, to be able to hear the science behind it, the treatment, to hear that death is not necessarily knocking on the door.     What such a life changing event needs is rational objectivity.  Not more drama.     Until you realized clenching caused the cuts to bleed, soothing the pain and enabling you to continue angrily clenching your fists until blood drips from them.   Which blood would help to soothe.   I always squeeze my papercuts until they bleed.  Then there is no pain and I don't get the ridiculous talking mouth on fingertip problem.      The quarantine might actually benefit the patient.   When Americans hear the word "quarantine" it seems like they think of E.T. and Outbreak... and all the zombie movies.     But "quarantine" doesn't automatically mean the patient gets shipped off to brutal torture institutes.    And the first 3 or 4 weeks of being diagnosed you're not gonna want to be sitting around your mother nagging over "You shoulda used a condom... how many times did I tell you to use clean needles.... if you weren't having butt sex this wouldn't happen... blah blah blah"      I've tried that before.  The clumps always just fall out of it eventually.  I haven't had a lot of luck.   I also don't like those soft "ticky-tack" erasers for graphite because they don't perform the same each time and end up laying down more mark than they lift off.      I do a ton of art, mostly charcoal but I do a ton of sketch work, with graphite, before going to charcoal.    This is where I work out mistakes...  and I'm not a very good artist so I have to fix, and fix, and fix, until it's right.   I don't just draw it all expert like as I see on Youtube.     So that leaves me with all these bits and chunks of erasers, that are each too small to use individually, but when piled together would make a very large eraser.     I store them in a small paint can that I dump out when it gets full.     How do I stick these guys together?   Can they be melted and remolded?  If I can reclaim these erasers, I'll save at least $14.75 a month; which means I'll have enough to take my daughter to her favorite Hands-on Museum each weekend.     seems dumb, to administer a medication to people, without even doing a physical first; let alone consult with a doctor at all.           I'm *TRYING*!   2nd Amendment Socialists!!  I'm one too!      Yes....  I'm saying the farmers are collecting WAY MORE than 23 gallons per cow.   They've got hundreds or thousands of gallons that evaporate each day in their pointless retention ponds that sit out in the sun all day.  I've driven by to see them keep the retention ponds full in bare fields they aren't using for cattle at the time.    At least if the cow drank it or it was used to grow alfalfa then it was USED for SOMETHING.       Just leaving it to evaporate out of some hole in the desert means the water was lost for NOTHING.       The word should have been caucus but... autoincorrect.     Should have read "As a VP she is useless to our caucus."     Right.  We need a revolution at the polls.  90% turnout or this isn't going to work.   And even then it will be hard.   Some districts don't even field two candidates because the new gerrymandered district is nearly 100% one party.   So they get seats no matter what happens at the polls.     At least we could hope for super majorities.      I actually, on several posts, already made the point that one should not see the reboot if they are the purist mentality.    I simply conveyed The Purist's way of thinking.  At no point did I endorse or condone it.     Chillax.   [Halliburton/KBR Open Burn pits.    ](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/01/22/kbr-iraq-lawsuits-supreme-court/22158399/) FUCK DICK CHENEY!

Her vote in the Senate is much more important if Bernie get's elected.    He's gonna get the shit stonewalled out of him if we don't overturn all of congress too.    As a VP she is useless to our cause.   [The Presidents Song](http://animaniacs.wikia.com/wiki/The_Presidents_Song_\(song\)).  Dot: Now in Washington, DC...   Wakko: There's Democrats and the GOP...   Yakko: But the one in charge is plain to see...   Dot: It's Clinton, first name Hillary!   Hopefully they don't do something stupid like make her VP.  Retaining her voting power in the Senate is much more important.    Bernie is gonna get stonewalled by congress worse than Obama ever did.   Especially if we don't turn out every member of congress that doesn't have a voting record that supports people instead of corporations.    When I was a kid, we had a Shih Tzu, named Ting Su (racist?) that used to hunt down chocolate.  She'd never touch any food within reach, but leave a Hershey kiss within reach and it was gone; it's existence to be memorialized as shredded bits of foil in the grass.  One Christmas, we were unaware that she had consumed a family sized bag of holiday mint M Ms.    Ting Su knew the candies were hidden inside the wrapped gift the moment my grandmothers bulging knuckled hands placed it upon the carpet of needles beneath the dry as fuck Christmas tree.  Those acidic smelling needles, that would take weeks of vacuuming to remove, did nothing to hide the existence of those sweet smelling chocolates.  Ting Su's nose was ninja.  A ninja with a stupid cloth antler collar on.     She waited until everyone left.  She knew what she was doing was wrong.  And she knew we would find her mess upon our return.   She carefully picked up the gift, as if it were one of the many puppies of the numerous litters she raised.  She quickly skulked down the hallway to the last door on the right.  She quickly ducked underneath the bed; where she would be hidden by the flowery bed-skirt and boulders of dust bunnies.  Her sharp teeth make quick work of all impeding packaging and she was rewarded with her 16 oz prize.    She played it cool upon our return.  No one knew of her misdeeds.   She was a "good girl," "a pretty dog," and strange sounds whilst human places mouth on top of head.   For me, nothing seemed amiss.  She laid her head gently in my small lap.  I really wasn't prepared for the traumatic event that was about to occur. I pulled her limp head up so I could see into her dark black eyes.  Those ebony globes ordinarily full of love had a different quality to them.    I moved in closer for a better look and then it happened.   Her body made a jerk.  A huge lurching occurred.  And time then became so very slow.  There was little I could do as I saw it coming.  Bathed in the warm light of the christmas lights, who's setting was not permitted to be changed from "slow glow", I saw the shimmering splash of red, green, white, and mostly brown geyser forth out of Ting Su.   The entire mass of liquid reflected the joyful decorations of the season as it moved ever closer to the center of my face.    And that's it.  She just wagged her tail and played with her toys for the rest of the evening.   Every year people give me those damn M Ms as a gag gift.   I can't even smell them.  YUCK.     She didn't die from chocolate. She lived to be 19 years old. She passed in her sleep a few weeks after her daughter died of old age.         And pig shit!    We're all easy to find. Unless you're Spencer Grant.    TIL: I only need a five minute radius to begin stalking /u/DerpsWithTheHerp   ...then again, he didn't say how fast he would be moving.  I'll just try every speed then.   Cows aren't even drinking all of that.  The farmers pipe it into big ass holes in the ground where most of it just evaporates and floats away to other states.     Maybe to you...   When I was in Iraq, I'd visit those memories before falling to sleep.  If only to dream of those places rather than the deadly hell I was in at the time.     That being said... if someone is a purist about recalling a movie... they just shouldn't see a reboot.     however, I don't think the conclusion is: your childhood memories aren't that important.     it's those memories and experiences that make each of us who we are.   So Yeah... seems like thats pretty important.      To be fair... I don't prepare my food in the bottom of a dirty sink.     Nor do I leave the sink all filthy and nasty after washing the cat there.    Cleaning is possible.  We've got lots of tools to help us with that.     How exactly is a rainbow made?      Yes. I bathe them in the sink because it's easier and safer than the bathtub.   You see that you quoted me saying I bathe them there?     Right because people still care about how much their gas bill is going to be.....    Evil cosmetic companies testing their product on helpless animals...   Thin Mints are messy as fuck in Iraq.   Why?  I've had lots of cats and have trained them all to stay off the kitchen counters and kitchen table.     It's not hard.  It takes like 3-7 days of conditioning and then it's fine.     The trick is to make sure they have a high place they are allowed to jump on that belongs to them.  That makes the other training go a lot smoother.     I don't even feed the cat in the kitchen or open it's food there.   They have their own spot and I keep their food stored near by.   Another mistake people make is storing the litter box in the laundry room or pantry in their kitchen.   BIG NO NO.   Then they wonder why their cat pisses on clean laundry.   BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE THE PLACE THEY ASSOCIATE WITH PISSING!  Derps.    My cats never have a reason to go in the kitchen.  They regard it as the place I force them to get wet when I bath them and thats it.   So they stay away.        Pretty sure this is a bot.    /u/TrollaBot ListenYouListenYou   What are you talking about?  I didn't say shit about ANY of that!  Did you reply to the wrong thread?     U===DO:          Vigo was awesome! I actually had a nightmare about him.    But yeah... the rest of the movie was total wack.     It's like they spent their whole budget on Vigo.      I agree.     Edit: If you see the comments below, it is quite clear that /u/ListenYouListenYou is an astroturf bot.     I never said I feel this way.  I'm just playing devils advocate for the sake on conveying the thought process of some people.  Who's to say they are wrong?  And who am I to tell someone when and how they use their own memories.    If you don't use your memories for emotional reasons then you're full of shit.  Or you're a robot.     So whilst I don't give a crap about reboots and the likes... I can see where some of these people are coming from.     I'd just argue to them to not see the reboot if they are that purist type.     You sir, just need to calm right down.  Switch to decaf.      /u/TrollaBot[1]  ListenYouListenYou   Without shadows you cannot see the light.      Ummmm for me... stimulating the gooch (which is really just prostate stimulation) causes me to ejaculate more... like TONS more.  I mean... LOTS AND LOT MORE.    I think your advice is shit.      Its because when someone says "Ghostbusters" you immediately recall all your fond memories of the original, untainted by additional memories of a very bad reboot.    Its the *purity of memory recollection* that people don't like losing.  Once you contaminate the waters, it's never the same.      Maybe he scowled because it sounded sarcastic?

Yes it's violent...but compared to what we are watching today, it's not THAT much more violent.  Not NC-17 worthy to say the least.      And the funny thing is... it really isn't THAT violent.

 For a split second I wondered whether there would be Dobby/Pomfrey slash fiction out there before I realized that of course there is. There must be.   I think that would be a good idea.   I'm not sure whether /r/lewronggeneration applies to people who actually lived/were old enough to experience the period in question.   What does infant mortality rates have to do with anything here?  Well, /u/NewWorldDestroyer alluded to the idea that black people get stuff just for being black and I pointed out that one of the things they get is inferior healthcare.    Also, of course non felons get hired more often than felons, regardless of race.  They actually don't. Excerpt from the abstract of the study:   "Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. **In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison.**"   Thought experiment:  Your brother kills himself. You're grieving for him. A few weeks after his death, out of nowhere, he is being accused of being a terrorist by thousands of self-styled internet detectives. They find his social media and just lambaste it with nasty stuff. They also find your twitter and your mom's facebook and write nasty/threatening messages until the internet detectives realize "whoops, we fucked up, nevermind".   No harm done?    Nope.   But as Pager Western showed in an extensive study in 2009, black felons were at least as likely, if not more likely, to be hired than white men with the same qualifications who didn't go to prison. [^^Source] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915472/)  Or let's look another fun study that shows that the infant mortality rate of non-hispanic whites is more than double the rate of blacks.[^^source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6205a6.htm)  Wait.

EDIT: Sometimes I wish reddit still showed the upvotes/downvotes next to the karma, because this post has been swinging wildly between -10 and +10 for the last hour and I'm curious to see what's going on!   That's not how disease transmission works. Not saying that there's a five second rule or anything, but prolonged exposure will makes transmission more likely.   In contrast, if you start without a condom (don't) and only remember to when you're already inside the other person, it's still a good idea to take a break and put on a condom.      they have more of a platform to say the things they say without punishment  That's not limited to the U.S.   Is "Human" another app or are you commenting on the ability of humans to count their own steps?

 Kukaan puhunut sellasesta yhtn mitn.   Itse en ole kovin vanha eik ole moni muukaan. Mutta kyll tmn "uuden kaartin" touhut aika pelleily on ollut.   Ninhn se menee ja suurinosa nist on niit jotka ovat sen kokoomuslaisuutensa idinmaidossa perineet. Vaikka se tuntuukin hassulta ja hauskalta niin suomessa on edelleen sukuja jotka ovat vahvasti oikeistolaisia.   Hyv, ymmrthn lopettaa sen pelleilyn!   Vitn ett elm elementtikerrostalossa on jopa rikkaampaa ja onnellisempaa kuin imel pikkuporvarillinen teeskentely.

No sehn onkin jo pariin kertaa mainittu ketjussa ett ei toteudu kaikialla. Mutta perustulolla on samat ongelmat edelleen. Ei ne normi vuokra-asuntojen hinnat siit laske vaikka kuinka opiskelijalle tulee perustulo. Ne hinnat todennksesti nousevat koska ihmisill on varaa maksaa enemmn.   Asehan tuossa maksaa ei oikeestaan muu. Tosin pit metsstyskortti tehd.   Se on noita mettstys harrastuksen etuja :D   Tuo 200e opiskelijasunnosta on jo aika hyvin. Kun mietitn ett opiskelijaasunnot on yleens sen 250-300e/kk. Eli siit j jo ihan hyvin kteen 450e/kk tuen jlkeen.   Kyllhn tm helpottaisin kummasti. Ei tarvisi mietti paljon tekee opintopisteit. Voisi ehk hieman himmata ja valmistua vasta parin vuoden pst. Kyllhn sit sitten joskus tihin kerke. Kenell nyt kiire olisi valmiissa maailmassa?  	60
 Ghana, Portugal, and Germany are all tough as hell matchups. You've got to love that rivalry that has developed with Ghana in the last decade though, they just have our number.

I guess this will have to do now that they've discontinued *Gringo Bites*   I think some of the goalies that they lit up would be considered abysmal by Today's standards. So while they were a dynamo, let's look at some of the stats from the eighties with a level head. It was a different game back then.    I guess they both were; but the Cincinnati team did have Kunitz, Corey Perry, Bryzgalov, and Bylsma the previous year.     AND... Coached by none other than Scotty Bowman! I was only 4 but I vaguely remember my dad getting frustrated that they just owned the Hawks in the Finals. I re-watched that series last summer, and man did they ever dominate.    A bit off topic but how about some of these rosters from recent memory in the AHL?   [Philadelphia Phantoms](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0007932005.html) Patrick Sharp, Mike Richards, Jeff Carter, Umberger, Seidenberg, Pitkanen.  [Cincinnati Mighty Ducks](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0009592005.html) Lupul, Ryan Getzlaf, Chris Kunitz, Penner, Glencross, Coached by Danny Bylsma.      How about the Oilers!?!?!?!  Sure goalies were crap during their reign, but [take a look at this 1983-84 roster!](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0000411984.html). In addition to GRETZKY (87G and 205 points) their top d-man, Coffey puts up 40G and 126 points! Kurri, Messier, and G.Anderson all with 100 points. Are you kidding me?    *Don't TOEWS me, bro*   -Granlund   Hjammer really is Slalom Ninjasharks back there. Blocking shots with his throat, what *doesn't* he do.   I think the FLYAHS were the only one he got wrong.      Right, and I think that Jones did an excellent job explaining this in the link above; my point was not to look at the "white flight" aspect so simply.    I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people.   However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory.   These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety.   So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.     I'll take it. Just let me pick up one of those vacuums from *Luigi's Mansion.*   [This is playing in Ryan Miller's headphones right now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1GmxMTwUgs).

I found myself in a similar situation recently. I actually needed to move 700 miles back home due to the declining health of my future mother in law. I was as professional and honest as I could have been, and my administrators took note. I also offered my help in finding a highly qualified replacement candidate.   I gave them a clear picture that this decision was based on my commitment to family. It was by no means an easy decision for me and I felt sick about it for weeks, but all three administrators showed empathy and professionalism. They have been my biggest advocates for getting back into the classroom. It is hard to feel confident about a decision like this, but as long as they saw your talents and are decent human beings it should not be an inhibitor in your career.   Cue the Ryan Miller ready-to-cry face. Should be an intense series, nonetheless.    Well, grab a nickel and let's head down to the Soda stand, then. Kidding.

Wait until you find out you have to pay a decent chunk of change to park your car on Oak Park streets past 11pm   So, I'm going to recommend that you look at Elmwood Park or River Grove. I take it that your schedule doesn't allow you to use public transit. These towns are outside the city of Chicago, but if it is crucial that you are able to be in Maywood in 20 mins notice then you could be in Maywood in that time window.   I'm not sure what your definition of "ghetto" is, so I'm steering you clear of the west side and Maywood. I grew up in Melrose Park and most people in the neighborhood talked about Maywood as if it were a lawless hellhole (although it is right next door and not too different than Melrose Park)  Elmwood Park/ River Grove are neighbors to the city, and if your planning to access the city by car it won't take too long. However, if you insist on living in the city of Chicago, then look at Jefferson Park or Old Irving Park. (With traffic do not assume that Maywood would be 20 mins away at any given time... or ever really)     Did Emerick say that Svengoolie has been showing "kiddie films" on Chicago TV for 44 years? Where the hell does he get these facts from?    Just make a trip out to Elmwood Park and eat at Johnnie's. Best 'Talian beast around.   Probably [this!!](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YVCsoRpcLRs)   Hopefully much higher, given that he's stepping into a much more talent-rich system here.   Hoping we take the time to get him acquainted with the North American game, even if it means spending a year in Rockford. Before Tony Salmelainen came to the Hawks he was absolutely scoring at will in Finland. However, he wasn't able to do much here. we have the depth now to take the time for a speedy Fin to get immersed in North American hockey.   Wondering if the Buick score is skewed by the demographic owning most of them; perhaps they are "reliable" since they barely get driven.   Huh. The Blue Jackets leave the division, and now I actually miss them... Waddya know?   Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing. After watching *The Screaming Skull* from '57, I was mesmerized by this car.   25 y/o with 5 kids. Uuuhluggohghhhhh.    That brought back a bit of PTSD for Westgarth... [nightmares of John Scott tonight!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=985bd9nTDGA)   Ha. I still have my framed picture of the 95-96 Blackhawks + a picture of Cam Russell that I won at a raffle at my library. I'm pretty sure that my name was the only one in the Hawks box then. The Bulls one was overflowing.    [In... the wulld](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAOh6RoV3Gk) FTFY    Look at the North or West areas of Alexandria. It's moderately expensive but Arlington in sky high.   When my fiancee and I lived in the DC metro we had a combined income of 90k and we still couldn't justify living in Arlington. We ended up on the West end of Alexandria for significantly cheaper. About 10 mins from Arlington and about 30 from Capitol Hill. 1 Bedroom apts. in Arlington are about $1700; it's pretty unjustifiable. I'm getting way more for my money in Chicago; however the job market in the DC metro area is great.   I'd say focus on work first, get that promotion, and then live in Arlington. NoVA is pretty damn expensive.      Your not selling the poor aspect anymore.   You never saw the episode with Nosferatu, saw it when I was four and I've never been more paralyzed by fear.   or just taking manorexia to a new level   The length of the North American season   playoffs and travel factors do not make it feasible for NHL teams to be participants. However, it's not necessarily elitist to say that the North American teams would add a highly co mpetitive element to the league. Not to undermine European hockey, but it would be an awesome showcase to see vastly different styles of play go head to head.   Perhaps it is a step in the right direction, but the Model E is not going to be a "mass market" car like some are saying. It's projected to cost Tesla $48,000 to make one, so those figures of it being under $40,000 are not going to come to fruition.   I remember before the Model S hit the showroom, there was a Tesla display at the mall. The guys from Tesla were showing off the Model S as a concept and saying "It will be available for under $50,000." We know how that turned out.   Are we considering the $40,000 concept vehicle a "mass market" vehicle. Sure, long term ownership will save many people a significant amount of money in fuel costs, but damn, that is a lot of money to fork over.    It does depend where you live.  	61
 [This](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-dream-within-a-dream/) is where it came from. The full poem.   She always put that sentence on the letters that she wrote to him in his teenage and youth.    "They told me I could be anything when I grew up. And when I did, I became none of them."  I guess something like this one is from Chris Gardner, *The Pursuit of Happiness* : *There was a time in my life when I could become anything I wanted, and one by one I became none of them.*  Oh Shit.. this quote suits me so well right now..   Harry Potter covers always rock!!!   Time Keeper is a really nice book.... and Tuesdays With Morrie is awesome..   "All that you see or seem Is but a dream within a dream." -Edgar Allan Poe   "I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours." -Henry David Thoreau, Walden   I love this kind of posts.. thank you so much OP.   looks like i got a new book to read.. thanks   cool advice..   Goddamnit Alan.. you're something.   it doesn't.. i was just kidding when I asked that...    I like your creative thinking!   you should leave out your magnifying glass!! although good correlation   and who said that??      Also, can you please help me clarify a small doubt?? In [Desnity Plots](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html) what are *xfit* and *yfit*??  Sorry if my question seems stupid.. I'm pretty beginner at R and stats..    It worked used read.csv("filename", sep=";")  str() now returns 17 variables. Thank you so much..    I'm working on [this banking public dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#) but when I imported the csv files into R and did a str() operation, it's saying that it has only one variable: 'age' while there are supposed to be other 19 attributes as mentioned in the website [link's *Attribute Information*.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#)  I need to make a presentation of Descriptive Statistics on this dataset and now I'm unable to figure out where the other 19 variables have gone.. Plz see if you too face the same problem. (If so then this is an error in the dataset itself, right??)      FUCKING.NAILED.IT.PERIOD    I had 5,000 books (which I lost in a divorce)  How would anybody lose books in a divorce??   *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau is my all time favourite book written by a non-writer. Thoreau is primarily an environmentalist who wrote out of passion for his work towards Nature than wih an actual drive to *write* something, the kind of drive that actual writers have.  What are your favourite books written by those who do not primarily *write books*?      sorta like the Zen stuff..cool.   He's just fucking with us...   Awesome collection... Thank you so much for the post!!   Roger that, captain :(      quote's awesome... but the background didn't suit... by the way, why the insect??   I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE IN THE COMMENT....   YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.. OUR BROTHERHOOD SHOULD BE BIGGER.   YES.. THAT'S A GODDAMN GREAT WAY TO LOOK AT IT..    WELCOME TO THE PARTY, BROTHER.   Thanks to [Philip K Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick), the author of the film's short story... the same guy who wrote *Blade Runner* book and *Minority Report* short story as well. He's one of the biggest dudes in science fiction...    But I've never read a book in it's entirety.  I wonder what you have been writing all along without reading a single book... ( no offence, for every writer reading is the fuel that takes him/her ahead..)   says a lot...   * Fight Club * Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind * Edge of Tomorrow * Predestination * [1 - Nenokkadine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375559/) (Telugu language) * Unknown (Liam Neeson's) * Inception * The Truman Show * Interstellar * The Adjustment Bureau * The Social Network (awesome screenplay) * Doodlebug (short film by Chris Nolan) * Following (Chris Nolan's first film) * A Beautiful Mind * The Butterfly Effect (Part 1) * The Sixth Sense  and   * Shutter Island     *The Social Network* - the dialogues of the film always motivate me! They're so brilliantly written that I made a scene from it (*"Did I adequately answer your condescending question?"* scene) as my mobile ringtone!  *"It's raining."*  *"I'm sorry"*  *"It just started raining."*  I saw something illuminating in those lines and that's it my life was changed.   [*The Words*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1840417/) is a really fine movie about a struggling *writer*... I wonder why nobody mentioned it yet.. The moral crossroads that he reaches when he realizes that his truth is found out by that person left me with a haunting feel.   But in one of my experiences.. I had long time back browsed for movies *about* writing and picked up *Barton Fink* and *Adaptation* - and hated both.   *Inception* - never before watching this film did I take the concept of dreams seriously, but with this film, the horizons of human imagination have surely been extended for me.      *Interstellar* - watching how the grandeur of the plot twist unfolds by the end of the film really made me think of creating such magnificent science fiction.. and that docking scene... OH GOD!! Fantastic..   Hey awesome post!!! Thanks...    Others I might suggest are Into the Wild or The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. They're both more about escaping back to the wilderness, but both succeed really in motivating you to just go out and do something.  Yeah.. Second that! And also both have awesome OSTs.. they motivate me write.. and roam around in the out.   I fell in love with her in my teenage after watching Pans Labyrinth.   that's true...!! thanks for the response..      From the titles you've mentioned above, I have already read *Into The Wild* and *Walden* - both had been powerful life changers... :)   *Into The Wild* has changed away my beliefs on individuality, passion, firmness in belief and all that stuff.. and then from this same book came another, one of the most vital books I ever read in my life, **Walden** by Henry David Thoreau - it showed an all new perspective of Nature, our place in it, and our arrogantly assumed ownership of the world...!!   *Walden* is so fucking powerful that at some point it ceases to be a book and starts acting a missile inside your mind.   yeah, big deal.. Thanks for the name.. will check out what this book is about :)   *As a Man Thinketh* is one of the best jewels I ever picked up in my life... The content is pure soulful awesomeness..   thank you so much for the detailed info... will pick this goddamn book for sure after listening about it so much from you guys :)   I love Sorkin's each and every dialogue from *The Social Network*!  Especially, that *Did I adequately answer your condescending question?* scene... I've never seen such a scene before.   When it comes to non-fiction by Isaac Asimov, I prefer long works.. the longer the better.. I mean, it's like sitting and listening to one of the greatest minds of Mankind.. So, I dare not limit it to 200 pages!   Oh brother.... I adore Joseph Campbell's works... that PBS TV series **The Power of Myth** has opened me up to an all new perception of what is called a *mythology.*   Hey.. thanks a lot pal for taking the time to give such a response... helped me and others to know of more books.. thank you so much.   On the day I came to know that *Moneyball* is actually a book (I saw the movie first because the film version is written by Aaron Sorkin, my fav screenwriter), written by Michael Lewis, I immediately put it into my must-read list.    I need this! That being said, now you already know I'm thankful to you.   I read a similar nonfiction/selfhelp book last year.. *Flipside* by Adam J. Jackson.. Its about the hidden opportunities on the other side of the problems we face in life.. It has since then been in my 5 star book-list... I absolutely loved it.. it's a real life changer in a way..    by Asimov  enough said... :D   I guess I need these... thanks a ton!   yaa.. i share a similar feeling about Freakonomics.. the other day I started the audio book and really couldn't feel interested in what is being read there... so.. i let it alone.. but Michael Lewis' *Next* was awesome..   Loved his Animal Farm.. but 1984 not so much... let me see into this one...  Thank u so much for the response..   this Einstein guy is really cool!! thanks..   sounds interesting... thanks for putting it up..   thanks a lot.. shall try picking it for sure... and also can you plz mention the name of the author.. there are many Hiroshima books out there.. so..   liked the ending.... and I would like to believe in this quote, looking at how ambitions in my life are going right now. So, yeah I needed to hear this. Thanks to you and that friend of yours..   Hello dear fellow Indian..this poster is kick-ass!!! Phaad diya bhai tune toh... (mera hindi itna acha nahi hai, so please don't mind)   I've seen non-fiction books being usually long.. But I love short non-fiction books too. Helps me absorb deep knowledge from short number of pages quickly.  My favourite short non-fiction works are:  *  *Words From The Myths* by Isaac Asimov (pagecount: around 130 pages - contains interesting Greek and Roman mythological tales behind the origin of some of the most used words in English language) (i love this book  more for the mythical stories it told than for its theme). * *Nationalism* by Rabindranath Tagore (pagecount: around 100 pages - contains Tagore's views on what differs a Country from a Nation)  Do you have any favourite short non-fictional works? Would love to hear about them.. please share the titles and your experiences with them here.  Thanks.   this quote is very negative... unfortunately.   Grimm's Fairy Tales - Brothers Grimm   Special contribution award of sheer awesomeness goes to NettleStorm25 of Slytherin House!!   It should be so.. because there is something called as *improvement..* which every writer, rather every artist needs infront of him..      That's a great thing really... you're way ahead of those people who are not doing as good as you.. All the best.. Do wonders with your stories.   awesome!!!!   Which ones did you buy?? Can you plz name them.. would like to know, just out of curiosity.   **The Martian** by Andy Weir   Well, this is the real dystopian.   Wow.. this post is fucking awesome... Thanks for coming up with this!   Siddhartha is truly very good.. and another one by Herman Hesse, Steppenwolf is awesome book... If you liked Siddhartha, then Steppenwolf is a must try.   *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau. This book depicts the beauty of world's nature and our position in it almost like no other literary work, may be except for the essay called *Nature* by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau's guru.   Hey thank you so much...   It's just a link to my blog.. anyways I removed the URL.. so I guess we're cool there!   It's a big relief that this isn't Harry... No glasses, see.   I like reading very much. It shaped my life.. Basically I love words and I also write.. Recently I started writing short pieces .. So to explore more of this ground, I'm looking for some books that are filled with short stuff.  Please suggest me books that have:  * Splendidnly well weaved words.. like some very short poetry.. something like Gitanjali.. (I have long poetry books already.. now I'm looking for something like one page long at max) * Beautiful short musings * Anything well written that's longer than quotes but shorter than stories, like a couple of pages.. * Short myths kind of stuff may be (short)   Sorry, I'm unable to articulate properly what I want, but I guess you get the idea...   Please suggest lots and lots of works.. (actually I'm an aspiring writer.. So, I'm exploring the beauty of words to fill my mind with it. That being said, if possible, put a note called "extra-works" and suggest whatever other works you think would be helpful for me to chisel myself into a better weaver of words..)   **Sorry if I'm asking too much of your time and effort with all this... but please help me. Thank you so much.**    In one way of the other we're all ugly.   Please note that I said: **everybody** and also that *ugly hat* is a personification of our various character traits..      Or maybe he's just teaching his son to respect other people's ugliness too; a character trait we all possess in this modern world. In one way of the other we're all ugly.   I guess that hat is a personification of people's inner self and we all need to love one another despite our ugl.... OKAY!!! this is going nowhere.. I'll just shut up!   deep shit. no kidding   He's a true friend... One of the most memorable moments for me in the entire book series is in the 7th book when Ron leaves Harry and goes away from the forest.. and then after a period of time when he comes back..   *Ron says: "Dumbledore always knew I was going to leave you, that's why he gave me that Deluminator."*  *"No. He always knew you would want to come back," Harry corrects him.*  That is the most epic moment for me in the friendship of Harry and Ron. I was very very disappointed when this scene is completely left out in the film.      I guess you mentioned you work on web technologies.. Holding an academic degree in Literature, how/why did you land up in tech arena? Just asking!   oh a degree in literature... that's so cool.. thanks. will surely keep in touch..   GREAT FUCKING THINGS ARE NEVER EASY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE. WHEN WAS THERE A GODDAMN EASY THING THAT YOU FELT BRAINFUCKING PROUD OF YOURSELF JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT, A THING THAT NOT MANY OUT THERE HAVE DONE TOO?   THERE WONT BE ANY. BECAUSE EASY THINGS ARE FUCKING DONE BY EVERY MOTHERFUCKER OUT THERE. SO WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM THAT HENPECKING CROWD? **DISCOMFORT.**  THAT'S RIGHT. DISCOMFORT IS SEEN BY MANY AS AN UNTOUCHABLE. NOBODY WANTS IT. DISFUCKINGCOMFORT IS AN OUTCAST.. BUT HEY THERE IS SOMETHING WE'RE PHENOMENALLY MISSING TO SEE HERE. DISCOMFORT IS LIKE THE DANGEROUS BRIDGE THAT CAN LAND YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.. IN FRONT OF THAT CAVE OF TREASURE AND MAGIC THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FUCKING DESIRED FOR.   OFCOURSE THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO STAY ON THE BRIDGE ITSELF ALL OUR LIVES, BUT TO FUCKING REACH THE OTHER SIDE.. YOU SHOULD NOT LIVE IN DISCOMFORT FOREVER, BUT YOU GOTTA FUCKING USE IT TO MAKE THAT LEAP FORWARD IN YOUR GODDAMN LIFE..   AND THE PROPORTION OF DISCOMFORT THAT CAN REALLY TAKE YOU THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN LIFE IS OF ASTRONOMICAL PROPORTIONS. YOU DO THAT ONLY THROUGH ADDICTION. GET BITCHLICKING ADDICTED TO DISCOMFORT - TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE FUCKING DOING, THAT NOBODY FUCKING FEELS LIKE DOING..   THAT, MY BROTHERS, IS THE WAY TO GREAT THINGS...   *WELL WOVEN PATHS CAN NEVER PROVIDE THE ADVENTURE LIKE FORESTS DO..*  **THINK ABOUT IT. DO THE DISCOMFORT.**       I'm looking into different ways of storytelling... so ya that's about it.. mostly stories.. that's my art.. I'm not at all figure drawing guy.   Hi.. that mod reference to "there was another user who is a writer" was about me. I recently made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtBuddy/comments/2xw4y3/im_an_aspiring_writer_im_looking_for_a_buddy_to/) post regarding me wanting somebody to draw art for my writings.. So, I'm a writer guy.. a storyteller (just starting out on taking that up seriously, although as a hobby).  Your project sounds really cool and I would like to really try my hand at something like this.. (can't promise anything as this is absolutely new to me. Never worked on anything related to comics at all.. but want to give it a shot..)   And also, I too prefer a leisurely pace, because I have a day job and commitments to lot of other creative stuff.. I'm from India, by the way!   Yeah like many comments said.. the idea is good.. but the execution of course matters... And also that human relations thing is true to its core.. I mean, look at **Interstellar** film.. it wouldn't have been what it is if the humanitarian aspects are not embellished into the plot.. look at that Docking Scene.. You want to save a planet full of people, and live for the your loved ones.. else you would just listen to the robot and not try anything, right!   Oh sure.. Please do. Not a problem :)   Hey, like I said your art work was fantastic.. so I felt like writing about it.. I just tried writing about that second picture of the Eye (image number #9 in the URL). So, this is like 'WriteBuddy' kind of stuff maybe.. [Here's the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBB-Leq0NlOdSx-UZgAI4Fz6NfOoZZxwX03xLmWAe38/edit?usp=sharing) to the text, please see.. (Sorry if it doesn't come anywhere near to what was on your mind when you created the artwork. That was just my interpretation anyway)  Thank you so much..   I would like to hear from you :)   Thank you very much for the response. I left you a message. Please check it out..     Oh thanks a lot, buddy.. Please do.. I will be immensely excited and happy to see my writings in drawing by somebody. Thank you so much. When you draw it and if there are any clear details that you would want to know regarding any of those writings, please let me know. I will give out a clear detail.. or you can please just give out your own interpretations.. anything is fine. Thanks once again!   I loved the film's [OSTs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/secret-life-walter-mitty-music/id776155469) But today when I was browsing through something another [OST album of the same film](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/secret-life-walter-mitty-original/id768262442) appeared.   Now I'm pretty confused... Which one should be the correct one and why are there two OST albums for the same film??   Hey a really big thanks for the kind of response you gave.. I will look through the suggestions and posts that you mentioned about... I really liked the idea of ArtBuddy and so I would try my best take help from people here. Fingers crossed!  Thanks :)   I mostly like writing fantastical or mind-bending related stuff, like Telepathy, Teleportation, Time Travel, Supernatural elements, Space, Cosmos and etc. I'm kindof starting out on them. Mostly short stories, short random writings and musings. You can take a look at some short stuff that I [wrote recently - ](https://medium.com/word-dust) especially the post titled ["On Looking at the Stars"](https://medium.com/word-dust/on-looking-at-the-stars-56ed4647d431)  I try to be imaginative in my writings and recently I felt like seeing my writings with illustrations, but I'm no good at drawing related activities.   So, I'm looking for an ArtBuddy who can do that for me for fun (I can't pay any money, sorry about that.. I don't write to make money either, not yet)  **EDIT: (typo in the post title) "WHO can draw my writings"**   Deep!   Thank you :)   That's a pretty good advice.. Thanks a lot :)  I will find such people who would stand as help for building up my skills. [If you're interested in doing so, plz PM me. It would be a great help, if not, that's ok too.]  Thank you so much for the valuable response and idea.   I'm 24, and I want to be a writer. So it is high time that I started practicing to write fiction. I want to do so through writing short stories first. But I'm looking for a good platform to present my stories to people. I'm using Medium for my blogging activities and sometimes Blogger. Blogger used to be my fav years ago, but recently it has turned to s**t.. really disappointed with that. And Medium is pretty good for articles and blogs, but for a long story kind of posts, I don't think it will suit.  So, I'm kind of looking for any suggestions on how to present my short stories to people. My interest is in writing fantasy (not like an epic fantasy, but mostly like Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King, with a touch of decent fantasy and supernatural elements) science-fiction, fairy tales and etc.   Thanks for the responses in advance.   I would like to be friends with you.   Because it says things in its metaphysical sense that talks about fighting against the cataclysm that the Mankind was about to face, its doom, and not giving up in the face of it.   **Do not go gentle into that goodnight** (*don't just give up all hope and die out, which is as easy as going into a good night sleep, only forever*)  **Rage rage, against the dying of the light** (*fight with all your heart, and your soul, and everything that you have, for the light, for a new dawn, for another sunrise, which would be a rebirth to the Mankind*)  That's why it is related to Interstellar.   GETTING GOOD AT STUDIES, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE SUBJECTS THAT YOU SUCK, IS THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. I WOULD LOVE SUCH A THING TO HAPPEN TO ME, A DIRECTION IN WHICH I'M TRAVELING THESE DAYS.  KUDOS BROTHER FOR THE KICK-ASS ACHIEVEMENT.  KEEP ROCKING.   WHOLEHEARTED THANKS FOR THAT :)   ALL THIS TIME SPENT AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA - WAS ABLE TO DO SOME REAL KICK-ASS THINGS.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:  * FINISHED READING FOUR BOOKS * FOUNDED AN ONLINE MAGAZINE WITH A FRIEND OF MINE (CURRENTLY IN A FACEBOOK PAGE PHASE) * REALIZED MY WEAK POINTS IN MY EXAM PREPARATION AND ALSO LEARNED THE PROPER WAY TO PRACTICE STUFF FOR IT.  * FOUND A NEW FAVOURITE AUTHOR: *NEIL GAIMAN*. HE'S FUCKING FANTASTIC AT WHAT HE DOES. * WROTE SOME FINE STUFF FOR MY BLOG. * AND STARTED WRITING A FAIRY TALE.. SHALL FINISH IT THIS WEEK.  AND ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THINGS:  I REALIZED THAT I NEED TO IMPROVE MY TIME MANAGEMENT FOR PREPARING AND CRACKING THIS EXAM THING THAT I TOOK UP. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE. I DIDN'T DO THAT WELL IN THE PAST ONE MONTH. SO THAT'S MY CONFESSION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT.  THANKS BROTHERS FOR THE SUPPORT..   **I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT ALL THE FUCKING GREAT SHIT (ALSO FUCKEDUP SHIT, IF ANY) THAT YOU DID IN THAT FEBRUARY MONTH.**    I WASNT ABOUT TO WIMP OUT IN FRONT OF HER.  THAT'S AWESOME AND PRETTY SMART, BROTHER.. KUDOS TO THAT MIND OF YOURS THAT CAME UP WITH SUCH AN IDEA :)   I AM TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA... FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH. I DO THIS WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE MY TIME IS BEING PUT INTO TOO MANY THINGS AT A TIME. LATELY I HAVE OBSERVED THIS WAVE TAKING SHAPE AGAIN IN MY LIFE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS SUB I FUCKING LOVE VISITING HERE. BUT ALONGSIDE THIS I VISIT MANY OTHERS SUBS ON REDDIT. I KIND OF SOMETIMES PUT FUCKING TOO MUCH TIME INTO REDDIT.. DAMN, REDDIT IS ONE OF THE BEST KINDS SOCIAL FUN OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET... ANYWAYS, RIGHT NOW I AM TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM ALL OF THAT SHIT.. REDDIT, FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND ETC..  SHALL READ BOOKS INSTEAD...  CATCH UP WITH YOU ALL NEXT MONTH BROTHERS.. MEANWHILE, CONTINUE TO ROCK YOUR FUCKING LIFE.  PEACE.  KRISHNA KANTH   HEY BROTHER.. THANKS A FUCKING LOT FOR POINTING A GOOD PATH. I LIKE PSYCHOLOGY. I FUCKING BELIEVE IN IT. BUT MORE THAN THAT I BELIEVE IN MYSELF. I WILL GIVE ALL THAT I GOT AND THEN SOME MORE FOR THIS FAVOURITE EXAM OF MINE AND WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.     A FEW YEARS AGO THERE CAME A TIME IN MY GODDAMN LIFE WHEN I HAD TO ABSOLUTELY REFUCKINGDEFINE IT. IN ALL ASPECTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN EDUCATION. I WAS MOVED TO MY BOWELS WITH THE NEED TO PROVE MYSELF TO THE MOTHERFUCKING WORLD AROUND ME. I WAS ASKED ON MY FACE IF I AM GOING TO BE A LOSER. I HAD TO FUCKING ANSWER THEIR ASSES WITH MY KICKING-ASS ACHIEVEMENTS. AND GUESS WHAT.. I DID. I FUCKING EXCELLED AN EXAM AND GOT INTO ONE OF THE BEST COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY FOR MY MASTERS.  BUT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, NOW AT THIS PHASE OF LIFE (I AM WORKING IN AN MNC, JUST LIKE MANY PEOPLE OF MY COUNTRY DO, I'M FROM INDIA) I FEEL LIKE I HAVE RAN OUT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I ONCE HAD BEEN ONE ABOVE MANY, BUT NOW I'M BEING JUST ONE AMONG ALL. I FUCKING DON'T LIKE THAT.   **I.FUCKING.DO.NOT.LIKE.THAT!**  THERE HAD BEEN A CHALLENGE THAT I HAD RAN AWAY FROM IN THOSE ACCOMPLISHING YEARS OF MY PAST. IT WAS A NATIONAL EXAM. I BELIEVED THAT I CAN NOT CRACK IT EVER. I FEARED THAT I WILL BE CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ITS CLAWS. I WAS FUCKING AFRAID. SO I LET IT ALONE. BUT SINCE THAT DAY A PART OF MY HEART HAD BEEN HUNGRY AND DISSATISFIED KNOWING THAT I HAD EVADED THAT CHALLENGE.   BUT GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKERS.. NOW I AM CALLED BACK BY IT. I'VE BEEN SUMMONED BY GOD TO PICK IT FUCKING UP AGAIN NOW AND BEAT IT TO HELL THIS TIME. SO NOW I'VE STARTED PREPARING FOR THAT FUCKING EXAM. TO FUCKING TOP IT.  BUT HERE IS THE DISAPPOINTING PART, BROTHERS. I AM FUCKING ACTING LIKE I FORGOT WHO I WAS. WHEN I SIT IN THE CLASSES FOR THE EXAM PREPARATION, THE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE BEING FUCKING GIANTS IN KNOWLEDGE (ESPECIALLY MATH) THAT I NEED TO POSSESS TOO. I USED TO POSSESS THAT KNOWLEDGE. BUT NOW I FORGOT ALL THAT GLORY.  LAST WEEK MY MIND WAS FUCKED WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND I DIDN'T HAVE A FUCKING CLUE.  **BUT I CAN NOT LEAVE IT AGAIN. I WILL FUCKING NOT. I WILL LOOK THIS CHALLENGE IN THE FACE AND SPIT ON IT. I WILL TIE THIS CHALLENGE TO MY MIND'S BED AND FUCKING RAPE IT EVERY NIGHT. I WILL GRAB MY FEAR OF THIS EXAM BY ITS HAIR AND FEED ITS FUCKING ENTRAILS TO MY SPIRIT-HOUNDS.**  YES I FORGOT MY HISTORY AND PAST GLORY.. NEVERTHELESS, I WILL REWRITE IT WITH THE NEW STORY.   ON PATH TO SOME MINDBLOWING GREATNESS IN THIS GODDAMN LIFE, GIVE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU'VE GOT TO IT....**AND THEN SOME MORE!**  THAT IS THE MOST GODDAMN PART: **SOME MORE**   IT IS WHAT SHOWS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND EVERY OTHER FUCKER PUT TOGETHER.   **SOME MORE** IS WHAT TURNS 45 MINUTES INTO AN HOUR.  **SOME MORE** IS WHAT CONVERTS PRETTY MUCH TO 'PRECISE'.  **SOME MORE** IS WHAT FINISHES THE RACE.  **SOME MORE** IS WHAT MAKES YOU COMPLETE.     Agatha Christie is an author that I'm yet to try.... Will do it this year.. Thanks   thanks....    awesome... thanks for the suggestions..    There was a Telugu movie I saw a long time ago.. and there is this scene where the heroine goes to an interview and the interviewer, after finishing all his questions, asks her to close her eyes and speak out what all the things she saw in the room from the time she entered. She tells a good detail of things in the room like wall poosters, clocks, or books and especially (here is the kind the books I want to ask for) she tells about the items placed on either sides of his hands on the table and thus deduces that the interviewer is a left handed person. I really liked her observations skills especially of the handedness...  Now, can somebody please suggest me some books where I can learn about such stuff??  Thank you so much.   THAT'S A REAL FUCKING ADVICE BROTHER.. THANK YOU.   YES. I WILL DO WHAT IS UNFUCKINGCOMFORTABLE AND MAKE IT MY FUCKBUDDY.. **I WILL MAKE DISCOMFORT MY CHISEL AND WILL FUCKING SCULPT MY DREAM WITH IT.**   (FROM INDIA) VERY UPLIFTING POST, BROTHER. A DAY STARTED WITH READING A BOOK IS ONE OF A KIND I TELL YOU. TO START A DAY THAT WAY WHERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN READ A SINGLE BOOK FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, IS A KICK-ASS KIND OF LIVING. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT I LOVE READING TOO. THAT BEING SAID, NOW REGARDING MY DAILY ROUTINE:  I USED TO MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, BUT THAT ROUTINE DETERIORATED A BIT RECENTLY. I'M TRYING TO GET BACK TO IT. APART FROM THIS, I START MY DAY BY STUDYING FOR A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM THAT I'M PREPARING FOR. I HAVE A DAY JOB AS WELL.  WHEN I START MY DAY WITH SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE IN THE BASKET I FEEL REALLY GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN I MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, THE REST OF THE DAY IS PERSPICUOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER DAY.  FORTUNATELY TODAY I MEDIDATED BEFORE STARTING MY DAY.  APART FROM THAT, I MOSTLY PLAN THE EXAM STUDIES BEFORE I GO TO BED. THIS HELPS ME LAUNCH MYSELF DIRECTLY INTO PRODUCTIVE MODE THE NEXT MORNING RATHER THAN INVESTING TIME IN DECIDING WHAT TO WORK ON.  THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MY PLANS GET DISTURBED.. BUT I'M TRYING TO BRING ORDER TO SUCH CHAOS.   	122

Thank you!   she painted this on a canvas. no computer programs.    hands      so long and thanks for all the fish...   source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html        Anna magically captures classic romanticism of renaissance portraiture, figurative forms while creating art that is completely modern and original. Anna is inspired by the graceful elegance of the female form, at turns, classically alluring, demure and provocative.   Some words from the artist:     "My art is a reflection of my life, a reflection of myself... "...If an artist were asked what he was thinking of while creating his work, he would hardly give a reasonable answer to that question. This process can not be analyzed. It is like a miracle. "  More about this particular piece:    She stands before us, half-exposed and half-mystery. We chase her for evermore inspiration but never exhaust her complex character. She continues to surprise us through her eclectic taste and individuality. Her wild arrangement of fabrics stands as evidence of her raw character.  source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html but i highly recommend them if you like this piece.       https://www.artstation.com/artist/jakubrozalski      https://www.artstation.com/artist/tonyfoti      https://www.artstation.com/artist/mobotato      https://www.artstation.com/artist/shz      https://www.artstation.com/artist/anda      https://www.artstation.com/artist/anda      https://www.artstation.com/artist/mikedee      https://www.artstation.com/artist/mikedee      https://www.artstation.com/artist/mikedee         Thank you TheCrazyAsylum for your submission!

Thank you!   i've always enjoyed [this PS](http://i.imgur.com/5FmnxrU.jpg) of him.   under US law; farmers can still use a small amount of chemicals on their crops and still call them "organic". Truth.   no such thing as natural b/c the FDA allows company's to take advantage and embellish what *is* really natural. Hydrogenated Oil's are not natural. But you'll often find them in food products labeled to dupe the consumer while still offering a product at a responsible cost to the consumer but also maximizes company profits *b/c they use cheap ingredients*.     only the devil could survive two heart-attacks and still be alive.    Still doubt it, our military is pretty much the best.   that's a pretty good reason, why we're going broke.    Thank you faizybaig123 for your submission!

    I see you've constructed a new lightsaber.                   Let me guess - prayer. Which is what they suggest for everything. Except defense, then it's all "Hey, we should all chip in to stop them thar terrorists. But the things actually killing people? Nah, just pray and work hard! Git r done!"   OH.....so NOW people are worried about money in politics?  Super pacs are great, lobbyists buying off congress is cool, but damn - when it comes to a debate we need to be careful!                              My Advice: I didn't like it either. Didn't get through first season.  Then I listened to others. It gets a lot better and well worth watching. Folks here were right, tell your sister they were right...         The new legislation is expected to include:  *     introducing Banning Orders for extremist organisations who  seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech in public places,  but fall short of proscription  *     new Extremism Disruption Orders to restrict people  who seek to radicalise young people  *     powers to close premises where extremists   seek to influence others   *     strengthening the powers of the Charity Commission   to root out charities who misappropriate  funds towards extremism and terrorism  *     further immigration restrictions on extremists  *     a strengthened role for Ofcom to take action against   channels which broadcast extremist content                She will quit before she even starts.   Conservatives will be upset that facts will be taught and not mythology.   What's next, an abstain from driving class because if you don't drive you won't ever have an accident and our founders and Jesus didn't have cars.                                              God helped us elect Obama over any of the conservative fundies that were running. He also helped gay marriage to get passed in many states.  God sure is busy.   Why? Maybe because you have access to more information. I am in the US and I watched the entire 7 hour house of commons discussion on gay marriage. It was illuminating.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZNpzdkzWIA  Having access to views other than you own can be a freeing thing. Some though don't want their views challenged and rely solely on 'faith'.   Conservatives don't generally like facts - hence why they want text books not to mention evolution, cut library funding, why they only listen to those who espouse their own 'beliefs'. The internet opens up the world to a sharing of information and knowledge - which directly challenges conservatives and is one reason they don't like it and find it 'liberal'. Facts aren't liberal, but the right sure does like to call em that.               I'll be 50 this year and I still think about Susan Dey at times :) She was my 'teen idol' (though not the only one).       Consider this. One of the things they often ask (not saying always, honestly not sure but I have seen it asked on the forms) is if you have ever had sex with another male. Suppose you were molested as a kid/teen. You answer yes and suddenly your aren't able to donate/sell blood.   It was (last time I looked) overly broad. Not to mention you could be much older and you fooled around when you were a teen, etc and so on.  Broad policy is too broad. It's as simple as that.          Probably because in toledo, when people die, they always go somewhere better. So the mean folks there let you live just to be jerks ;)   Wow, that article was just stupid - looks like an angry kid wrote it.  Then again, no one ever accused deadbart of being journalism. It is simply partisan hype for people who don't like facts and want to emotionally charge up their feelings on issues.  I would be interested in talking to some people who take them seriously though. Would be an interesting conversation.         Toledo might be worse :)               Good.                     Professor Falken says: "The Bees"      That is so he can hook up with the ISIS folks that Obama is stashing just over the border. He is flying them in using the stolen libyan jets the right was warning us about last year. Once here they will finish the job of helping Obama spread ebola using illegal immigrant kids from south America that isis trained - and as our population dies off from the ebola Obama will be able to establish his caliphate.   It's all so obvious, why don't libtards see it like them super smart conservatives??   I don't, but you might check ghostery if you are using that as it may be blocking the widget used.                The one with a single unnamed source? Yeah, guessing not as reliable as some want it to be. The same people who still think that Benghazi happened the way the right portrayed it back in the day will probably believe this without question though.         Don't really agree. Yes, I am disappoint in some of his actions (like this one, drones, etc) but overall I don't think this admin stands against 'everything' libs/progs want. Gays in the military, something done with health care (though not single payer), leaving Iraq, not going to war in Syria and Iran...plenty of positive compared to if we had a republican in power.  I am an independent who leaned republican in the 80's an 90's - but since then repubs have went batshit crazy. George Bush was worst president in my 50 years of life and I can't imagine someone like cruz being president.  I'll take a bad dem over anything the crazy party has to offer any day. Hell, I'd take UK's David Cameron over any US person currently running on the repub side.                    *Blacks and Latinos make up just more than a third of the citys population, yet those groups made up nearly two-thirds of the citys traffic stops, including searches.*  I am guessing that if they stopped and searched people of other races the same amount they might find the same issues that crop up here.    Cordell shows that police have pulled over, searched and handcuffed blacks and Latinos at higher rates last year than their share of the citys overall population.  When you grow up in an area like this and you are stopped more often than whites, cuffed, etc, it may have some affect on you. If 10% of the people driving have an open container, pot, etc in the car and you pull over one race more than another...chances are you will get more of that race going to jail. Which then leads people to say "See, higher crime, more cops there to catch them!" which just feeds the original problem.                        One show I have never seen, but one had a hard time escaping it's cultural impact and references. I am sure other shows will take it's place.   Maybe they should make a show where people try to make show like Idol and the winner gets it funded :)      I wonder if they spend much time talking about how Laura Bush killed someone and how she felt about that? Probably not - because, as I recall, after the bush failure and 9/11 happened the right was telling us that we needed to be real Americans/Patriots and stand behind Bush.  They don't like Obama because he beat them twice, which has really brought out the nutcases. Look at their reactions to 9/11 and Beghazi as but one example out of hundreds. It's not rational - it requires people to be emotionally unsettled.  They let hate fuel them and toss out their principles in favor of it. They rally behind theocracy loving people like ted cruz and act like and American isis because they fear god will send hurricanes/etc on America because gay marriage. That is not rational - but they firmly believe god himself cares and will punish America.   Conservatives lose on the issues and logic, so they appeal to baser things like emotion. Look at the whole Benghazi debacle - been investigate and it hurt their feelings that it didn't find what they had all been claiming. So they cried a lot and investigated more. And they keep doing it.  They emotionally got behind an Iraq war, believed lies, and cheered on expansion of powers for the government with patriot act/tsa/etc. It made them feel patriotic (compare to the ACA, they love to call it Obama care, but the Patriot act they shy away from connecting bush to).  Another emotion they live with is fear. They are afraid of immigrants, isis, blacks, and non-christian people. People like Rush and Hannity know this and play on those fears - and cons tune in en masse to be preached to by father figures who tell them everything will be alright if just pray, wave flags, buy more bombs, and help less people in need.   The article is BS, but assuming it were true I guess it means I wouldn't vote for Obama next election.  PS - Really wouldn't care if it were true, Bush is still walking around a free man after the Iraq war BS so Obama has a long way to go before republicans can complain.   It's a fake site. Sad. Figure most people would know this already, LOL.   It's a plane. It's function is safely deliver paying customers from one point to another. It's not a danged carnival ride.   If the Captain felt something would, in some manner, bring potential harm to either other passengers or the plane, he had a duty to act on it.  What would Captain Kirk/Picard/Kangaroo do?      Weird, more came in under bush than Obama - was he spouting nonsense like this back then to his little sheep?  Between him, beck, rush, hannity, levin, and fox is it any wonder people think of conservatives as idiots these days? All emotional drivel for their mindless masses.      Yeah, and I want cops to stop harassing and killing people. Maybe when that happens I will lend an ear to what they are whining about now.               Dumb. The prof. should have had students get naked in order to join the class instead. Makes more sense to me...   This is brilliant. Probably the most brilliant thing you have ever posted.      "First, Tommy, let's do some tests. See if you can put that round peg of yours in the right hole."         I am going to make a guess here and say he is a conservative/fundie.  Those folks need to put down their torches and come out of the caves and meet the 21st century and realize the world is bigger than their bigotry.   Dang, she raised more than an Indiana pizza shop. The right was all about how awesome it was...wonder if they think the same about this. Huh. We will see.   Suddenly, because of jeebus, some on the right are against their fellow humans being free to enter into contracts with each other and having those contracts recognized by the government.   Going by their views divorced people shouldn't be allowed to marry, non believers to believers, etc and so on.  I don't get it. Well, I kind of do. These super smart people are sure that God will rain down destruction on the US if gays can marry (even though they can in many countries). God doesn't care about the sick and poor being screwed over, wars like Iraq, crime, and so on. Nope. Just gays.  Your god sucks and you don't truly believe in him (Heck, based on the fundies we don't need a military, God will just swoop down and destroy the bad people....oh wait...the right pushes for more military. Maybe because they think their god is a wimp?)   Yes...It will liberate you from your rights, your lands, your own religious ideals, and in some cases - your life.  It is interesting, to me anyway, how the rw fundies in this country now claim that Christianity is 'better' and more liberal than it was before (which they state when talking about Islam/Isis/etc).  Which basically says: "Yeah, we changed our faith and beliefs, but we won't do that now. And we believe that other faiths aren't as advanced/liberal as ours is now. But we hate liberals and progressive ideals."  Your faith was wrong before, you reformed it time and time again, and yet now you think it is all ok and doesn't need to change anymore. I am a little skeptical.      A good and free, short, book about that from 1877:  https://archive.org/details/TheDevilhisOrigingreatnessandDecadence      *Nike has 26,000 U.S. employees and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes.*  So give them the ability to hire more low wage or slave labor across Asia and they will toss in 10k jobs here. Yeah. OK. They are based here, have 1 million employees elsewhere, but only 26k here in their own country. Something just isn't adding up imho.                                                He should have just said "The perp and I made eye contact and it scared me. Scaring a cop is a shooting offense. I only had a split second to make a decision...was that a gun on his belt or a cell phone?"                        If you think that is bad, look at how some are freaked out by us not having a white president. It is like every talk radio station and conservative blog/'news' station/etc are constantly trying to get him impeached over everything.  Now it's "Jade Helm" or some such crap. They will investigate Benghazi way more than 9/11/2001 just because. He wasn't born in the US. He will, without a doubt, use his powers to take every gun in the US and crash the stock market, etc....  You can only cry wolf so many times before people laugh at you.   But, but....It's Jeebus!                        Oh, I am fine with backlash here. But fox is about as biased as they come and aren't doing anything here to 'debate' an issue but to back up what they and others already feel about the left. As one can see they grabbed this from The Daily Caller - an obvious RW blog.  Fox isn't really 'reporting' on it. They grabbed a little blurb from another site and pushed that narrative with no context (which they don't need, most fox viewers just need headlines and a blurb and they are sold on something).   Difference is - this guy doesn't represent most on the left. The right is a small tent made up of fundies and people who all think mostly alike. Hate muslims, don't want to allow their fellow american citizens (gays) to serve their country or get married, think all poor people are lazy welfare bums, etc.  I can find wackos on the left to be sure (am an independent and have been registered so since 1984 - though I did vote for both reagan and bush) but they represent less of the group because there is less group think on the left and more fractured 'tents' (some are pro gun, some anti, some religious, some not, etc and so on).  Pick any given conservative and you will find they represent a large chunk of them.    Oh, I have a problem with it - and also with who is pimping it and why. It's fox news, they are feeding their sheep with this to try and reenforce the bias of those who watch their 'show'.    SO, some guy I have never heard of says something silly and fox blows their dog whistle for their obedient, mindless, folks and they come running.  Man...they know how to manipulate their audience very well (not hard when their thinking skills boil down to 'someone with red/white/blue in their newscasts told me what I believe!')   The things which are harming Americans the GOP loves and embraces by blaming those people for it.  The things we already have defense against and aren't killing us they want to spend money on.  All in the name of Jesus. Because we all know true conservative fundies believe you can pray away sickness, being homeless, hungry etc - but you can't rely on a weak god to protect you so you have to spend money on weapons.               Well, since women are physically different than men I can see some of their uniforms reflecting that. The universe isn't unisex. I am guessing fat storm troopers would need a modified uniform as well - but we only ever see thin guys in them. Diversity is lacking at times in that regards :)   I don't see the 'sexualized' part of it. Do some people think that a woman can't be both appealing (to some anyway) and a storm trooper? That seems a tad prejudiced IMHO.   "Oh hey, you look pretty and have a nice body, therefore you should be working in the Cantina serving drinks to space pirates."  Yeah. No.                        Sure. Soon as we stop waving it every time we kill people we don't like in wars started on lies, when we stop torturing people and acting like animals, and when it means something decent and not screw the gays, the poor, the sick.   I think the flag is used too much by people as a blinder. It is like when they turn on fox news and are blasted with red/white/blue which is code for 'it's ok to lie, just look at these colors and you will believe'.                      "No, there is another."   They will say "See, this will help those people get rich! We can suck up all their water and pull more of the chemicals we need to find oil and free the US from foreign oil dependency. A win-win for us all when we recycle your well water for you."            Sure. Now that people are aware of the suit they can join in and maybe settle for a case of Blue Moon :)                  I am not sure I have ever drank hot dog water to know. I will take your word for it :)   Dang, it's that easy to get gold? I have been doing it wrong all this time :)  Since no one really ever sees me drink beer I can drink what I like without concerning myself what others think. And if someone wants to complain about my choice they are free to buy me the beer they want me to drink.   I'll be keeping an eye on you ;)                  Because republicans just want to get the "truth",  they keep finding it, but it isn't what they wanted.   	200

 I want!   I love my ST and will probably hold on to it for a few more years, so I hope the RS sticks around long enough for me to pick one up.    Take lessons.  Take lessons with someone that users a video camera.  I did and it was the best money I've spent on golf.    I actually really like it.  It keeps things new and fresh.  Plus we won't have to wait for him to (maybe) finish the books.   It's similar to The Walking Dead, in how things are the same but different.       I'll probably go stage 3 Cobb, with their standard tune.  Seems like it is safe enough, from what I've tag on all the messages boards.    I agree.  My backseat is just an extended trunk.  I've had two single passengers back there, and it's good for them on their own, but if I had 4 people to haul, unless they were 10 or younger, I'd tell them to take a different car.   I love my ST, but I see it as a two adult, and a couple of kids, car.  Not 5 adults.    The aftermarket for these cars is pretty big too.  I'm waiting as long as I can (warranty) before I start to tinker with it...  I know I won't be able to hold out for the whole life of the warranty, but if I make it another year, I'll be good to go.    I love my ST.   I have a Focus ST, and love it.  Have fun!    Buy cars and car parts, for restoration.    It's a man thing.  Even men who have no idea how to work on cars, are naturally drawn to an open hood.  Doesn't really matter that it's s woman that opened it, all the man sees is an open hood.  Once they get there, they might realize that you're a woman and turn up the bullshit and creepy meter, but it was the open hood that first brought them over.    I'm anti government, and pro individual rights, but I'd fully support this in my neighborhood.  I do me, and you do you, as long as your thing doesn't interfere with my thing.  When it does is when we need government, and there's too many people walking their dogs and not picking up after them.    Go home, you're drunk.    Raising Arizona.   15 min into the movie before the opening credits start .   Don't get drunk and pass out around strangers.  Take off your shoes and go to sleep like a civilized person, asshat.   Did he pass out with his shoes on? Our rule was, pass out with your shoes on and you get "tagged", take them of and you're safe till you wake up.    No one's asking you to like old cars or engines.  Please take your opinion place else and quit trying to kill other people's buzz.    I would also think that as part of the interview and hiring process, they would point out the fact that the big man in black can kill you, so not to back talk him.    I thought I've heard that most pedophiles were sexually abused as children.  If that's the case, then it has nothing to do with how they were born, but how they were raised.    People who say/think, that violence is never the answer, don't realize that in cases like this, an ass beating goes a long way.  Either you get your money back, or you feel better because you just taught someone a life lesson.    My wife has an auto immune disease that attacks her joints (among other things). She can walk normally, but always in pain.  She doesn't show it and people give her shit all the time.  Never when I'm around.  The other day a fucking cop gave her a hard time and accused her of using someone else's window placard.   Alcohol    Yes. Life is harsh.  Don't do stupid shit, or something bad might happen to you.  Pissing of the wrong person, who knows their rights in the eyes of the law, just might be one of those bad things.    Ok, per street rules then.  Touch me and expect it back. Step on me, and I'll put you on the floor.  Or are you suggesting that hoodie should have just smiled and carefully moved to another desk?    The defense is this: I was being bullied, taunted, and harassed, then in my interpretation at the time, was attacked from behind, so I defended myself.  In fact, the whole thing got caught on tape.  Oh, she was just stepping onto the desk I was sitting at? Ok, I still defended myself.  No body has the right to decide to climb on me, without my permission.  That's the defense.  Seems pretty straight forward.    Point being, personal space is personal.  You breach that space uninvited at your own risk.     Being "attacked" by legal standards is 100% subjective.  If you poke me, and I feel threatened, I'm justified in defending myself.    Anyone who says they had the best days of their life in high school, I just feel sorry for.  How sad to think that someone can peek at such a young age, then have it all downhill from there.    If you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the legal right to defend myself.    The person in the hoodie got stepped on, the girl fell when hoodie moved.  And fuck that, step over me in any situation, and I'll put you on your ass.  In that situation, I was assaulted first and I defended myself.  The law is on my side, you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the right to defend myself.    More movies than, what?   And I've watched plenty of movies.  Not saying those are the two best movies, just two of the best endings.  If you disagree, please feel free to let me know which endings you think are better.  And if you say "The Usual Suspects" or "The Sixth Sense", or any other movie that ends in a twist, then I'll call you a cheater. ;-)    But how do you know that you didn't just save the bad guy?  Maybe he was part of their group and turned on them, and you just stopped some justified mob justice?    Try to justify it all you want, but look at your vote counter.  Your wrong and there isn't anything you can say to change that. Asshat.   Needs more fire.    Two great endings.    I'm 80% sure, if not, it's the second to last.  But yeah, it's the end of the film.    I love that movie, and that is the best part of the whole film.  Probably the best ending of any movie, next to seven.   Yeah, fuck that.  I'm going in.  Say shit and I'm calling the cops.  Rule of thumb, person who calls first gets the best treatment from the cops.    I realized how dumb I was, right after clicking "send".   If you're getting passed in the right lane, you're breaking the law.  Dick.    But if they're speaking, how is he able to tell the difference?    Are those like the Lincolns from the 90's?  You got to turn those off or they'll blow.    When ever I get asked to go to a strip club, I ask them if they want to go to an all you can eat buffet, but you can't actually eat anything...     It's almost like revolutionary is related to evolutionary...   My parents *pretty much* know.  The aunts and uncles though...   *smacks you with a rolled up newspaper* No!   Dude, you're the freaking problem.    It's like a grown up Highlights magazine.  Can you name them all?  80's hoopty ride in the back round, cigarettes tucked into the bra, sandals over socks, cheep domestic beer...   We used to have Hulu, then we upgraded to plus.  I then told my wife that I'm not paying go watch commercials.  Netflix it is.    Yes   If it is designed to have different sizes, then it's Ok.  If the engineers want something, they can pre-plan for it.    Correct.  Width doesn't matter (that i know of). It's all about making sure each tire travels the same distance as the others.     Keep with that theory, and check the organ donor box on your driver license, so at least one life will be saved...  	53
 **I Hate Camping**  I get asked a lot, you know. Its weird, you wouldnt think its that common of a question. But I hear it from family, from my co-workers, hell, even from a few of my friends.   Hey, wanna go camping some time?  I try not to be rude. I say:  No thanks, Im not a big fan of camping. Too many bugs.  I can usually stand the bugs, to be honest. And saying that Im not that big a fan of camping is an understatement, because the thought of camping, spending the night in a tent in the wilderness away from roads and buildings and electricity  well it sounds pretty shitty. I hate camping.  I try not to think about the last time I went camping. But the other day a coworker, Zack, brought it up to me. He said:  Im thinking of planning a big fishing trip weekend after next in Deckers! Calvin and Will said theyd be down. You in?  Umm. Maybe Where would we stay? (Deckers, a small town about a hundred miles into the Rockies, wasnt known for its selection of hotels)  Zack told me: Well, I was assuming wed just camp right beside the river. Bought a brand new tent after our bonuses came in-  No thanks! I interrupted. Im not really much of a camper.  I started to turn away, but Zack put a hand on my shoulder  Hey, whats wrong? Did I say something?  Its nothing, I just dont like to go camping. Too many bugs. I hadnt expected him to push, I was getting a little nervous.  I dont think its the bugs. Zack insisted. He was determined.  Its the bugs, I promise. I offered.  Bullshit. When we had the fire-ant problem in the break room, and you werent phased at all by that shit. Whats your problem with camping?  That was all it took. I broke down. Starting crying. Zack was startled and visibly regretful hed even asked. He started apologizing to me - Shit man, Im sorry. I didnt think it was a big deal. Listen, if I said something-  Its wasnt you. I spoke, stifling back tears. I just I hate camping.  Zacks a good guy. But, he was curious about what I said, and I cant really blame him.   Why? What happened?   I told him what happened. Not then, I was still pretty choked up. We went to a bar that night, after work. We ordered a round of beers, and I told Zack the story of my last camping trip. I told him why I hate camping.  --------------------------  I was 18. It was early August of 06. It must have been 2006 cause thats the year I finished my last year of high school. Just east of the Rockies, its still warm that time of year. I had about 2 weeks left before I left home to go off to college. That was kind of rough, Id lived in the same neighborhood and had the same friends all of my life - I wasnt excited to say good bye to them.  Honestly, it had been a rough summer. I was stressed preparing to go off to school, I was sad to leave my friends behind, and on top of all of that, my high school sweetheart, Sarah, cheated on me sometime near the end of July. We broke up.  That probably doesnt seem relevant, and maybe it isnt, but what is relevant is how it affected me. See, I wasnt really myself that week. I was kind of floating through life, spaced-out. In my own little world. I was spending my dwindling free time wandering the old suburban neighborhood Id grown up in, feeling sorry for myself. Mostly, I wandered alone.  But I had good friends back then, and sometimes they wandered with me. My best friend, his name was August, noticed that I was a broken shell of a human being. He wanted to help. He must of.  I think youre spending too much time here.. August was a short kid, but he was athletic and handsome. He thought he was an expert when it came to girl problems.  What do you mean?   I mean that youre spending all of your time around all the places that you and Sarah used to go. I can see it getting to you. You should get away for the weekend.   I grimaced  I cant spare the weekend. I driving up to Silverthorne Saturday night to see my older brother before I leave.  What about just Friday night? We could go camping.  We were driving somewhere, I think, while we were talking. I dont remember where, but that isnt important. The only reason Im sure that we were driving is because I remember swerving a little when he suggested it. I guess I was never much of a camper.  I havent been camping since we were in boy scouts.   Itd be good for you man! We could get everybody to go. Itd be a good last hurrah, ya know?  So we went camping. Not all of our friends could get permission from their parents to go, but some did. There were seven of us. It was August and I, two girls named Lyndsey and Morgan, a guy named Chris, and a couple  Matt and Dana. We left Friday afternoon. Well, thats not entirely true.  August, Lyndsey, Morgan, Chris, and I left Friday afternoon. Dana had work until 6pm, so she and Matt were going to drive up separately from us that evening. The campground we had chosen was a mountain trail about 50 miles west of where we lived. It wasnt that long a drive, but it was in the mountains, away from civilization, and most of all, you didnt have to pay to get in. The name of the campground was Rampart Range.  I spaced out pretty hard during the drive up. Everyone was going out of their way to cheer me up, but I was having trouble getting my mind completely clear. I read off the directions that wed printed from the Map Quest website so Morgan, who was driving, could get there, but I wasnt really aware of where we were going. I was still in my own little world. Maybe if I was a little more lucid, I would have reconsidered the trip in its entirety.  The five of us got to the trail at about 4pm. There were a bunch of different trails in Rampart Range, so we choose one near the entrance. Morgan parked the car and we climbed out onto dry grass. I groaned and stretched to get rid of the kinks that the drive had put in my neck. I looked around. There was a small trail that ran through some trees, about twenty feet from where we parked.  Shall we? August suggested. He was eager as ever. We started hiking down the trail to find a place to camp. We hiked for about thirty minutes until the trail led to a small clearing that was deserted. It had a place for a fire pit, probably set up by a Park Ranger, or the owners of the trail. The clearing looked like it got plenty of use  I could see a few empty beer cans and cigarette butts near one edge of the camp. The aesthetic wasnt pleasing, but hey, beggars cant be choosers. We set up camp.  Camp consisted of a small fire and three tents. One tent was smaller, and we had reserved that one for Matt and Dana when they got there. The other two were the same size, so two people (Chris and Morgan, if I recall correctly) slept in one tent, and the rest of us (August, Lyndsey, and I) slept in the other. I dont know how we came to that arrangement, but I remember being mad that I was crammed in a tent with two other people.  I have to admit that the fresh mountain air and the hiking were doing me good. I was on the way to forgetting my worries and I was truly enjoying the time we were spending in the mountains. I remember that we climbed a bunch of huge rocks that we found in the woods near our campsite, and that August, Chris, and I played Hacky-Sack while Morgan and Lyndsey tried to get the fire going.   At around 7:30, something hit me. I realized that Matt and Dana hadnt shown up yet. It was going to get dark soon. The sky was already that shade of orange it becomes when the sun starts setting. They wouldnt be able to find the trail in the dark.  I tapped the contact for Matt in my phone, trying to call him. Phone reception was pretty spotty in the mountains, and he wasnt picking up. At around 8, I could feel myself growing frustrated. Either Matt was ignoring me or his cellphone wasnt working or wasnt getting service or some shit. I took a break from calling and left my phone in my tent. It was sitting neatly on top of my sleeping bag, where Id be able to get to it easily if Matt called back.   Chris and August were sitting around the fire roasting hot dogs. I sat down next to them. It was already getting pretty dark  you couldnt see past the trees at the edge of the camp anymore. But the fire was glowing fairly brightly, so I tried not worry about Matt and Dana. Chris and August were talking about high school, and all the kids we had known but would probably never see again. I listened for a while, until Lyndsey interrupted.  Hey, your phone has been buzzing for like, the last 30 minutes. She said, putting my phone in my hand.  Oh shit, thanks for telling me. I replied.  Any time. Lyndsey smiled.   Eight missed calls from Dana and Matt. *Fuck*, I thought. I called Matt back as soon as I could. The reception was still pretty bad, but he picked up.   Hello?  Hey Matt! Where are you guys? Its already dark here!  Were fucking lost in this stupid place. Who the fuck chose this campground?  Calm down, describe what you see, Ill help you navigate.  I see trees and rocks and literally nothing else.  Matt, try to be helpful here.  Matt handed the phone to Dana. Her tone was more relaxed than Matts.  Ignore Matt, weve been driving for a couple hours and hes in a bad mood.  Yeah I gathered that.  Which one of the trails did you stop at?  I considered her question for a minute. I had been pretty zoned out when we drove into the campsite, so I wasnt really sure.   I dont know, but it was near the entrance to Rampart Range, if that helps any.  Uhhh. Weve passed like 20 different trails  Oh shit, right. Well, we took Morgans Dads car. Maybe you guys could look for her car?  What kind of car is it?  Hold on.  I yelled to Morgan. What kind of car did we drive here?  Morgan was in her tent, but she leaned out the flap and yelled Its a Ford Explorer!  I could hear Matt grunting something through the phone.   Dana you there?  Yeah I am. Dana whispered something quietly to Matt. Matt, chill out Im sure hes just trying to get out of the campground.  Morgans car is a blue Ford Explorer. It should be the 3rd or 4th trail when you enter the campground.  Sounds good. I think we just drove a little too far so  Matt just pull over and let him pass  Her voice was sharp and she sounded irritated. Dana what are you talking about?  Oh, theres this guy tailgating Matt and I in a big white truck.   Hes been following us for the last 5 miles or so, but Im sure hes just trying to find his way out of the campground.  I could hear Matt in the background of the call. He yelled Hey fucker, back off!  Dana covered the receiver with her hand so I couldnt hear Matt anymore Im going to let you go. If we get lost again Ill give you a call.  She hung up. Honestly I was relieved, you could hear how stressed she was in her tone. Everyone at our campsite was starting to get tired. Chris and Morgan wandered off to their tent to get some shut eye. That was what they told us anyway. The rumor was that they had been hooking up all summer, and this was just another opportunity to spend some alone time together. Anyway, that left August, Lyndsey and I sitting around the fire, killing time until Matt and Dana showed up.   Around 10pm we started getting worried. It had already been a long day and camping has a way of taking it out of you. My ass was sore from sitting on the hard ground beside the fire pit. I wanted desperately to go to sleep, but I was determined to wait for Matt and Dana. I was considering calling Matt again while August and Lyndsey were talking about a mutual friend of ours named Peter, and how he had decided to go to Europe for a year instead of going to college.  Matt, it was fine. I bet he was just lost.  It sounded like Danas voice. It was coming from the trail, which was out of view behind a few trees. I stood up and walked towards the trail. Matt and Dana looked like they had been walking for the last hour or so. They were covered in dirt and pine needles. Their eyes were bloodshot and strained. There were bags underneath their eyes, and Matt walked with a slight limp. They looked exhausted. You could tell from Danas tone that they were growing tired of one another.  No Dana, that was creepy as fuck. Matt snapped.  Hey, whats going on guys? I asked.  Matts voice broke when he spoke. He didnt just sound angry he sounded scared.  Some guy in a white truck followed us while we were driving through this stupid fucking campground.  Im sure he was just trying to find his way out of the campground. I suggested.  Yeah thats what I thought too. But then we found Morgans car. I parked beside it. I thought that when I turned the car to park, the guy who was following us would keep on driving down the road. But he didnt.  Dana was quiet. What do you mean? I asked.  Matt hesitated. When I got out of the car, the guy in the white truck just stayed there. He just sat there. Watching us.  Matt, Dana and I stood at the edge of the trail, silently. You could feel the tension in the air.  Was he there when you left the car?   Matt nodded silently. Dana had started to cry, and Matt was pale and shaken. Ill admit that I was shivering a little myself. Lyndsey and August exchanged a quick glance.  Maybe we should just go? Lyndsey stammered. The story had clearly spooked her as well.  Yes! Lets get the fuck out of here. Matt interjected.  No! Look guys were already here. Its already dark. August argued. Lets just go to bed, and well leave in the morning okay?  Scared as we all were, August was right. It was dark, and it would take half an hour to get back to the car, never mind the drive home. We went to bed. August and I slept in one tent, with Lyndsey in between us. We were teenagers, so we felt like we needed the buffer to preserve our masculinity, I guess. Dana and Matt slept in the other tent. Our tent was in between the other two, and my sleeping bag was on the side of the tent closest to Matt and Danas tent.  It was so dark out that you couldnt see your hand two feet in front of your face. We all tried to go to sleep. I was pretty freaked out from Matts story. I couldnt sleep. I laid in my sleeping bag listening to August and Lyndsey snore loudly. The whole time, I just kept thinking about the person in the white truck who had creeped Matt and Dana out. Probably just some drunk fucker looking to mess with a couple of teenagers I thought. The wind was howling outside, making the grass outside whistle.  Around 2 in the morning, I was just starting to drift into sleep when I hear a noise by my head.   Lyndsey, shh, Im trying to sleep. I whispered. The noise didnt sound like Lyndsey talking. It sounded like a twig snapping. It sounded like someone had someone had stepped on a stick.  I sat up. I heard the noise again. This time it was the sound of a footstep on the matted grass below it. The wet sound of the foot lifting slowly in the grass. It was coming from right beside me. It was coming from just outside my tent. Then, I heard a second noise. It sounded like something heavy was being drug through the grass. I wasnt sure what it was until I heard a metallic CLUNK as the heavy object was dragged over a rock in the grass.  *I must be imagining this*, I thought. *The noise is all in my head.*  The footsteps were getting closer and closer to the entrance to our tent. I could hear that dragging sound the whole time. I thought I was dreaming.   Then I heard Matts voice from the other tent. Does anyone else hear that?  I felt all of my breath leave my lungs. I hear it Matt.  I was overcome by absolute terror. I think Matt was too, because he didnt say a word. All I could do was wake August and Lyndsey.  What is it-August started   Shh. Do you hear that? I whispered.  Everyone was silent. There was no sound outside, except for the wind and the brushing of the grass against the tent. Then I heard the faintest noise. I couldnt tell what it was at first, it sounded like metal.  Then I realized. It was the zipper of my tent. It was slowly being pulled open from the outside.   What the fuck!? August yelled. The second he yelled, the noise stopped and whoever (or WHATEVER) was unzipping our tent, started running. You could hear its heavy footsteps sprint through the campsite.  Overcome with stupidity or courage, or maybe a little of both, August tore our tent open. He ran outside to see if he could see what was fucking with us.  I dont see anything guys.  By this point, all seven of us were out of the tents. I was shaking. Matt and Dana had both been through so much, they were trembling violently.  Should we leave? Chris quivered. I think he was annoyed that his time alone with Morgan had been interrupted, but he was scared as well.  Its 3 in the goddamn morning. Its too dark to leave. I mumbled.  There were murmurs of reluctant agreement from my friends. It was too dark and early to try to leave now. No one was ballsy enough to walk back to the car in the absolute darkness that was the night. We decided that we would try to get some rest, and leave the second it was light enough out to see.  I dont think Ive ever slept worse. I was so horrified that every time the wind blew or the grass rubbed against a tent, I almost yelped. But we made it through the night. When it started to get light out, around 7 or 8 in the morning, we warily climbed out of our sleeping bags, packed up the campsite and left. I don't think any of us were really sure what had happened to us. Chris had suggested that it was a deer or something equally as harmless. No one else could dismiss our absolute terror that easily. The footsteps were too heavy to be a deer. The way it walked was so deliberate, like whatever we heard was trying not to be heard. I still have nightmares about the sound of our tents zipper slowly opening.   --------------------------  Fuck man. Id probably hate camping too, if that happened to me. Zack lamented over his third or fourth beer.  Yeah. It was a rough night. I sighed.  Zack yawned. It was late. I had been talking for a long time. Zack chuckled and put two tens down on bar counter.  Well, god knows Im not getting any sleep tonight, after a story like that.  Yeah. Now you know how I feel.  You need a ride back? He asked.  Nah. Ill walk. The bar was only a few minutes from my apartment.  Suit yourself. Zack said, standing up and cracking his back. See you at work tomorrow?  Yeah man. See you.  As I walked home I thought about that night in Rampart Range. That night was the most terrifying night of my entire life. Zack probably thought it was a pretty good ghost story. I bet he would tell it on his fishing trip with Calvin and Will.   But I didnt tell Zack the worst part. I wasnt sure he could have taken it.  After we left the campground, we all went home to get some sleep. After a few hours of much needed rest, Matt went in to the office where his mom worked. Shes an attorney, or something. He was waiting for his mom to finish a meeting. While he waited, he chatted with his moms secretary, Denise.  You look tired. Rough night? She joked.  Yeah. I went camping. It was kind of crappy.  Whys that?  I dont know. I guess we just choose a sketchy place to camp is all.  Denise frowned. Where was that?  Some campground called Rampart Range, or something like that.  Denise started crying, almost immediately. Matt was startled. He told me she cried for almost thirty minutes before she was calm enough to talk again.  When Matt told me this part of the story, I asked him why she had gotten so upset. Matt went pale. He looked like he was going to cry.  Denise said her son went camping in Rampart Range a few months ago. He and his friends were attacked by someone at their campground. Their attacker ripped open their tent in the middle of the night. Her sons friends were found a day later by a park ranger, beaten within an inch of their life. Their attacker had used a heavy metal hammer on them. But they got off lucky. Denises sons body was found dismembered and strewn violently throughout the campsite. They never found the guy who did it.  I hate camping.  [J.L] (https://www.facebook.com/Jlaughlinhorror)  	1
 I cringe thinking about it, but I'd take a downgrade back to the old USAS Frag combo of death over the current state of the game. I miss the old version of the game :\   I will decorate every wall of my one bedroom apartment with posters of your art, if you sell them. These are phenomenal!   As in bytes. I know very little about rendering environments in games, but I figured they can only load a certain amount of information before the game starts to drop in frame rate, lag, etc. If I downloaded information through my eyes in a similar way, how much information would I be downloading, in terabytes or however great the number might be?   Definitely will. Thanks blue!   Yes, click and zombies die.   I was completely serious haha. I am so happy I might die   OMG. HOW THE FUCK HAVE I NOT HEARD OF THIS. This is insane. It is LITERALLY what I just posted. I'm the happiest person alive right now.   Are you guys serious? Yes, I have lived under a rock for quite some time now. What is Dayz?       If it means anything past the downvotes, I laughed when I read this. haha   I don't know much about the cards themselves, but I got an electric Charmander card. I'm confused, what is it? I thought it was a ditto or something at first but it is definitely a Charmander.   Really, I *almost* believed it, but when derp in the corner wasn't moving, and herp by the door *also* wasn't moving, it really ruined it. The MAV just letting you lock onto it was suspicious enough.    That's what I thought, but I turned the other cheek, hoping it would not be a big deal once work starts. I believe my job requires me to be constantly working, 6-8 hours straight. I'm hoping that keeps the talk time with the boss low.   He tells me, "If you get fired from HerpDerp Tires Co., you fired yourself." We'll see who gets the last laugh.   Well it's an easy, full-time job, and I have college tuition and rent to pay, so it's not a big deal. My plan is to tell my manager, assuming he brings up religion again, that I'd rather leave religion out of my work environment.    That's what I was thinking. I must tread lightly...   **TL;DR:** My new employers are Christians running a business completely unaffiliated with religion. Asked me religious questions in interview. Don't necessarily share beliefs. Can they legally do anything about it?   I live in Kansas if that matters (law-wise). I was recently hired to work at a business that sells car tires. It's not a church, it's not spreading the word of God, but they're obviously Christian owned (paper on the door asks people to not swear, then follows with Bible verses).  Anyway, when I was in my pretty laid-back you-already-got-the-job kind of interview for this particular business, I was asked if I was sleeping with my girlfriend or had any illegitimate children running around. As a redditor, I don't know what a girl is, so I said no. He then follows by saying, "You don't have to be a Christian to work at HerpDerp Tires Co., but we do have prayer time in our meetings. You can participate if you want." I'm like, okay, fine, that's your thing. I'm just worried they might find some reason to fire me if I disagree religiously.  Also, while I do believe in God and was raised Southern Baptist Christian, I can guarantee I don't share my beliefs with these people. I need a job though or I can't afford my rent, and this was a great opportunity. Am I safe, or is there some legal reason that they might be able to fire me in the future?   I'm easily convinced, I'm buying it. Thanks for the suggestion!   Dead Island surely scares me. I close my eyes every time I climb ladders with zombies following close behind. Haha.  Is the game fun enough to buy? I know $5 isn't much, but I don't want to waste it if it's not worth it.   Had not thought of that. I took a Geology 300 class last year, and vaguely remember how little we have. We were taught that we have enough to sustain our existence, but it just gets more and more difficult to get to, even though technology gets more and more advanced. This surely would cause a great problem for us if we couldn't find a way to harness the sun/wind/water more efficiently right off the bat.   That's also true. I didn't really define either. Assuming all was completely annihilated somehow but everyone didn't die in the process, then we would be stuck at square one. However, if everything is just wrecked from bombs or some other WW3 type destruction, then we would have the rubble to use to rebuild. We would have to separate each element in the rubble, which would also take technology though.   Is this a game I should buy? I'm terrified of zombies, but I kill them to help lessen my fear. I play Dead Island with two of my friends on PS3, and if this is a game you guys think I should buy then I'll convince them to get it too.   That was my assumption. I was also curious as to how small the layers would get as we reach similar levels to where we are now. Like for instance, we use computers to run machines that build computers. Rebuilding the computers without the machines, in order to run the machines, would be another layer we probably couldn't circumvent.      They should also add what vehicle a player is using. It'd be pretty helpful as well.   Alright, I'll probably try those next. Yes sweet, Peabody is a near nonexistent town a couple miles from Newton, another pretty small town. I didn't think anyone from Peabody would be on Reddit, but you never know, might as well try.   This is related to my post a few hours ago. My friend found a gray cat with white socks with no collar unfortunately. It was found off of Highway 50 near the Coneburg in Peabody, KS. If anyone knows anything about it, the girl who found it would be thankful to give it back since she had her cat picked up the same way a few months ago and never got it back. She is sad that someone can't find their cat, assuming it belongs to someone. Thanks if anyone can help.     	28

 Just woke up from a 14 hour night shift. Imagination broken   It's such a beautiful day, give me something to do. Anything at all.   Just sold my 1st item on gumtree. Person picked it up and I wasnt raped or murdered. Today is a good day.   Centrecom in sunshine are just as bad. I called them to check if they had a certain graphics card, was on hold for 15 minutes then was told they had plenty in stock. I told him I would be there in 30 minutes to grab it and if he could get one ready for me which was all good. Then I get there to find out they dont actually have any at all. Apparently i was the arsehole for wanting the next model up for the same price because they fucked me around.    I usually take my own outside micrometer set (0-100mm), depth micrometer set and vernier. All shops iv worked in have supplied them but its hard to keep track of the condition of the tools when everyone else is using them too. Also a dial indicator and base. Very easy for them to be damaged and no one says anything, potentially causing you trouble down the track.    24, been in the trade for 7 years. finished a 4 year apprenticeship in australia as a fitter and turner/ toolmaker. Moved into maintenence for the dollars but we still have a couple of lathes and a mill we use for repairs, breakdowns and general bits and pieces. Kinda miss being in a proper tool shop though.      VLC   I was chasing a friend around the house and some how I ran flat out into a door and knocked myself out. Left a nice little scar under my right eye.    sooooooo... im getting lucky?   It still is pretty common. I lost a friend of the family recently to dravet syndrome, she was only 11 and basically minutes after she passed there were photographers there who work for the hospital and asked the mother if she would like some photos taken, she said yes, and a few of them were actually used at her funeral.    Basically I'm interested in having a session in a sensory deprivation tank, and would like to know if anyone here who has done it in or around Melbourne and could suggest somewhere to do it? After a quick google search most of the stuff I have found is for myotherapy and pain relief sort of thing, not sure if they would cater for someone looking to chill out.    I was so pissed when they broke up :(    It's the name of the band   	13
 You mean the quality? I know, I don't have a decent program for capturing video, and I haven't really gone through the settings.   I'd like to hit 10! I'm stuck at rank 13/14. Most of my success has been with Demon Zoo and Control Paladin. I also enjoy playing midrange deathrattle hunter.  Any advice on how I can advance further?  I get frustrated with face hunter and mech mage because I don't want to change decks as a simple reaction to those two decks. Or is that the inherent nature of the meta?

Jahrhundert brachte einen staunenswert gleichen staatlichen Einigungsproze. Die deutschen Stmme einten sich im Deutschen Reich, die italienischen Staaten im Knigreich Italien. In einem Jahre, 1866, hat das Schicksal beide Vlker sogar miteinander fr ihre staatliche Neugestaltung zum Kampf antreten lassen. Heute erleben wir zum zweitenmal diese gleichartige Entwicklung. Ein Mann von skularem Ausma hat es als Erster unternommen, der in seinem Volke unfruchtbar gewordenen demokratischen Geisteswelt erfolgreich eine neue Idee entgegenzusetzen und in wenigen Jahren zum Siege zu fhren. Was der Faschismus fr Italien bedeutet, ist schwer abzuschtzen. Was er fr die Erhaltung der menschlichen Kultur geleistet hat, liegt bei den Sternen. Wer wird nicht niedergezwungen bei einer Wanderung durch Rom oder Florenz von dem Gedanken, welches Schicksal diesen einmaligen Dokumenten menschlicher Kunst und menschlicher Kultur zugestoen sein wrde, wenn es Mussolini und seinem Faschismus nicht gelungen wre, Italien vor dem Bolschewismus zu retten. Deutschland stand vor dieser selben Gefahr. Hier hat der Nationalsozialismus das Wunder der Rettung vollbracht. An diese beiden Staaten klammert sich nun in der geistigen Vorstellung unzhliger Menschen aller Rassen der Glaube an eine neue Renaissance unserer Zeit. Die Solidaritt dieser beiden Regime ist daher mehr als eine Angelegenheit egoistischer Zweckmigkeit. In dieser Solidaritt liegt die Rettung Europas vor der drohenden bolschewistischen Vernichtung begrndet. Als Italien seinen heroischen Kampf um sein Lebensrecht in Abessinien durchstritt, stand ihm Deutschland deshalb als Freund zur Seite. Im Jahre 1938 hat das faschistische Italien uns diese Freundschaft in reichlichem Mae wieder vergolten. Mge sich niemand in der Welt ber den Entschlu irren, den das nationalsozialistische Deutschland diesem Freunde gegenber gefat hat. Es kann dem Frieden nur ntzlich sein, wenn es darber keinen Zweifel gibt, da ein Krieg gegen das heutige Italien, ganz gleich aus welchen Motiven vom Zaune gebrochen, Deutschland an die Seite des Freundes rufen wird. Man lasse sich vor allem nicht von jenen anders beraten, die in jedem Lande als vereinzelte brgerliche Schwchlinge vegetieren und nicht verstehen knnen, da es im Vlkerleben als Ratgeber der Klugheit auer der Feigheit sehr wohl auch den Mut und die Ehre geben kann. Was das nationalsozialistische Deutschland betrifft, so wei es, welches Schicksal ihm beschieden wre, wenn es jemals einer internationalen Gewalt gelingen wrde, das faschistische Italien, ganz gleich unter welchen Motivierungen, niederzuzwingen. Wir erkennen die Konsequenzen, die sich daraus ergeben mten, und sehen ihnen eiskalt ins Auge. Das Schicksal Preuens von 1805 auf 1806 wird sich in der deutschen Geschichte kein zweites Mal wiederholen. Die Schwchlinge, die 1805 die Ratgeber des Knigs von Preuen waren, haben im heutigen Deutschland keine Ratschlge zu erteilen. Der nationalsozialistische Staat erkennt die Gefahr und ist entschlossen, sich auf ihre Abwehr vorzubereiten. Ich wei dabei, da nicht nur unsere eigene Wehrmacht einer hchsten militrischen Beanspruchung gewachsen ist, sondern ebenso auch die militrische Macht Italiens. Denn so wenig das heutige deutsche Heer beurteilt werden kann nach der alten Bundesarmee etwa in der Zeit von 1848, so wenig kann das moderne Italien des Faschismus gewertet werden nach den Zeiten der italienischen staatlichen Zerrissenheit. Nur eine hysterische, ebenso unbelehrbare wie taktlose, dafr aber hchst bsartige Presse kann in so kurzer Zeit vergessen haben, da sie erst vor wenigen Jahren mit ihren Prophezeiungen ber den Ausgang des italienischen Feldzuges in Abessinien sich ebenso grndlich blamierte wie jetzt wieder in der Beurteilung der nationalen Krfte Francos im spanischen Feldzug. Mnner machen die Geschichte! Sie schmieden aber auch die Instrumente, die zur Gestaltung der Geschichte geeignet sind, und vor allem, sie geben ihnen ihren Hauch. Groe Mnner aber sind selbst nur die strkste, konzentrierteste Reprsentation eines Volkes. Das nationalsozialistische Deutschland und das faschistische Italien sind stark genug, um gegen jedermann den Frieden zu sichern oder einen von unverantwortlichen Krften leichtfertig vom Zaun gebrochenen Konflikt entschlossen und erfolgreich zu beenden! Das bedeutet nun nicht, da wir Deutsche  wie es in einer verantwortungslosen Presse jeden Tag geschrieben steht  einen Krieg wnschen, sondern es bedeutet nur, da wir 1.                  das Verstndnis dafr haben, da sich auch andere Vlker ihren Anteil an den Gtern der Welt sichern wollen, der ihnen kraft ihrer Zahl, ihres Mutes und ihres Wertes zukommt, und da wir Danken wir Gott, dem Allmchtigen, da er unsere Generation und uns gesegnet hat, diese Zeit und diese Stunde zu erleben.

Pretty good.   nope dont see a medic anywhere i am a simple sandwich   Nobody else was playing Medic.   DR isn't that good though, especially against Soldier, Heavy, Pyro and Anyone using Melee. Soldier can see the Cloaked Spy with the splash of his RL, Heavy can keep firing and see the Spy because when taking damage the Cloak fades a little bit, Pyro just because Pyro, Melee is very easy to use to track spies if you hit them once, you keep walking into them and wail on them.   Combat Medic is so appealing because of what's called "The Medic Effect" which is absolutely not real. What it is is that people don't see a Medic as a threat so they wont target them. **Haha** Also people think killing a real Medic as a Combat Medic is impressive. **Hahaha**   The Rocket Launcher has 4 rockers that can do damage *without* directly hitting the player! That's so unbalanced! And don't get me started on ubercharge, invincible for 8 seconds!?

Yeah, my Espeon.   I'd tell my sister that Australiums go for like $5 each and give her a $5 note. My entire argument would be "Two Cities is a 4 tour mission, right?

This is assuming she would play and get an aussie drop.

 - ... hey  - Hey  - ...  - Let's get the awkward question out of the way first, shall we?  - Err, yeah, I guess...  - What're you in here for?  - A crime I didn't commit...  - Hah! That's what they all say, right?  - I don't know. I just got here.  - Murder.  - Sorry?  - Murder. That's what I'm here for. Murder.  - Murder?  - Yeah, stone-cold fucking murder.  - Shit, I err...  - That must make you a murderer, too, if they've gone and put you in here with me!  - Well... sir... with respect I didn't do anything. They didn't catch the guy and I was the only one around.  - Alright, fella. I hear you. You "didn't do it". I understand that.  - ...  - So who didn't you kill?  - I don't think... I don't think I want to discuss it with you... if you don't mind... sorry...  - Hah! Alright. We got plenty of time together anyway to discuss it. Could be useful, talking about it, you know?  - I don't think so.  - ...  - ...  - Well?  - Well what?  - Aren't you gonna ask me who I killed?  - Well, I don't think it's any of my-  - My whore wife.  - ... business...  - My *whore* wife. Fucking bitch. Caught her with another man. Came home from work early, opened the door and noticed some prick's boots by the door. 'course I didn't yell or any of that shit - didn't wanna give her time to react and make up stories. Just went upstairs, heard all I needed to hear, and waited in the bathroom.  - ... please I really don't want to hear this. I just got here and I-  - I stood in the bath behind the curtain. I waited and waited and waited.  - Please!  - Shut up! If you're gonna be with me you'd better get fucking used to it!  - I just-  - I was in the bath. After about an hour he left. Southern accent. Said he'd see her in the office. Wife's a lawyer.  - A lawyer?  - Yeah, a lawyer. Fucking property or some shit, I dunno. Who gives a shit? She's a dead fucking lawyer now.  - I just...  - Save me your stupid questions, yeah?  - Sorry...  - So she obviously needs to piss at some point, right? I don't have to wait long after he's gone. I hate waiting. I'm an impulsive guy, y'know? I don't think - I just do. So she comes in. I let her piss. Give her the satisfaction of knowing she didn't piss herself as she dies. She flushes. As the cistern fills up and the tap's running, I pull the curtain back and step out. Her reactions were quick, but not quick enough. A quick slam in to the mirror, yank her back by the hair, in to the bath. She kicks her feet but she can't do shit in the bath. She looked real fucking stupid. She knew she'd been caught. I still remember the panic in her eyes - a stare right through my gaze, looking for something inside me. "Please, please", she said, "Please don't".  - This is too much, please...  - I grabbed her throat as hard as I could and didn't stop squeezing. Her eyes bulged and everything went red... No last words... Not even a last breath.  - For fuck sake! Stop!  - Hit a nerve?  - This is bullshit... this is crazy... someone's having me on...  - No one's having you on. This is reality! People do stupid shit and people fucking die. Whores die.  - No, not... fucking hell.  - Jesus, man, I dunno why you're all wound up.  - I... I...  - Spill it. Speak!  - My wife was a lawyer. The story cut too close to the bone.  - Oh, she's a lawyer, huh? Who gives a shit?  - Please...  - So she's a lawyer, and you know what you are? A pussy.  - Excuse me?  - A PUSSY. A fucking pussy. Listen to yourself. All please this, please that, don't do this, I won't like it. Wah wah wah! Fucking cry-baby. So you killed your fucking wife.  - What?  - You said your wife *was* a lawyer.  - Yeah.  - So you killed her.  - No, I told you they didn't catch the guy. I would never hurt my wife.  - Everyone says that, until one day you catch them fucking some other bloke.  - She wouldn't...  - Why wouldn't she? Married to a pussy like you. You'd probably forgive her. Accept her stories. Take her back. No! What you need to do is stop taking shit from people. You didn't even tell anyone about Uncle Jack.  - ... w-w-what? W-who... H-how...  - You are such a fucking pussy.  - W-who... who are you?  - You really are a worthless piece of shit. I'm you.  	1

It utilizes the older, lever-style shifters that I am unfamiliar with. I am used to riding mountain bikes and decided to switch it up and use it to travel around town.   Being that the bike isn't new - what sort of maintenance should I perform to get it to tip-top shape?      And it still is?  	11
 beats sound like shit compared to many of the much cheaper brands  it's just it was "cool" to be seen wearing beats.. idiots easily part with money   he must of forgotten about the crusades   people still have to control and maintain them drones don't shoot missiles by themselves  besides send a drone in and if it gets shot down you lose a drone not a plane and a human   Nope just not a lazy grubby cunt   you don't own the house and should have it clean all the time  it's not hard to keep a house clean unless you're lazy   it's more the fact you have to go to the government and get a license which shows them you take drugs  people are not going to want to do that   nope i studied at tafe and paid rent it's possible to do when you have a full time job and study at night   a drug license wouldn't be a good idea no one is going to want to get one and will just continue to buy off dealers   they don't want to pay ridiculous amounts of money that we are charged for things  it's called the Australia tax for a reason  also most shows are still delayed here   only problem with streaming is the exclusive deals they all have  if you have netflix and x show is on foxtel you can't stream it without having foxtel as well as netflix.. then you have the other few streaming services which all have an exclusive show  piracy might have lowered a little bit but it will pick up as people don't want to subscribe to 2-3 services just to watch the shows they want   the war on drugs is a waste of time anywhere it's fought  it failed a long time ago yet they refuse to change tactics..   even America the country who started the whole war on drugs thing has realised this and some of it's states have legalised things like weed   greens won't get that many more votes people might hate the alp and liberals but the greens are seen as wackos by a lot of people   not buying work lunches is the best way to save money when i was working construction i was easily spending around 100-150 a week  all those coffees bacon and egg rolls and maccas lunches put holes in my pay  luckily i didn't smoke as well as my work mates would do the same but add a pack of smokes a day   yep it's easy to find work as a schoolkid at mcdonalds in fact that's the age fast food places generally want because they can pay them less then the older people  you can easily switch to part or full time after school or stay casual if you have uni and make money  it's what i did i saved thousands working 6 years at maccas while studying  my guess is some people quit after they turn 18 because they don't want to work in fast food anymore due to embarrassment or something   no point helping them no way to guarantee the food gets to the people instead of the military etc  besides that they have been pissing off the world with the missile tests and nuclear program and most countries are not going to want to aid them unless they agree to stop testing missiles etc   all thanks to the anti-vax retards  seriously whooping cough should be a thing of the past but no retards think they know better than doctors/scientists and years of medical research      so we should just leave them out on the streets to commit more crime?      shitloads of people do that many don't have wealthy parents either   don't see what will make anyone spew she worked and saved money and bought properties  any money she received from the family was wisely used instead of been pissed up the wall like most people at that age  I think the reason why people think they cannot buy property is because they want a multi-million dollar house now. Youve got to start somewhere and build it up, she said."  that is actually sound advice.. lots of people are not willing to live far from the city so prices are much higher, the further you move the cheaper it is.. the commute might suck but you'll have a cheap decent home/apartment   nothing shocking about it they commit crimes and are put in jail.   most of them are re offenders and it's the reason they are in jail if they don't commit crime they won't be in jail it's as simple as that   the last time they adopted a "softer" approach people smugglers where having a field day  you don't want a situation where you open the boarders again and have boat after boat come here because they know we'll just take them   all it will lead to if more deaths at sea just like last time but a lot of people seem to conveniently forget that when they cry for a softer approach    Hulkenberg is a good driver wasting away at a shit team i hope the guy gets a offer from a better team    well it's not like they could do any worse   they stabilize the car when it's up on the jacks if i'm not mistaken   2013 by far  my advice is skip every 2-3 games as they don't change enough to justify buying it every year   i see this game like fifa get every 2nd or 3rd one because the changes are usually only slight improvements of the graphics and the liveries/drivers of cars and maybe a tweak to handling  to me it's not worth getting every year   if those 4 teams all had a decent car fighting for the championship no one would be calling f1 boring        back when he started health and safety wasn't as bad as it is these days  these days saftey comes before anything even if it ends up killing the sport or whatever  it's happening in every sport where they ban or restrict things that for years where fine   in Sydney around Gosford (around 75km from city) and even further the house prices come down considerably  some people are just not willing to live that far out of the city..   yes it would be a shit commute if the job was in the city but you have to buy what you can afford or you will rent forever in the city   most people try to fill the carry on bags with as much shit as they can if the other baggage is nearly overweight to avoid fees   a black market for porn would form in under a second   open files like music.mp3.exe   or they threaten legal action for defamation and the person put the site back up  what they did is actually illegal regardless if they where paid or not (the last 2 lines on the site)     ^ this  very risky doing this and will likely land the person in a lot of trouble if they sue him   skyrim for me fell short in dialogue  a handful of voice actors for the mass amount of NPC's and even then most of the lines are recycled so you hear them a million times  the guards being a great example      they should do it again and expand upon it  it was pure laziness doing it like they did in skyrim   might be forced retirement if he continues performing the way he is   having decided to play thru skyrim again one thing i hope the next game does is hire more voice actors  seriously i forgot how bad it was hearing the same voices repeated over and over again (the same lines as well), wouldn't be hard to pay a few different ones to give some variety so they don't have to recycle the voices for everyone   this kid should just shut up already he was in the wrong and can't admit it now is talking shit like a douchebag  the Verstappen hype is beyond annoying now and just giving this kid a big head       he's not lying about the part that people will drive right past you if you're bleeding on the street  i had a bad car accident a few years back (mangled car bleeding all over the place from head injury) and at least 5-6 cars just drove right past only one stopped to see if we where ok   don't understand why some of the trophies are all the same colour.. why don't they at least have one gold silver and bronze  besides that they look like something that belongs in a kitchen   do you think the other engine manufacturers like BMW or Toyota will return to f1?   would be good to see Williams become a works team i don't see them winning as a customer team   they are trying to ban it in all sports problem is that's a shitload of money out of the sports  question is who would come in and provide it   they still don't realise that everything they do just lures more young people to it   have to say black looks better than red for this car  usually i only like red Ferrari's but this one is amazing in black   they are biased because it's a dutch driver because i don't see torro rosso making that claim   proven by the data they used to penalise him grosjeans car braked 5 meters later than the previous lap  it was a rookie mistake but one he just won't admit he made   it's not and happens every year this type of response is the exact reason why this charity has no funding   hes already been proven otherwise he just doesn't want to admit he made a mistake  with a attitude like that i won't be surprised if he crashes into another wall this year   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4Dh_EAfJI  i still prefer the the sound of the v8 over the v6     it's good they are addressing one of the major complaints i know it won't be v8 levels but it's better than the current lawn mowers     he still can't admit he was at fault even with the data showing grosjean braked later than the previous lap  he won't learn from mistakes unless he can admit he made them won't be surprised if he crashes again this year  	54
 I just finished with the tenth doctor today :( I feel like I'm in mourning because I loved him so much   This is why I like kids. They're just so funny!   This is why I like kids. They're just so funny!   Paint me like one of your white girls   You never know. She could have pudding in there just to freak everyone out. But she probably doesn't. Just look at her. Pudding? That's too smart.   At first glance I thought of Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny.   I totally thought it was wtf when it was posted THE FIRST TIME.   The one on the right is Chris Crocker, known for his famous "Leave Brittany Alone" video on YouTube.   Hello haha   They are featured in quite a few episodes under the ninth reincarnation of the doctor in 2005 when the show came back. I know I'm right. In the show they dealt with a specific family of Raxacoricofallapatorians called the Slitheen.   Post it to r/wheredidthesodago   Of course, no problem! I enjoy telling people. Also my name is Eli!   The creature is off of Doctor Who. It is called a Raxacoricofallapatorian. Link to an explanation of the creature: http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Raxacoricofallapatorian   This looks more like stains from decomposing bodies. They even have human outlines.   Thanks. It was my best guess. I honestly just remember how much of an impact it was on the surrounding communities.   The Johnson's lived 30 miles away from where I grew up. President Johnson was long dead before I was born, but Lady Bird died almost 10 years back, I think back in 2004 (can't really remember). I lived in Fredericksburg, and the Johnson's in Johnson City. They attended church in Fredericksburg at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. Lady Bird was such a nice woman. One time when I was 3 years old, we were late for church. We sat in the back row, behind Lady Bird. I was being unruly, not behaving. Mrs. Johnson turned around and told my mother what a cute child I was and asked if it would be alright if I sat with her. Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the service. She loved kids. I bet she really was laying into her husband.   While it may be a gimmick, she really does have enormous talent. She's just gone off the deep end, let the fame get to her head (I think at least). I'm a huge Gaga fan but you have to admit it when the people you idolize and respect lose it. I saw her in concert in 2010. She really is an amazing vocalist and her piano skills are incredible. She just needs to calm it down.   I see where you get that and I respect that being her fan. The great thing about music is that a song that can be so small and insignificant can mean so much to someone. A lot of Adele's music speaks to me on a personal level. The music helped with a lot of heartbreak. But, music is fascinating. Songs become personal, and that's the beauty. Some people enjoy it for the tune, the rhythm, the vocals, or the words, and its all about taste. Like wine. You pick and choose until you find something you like. That's how I see it all.    I see no difference. In every aspect.   What's his porn name?   It's the angle of the camera...   I think you spelled "*I am an asshole*" wrong   **kill the child**   Same.  **24 cents for a pack of ramen is TOO DAMN HIGH**   You even used the same title. What a dick.   Very   He was so attractive and handsome.   Sorry someone ate the chips like they were supposed to be eaten and left the ones they didn't eat in the container because they didn't want a whole lot of chips and tried to keep the left overs from getting stale?   Someone noticed that earlier   Nice little tongue twister   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawfish#section_2  Or you could not scuba dive where they are?   Looks like my toilet after really spicy Indian food. But I love my curry.   Walmart does a shit job when it comes to gathering carts from their lots. Walmart is just shit. And as far as the cart crew shirts, I'm pretty sure they have them at most, if not, all stores. It's a corporate uniform. They don't really have a choice.   Downvote me if you want but... *knife   Because Ozai is an evil dude. Why would he be nice and upvote someone?   Agreed   lulz   That was beautiful   This is one of the cutest things I have ever fucking seen. The expression in its eyes was priceless.   I fucking love gingers. Too bad you don't like guys. I'd be more than happy to be your valentine. Please take it as a compliment and not a comment from a creeper!   *Licked   They are. I think the person being locked though is Marcus Butler. They do a lot of videos together.   Jack Harries. Yum! Both he and his twin. Wish he was licking me!       Closest thing to a man granny has seen in years. Plus, repost.   I didn't know medical examiners dyed the brain when they examined. I've neer heard of that. It's cool. It made the brain look diseased though lol Do they do that often where you work? I've seen a couple autopsies but have never seen them dye it.   Well that fantastic for you. You go be a bigot back at them instead of being a bigger person and not giving a fuck.   And you think this hasn't been posted 40 times either?   You couldn't wait at least a day to repost it? Just go away.   Repost   Totally not a sand crab   This has been posted before.      Well, I know I'm looking at a repost   Oh god what the fuck is that! It looks like a caterpillar but it can't be so what is it! Oh my god!!!!1!!!!!!1!1!!!!!   You're the stereotype that prevents me from having straight friends. Good job.   -_- so. funny.   From the movie "The Mummy" and its also computer generated.   It's common knowledge. I saw a post a week back that had someone's thumb with her face drawn on it. The resemblance was uncanny.   That guy has been an extra in so many movies.    Why not laugh?   Oh god, that was perfect   Because you're not in the fucking north eastern part of the country.   Why do people think it a good idea to repost the same thing everyday?   This made my skin crawl   Took me a second. I thought you were implying something about a street name. Now I see. I too am "lame"...   "I'll meet you there a quarter past Y"   Whenever I see Claire Danes nowadays, all I can think of is her playing Temple Grandin. I always expect her to talk in that way.   Some heavy drugs and her sexuality.   I remember it being a pretty popular post. A few days ago that is.   Is it wtf? Yes. Has it been posted a million times? Also yes. Even if you're new, I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet.   Am I the only one who remembers that Daleks can fly and levitate?   Nike doesn't advertise in other countries?   The underwear of course. Aw fuck it. Who am I kidding! I want all of it!    Want!   If this is your picture, why aren't you helping? Stop taking pictures and get your mouth to work.   ...the fuck?   WHO THE FUCK FOUND THE GODDAMN GIF OF MY FUCKING FAGET ASS GIRLFRIEND BRUSHING HER TEETH I HAD JUST FINISHED SUCKING HER DICK LIKE A SUBMISSIVE NIGGER FAGET, THATS WHY SHE SEMI HARD FAGETS ENJOY MY SISTER, I MEAN GIRLFRIEND I MEAN BOTH FAGETS   Given the right spices and seasonings, bugs probably taste good.  	79
 Kinda, a little, I guess?   As someone else who doesn't watch it, I assume there's a reason known to those who watch the show?   Is there anything those drows can't do?   Yeah, you're not alone there.    Aw, I had high hopes when I saw the name, but ended up skimming to the end.    3/10, good trolling effort, poor result, will not look for more of him.    There is no story in the title, wtf is wrong with this fucking bot?   He's talking about the light, not the object emanating the light.    My vote goes to it being real to the characters, there were several other ways he could have used to convey the awesomeness of the object, and I don't recall any other effects that wouldn't be real in-movie.       Loved it, I'm rewatching it now on Hulu   Does the app "Notification History" tell you what it is?    Iron Sky sequel? Awesome.   Well, that got incredibly annoying fast.   The older Roku is laggy, gotta go with the Roku 3 unless you really can't afford it. Youtube app is the worst.   Worth it.   Search Zedge or whatever ringtone app for "executive"  and "exec", that's how I find decent ones.    Detasseling. Riding in a basket watching the tops of corn stalks go by makes you see them even when you close your eyes after a week or two. Makes you dream of them every night as well.    This is what I do. I have maybe 10 movie libraries. Mostly I have them split up by type, but 4 or 5 of the same series have their own library.    I have my daughter on Straight Talk, iPhone, Verizon network, it doesn't use a sim card. Just depends on which phone you get.   Flagging sucks. Standing all day makes for an incredibly long and boring day. It's not like you can play on your phone to pass the time, and you're most always alone and away from others, so there's no idle chatting. Stand all day on the hard road and you're quickly hitting the store for better boot insoles, because your feet ache at the end of the day.   Then there are the idiots driving. They're safe in their cars, so any thoughts of zipping close by anyone working on the road doesn't  bring any thoughts of safety to their minds. Suits and mommies chatting on their phones are the worst. They have places to be and you, you asswipe, are fucking up their day. How dare you, don't you know how important they are? You turn your sign to let them by, and off they go to try to make up as much time as possible. It's downright scary sometimes how they'll gun it to catch up to the line to get by before you turn the sign.  Fuck flagging, you couldn't pay me enough to ever do that again.      TIL you can send military tank chip info to the Chinese government and only get a $100 fine with no time served.    Sigh.    First off, it's completely against reddiquette you should be downvoted for this: fuck fanboys.   Secondly, I had the same problem until I installed VLC and all the codecs. It must use those codecs, because suddenly it played everything. I just save new movies with plain names, and use Filebot to rename my shows. The rare instances it won't see the correct show is fixed pretty easily. Doctor Who (2005) is constantly misread, for instance, but quickly fixed manually.    Ugly ass things, but they are the alpha bug hunters. If you have them, it means you need them.    Please stop spamming my inbox with hate mail.    Done being a dick yet, fanboy, or are you going to keep going?    You're completely correct. I was a fool to entrust my music to apple.    I reset the defaults like you said, still didn't get that message.   Don't be a dick.   Edit : like the other guy said,  I guess. Still.    Here come the downvotes, heaven forbid anyone is unhappy with apple crap. Really just want my question answered, no need to read the rant. Asking too much, I guess.   It just pisses me off that itunes has me add folder to library, then links behaviors after that. It clearly distinguishes between the folder and the library, but deleted the folder with no warning. I only wanted to delete the itunes library. It's crap like that that steers me away from apple stuff, lack of user control causes unwanted results.   The warning says nothing about the original files being deleted. I'm looking at it right now. It says "Are you sure you want to delete the selected songs from your iTunes library? These songs will also be deleted from any iPod, iPhone, or iPad that synchronizes with your iTunes library." If the library and folder containing the music are considered the same thing, why do I need to load them in manually? Why doesn't itunes see them on start up?  edit: So, this response, which is correct, is downvoted, but what I'm responding to is upvoted even though it's incorrect? Yay for reddit, I guess.   My daughter went with an iphone, so we ended up putting all our music in our itunes folder, then adding it to my library. Things were all messed up (tag wise) so I spent half the day fixing and adding tags. When everything was all good, I wiped my itunes library to reload the folder. Apparently it doesn't just wipe my library, it wipes my music folder as well. When trying to delete the songs from my library, I get a warning that it will wipe the library, ipod, iphone, or ipad. NOTHING SAYS THAT MY MUSIC FOLDER WILL BE DELETED. If my itunes library was the same thing as my music folder, I wouldn't have to manually add music from the folder to the itunes library. Thousands of songs, gone. Years worth. I've undeleted with Recuva as much as possible, but tons are gone from restoring what I could from the recycle bin, which wasn't nearly large enough to hold all my files. Songs I didn't get from apple, so there's no replacing them. Some I may be able to redownload, but I'm basically forced to pirate music now, since I'm positive apple isn't about to replace anything I didn't buy from them. Gonna uninstall itunes, go with a 3rd party app, and never get another apple product again. What a huge, giant FU from apple. Well, right back atcha, guys.    Roku 1 w/ older Samsung tv. Same issue.    I had no idea about the WOL, awesome tip, thnx.    Ah, scraping, I get it now. I use Filebot to rename all my shows, rename movies myself, and let Plex sort it all out. I've noticed it's gotten better at figuring things out these days. Doctor Who (2005) seems to want to be renamed, but "fix incorrect" takes care of that. Oh, and Harry Potter 7 parts 1 and 2 gave me a hell of a time. Had to throw them into their own folder before they would split. Weird.    Would converting with Handbrake solve that?    I'm using Plex now, and it is indeed awesome, but I only have the one computer and don't want to leave it on all the time.   I don't have a need to watch outside of my network.   Converting to mp4 would take care of transcoding and scraping, wouldn't it?   That's fine, can always convert files.    edit: Ok, so Plex really is the way to go. I was using an extremely old computer as a Plex server, but it was so laggy it was unwatchable. If  I got a newer one, all I really need is decent processing power, memory, and storage to stream well, correct? I don't need to worry about a decent video or sound, seem about right?   edit2: Found a good read about cpu requirements here: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201774043-What-kind-of-CPU-do-I-need-for-my-Server-computer-  edit3: Lots of good info, thnx guys, much appreciated.    Utterly awesome of you, thanks for the bill relief!    I could use that, I have 2 phones on Straight Talk. Just got my daughter here first phone a few months ago.   Nope.   As long as your sync is on, any additions or changes will be synced. It should automatically sync any time you change your contact list.    The George painting has a title too, doesn't it?    The coolest belt buckle ever, The Kramer, and some PCP.       Oh, that's what the problem is, I'm an idiot. See, I just didn't realize. Thank you for pointing that out.    45 but no vet. I wanted Air Force but I had an issue with my legs in high school that ruined anything for a couple decades. But my family is full of Army and Navy vets, and I'm quite proud of them all, and considering them murderers has never, ever crossed my mind.    Soldiers are murderers? Take that shit to the vets and their families, wonder how that will go over. You have any loved ones who are vets? Did you disown them for the murderers you believe them to be? And while I'm not a gun nut, there are legit reasons for guns. They're just plain fun to shoot. Most folks I know around here have them, they all hunt and eat what they kill. I'm not into it, but if they want to eat pheasant, more power to them.    Pretty obvious you haven't got much experience with the real drug world. Innocents suffer every day due to the whole mess. Not everyone gets a choice whether or not they associate with them, and often times are completely unaware they are. My sister's best friend in school was killed because her father was in it. She had no idea about anything.   And war, as horrible as I believe it to be, is the natural state of affairs. Has there ever been a time in history when it wasn't? Are they all necessary? No. The Iraq war wasn't, I think. But when groups like ISIS or the Nazis rise up, evil will only triumph when good men do nothing. Did more people die in WWII than would have died had Hitler had gone unchecked?   But all that stuff aside, I still would prefer a children's toy store didn't sell drug dealer toys.    I see your point, but we've grown up with that stuff. And I've never seen a gun pusher standing on a corner. How  can you have more of a problem with playing soldier than playing drug dealer?    WTF are you talking about. It's a kid's store. How many commercials have you seen that didn't target kids?   Btw, they were put alongside gi joe and super Mario bros figures.    Ok, I wasn't expecting much, but that is one of the funniest youtube videos I've seen in a long time. Is this a tv show?  "I HOPE YOUR MOM GETS ASS WARTS!"   ...for a rapist?   You can't?   Toy R Us is selling fake bags of meth, and they defend it. What world am I passing off to my daughter...   Oh dear lord, don't tell me those dumbass legwarmers are a thing now.  edit: So I just asked my white trash baby's momma about these, she's seen them. Kids, en mass, have no taste.   On the left.    "Does not require any special permissions."   Good Guy Dev   WiFi?    They claim to do a better job of cleaning if done while standing up.    Best ______ ever.   Bugs me to no end.    Yet another has learned the true value of syncing and backups the hard way.  	62
 Nice try, but I'll believe hours of video over one staged shot.   So Redditors now support blackmail of elected officials if it advances their agenda?  When Anthony Weiner did this, it was 'his own private life'.  Hypocrisy abounds among the naive Reddit 'intelligentsia'.   Republicans receive money from rich Americans for political favors -- Reddit Outrage  Democrats receive money from rich foreigners for political favors -- Reddit Silence   Would you rather be in the middle of a sporting event riot or a Baltimore/Ferguson riot?       Not even close.  Were the UK fans beating up innocent blacks for fun? Gangs are viciously attacking people in Baltimore because they are white.   "Oh she's such a great mom!  She's a hero!"  No she's not.  She's doing what a mother should do.   Too bad he is not trusted by his masters in the Maryland state government with a firearm to defend his livelihood.   Are our standards so low for black males that we elevate a man for simply opposing violence against police?  Why are we fawning over something that is simply what good citizens do?  Because he's black?  If he was white, would this be a thing?  All able-bodied men should be standing up to the criminals in Baltimore, Ferguson, etc.   It's not a riot.   It's a celebration of diversity.   Will the mayor continue to 'give space' to these criminals?            The Clinton familys mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid, notes the New York Post. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends."  Color me shocked.               Congratulations.  You've found the difference in incentive betwen the government and private sector.  A business operates off its own money and thus has the incentive to perform and be accountable.  The government doesn't operate off it's own money and the employees do not have any motivation to be accountable or even perform at all.     And Democrats want to put these people in charge of our health services.   Ignorant liberal outrage against Nestle.  Nestle responds, shutting down operations, laying off people and moving out of state.  Ignorant liberal outrage against Nestle.    You do realize that George Bush has not been President for 7 years?         Do you approve of donations from a Russian company to the Clinton foundation while Hillary signed off on uranium rights for that **exact same company**?  If this is a popular stance, to condone corruption of one party, this country is in trouble.   Can someone explain to me why a random company in Russia would donate to the Clinton Foundation?   Liberals want "money out of politics",  provided that money is not foreign money going to the Clinton Foundation to influence policy decisions.   This is not a valid reason for not sending fixed wing air support as there would be very little risk to the pilots.  Again, why was no force ordered to support the surrounded force on the ground? Why was no force ordered to spin up *at all*?  This fight went on **all night long**. For those hours and hours no one was ordered to even simply get ready to go in.   "Several press reports surfaced Thursday saying Clintons department signed off on the sale of uranium rights in the U.S. to a Russian company, while the Clinton Foundation was receiving donations from that company. President Bill Clinton was also given a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia."  Outright corruption to anyone with common sense.  Head-turning and excuses from the liberal Reddit intelligentsia.       Obama and Holder will not rest until they find the white Tea Party member responsible.      There has not been a comprehensive report released yet.  Gowdy's report will be just that.   Your reasoning fails basic logic.   If you call the fire department and tell them your house is on fire, they will never say "It will take too long to get there and your house will be burned down by then, so we won't come at all."  No force was *ever* sent.  Why?    Here is the Democrat playbook for scandals.  1. Deny, stonewall, deny, stonewall, etc. 2. When evidence finally surfaces in spite of Democrat obstruction, say "it happened a long time ago."  Sorry Obama, Hillary and Carney....the truth is timeless.   All of these attacks took place in sovereign nations with responding security forces.  In these cases, unilateral intervention would be more difficult politically.  Libya, however, was in a state of civil war and unilateral action would have been the *only* security response.  Who is the only one person in the USA who can authorize military action in another nation?  Why was no rescue force ever sent while our people were in a siege and getting killed?  Why were fixed wing aircraft resting on a tarmac one hour away(Italy) never scrambled?  We did however manage to send an *unarmed* Predator.  Why did we prioritize the launch of an unarmed Predator over fixed wing assets with real bombs?  Why was the attack blamed on a video despite there being no evidence of this?  How did the White House/media know **immediately** the motivations of attackers in the middle of the night 8,000 miles away in a war torn country?  What source did they use for this?  Did they interview people?  How did they know this?  Why was a low ranking person, Susan Rice, paraded out on talk shows to blame this attack on a video?  Why not have someone that is formally in charge actually address the nation first?  TLDR: Our men fought all night long, while no one in Washington lifted a finger. The White House made up a story about a video, since this was mid-election and a terrorist attack would have been bad for Obama.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i4tuuy1jsw   "What difference does it make?"   You could substitute Grandma with any other person with more life experience than you.   A product of the Democrat party's free-for-all immigration policy to import votes.  There will be more of this..      Another inefficient federal program running in the red?  Color me surprised.      Give yourself small rewards for small attainable goals.  ie.  Play a game for 10 minutes after each hour of studying.   The rate of soldier suicide is actually lower than the general population.  Facts. Find them.   3) A holy war to ~~defend~~ spread Islam.   What would happen if you moved out of your mom's basement?         Barack Obama's illegitimacy to be President of the United States of America.   That's life. It's not fair.  When you stop blaming your problems on the "rich" bogeyman, you'll start sleeping better.  Take responsibility for your own situation.  No one else is holding you down.   Why do you believe you have a right to money that someone else has earned and already paid taxes on?   The estate tax is wildly unfair double taxation.  Another "hey you're rich and we don't like that so we will make separate laws for you" moment from the Democrats.   Because Americans were being actively overrun and Obama purposely didn't lift a finger.   Muslims are just so peaceful.         "more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline around the time the project was being debated in the State Department."  Goodbye Hillary.       Ohh those evil corporations are so corporationey.  Go get laid.      You mean we don't have a junior state senator with no leadership experience who dislikes white people? We have many viable candidates. What we don't have is cover from the media.    You mean one guy saying it vs an entire crowd chanting?            Foreign relations 101.   Your grade:F   Please show me where our President lobbied for North Korea to build nuclear weapons.   Iran has explicitly said they will "destroy Israel".   Intelligence gathering is now complete.   "The Obama administration has taken a position weaker than the U.N. Security Council.  Ouch.  So it's not even a harsh letter.      It's hardly a kneejerk but is a stance founded in the principle of equal treatment of all.   You want to treat children differently because of their race.    You are telling them they need extra special treatment because of their inherent race.  I'm sure that does wonders for their self-esteem.  Affirmative Action tells people they can't do it without help and in America that's bullshit.    This is a public school, not a private business.   Anything to keep them busy so they don't invade half the world again.         Brought to you by the Muslim Student Association and Muslim Brotherhood.      They're just so peaceful.   It is highly unethical for a Secretary of State to run a private charity that takes donations from foreign governments.  Can you say conflict of interest?   Why not discuss the topic of the article?   A Democrat does something unethical.  Reddit looks the other way and attacks the source.      Let me know how your campaign to ban "non-factual garbage opinion" goes.   You're right.  Let's ban dissenting views.  /s   How many wars will a military comprised of atheist Reddit hipsters be able to win?

 SCRATCH N SNIFF MONITOR, i need you.   home repairs.   not only do you save money but you never have to worry about someone screwing you over.  there's so many youtube videos on how to fix toilets, add thermostats, install garbage disposal etc.  it's not as hard as you think.  (TWSS)   happy to help a fellow cheeseheader if i can.      I would seriously considering ordering one off of DrWobstarCwaw.   shoulda bought a weber   my roommate did this several times.  other times he would rip open a bag of salad, pour it on the counter, pour ranch onto said salad/counter and eat with his hands.     I've been happy with Kim Miley in the past.  No pressure to come back or get on said 'recommended schedule'.  They have a great masseuse as well.  http://www.mileychiro.com/   hit Dynamic Discs right around the corner from Oklahoma Joe's.  http://www.dynamicdiscs.com/kansas-city-disc-golf/   Agreed 100%.       my concern with the pizza was that the giardiniera would make it really soggy.  was it?   it's about one block north of 103rd and pflumm on the west side.  right next to where grinders south is being built.  their beef is uh uh good.  i was in there a few weeks ago and the chef told us he's now making an italian beef pizza!   $8000 on dirt?!  that's a lot of dirt.

 At the end of last year in place of the ever popular Hchste Kaiser's Word, there was a live showing of the execution of the show's news team. Before the execution, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 explained to the people that the news team was being punished after the discovery that they were stealing classified information and supplying it to the terrorist group currently at large and killing Liechtenstein's citizens. The execution was done by pistol and carried out personally by the nation's leader. After the execution he stated that betrayal to the country in any form will not be tolerated.   At this point just asking would be more unique than anything else.   Jesus, for a second I thought he was.   Well I feel silly. I meant to add something to the post before submitting it.   Liechtenstein is doing nothing. We had no property in space.   In other news, the terrorist cell currently attacking unarmed civilians and government buildings has begun spreading its demands across the Internet. They are calling for a stop to the construction of the Wall and reopening of the nation's borders. The group claims to be making these demands in order to stop what they foresee to be a rapid downfall in the country's economy that they fear will have a large and irreparable effect on Liechtenstein's people. The still nameless group had threatened to continue the attacks until their demands are met. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has yet to make a public acknowledgement to the terrorists' demands.  Edit: forgot stuff   Liechtenstein welcomes you. We have sent a fruit bouquet in hopes of peaceful relations from now on.   Yeah, the Ajax near my house is selling a couple really cheap.   "Stay out."  ~Hchste Kaiser, /u/test_subject7429   Liechtenstein wishes for a public execution competition.   Fucking do it   Our ancestors were right. We'll protect this secret with our lives.   Aw man. Well, thanks for letting me know.   Hchste Kaiser will attend your silly convention.   If you could please clear the confusion on the shape of the Earth, Liechtenstein would be most appreciative.   ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   When I last saw them Caleb had disappeared into the crowd and someone from the crowd got on stage and finished I Have A Problem. It was pretty great.   I've seen them twice now and let me just say that they are the only opening band I've ever seen with so much enthusiasm. They got the entire room moshing. It was fantastic.   No problem. I'll wait. My bad.   We'd love to continue the service.   Liechtenstein might be willing to pay for Sealand's mail service to continue of it's in Great Britain's best interests.   Thanks for looking out for me ;)   [Meta] Thanks! [Meta]   [Meta] Yeah, I'm just having fun with this. And of course, if it ever becomes a nuisance, I'll set her free.   Liechtenstein would like to send diplomats to the micro nation of Sealand to discuss annexation as a strategic base. Since its leadership has gone quiet for over a year since claiming the territory, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 assumes that it is now open to new leadership and, because of it's size, wouldn't count as a full country in regards to annexation.   Liechtenstein withdraws its attempted negotiations with Austria for annexation of one of its territories.   Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to help with the relief efforts. They're trained for all manner of emergency situations beyond just combat.   In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks.   The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning.   Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.    I was on a tricycle and a friend and I were rolling down a neighbor's driveway into another neighbor's lawn to slow down. Long story short, my shitty trike was nothing on her Big Wheel and I had no helmet. The grass didn't slow me down enough and the front wheel hit a rock. I flipped over the handle bars and hit my head on the rock and blacked out. Then I saw one of my neighbors running toward me yelling my name. Blacked out. Blood on the sidewalk. Blacked out. My front door. Blacked out. Then it was the next day. Tricycles make me nervous now.   Beautiful   Our eternal leader, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the bass guitar the national animal of Liechtenstein. They are now government protected creatures under the guidelines set by the newly passed Godly Rythm Act of 2020. All citizens will treat bass guitars from here on out with reverence, love, and the utmost respect or risk public execution. That is all.   Liechtenstein has sent a fruit bouquet as a welcome back gift. Just know that they aren't  actual flowers, but fruit under the guise if flowers. We hope you enjoy the fruit man's ruse.   I live here and didn't know that!   (I was busy yesterday)  Hchste Kaiser's third year as the supreme general of our great nation has been quite eventful. An attempted terrorist attack took place at the capital building while Hchste Kaiser was meeting with all of his officials. Luckily, the explosive malfunctioned and wasn't able to detonate. Turkey was able to supply intelligence that told us that this isn't a single man's idea, but a group effort. The terrorist is still being interrogated for information.  On a brighter side, our great leader recently started a new program for the military elite. The SHIT program will include the best if the best soldiers from both Liechtenstein and France. These SHIT Squads will be used as Hchste Kaiser's personal guard and in missions considered to dangerous for the average soldier or police officer. Hopefully, once the program releases the first groups from training, a terrorist attack like the one mentioned will become much more difficult to execute.  In more recent news, our wonderful leader sent delegates to the Vorarlberg region of Austria to negotiate an annexation. If Austria's own annexation of another area comes to fruition, then Vorarlberg may well become the newest addition to our great nation. These negotiations also led to an alliance between the two countries.  In other news, the construction of the Wall is going as planned, but, sadly, the **subway station's** construction has been haulted until further notice. And finally, Texas finally gave Hchste Kaiser his money back. When asked about the country's new leader, /u/test_subject7429's only response was, "Who? Oh, s***! I'm late for my banjo lessons. Get out!"  This concludes your only choice in yearly news. We thank you for choosing Hchste Kaiser's Word, even though you have no other option.  All news dictated but not read by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429  Next: Real Housewives of Liechtenstein with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   Batman   Robin isn't the worst movie. It's just really, really bad.   Excellent! Good luck, for both of our sake!   We think that would be a great idea.   Whatever you choose, Liechtenstein respects the decision.   Thanks for considering. We understand if you'd like to keep the land.   Liechtenstein would be willing to donate $10B to help with the project. We are also willing to help train pilots and design weapons systems for the ships if needed.   Hchste Kaiser wishes to expand, fearing that the small size if our already great nation is a weakness. If Vorarlberg will allow it, we will welcome them into our arms as a new addition to our country.   This information is concerning. Thank you for sharing this.   Liechtenstein is interested in helping with this project, if you'll have us.  ~Hchste Kaiser   Signed  ~Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   Recently there was an attempt on the Hchste Kaiser's life. During a meeting with his parliament, a large car rammed itself through the front doors of the building and the driver attempted to detonate an explosive in the vehicle. Thankfully, the explosive didn't detonate and the bomber was captured. He is currently in custody and being questioned. Hopefully this was an individual attack and not a group effort. Any information will be extremely appreciated.    Liechtenstein would be honored to have France's legendary soldiers take part in the SHIT program.   Today, our great nation begins a program that will not only ensure our land's protection, but help efforts all over the world. This day marks the beginning of the Special Hunt and Infiltrate Trooper training program for the country's most elite military personnel. This elite team of soldiers will have the newest in prototype military technology and have the best training the country can offer. This is a great step forward for Liechtenstein's military and a great day for our country!   Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   Hchste Kaiser will make an appearance. The yeti menace has terrorized the great nation of Liechtenstein for far too long.   I'm a a pretty big fan of Mike Litoris, myself.   I completely agree with you. I don't know what it is, but I find that the more affordable cars are a lot more interesting.   I wish they'd had the other characters you'd unlocked around the city fighting crime or something. That would've been badass.   With the return of Liechtenstein's money, the construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein will begin as planned in January of next year. However, without the help of the former dictator of Texas, a completion date is still unknown. But do not worry, people.  The continuity of this great nation is still of utmost importance to me.  Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   Thank you very much.   Return Liechtenstein's money and I will consider making an appearance at your silly concert.   Does Matt Greiner play guitar?   This year has been a stressful one for the great leader of Liechtenstein. The panic cause by the meteorite impact in Northern Africa forced Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 to close the border to all but the most important persons and events. Despite the crisis being solved, the leader remains cautious and has yet to reopen the borders to the rest of the world.  In other news, a **subway system** began construction. Everyone is extremely excited for the **subway** and hopes to be able to **travel the country quickly and in comfort** soon. Sadly the **subway** does not yet have a definite completion date, but stay tuned!  (*Disclaimer*: **subway system** is definitely **not** a military bunker.)  On the topic of construction, the leader of our great nation also began construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein. This wall will surround the entire country and be fully armed with soldiers, artillery, etc. Sadly, did to the recent change in leadership in Texas, the previously expected help in building the wall seems to no longer be the case. This unexpected delay has caused this project, too, to no longer have an expected completion date.  On a related note, Hchste Kaiser expects Texas to, "Give me my money back. Like, now, guys. I mean... Come on."  Lastly, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the raspberry as Liechtenstein's national fruit. All citizens are now required to consume at least one raspberry every 6 hours in accordance with the laws set by the recently passed Freaking Delicious Act of 2018.  This concludes your once a year news source Hchste Kaiser's Word. Tune in next year for your only choice in Liechtenstein news!  Stay tuned for Sing-Along Disney Songs with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   Why have I seen this same story in different formats so much these last couple of weeks?   Due to the recent change in leadership in Texas and unrealistically enthusiastic deadlines by our great leader, the **subway** that was planned no longer has a definite completion date. We **apologise to the citizens** and **hope they will be able to ride the rails** sooner than later.  Hchste Kaiser's Minister for Expansion   Yeah, that was just me being enthusiastic more than anything. It'll definitely be a while.   Either Notch or Lived a Lie by Codec   Oh, it definitely is **legit**.   Liechtenstein has begun construction of an underground **subway.** This amazing **transportation system** will run throughout the entire country and **be able to transport the citizens of Liechtenstein all over the country**! This is **in no way** a military base or a vault or anything of the sort! As a sneak peak, I am willing to say that the new **subways** will feature extremely large 3 ft thick gates that will stand around 20 ft high and be able to be withstand even the most powerful of **train collisions**! Isn't that fantastic? The **subway system** will also be going hundreds of feet below ground with multiple levels to **allow for more trains and routes**! Wow! To give you people an idea about the size, it may or may not be able to hold the majority if not all of the citizens of Liechtenstein in the event of a great **celebration** so everyone will be able to **party together**! Amazing! We anticipate that this **subway system** will be complete in a matter of 3-4 years and then **everyone** will be **allowed** to **ride the trains all over the country**!  Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein /u/test_subject7429   Liechtenstein   Holy shit. The fez thing. I know someone that wears one every day.    Ohmigawd you guys so I was on tumblr and everything they said even the stupid way they type without punctuation as if they were yelling and never taking a breath is just crazy and I'm literally dyING YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW   That has to be one of the shortest ever. I swear it lasted all of 3 days.   Wonderful. I've sent the funds.   Sir, you have your self a deal. Maybe we can even go one step further... And build both.   Preposterous. I won't pay a penny over $98M   Hmm, how large of a fee?   After reports of a multitude of people secretly entering the great nation of Liechtenstein despite the heavily enforced closed border rulings, I have decided that in order to keep the peace and integrity and ensure the defense and safety of this perfect nation and its citizens, a barrier must be built. The wall will stand 50 feet tall, be heavily defended, and surround the entire nation. This decision is not one made easily, but must happen in order to ensure the safety of my nation and its people in these unpredictable times.   Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   Social experiment?   Well... That's awkward because he's... Ah... Dead.   The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.  As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.  In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.  That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.  On next: Cooking with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   All travel into Liechtenstein is hereby suspended indefinitely. Only people with top clearance will be allowed across the border and only when it is absolutely essential that they be allowed into the country.   Liechtenstein also offers financial aide to help with researching/combating the new bacteria.   ~Signed Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   Liechtenstein would be happy to join ~Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   If you could change that, I would be forever grateful.   Awesome. Thanks!   How's "Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein"?   Lichtenstein wholeheartedly accepts the offer!   Lichtenstein hopes the parties are fantastic.   Lichtenstein offers a party planner instead.   Liechtenstein hopes you understand.   From here and on, all citizens 16 and older will receive basic military training in preparation for any evident military threats against this great nation.  Liederstein Froogle   The country of Liechtenstein thanks you and in return would like to send a shipment of posters depicting the Alps (36"x12"/91.5cm x30cm). We hope this is the start if a wonderful friendship.   Actually, I'm really sorry if you already did it, but  Hchste Allgemeinen fr die Ewigkeit  Would be nice.  Edit: I'm perfectly happy if you can't/don't want to.   Are they bright?      All glory to Supreme Liederstein!   Honestly, there's always seemed to be this huge anti religion thing in the genre. And it's a little weird.   There's a whole sub if you didn't know! /r/reclaimedbynature sadly it doesn't seem to be very active at this time.   You guys are so cute together!  	91

Plus add on top of that the whole correlation is not equal to causation thing.  Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Yes, you need to pay attention to what you eat in order to make sure you are eating healthy, but that is the case regardless of whether or not you are vegetarian.  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns.

Are you subscribed to /r/vegetarian?   Don't let the negative comments bother you. Veganism isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of anything relating to kingdom animalia. It is about minimizing the harm our actions cause to animals as much as possible and practicable. If an animal does not possess the neurological capacity to be harmed in any meaningful sense then it is perfectly vegan to use/eat it.

[Here's a talk by Adriano Mannino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aa6g1y4l8I) (one of my favorite philosophers) on reducing wild animal suffering.      I think you have the wrong idea of this post. I do not run Action For Animals. I am not trying to get into modeling. There is nothing that I stand to gain from this. Even if it was self promotion, given the amount of other material I contribute to reddit it would easily fall within what is allowed under the reddit rules.   Sounds like somebody can't believe it's not butter.   When you're on Tour I expect you to post pictures of yourself modeling the shorts to /r/vegan.   EU countries import 35 million tons of soy beans and soy meal from north and south America every year - to use as feed for pigs, chickens and cows.  Cultivation of primarily genetically modified soy for export uses land in developing countries that could go toward sustainable agriculture.  But even in industrialized countries like Germany, globalized industrial livestock farming presents a pollution problem.  "[Animal waste] is the root of considerable environmental problems in Germany, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming," explained agrarian economist Knut Ehlers of the German Environment Agency.  Although manure is also a fertilizer, too much is toxic for soil and water. The environmental impacts of factory farming "ultimately fall on the taxpayer," said Ehlers.  Such agriculture is unsustainable, Ehlers stressed. He hopes that aiming more public attention to the issue of soil depletion on the national and EU levels will lead to more sustainable policy-making, and development of organic agriculture.  [Source](http://www.dw.de/loss-of-fertile-soils-a-food-security-risk/a-18395856)  Plant farms are taking on a part of the issue of the overwhelming amount of excessive manure and waste generated by animal agriculture, and yet you are trying to throw them under the bus for not being entirely self-reliant? We have many other fertilizer options available. Be grateful that these farms take on some of the waste that you create.   Shh... Don't tell the NSA.

If you're going to any of the US Warped Tour shows they will also be available there.                              As a utilitarian, I am going to say that the action would be justified if the benefit to you exceeds the harm to animals, and if it is the available option that maximizes the benefit and minimizes harm.  I think you would be hard pressed to find many real-world scenarios where raising animals oneself or hunting them in the sense that you are likely imagining would meet those criteria. However, I will say that hunting oysters, which are animals with very limited nervous systems as adults, could very well be justified.   You went from a bad justification to a terrible justification. It is not okay to pay people to abuse animals and slaughter them just because you enjoy it. You need to take into account both your enjoyment as well as the harm your actions cause to others in order to make an ethical decision.  The food chain is not an ethical theory (and you won't be any more likely to get eaten by other animals if you choose to eat less meat).

So if great apes could be taught American sign language, or if parrots had been taught to speak as well as human children, or if dolphins called each other by name and spoke over underwater telephones, or if we had identified words in prairie dog language that communicate shape, size, color, and species of individuals then you would treat them with respect?  At the same time not all humans possess language or higher reason. There are young children, the severely mentally handicapped, the elderly and senile. Should we treat them as property and say their rights end where their owner says so?   Humans are animals, and the idea of what ethically relevant criteria should separate humans from non-human animals is one that has been debated for millennia and pushed back time and time again.

 Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a book for the better part of a year now, and i wanted to show off the main characters and get some feedback regarding them. The basic plot is that death has stopped working and the five protagonists have to find out why before the world ends.  I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.  Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is useless in a physical fight.  Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing. He sucks at hand to hand and relies on trickery and dirty tactics to win.  Daniel- I know he's a young swordsman, but I need help for him in terms of personailty and quirks  Kara is a young woman who is raised by dwarves. As a result, she is capable of defending herself in hand to hand combat and is the only party member who is able to hold off multiple opponents single handily. However, while she is a badass, Kara isn't very good in social situations and due to the dwarven tradition of judo throwing people as a way of saying 'hello', this leads to some really awkward situations.  Felix is the grim reaper's teenaged and amnesiac apprentice. He is the voice of reason in the cast and tries his best to guide the them in the right direction. As the apprentice of Death, he is capable of teleporting and entering the realm of the dead. Despite the fact that he wears a skull mask, he's a nice guy.   Hey Redditors,  I think I might be a low level empath. Whenever there's an argument around the house or I talk to someone with high levels of emotion, I pick up on how they're feeling and 'acquire' it to my own mental state. For example, if my mom is angry, I become unhappy. I've tried shutting this off, but I can't seem to. Some times this can be great, like when I'm talking to girls, I can pick up on 'vibes' and say the right things, but other times, when in an argument, this is bad. Any suggestions on what to do?    Yeah, as a little feedback, I don't care about credentials! I'm not an employer, I'm a reader. I need to know if this character likes chocolate ice cream, or if his wife died and started his path to being a hero or even if he's secretly gay! Tell US about THEM personally. You need to know these characters inside and out.   Hey Redditors,  Just wondering, is there a separate subreddit for character feedback, or can I do it here? I don't want to seem to egotistical.  Thanks, much love!    Hey Redditors,  I want to make a Minecraft Machinima, but I don't know how. I work on a Mac, and I only have one computer.  Thanks    I could see Turps or Strippin as golems, Fiona as a shape shifter and Strife as a Griffin.   On second thought, I'll just make the world with multiple biomes, but a very large jungle region along the Equator   It's the same size as earth.   Oh wow. I'm not much for climatology, but thanks man, I'll add some more biomes then.   Nice work! I personally would've chosen wolves or otters, but I made the post, so I figured it would be in bad taste.    Interesting! Very Tarzanish!         The idea is that having archenemy is easy in a world where superhumans exist. Forming rouges galleries would be made simple through the app. Also, I wanted that whole ,'borderline in a committed relationship' that some superheroes like Batman have with some of their enemies. And The Quake and Screech will eventually develop that overtime.   It wasn't that I was a bad superhero. I'd fought criminals, like Big Figure, Crag and Crowbar. But I didn't have a arch nemesis like my friends. I knew that getting an arch would propel me into superhero stardom, but I just couldn't get a break. So I turned to the internet, a phone application called Find-a-Nemesis. I met a guy around my age, 19, named Mathis. After we got to know each other, we agreed to go meet in person.   I stood at the door of the apartment as it was wrenched open by a heavy set teenager wearing a pink t-shirt with a cartoon pony on the front. His face was covered in acne and his glasses were perched on his greasy nose, over a cheap black mask that hardly stretched over his face. A red cape was tied around his neck and he wore a pair of matching gloves that went up to his elbows.   "Hey are you Mathis?" I asked, hoping that this was his fanboy brother. Not that I was picky, but I didn't think this guy could even walk a mile, let alone withstand one of my sonic screams. He scowled at me. "I am Mathis." he annouced with a heavy lisp. "And I assume you are Wyatt, AKA, The Screech." My heart fell. This guy is my arch? Damn it. "I was expecting someone at little more- you know- capable of putting up an impressive fight." I said sheepishly. Mathis grinned, showing me a row of yellow stained teeth. He flexed his flabby arms and glared at me. After a minute of awkward silence, the ground began to shake.  "Um, is that it?" I asked. Mathis nodded.  "You have felt the power of... THE QUAKE!" I groaned. "No." I said. "I can find someone better for the job, thanks though." I turned and began walking down the street. I opened the Nemesis app and turned on the locator. 'No new nemesis's in your area' it read. Damn. I turned back to Mathis.   "Ok, fine. I guess your my arch. Let's make this quick."   No, Patrons can tell who is a another patron and who isn't. Plus a lot of their meat comes from the dinosaur-like creatures.   I'm thinking that the type of magic is going to be exclusive to your patron animal with the exception of deity boons. For example, a lion shapeshifter would have a ability to enhance their strength for a amount of time, but the a lioness priestess could call for a certain god's help in battle for whatever.       There are other varying climates, but a large part of the world is jungle and rainforest.   Nope. No one is 'normal'. Unless i decide to make a story where that is the case.   They prey on the week. Interesting.    This will be a book series. I just need ideas for how each race, (black, white, asian) could be represented. The overall goal for the world is to make it as cool as possible while being as relatively realistic as I can be with magic and shapeshifters. And there is a sort of 'Republic' like the Roman Empire that's important.       Hey Redditors,  I had an idea for a world where every biome is a jungle, baring the poles. The people have the ability to become their patron animal, like a jaguar, parrot, river dolphin ect. Dinosaur-like creatures also exist. I need your help because I'm not sure where to take this concept .    Pantaria used to have a Magocractic council. Unfortunately, after two hundred years of the chaotic and an ultimately unproductive rule, it was dissolved but has been reformed twenty years before the events of the series. The magocracy was and still is corrupt, run by a lazy and idiotic council of wizards and a few sensible witches. People generally don't care about the council, as everyone knows that only a major event would get them to agree on anything. The only thing stopping the mages from doing whatever they want is food. All council members have four feasts a day, and are so fat, they need levitation chairs to get around. They don't care about anything but their own political agenda, and will fiercely defend it, often times to the death. The council members will usually be either top graduates of prestigious magic academies, be the sons or daughters of former council members, or just kill their way into a council seat.    I slammed the door to my apartment and bolted the door just in time to hear the frantic whirring of the now sentient vacuum robot outside my door. I opened my blinds and looked down into the L.A streets, as the sea of black and silver machines swarmed over the screaming crowd. A woman standing on a taxi screamed as two of the sucking bastards tackled her and began viciously sucking at her face and hands. There was a loud squelching noise and a crimson spray of gore splattered across the hood of the taxi, as her now faceless corpse slid down into the machines below.   "Oh god, help! Someone help!" A man wearing a pink cardigan shouted, his high voice becoming hard to hear of the roar of the cacophonous machines. The man had managed to climb on to the bus that was parked below my apartment window. I wrenched open the window and threw down the emergency rope ladder, thanking my overcautious mother for the gift.   "Grab on!" I shouted down to the man. He looked up, relief passing over his blood splattered face. He grabbed the second rung and began climbing. For a second, I though he'd make it, but then it all went to hell. A few Roombas had managed to somehow climb on to the roof of the bus and where beginning to devour the lower rungs. The man was halfway up before my door was broken down by at least thirty of the robotic bastards, each one sucking up splinters of the door. I shrieked and held on to the ladder with one hand, while struggling to fend off the ravenous vacuums with a broom. Then my hand slipped and the ladder fell. I managed to look over the edge of my windowsill to see the man fall, screaming on to the bus with a nasty crack. His leg was hanging at an odd angle, blood dripping from a compound fracture into the sea of vacuums below. Then they all turned their attention away from civilians and began to swarm the bus, pushing, shoving like a school of piranhas. The Roombas in my apartment were distracted, so I pushed them out of the way and ran down the hallway. I didn't know where to go next, but I heard about a quarantine zone a few miles outside the city. I just hoped I could make it.                 Happy birthda-vorp   Oh totally. I need a sidekick though   My name is Chris. And I am a wizard. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I am an ordinary dishwasher, but secretly I use my yeti powers to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am frostyetiwizard.   Oh, god, I can see each of us with a Arrow style opening   A cross dressing superheroine vs a guy who wears yeti slippers and a wizard robe with a sonic howl?   Thanks! A lot of fun! I really wish we could find an artist to make a group poster, just to see how silly everyone would look!   During the day, he's an ordinary 20 year college student and part time dishwasher. But by night, he throws off his Smite t-shirt and becomes..... frostyetiwizard! Diving into a pair of sturdy jeans, wizard robe, Kick-Ass style mask and yeti slippers, frostyetiwizard patrols the streets of Seattle, battling foul villains from his Rogues Gallery such as Downstrike, Southafricanon and his arch enemy, firegoblinwarlock. Our heroes powers are frost beams, a magical cape that lets him fly and a sonic Yeti howl that can shatter glass.    Oh, I see! Well, considering how they're human-like, their home planet is about the same distance from their sun as Earth is from ours.   I don't quite understand.  	33
 I definitely get that he needs to get help for his bipolar disorder...and that other people could love those qualities.   He doesn't call me names or do anything like that...  However, I see your point and appreciate your honesty.   Its for Information Technology and I'm thinking a deep red heel and deep red or black blouse...   My mom is a hairdresser and basically the low down on clarifying shampoo is that it shouldn't be used twice and its to remove impurities such as chlorine...  It shouldn't be used regularly and is actually really hard on your hair.   Kind of feel like I'm missing the context of why your hair dresser told you this...Although, even if you switched colors to blonde or lighter a 'blonde shampoo' is a better choice.     The lather from shampoo actually isn't a good measure of anything as its all chemically created...I use dread shampoo and the lather is very very minimal and consistent because it doesn't contain these chemicals...Even Sulfate free shampoos typically have other chemicals in them...  My hair acts much better and the natural oils in my hair are not stripped from washing daily. Because I use natural oil based dread shampoo, which comes in a bar like soap..It doesn't strip any oil. Its all about what you're using.     This has happened to me too recently...I've been on Marvelon 21 for over 2 years and now that I'm taking it continuously it seems very very useless. 22 days and 3 doctor's appointments/clinic visits later my period got to be over. Beyond terrible and my family doctor won't switch me to anything else.   She isn't a specialist but I don't really understand the difference between a specialist and a gyno/surgeon...There's only one specialist close to my area in the listings here(Halifax/Nova Scotia) and I can't find any info for him when I click the link...  And thank you for the well wishes!    Thank you for the advice and well wishes, I'll look into heating pads for sure!   I know what you mean about exercise, I lose my energy very quickly. And its super frustrating because I used to be an athlete and now yoga is hard. But, I'm going to keep at it.    I'll try to keep physio in mind if/when I get a diagnosis.    I've been taking fish oil as part of my supplement routine as well as vitamin D.   I'm actually as it happens lactose intolerant, I do try to have milk alternatives for ice cream and milk but mostly just veer away from it all because I find soy bothers me as well.   I can see how exercise can help, I'll have to start trying some yoga..  Thanks for the advice and the well wishes, I have an appointment to see a surgeon/gyno on May 29th. Hoping she schedules me for a lap.    Thank you very much for the advice, I think you're right...I'll look into doing both of these! It definitely has been taking a toll,   I'm in Ns and wondering if this one is still current? I clicked the link in the added section but his name wasn't listed anywhere on the page...   Would you mind explaining the difference I'm new to all this...   I'm currently being relatively untreated for my endo...I'm taking vimovo(basically naproxen) twice daily 500mg. And taking my birth control continuously with issue...My appointment with my new gyno is in 2 months or so...And I'm in pain daily, low pelvic pain mostly sometimes its leg and back too though. I've been trying to manage my diet, I've cut out coffee, soy, all dairy except cheese, eggs, and started taking supplements, eating fiber, and drinking green tea...Is there anything else I can be doing to help myself?   _sinnerbynature   just wondering about how to start with this method and the best things to use for combs with back combing and that sort of thing...Does this method typically have a lot of shrinkage? How long should my hair be before I start this method...Is it possible to do your whole head alone?   "yurbuds, Ironman inspire series"...They're designed for the gym, and have an optional clip...As well as play, pause, etc buttons built in...The rubber piece that locks them in can be taken off if you want to use them for normal activities...        Aw, thank you! :) My budget isn't great I'm kind of limited to drug store and discount stuff at the moment...I'd really like to keep my everyday look more of a natural kind of thing but I'd really appreciate any other look suggestions you think would like good! I think I just prefer natural where I'm new to make up. I like highlighting my eyes, maybe my cheek bones but I have no idea where to even start on that one.   I really appreciate that suggestion I'm definitely going to give it a try! I'm picturing it and I think you're right about the definition without harshness...I do find the black liner a little harsh around my eyes.   Where can I get NYX products? I live in Canada if that helps...and Thank you so much for the suggestions! :)    That sounds very very doable, and hmmm...I will have to look into something a bit cheaper for sure, I'm a student on a budget but I appreciate the suggestion.  And thank you! :) I find its a bit red without foundation but overall I can't complain. haha.    Well, I'm currently a student so the drug store price range is definitely ideal...I'll definitely look into the Maybelline nude palette! Thank you :) And, I have a brush I will use with my eyeshadow...it could probably be better though, lol. I'm not sure what kind of color I should go for with blush...I've never used it as I'm fairly new to make up in general. Thank you so much for the compliments they mean a lot! :)  I'll look into the lip butters as well, I recently picked up a red lip tint but I'm not too sure about it yet...Its called santa baby from lush...I feel like red is a little too bold can you recommend me a few colors? :)   	20

 Hashtag alcoholism   I don't think you know the meaning of what you just said. There are contradictions in your sentence that nearly created a tear in the fabric of space-time.       If an Hispanic man being found innocent via a completely legal jury is openly called racism by our president, what is the blatant ignoring of an entire city that is predominantly black called?

 I can only partly understand your feelings OP. I'm 18, and my very first girlfriend, I had started dating at the beginning of December. She came off as quiet, but when she got used to you she would talk your ears off. She also warned me. Of how her past would be extremely difficult to work through. Like you, I thought I could handle it. But I was naive. I didn't go through the things you did (the late nights with her extremely depressed), but I did fully realize what 7 years of self-harm can do to a person. And how utterly and hopelessly depressed some people can be. I couldn't bring my self to love her the way she needed. It was far too taxing for my very first relationship, and it honestly scared the hell out of me. The self-harm made me push her away. I also tried to end it as soon as I realized, because I didn't want her feelings for me to deepen to the point where she feels the need to end it all. I was torn up in the break-up, and what made it worse is that I'm positive that instead of helping her condition, I only added more scars to her body and heart. It's a rough life. Good Luck to you man.   Tempus Edax Rerum   One Day Too Late by Skillet  It helps me when I lose sight of my goals, or when I have an opportunity to take a risk for a benefit.

 When you have to factor in..  * Travel cost to get equipment to site. * Hire price for the machines to rip it up, re seal it, smooth it over etc.     * A machine to rip up old road     * A machine to lay new seal     * A machine to lay new arreggrate     * A machine to smooth it all down     * **Not sure if you can get 1 machine to do multiple jobs?** * Getting council approval to take road. * OSH precautions - Road cone's diversion plans. * Advertising may be required if it's a main state HW - so cost of hiring a fuckoff sign for a week or two. * Cost of 5+ staff perhaps. * Cost of clean up (dumping waste etc.) * Cost of tar seal. * Cost of rock aggregate. * Cost of portaloo for time period needed.  From seeing it done a few times, depending on damage..  They would need to:  * Dig up X amount off road * Lay new substrate * Lay new tar seal and chip it  Or at least that's my extremely layman's point of view, but I'm sure you wouldn't get much change from a 80-100K $ per KM. And then you factor in redoing the bridge, this will be signifcantly higher due to probably needing to shut down the bridge/have a stop/go so probably nearer $300-400k per KM  Edit: he's recording for at least say 3minutes using this [distance calculator website cause I'm lazy..](http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/speed_distance_time_calc.html) and he's travelling at 90km/h for the entire trip, say 2minutes at 90km/h = 3kms.  So to answer your question, I would hazard a guess of around (at least) $1,000,000+ to redo the road the fucktard ripped up.      Ok,  let's look at meridian energy for instance.   They generate energy which pays dividends to the government and private corporations.  These dividends are supported by worth and profit. To maintain their worth they must generate a X amount of profit. They get profit from selling energy to consumers. An extra charge (say to Maori for water rights) eats into the profit, which means they have to charge you and I more to maintain the same worth, and continue to pay dividends.  So essentially you and I will be paying more, which will be subsiding the water payment.  So again, I pay a amount which goes to government which they use to better the entire country. If they are successful I will pay more money which will only benefit Maori.  How is this fair?   Again I understand if the water was Tapu, or they simply want more money, and you and I will be paying for it.     Preparing for the bashing here, but seriously over this fucking profit grab.  Unlike the money which is currently gathered for water rights us used by all kiwi under say the local council who charge for the usage rights, this money will go to exclusive rights to the Maori.   How is that not racist in it's own rights? "I don't want everyday NZ'ers to benefit from the water, I want ONLY Maori to benefit from the water use." Fuck That Shit.  Edit: if you're going to downvote me, tell me why I'm wrong. I understand the Treaty of Waitangi, I understand Maori have rights to the LAND which was taken from them, but water is a renewable resource, it's not Tapu, how can they claim rights to be able to sell it off and make the profit from it? And take profit away from everyday NZ'ers?   Protips:  Add +1 hour to almost all Google City-city trips.  Don't take the main highways if you're not in a rush.  West coast anywhere = must visit.  Put the camera down, and just take in the sights without a viewfinder in front of your face.  If you're from a major city, take a walk at midnight/1am basically anywhere from the main centres = More stars than you've ever likely seen anywhere else in your life.   Wearing a helmet pro: YOU DON'T FUCKING DIE IF YOU GET HIT BY A CAR.  Con's:  Oh, my hair do gets messed up.  Yea.. In all seriousness though, I would love to see [hovdings](http://www.hovding.com/how_hovding_works) being sold in NZ ay.   100% scam. Good luck, if you can't see em face to face don't sell them shit. They are looking to scam you. Trademe are a cesspool of lowlife scum, and Trademe themselves seemingly couldn't give a flying fuck about it. (Or there's nothing they can do.)      I should have known something that had been gilded that many times, but wasn't the top story was something really fishy!   You Sir are a legend.   "I quit my job to earn less to avoid paying money to help my children" would make a much more accurate Stuff article. But no, it's all governments fault. /s   Nah man you've missed the point - just a lot of bad stories about German tourists. You don't hear of other nationalities stealing returned camper vans, or camping out in red zone houses or pulling knives on people. I don't know why they're all Germans, but it's just not a good look.   To explain my headline:  * German tourists pulled knife on a reporter when he approached them in New Brighton while they were covering a piece on freedom camping. * German tourists camped out in a Redzone house last year, shitting all over the place. * German tourists told there are easy pickings in tourists returning camper vans to Chch Airport (implying it's been done numerous times before).            This sounds like a piss take surely.       Thanks for the update, good luck to you both.  It's stressful enough losing an income without this on top.   Just keep a recording/write down everything that happens so as little as possible can be disputed should it go that far.  Put it this way, I got hit by a car recently, they disputed they were at fault. I had a dash cam recording as proof so insurance waived excess immediately. :)   English is not my forte.   God damn grammar fail. Re-read it like 5 times too. Fuck it.   Ironically if you ever did that to a sheep while you're shearing it you would probably be shot on sight.         To be honest they are probably relying on you giving up and going away.   The trouble is if the assholes are going to do it to you, chances are they will try it on with someone else, so fully don't give up.  By seeking legal advice you could let them know you're playing hard ball, which could be enough to scare them into paying without any further fuss.   I'm not sure were you are, but here's a [Free phone Canterbury Law advice helpline](http://www.canlaw.org.nz/legal-info-by-phone)  [Or find your local community law centre](http://www.communitylaw.org.nz/your-local-centre/find-a-community-law-centre/)  Edit: ensure ALL your correspondence with them is captured, if you phone them put them on speaker and have another phone recording them. Of course tell them: "For complete disclosure, this call is being recorded and may be used should this matter have to go to court." it might seem like a dick move, but if it's your word against theirs don't make their life any easier.    A better roll out method for Android updates that don't involve such a stupendously lengthy process.  Seriously, I'm faced with my wife's S4 being upgraded to lollipop before my S5 for goodness sake.   Yeah..very.         He was a recidivist dangerous driver, was stoned and on the wrong side of the road. Fuck that judge with a deepheat coated pole.   My condolences to the family, that us not justice, that's a joke.   Don't touch the camera with sunblock on your hands [it's actually really bad for the plastic.](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/08/29/psa-sunblock-bad-camera/#.VSTjS0OuTXm)   We're with state with 2 cars and contents. Coupled with roadside assistance we've been more than happy with the 2 car claims so far, no contents yet.   Good price with a package discount.    Most car advertisements.  This car is going to make you feel awesome.   Fuck, I can think a lot of cheaper ways to make you feel awesome than a $50,000 car.   your name is apt in the context of this comment.   What kind of tokens do you find?   Buzzbars are also good frozen if you can get your hands on one!      My hat off to you. How do you cope without wanting to give the little buggers a good smack?   Really? Did not know that. As I said it's very well tinted windows. God that must be a boring job.   Nah, it's a dedicated speed camera. (Dark blue van with camera sticking out the rear heavily tinted window.)  But that does raise a good point, now this could be because I see a very censored view of NZ policing via police television shows, but I see your point in that if someone is doing 1 thing dodgy, chances are likely they're also doing other stupid shit - like if they're not wearing their seatbelt, they could have an unrego'd car or something. Again, that's just from seeing TV shows, but it confirms your theory of if someone looks dodge, it's cause they are?   For the record (and yes, I've never had a speeding ticket so can throw  stones. (for now again)) most speedo's are calibrated to +2-3km/h at 50km/h and +4-7km/h at 100km/h.  So if you were stupid enough to drive with your needle above the +5km mark, you're going to get caught.   Drive at 50-55km/h and you're going to get lasered at 48-53km/h no problems.   Source = my driving past the concealed fuckers down Fendalton road in Chch every morning.   So basically, target the people who drink in moderation and who probably WILL PAY to avoid a conviction than increase the charges for those who drink to excess and WHO FUCKING DON'T PAY anyway?    Fucking GENIUS! I bet the politician who thought this up while playing golf on a Wednesday morning got a massive pay rise.   Actually totally agree with you. It's fucking hardcore bullshit our pussy ass politicians target mum and dad enjoying a wine with dinner while refusing to man up and increase the punishment for the hardcore recidivist drink drivers.  If you drink and and drive once with quite a few on board = cash and demerits. Again = cash and demerits. Again cash and and demerits.  The definition of stupidity is doing exactly the same thing and expecting the same result. Stupid fuckers are going to be stupid fuckers.   Demerits? They'll drive anyway. Thanks to under staffed police they're willing to risk it.  Fines? fuck it - throw it on my tab! Then when it grows too big, the court inevitably sentence them to a hundred hours or so community detention. Which if you work it out for some of the worst offenders, they are essentially being paid at a rate of a FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR? It's a fucking joke.     Also photos taken using a cellphone operated by sticking it into your mouth and breathing on the camera lens.   Does anyone mind Eli5 please?  Why is this a big thing?       You ass.

"Hey Johnny, what did you do at school today?"  "Oh our teacher blindfolded me and asked me to eat some cookies with a salty taste"  "Oh, that's a good boy"? ? ?   Seriously wtf.    It's around the fucking world, fucking hypocritical cunts. A few young adults in the states willingly created a video of them in a sex act, so the court charged them with creating child pornography.

We have so many different spoken, written and sign languages.   Not to mention electronic communication like typing using a physical keyboard, or a software keyboard on mobile phones.   Even then you've got dvorak, qwerty and other proprietary formats. And furthermore you've got various forms of swiping or tapping your letters.  With so many forms, is there a better version above the rest? If so why is it better?             Just fucking carefully cut your existing one to size? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVqRRLVHtfk  You fuck up, I barely bear no responsibility.   Thanks, that may have helped.......!    So SKY, Mediaworks and TVNZ (TV1, TV2, TV3, TV4 and Prime) are all pissedoff we can get..  * Faster Content.  NZ can wait *years* for Movies and TV shows etc to come to TV!  * More convenience to watch what we want. When we want.  Instead of subscribing to some shitty unreliable expensive HDD recorder, or paying money to still have advertising anyway we can download and watch them them on any TV or mobile device whenever/wherever we want!  * Easier: Again without DRM restrictions, it's a "Hey mate, here's a flash drive with the latest GoT episode".  * Cheaper: Sky increased their prices recently, the Commerce Commission investigated and basically said "Sky are a monopoly and can charge whatever they want." (I'm not kidding.)  * Access to just soooo much more content than **anyone** can offer NZ consumers.   So tell me where's the draw card for going through the piss poor selection available to NZ buyers? You've provided a poor service, years too late, and for way to much money. Then you bitch about it?  They can charge as much as they want, but unless the market things it's a fair deal it ain't going to happen.   Fuckin' Genius.   Indeed. However we're way too lenient on "shit cunt" drivers in court. So there's very little to stop the stupendous amount of recidivist "shit cunts".    They specifically touted "Zero" tolerance over the Xmas break, which failed epically.   It would good be for a police person to confirm, but I've seen most cars not get caught at 5-7km/h so I can only presume they're lowering the tolerance to only 4km/h and will be more vigilant in pulling you over/issuing a fine?   Hi /r/NewZealand,  Neighbourly.co.nz is a Fairfax run community congregation website designed to help connect neighbours communicate and keep in touch about local events and goings on.   Local area events like:  * BBQ's  * Work wanted * Local fairs * Garage sales * Community events like Street Parties Etc.  This is all dependent upon local involvement, obviously someone needs to post these events, but as it's been out for a wee while now, and thanks to advertising drives it is getting more and more popular, so while there may not be much happening in your area it's worth sticking with it.   My sister in Wellington really waxed lyrical about it so thought it was worth a go so I signed up recently and was quite surprised with the amount of people in my area using it.   Depending on your local politician and police involvement you can also receive alerts like local burgarlies and political speaking events in your area as well.  When you sign up initially you can gain immediate access by supplying a cellphone number, but you do have limited interaction until you receive a letter by post containing your verification code as to confirm your identity and your local area. This can take a wee while.   The key to driving in ~~Nelson~~ anywhere in the South Island is assuming that no one knows what the fuck they are doing at any given moment, and to drive as if everyone is poised to kill you.   Just become on of the growing many who are posting dashcam footage on Facebook. Sweet social media revenge.         Samsung phones can do it, as well as sync with calendar, and photo albums. (Facebook albums appear in gallery).        Reading the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy_murders) the whole affair is actually horribly hilarious in a cruel and twisted way.  Mark was found guilty in 2002.   Sentenced to Life, minimum non-parole of 17 years.  He then appealed and this was increased to a non-parole of 20 years.  He then appealed again, and was immediately sentenced to 20 years non-parole.  **He's been found guilty THREE TIMES**  He was eligible to get out in 2019 had he been a good prisoner. Now he can't get out 'til 2022. And I wonder if the fact he still maintains his innocence will count against him in his parole hearings?   No tax bill in NZ. :)   Came here from /r/Android and did quite a double take. Well played mods.   Edit: the signatures are a very nice touch!   Actually. Good point.    Actually I thought it quite funny?      They came, they lost and now the must suffer the humiliation for the rest of their lives. (Well, while people can still Google them.)   Sorry Cassiusz  This isn't a good look for me at the moment. I'll clean up my act!  Thanks, TehGerbil.   Oh YAaa..... Wait. lol.   Also freeze marshmallow easter eggs.   Come here, take a seat.   Indeed. NZ and Kiwi dollar are bloody neck and neck at the moment.   Well described for most things, but I was pleasantly surprised that they actually looked at the device on its own merits, rather than comparatively with the iPhone.    It can easily and quickly share photos and videos (re-encoding them to a compatible format across the OS versions) to multiple people at once. Edit: I know it's the *only* one, but for many people it's the *best* at what it does.    I couldn't find any news articles so I've had to take a screenshot: http://imgur.com/NnP0IXz  I'm in the Facebook [Beta program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/introducing-the-facebook-for-android-beta-testing-program/10151529228878920) so not sure when it roll it fully, or ever at all depending on stability feedback.      Hence why I didn't link it.. :-D it's really a non story though.. I'm sure the journalist who wrote it will get a raise..   Yes, messaging her over Facebook for goodness sake. They would have instantly made her day significantly shit.   No such thing as bad publicity eh?   Given what a significant difference lights have made on the intersection of Idris/Glandovey I'd be pretty happy about lights instead of that god forsaken roundabout.      I thought it rather ironic.       Well said.      The issue is there's precious other resources which have localised news.   There's [The Scoop](http://www.scoop.co.nz/) which is alright, but being 'dependent' doesn't mean they don't put their own spin on things.    Retail workers get very little 'normal' time off, so those precious few days are novocaine for our souls.   But when it's been 2 months, the majority of the feedback I saw last time this was brought up it was also "just let it die for goodness sake" I think they've gone too far this time.      Indeed. 2 months is a long time, clearly the poor girl thought it had blown over enough for her to reactivate her Facebook.  I reckon it's a tad cruel to potentially reignite it all by having it as a headline on The Press and Stuff.   Headline article on Stuff.co.nz is the girl 'caught' by voyeurs at the pub with her pants down with her boss (?) is leaving for the UK.   The 'journalists' have been seemingly monitoring her Facebook account, noticed she reactivated it, and attempted to message her about the whole affair.  I'm not giving them satisfaction of more clicks, the link is available on Stuff.co.nz if you so please  Horse is flogged, whipped, beaten and just needs to be left alone?   Fully understand. To be fair in this case "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all" comes to mind.   Thanks, I'll look it up.   Awesome, thanks!   When you're drunk you're the most honest I suppose. Hassling the opponents for the purpose of upsetting their psyche is definitely in the rule book.  I think the significant contrast in attitudes to sportsmanship behaviour while on the field between the 2 sides is well known and his comment just highlights this.  I think that's what's probably making this worst than it first sounds.      For instance:  * Are those fuel injectors that "clean and protect" worth it? * Is higher than 91 octane better for your car? * Is it worth cleaning/replacing your spark plugs or air filter? * Do you recommend changing the oil every X months? * Do engines really get build up if they're only ever driven about around town? (Aka: low revs/speed.)    If his comment was meant in jest it's still a fucking uncomfortable thing to say.   Indeed. As someone from my FB feed said: It speaks a lot to your character that someone acting nice around makes you so uncomfortable you feel the need to be mean back.      The simple fact is from an economic perspective we need the money that foreign oil and gas exploration brings in.   The only thing we can keep doing is keep reporting this kind of stuff and sign petitions to ensure there's minimal impact to the local flora and fauna (if onshore) and minimal disruption to our marine environment (if offshore.)   Yes I would amazing if the world could suddenly perform an about turn and stop using oil etc, but the simple fact is that isn't going to happen for a few years.   In the meantime we need to be smart about how we whore out our natural resources.   This is the *E* series though, but yes, their designers ought to be fired.   Jesus. 3 minutes of pure fear for the passengers.         Are*. Sorry for potato grammar.   Are*. Sorry for potato grammar.   As you're all aware, Easter Friday and Sunday this weekend (4 day weekend, hell yeah!) but it means most super markets etc are shut on Friday 3rd April, and Sunday 5th April.   This usually means horrendous queues on Thursday, Saturday, and Monday, so if you want to avoid the queues (if you can) just  a heads up to get long range shopping done earlier in the week. :)   In before Nick gets punched in the face by someone who's thoroughly over it.

 Herbal Salvation, you would have to order in bulk to get that price though.   lol. Yes. 20 dollars for 25 grams is too much. I think I pay 5 dollars for 25 grams.   Just looking at it makes me feel like you spent a lot of money for it. At least it's good quality though.   That's interesting. I was gonna say to mix a green with a red and up the dose to around six grams but if you tried one from each for a total of six grams, Idk what good it would do to try my idea.   Are you taking different strains or just mostly one? Are you mixing your strains in your doses at all?   Ohhhhhhh. No chance of that. Not after only a few days.   Yeah just add more to it, although I can't imagine there would be enough stuck on the inside of the bottle to actually do anything. I mean, even a gram stuck on the inside of a bottle would look like a shit load.   Yeah I thought about mentioning that but decided to only mention the ones I've actually done myself. Smoking oxy seems like it would be such a waste compared to shooting it. lol   I would think that extract would be the only way to go, if one was to attempt it.   I would like some free kratom please.   Black tar heroin. Opium. Fentanyl gel.    Ha. Some people just aren't built for toss and wash. Not necessarily an allergy.   NEVER MIND. NOW I'M NOT GONNA GET ANY.   OH MAN I'M GONNA GET SOME NOW   Oh really? Sometimes I think about trying it, but I have an extremely addictive personality and the last thing I need is another habit... especially something that could possibly cause withdrawal like that.   Fucking alarm clocks, how do they work?   The only thing I know about phenibut is you're not supposed to take it every day cuz the withdrawal will have you fucked up after like two or three days of consecutive use.   That's a true statement.   Oh.. and some say it suppresses appetite. I demolish shit after I dose, though.   Some people say it's good to have a little something in your stomach. I am not one of those people. The emptier the better, as far as my body is concerned. Don't ever take it when you're full though. It'll be wasted.   Yeah. I throw it under my tongue and then swig water, mix it around in my mouth so it's not stuck to anything, then kick my head back like a dog and swallow. Always had a bad time trying to put it on my tongue. It's the most efficient method concerning preparation time, effort, effects, and onset time. Some people just can't do it though.   Real men have to shoot their load all over themselves when they toilet jerk cuz their wieners are too long to aim down into the toilet.   Well. You could try lowering your dose little by little and see if those effects go away. You could also try switching strains, or your vendor. I take 5-6 grams three times a day and have never had any problems like that. Everybody's different though. Strain/vendor switch would probably be worth a try if you haven't already.   It's not an extract, just leaf. Take 2-3 grams to start off, just to be safe. Real men toss and wash.   If you're opioid tolerant, which you are, 3 grams of kratom isn't shit. If you were deeper into withdrawal when you took it, you would probably notice it more. I personally would try 5-6 grams on an empty stomach. That's me though. You may still not feel much, unless you give it a few weeks and lose your tolerance.   Mmm. Pita bread.   A fat naked lady shows up and poops on an old man's chest.   I'm not sure that classifies as boiling water.   Yeah man I tried it again yesterday. Trash. I'm done fuckin with it. I'm sure other people love it but RVS and RVT all day long for me baby.   I'M FREAKIN OUT   Can you elaborate    Huh?   Try doing them with a dildo jammed up your asshole.   Incognitooooo   Donna and the cocktasters.   Wut.   Hopefully I enjoy it someday, but as of now, I don't even want to try it again. Lol. How much RVS do you normally take? And how much Maha Kali? The same amount?   Sure. Send me some money so I can buy some, you stupid asshole.   Fuck man. I heard that too. Try mixing them tomorrow instead of today.    Good, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who notices it. Yes, my Bali and RVT are both from HS. Try the 2:1 RVT to Bali ratio, if you have some on hand. It's something special.   "i was talking about grammer". I know bro, I was talking about grammar too. Did you mean to say "wasn't" instead of "was"? You somehow just made yourself into a great example, supporting my earlier reference to your grammar. Speaking of English classes, you should go see if a professor will pay you to be a case study. A lot can be learned by attempting to read the trainwreck nonsense you type up. I NEVER point out people's grammatical errors. I'm far from a grammar nazi. I just couldn't help pointing out your ironic statement. TL;DR You're lucky I don't know you personally or I'd come FISTFUCK YOU IN THE COCKSUCKER.   Ok well I've taken single strains by themselves only about 102746 times, and it never gets me to where I want to be no matter what. Mixing Green Bali with reds is what does it for me. I wouldn't even be taking kratom if I wasn't mixing them the way I do because it wouldn't have the effect I'm looking for. I wasn't asking why I'm not satisfied, I'm asking if anybody else notices the same thing when they first try a new strain. The same thing happened to me with RVS, RVB, RVT, and RV Hulu Kapuas... I took them twice to begin with and didn't feel much, and then after that they started working great. Also, I don't mean to be a dick either, but I find it strange you think I sound like a kid when I'm the one who uses correct grammar, and you can't even be bothered to spell out the word "you". Either way, thanks for the advice.   Alright alright alright. So I usually take 5-6 grams of Red Vein Sumatran/Green Bali mixed at a 2:1 ratio, respectively. I do this before work in the morning, and then after work in the late afternoon. Then at about 8 I dose one more time, except I substitute Red Vein Thai for the RVS. I do that just for kicks, mostly. Well, the time came to order some more Green Bali, and I decided to cop a 25 gram sack of that Maha Kali everybody keeps going on and on about. Well, the shit came today. I just got home and jammed 6ish grams down my cocksucker, same mixture ratio as usual but using Maha Kali in place of the RVS. A half hour or so has past, and by now, I would usually be feeling great. But at this point I'm actually regretting not taking my usual RVS. I definitely always feel better than this by now. However... I've noticed in the past that the first one or two times I take a new strain, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I'm hoping that's the situation here. Does anybody else notice that happening to them?   I'm not your pops. Him and I are Eskimo brothers, though.   You've got your work cut out for you, son.   Thanks for contributing to this conversation. Leave it to shmooly the fuckfaced asshole to point out things we already know.   That's the only place I can find any word of it. Have you found it anywhere else? It's kind of strange that they're telling you to stock up while you can lol, considering they sell it.    I appreciate your humor.   That brother Phalze thought Miami was so nice, he had to live there twice.   I had the exact same reaction a couple times. The first was the only time I ever tried a white vein, and the second was the last time I took Maeng Da. I only took a half gram of it.    Upstate NY   Wayward apostrophes gave my mom the shingles.    You say settle down, but your username unsettles my scrotum pretty severely.   Idk what strain viva Zen is but I'm pretty sure everybody here is just going to tell you to buy some plain leaf strains and cap your own. You'll save like one million dollars a day.   Yeah. My sweet spot is six grams but everybody's different, would be a shame to start at four and end up taking more everyday than he needs to.   Start at 2.   Ha. I play guitar. I was bluffing again though. I'm not gonna write a song about this. I have a bluffing problem.   I'm gonna write a song about this someday.   A toilet jerk?   That's a pretty good idea. I was bluffing about a toiler jerk at work though. At work means on the kratom. On the kratom means no toilet jerks. My right arm isn't toned enough to deal with a kratom jack toilet jerk.   Imgur 4 life   I just assume USPS is going to be late when I'm putting an order in. I do it like 2-3 weeks ahead of time. I'd much rather do that than pay those FedEx or UPS fuckfaces to do it.   "Exploded when it hit my throat" Thanks for giving me an at-work boner. Might have to go for a toilet jerk.   I..... I love it   lol. I love using my smartphone on the toilet. I dunno about you, but my pisser works funny on kratom. It's sort of stop and go sometimes, and I love using my smartphone on the toilet so much, that I always piss sitting down too. I end up spending like 10 minutes on the toilet every time I piss, and my bitch always ends up yellin at me. She thinks I jerk it in there. Sometimes I do jerk it, though, if it's been long enough since my last dose. Toilet jerks are one of life's greatest simple pleasures.   I spend most of my free time trying to shit.  	66

 It is not   The author won a Hugo award, but keep on rockin dude               That person was me. The book you hated was a popcorn horror novel. It wasn't trying to be Pynchon or Delillo. You are also greatly exaggerating how bad the book was.  The book also received a Kirkus starred review,  which is fairly hard to achieve ( https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/josh-malerman/bird-box-malerman/), so maybe the one with bad taste is you?    Nope   I thought it was pretty enjoyable. To each their own            I don't understand the hype for this book at all.

It has not gotten the hype that it deserves, in comparison to most of the other books listed.      Draft is still too fast for my liking, but with the consistent mechanic, overload, powerful underdops like shardbound invoker, and scaled spells like Howl, it's probably never going back to a slower meta like it once was before. To be fair, these were all implemented to stop level screw from having such a huge impact, which I think they have successfully done.

Even Magic: The Gathering, with its 20 years of experience, ends up having to ban cards every set (most recently Jeskai Ascendency, Dig Through Time, Treasure Cruise)  I don't play anymore, but I don't think these are actually banned yet? Could be wrong   I would like to see SBE post top lifetime win ratios, rather than just weekly wins/win ratios for a change   Because he was being a douche   You do not need to explain it to me like I'm a child - I understand the changes.  With the new changes, they removed a primary motivator for many people to pay this game - going infinite. They already added casual draft, does this game need to cater to casual players 100 percent of the time? Nobody would be complaining if they left the competitive tournament queue payouts the same with all of the other positive changes.    Why reward the players that are actually good? Let's just coddle the whiny babies instead   The changes look good, except for one thing, unless I'm mistaken - with the restructuring of tournament prizes, there is no way to go infinite anymore?  Edit: never mind, noticed they pay out silver instead of tickets. Not sure if I'm a fan? Seems harder to go infinite, but maybe the elite tournament makes up for it.   What time does the game unlock?   What a totally asinine, biased, and uninformed view about M:TG. As a former player who has played the game for about 15 years, about half of which competitively, here's where you're off base.   Magic players have no problem spending $200~ on a deck that will only see around 4 months of play (due to newer sets coming out, making your older cards no longer legal). This, to me, is insane. You can, of course, make a deck much cheaper. With that said, it is unlikely you will find any success unless you use more expensive, rarer cards.  Sort of true, but very, very, misleading. Yes, top tier standard decks cost upward of 200 dollars, but it's not like players are just dropping 200 bucks every four months, the way you make it seem. Magic is an investment over time. Each set stays in Standard for two years. Due to different popular formats (modern, legacy) and casual formats (commander), the chase rares of a set will hold a good portion of their value once they rotate out of standard. Trading/Lending is also a huge part of Magic culture. It can be expensive to start from go from nothing to having a top tier deck, but this is not the path 95% of players take.  The most expensive formats are the ones that use nearly all the cards. Needless to say, decks can cost $1,000s. Here is a link to a popular card in these types of decks. Do you see the price? That's a legitimate $200 for one card. Decks that play this creature want to run the maximum 4 copies. That means, if you want to use this card in your deck, you're likely spending $800 to do so. That's just 4 cards out of your 60 card deck. It's insane.  Again, wrong. The players that play these formats are experienced ones who have built their collection over time, have at least a couple years of experience, and have either opened these cards years ago, traded for them, borrowed etc. These formats are not run nearly as often as standard, so when they take place at a large scale, cards are heavily borrowed within the community, which is pretty tightly knit. No one just drops a thousand dollars on a deck like it's nothing.  As a final note, many players ignore the cost of their decks by claiming that the value in their cards is not lost. Tarmogoyf, as shown before, is a $200 card. When you play with it, it's still $200, and you'll be able to use its value to potentially sell for your money back when your "done" or trade it away for more cards. It is painfully clear that you will never get your money back on any of these cards. Only the historic rares, like the Black Lotus, ever exchange hands for meaningful money. Players will only ever offer you more cards, and stores will undercut you severely. Your money is lost forever within every card you purchase.  Wrong again! Here's a link to an completed ebay listings of Tarmogoyfs - http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40 _sacat=0 _nkw=tarmogoyf LH_Complete=1 rt=nc As you can see, they're mostly selling for $150 each. Like anything else, you will not get 100% of listed value, but to say that you will never sell them? Wrong wrong wrong.  If everyone in the world decided that Magic: The Gathering was an amazing game, and we all wanted to play it, we couldn't. This is because there are not enough copies of the cards for all of us. Tarmogoyf isn't just expensive because he's a popular card. He's also expensive because there aren't enough copies of him for everyone. Proxies are illegal in all sanctioned tournaments, which means that most MTG fans will never get to play in formats where Tarmogoyf is legal.  That's why Standard and limited exist - the cards are readily available. It's hard to find smaller weekly tournaments that *aren't* standard or limited, so to the regular player, this shouldn't affect him at all.  I don't know what it is about card game communities, but it seems to attract some of the oddest. Are the people pictured "good people?" Maybe, but most won't want the association. Other geek hobbies seem to have grown mainstream. Comic-Con is filled with beautiful people in costumes. Call of Duty is something the average-Joe plays on weekends with his buds. Magic: The Gathering, and other card games, have "Crack Gate". In my year of playing MTG, the majority of **the people I met were either children, college-drop-outs, drug addicts, mentally-unstable, or any combination of the former**. In the same way Sonic attracts a "strange" crowd, card games do as well. There's a lot of fun you can have playing these games, and merit in interacting with these people, but I cannot blame anyone who would refuse to do so. Of course, people of all walks of life play these games, just as all sorts of people do anything. I mean no disrespect to any particular person or people.  Really dude, could you be more insulting and condescending? You're posting on a forum about video games, you really feel like you're above these people? You really think cosplayers and people that go to cons are totally free of weird people? Yeah, there are different people that play Magic, but there are weird people that do everything, especially of the nerd persuasion. There are obviously bad seeds, but most of the people you meet are genuinely nice people and wouldn't bat an eye to help out a new player.   I choose winning and taking the legendary...   I always pick legendaries no matter what. It's still a fourth of a legendary you actually want, even if you already own three and the card is horrible in draft.    It's possible to win with other faction combinations, but in my opinion, nothing is close to the power of U/N.  So, unless there's a legendary there, no.   factotum by bukowski         r/writing is   Hi, I just checked out this game last night, but have lots of tcg experience (mtg for 15+ years, most competitive, solforge, hearthstone, etc. ..).  I am looking to play this game without spending money. Is it viable? In other online ccgs, it is possible to build nearly everything you need over time, while playing limited to build your collection. Can i do that here? Are there daily rewards? Can i join tournaments and buy legendaries without platinum, which seems like a bought currency?   Would definitely appreciate advice from other F2Pers, or just be told that this is not the game for me. Thanks!   Not something a new player should expect though,  regardless of tcg background   You can't grind out a collection in this game. It's either pay, or amass one for free over time.  There are daily rewards for login, 1 online win, 1 win, and 3 wins. Every win will also net you 100 silver, which is not nearly enough to be worth grinding.   It took place around week 3 though, not at the deadline.   Yeah, killing hundreds of people is equivalent to sleight of hand tricks, totally the same situation   Fuck them, they deserve what they get   The problem is Stoneblade's to fix. It is not an unsolvable problem. Other games either circumvent this toxic behavior through timers, or punish repeat offenders by banning them from the game.  It's pretty clear Stoneblade has no intention of dealing with this behavior, so expect plenty of 15+ minute waits in between games in the draft queue.   lol give me a break   Ahahahahahaha   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Allison+Allen-Grey   related to books how   The pictures show the book the short story is contained in - usually a collection.                     Popular YA lit isn't representative of all current writing. If you like Vonnegut, try *Tigerman* by Nick Harkaway. Orwell, try *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball. Bukowski? try *Person* by Sam Pink, or *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria. Try reading Denis Johnson, Atwood, Tartt, DeLilo, Adichie, Murakami, DFW.  Stay open minded. You won't like everything you read, but if you aren't afraid to try something new, you aren't going to branch out and will miss out on a ton of great reading.    What have you read that is current?   This is a colossally stupid point of view. You didn't like the Hunger Games so you're going to write off every book in the past twenty years? Keep on truckin!    Check out Jesse Ball, great author that fits the bill of what you're looking for. Any of his four novels are worth reading.   Probably should get on watching some Lynch as well      technically not strictly better since they are in different factions      new player here, feel like I understand most of the game so far, but not sure on how preseason works.  Is there a point to loading up my roster with 80 guys, and keeping my sure starters off of the preseason depth chart?   I understand that rankings only change at the end of the season on paper, but fluctuate throughout the season under the hood. Do the player rankings for young rookies/guys trying to make the team vary wildly enough that I should be heavily evaluating preseason play?  Or is the point just to keep starters from getting injured?  Thanks!   I survived Carlos Hyde's three consecutive fourth quarter goal line carries (including a fourth and one) to preserve my five point lead going into MNF.   Hi Shane, I've just recently read Light Boxes and have Crystal Eaters in my to-read stack on my nightstand, great stuff.  What are the authors/works that have influenced your writing the most? Conversely, what are some non-literary (tv, film, life in general) influences?  What's next after Crystal Eaters?      Sam pink   because this sub sucks   Then yes, you should certainly complain   Stupid rule but you should have complained about it before you drafted   Thanks for the informative post   Haven't read it, but I do like the author quite a bit.    I'm aware. I've been playing the deck since crafting for killion opened, and it's just not very good. It has a lot of bad draws, especially if you are playing first. Many games you just get smashed in PL1 and your leveling is worthless because you lost the game before making it to PL2. The deck also loses to random trash like sporelord.  The deck is capable of coming in second, sure, but it is not tier 1. That's results oriented thinking. There is a reason is showing up less and less.    AT scorchmane is fun but it stinks. I played it for a bit until I was tired of losing and switched back to BQ/Doomriding, the deck is just too good   I'm about three quarters through *The Goldfinch* by Donna Tartt. Very good so far      Scott McClanahan  Sam Pink    I think Seal is fine. It's powerful but not insane like it was before. Personally, I think constructed needs more balancing than draft does.   I think you made the right choice.               I have an eReader and an open mind - If the book comes recommended or sounds interesting, I will read it.    What are the three best books you've read over the past 6 months? What would you recommend as the best place to start for someone new to your work?   I would suggest just getting a quick reference guide type book. We used Baby 411 and it was really handy. I wouldn't recommend comprehensively reading any book, especially the "So you're going to be a dad" type books, they're just pandering bullshit really.   Uterra is still the best by a lot. Alloyin seems like it's the worst, and my preferences are generally U/N - U/T - U/A - T/N - A/T.   I'm sure plenty of people love A/T, but it just doesn't work for me. The citadel wall deck is good if you get the cards, but if you whiff on citadels or the 7/2 guy, your deck just sucks and you end up 1-3. Alloyin doesn't have many great tricks like it used to with matrix warden, and even strategist feels unimpressive compared to cards in other factions.  Lysian Shard, batterhide, the new 3/6 consistent guy, and dysian siphon are all obviously nuts and gamebreakers. Seal is still great and usually a first pick but it isn't the play it at all costs card it used to be.   Highly prioritize nearly any good consistent card, any of the good one shot cards (siphon, hound, burnout), and the rank 2 cycle.   Since when is not conceding bad form?   "Just concede" is the definition of an obvious non-solution. People say it so often here in regard to anything, and it's something you simply wouldn't do in a tourney queue. Nobody cares about regular queue games   That's not an option, as they could easily fuck up or fizzle the combo. Some of us don't want to waste 10 minutes finding out.   You realize multiple people, including Beta Ray Bill, Storm, and Captain America, have wielded Mjolnir, right?   Why? People didn't have any problem with Thor being an alien. But a woman? God forbid.   It is, but it's more so for jodorowsky fans than fans of Dune. He takes quite a few liberties with the plot   They don't take ratings into effect though. It will still recommend books based off the one you gave one star.    Stop wasting time on reddit and read a book?    Good series. Annihilation is going to go down as a cult classic, great book. Authority/acceptance were good, but not near the quality of the first. I think if you wanted to, you could just read annihilation as a stand alone, but I am glad i finished the series.   Recommending *The Third Bear*, a short story collection that is Vandermeer's best work in my opinion.   brookline booksmith   What a great topic -  a bunch of people saying they are the same, the lone dissenter downvoted to the bottom - never seen that in this sub before   Drop him   That seems fine. Lose two shaky rb plays for one shaky rb play, and upgrade qb and get a solid backup te. Pretty fair but it benefits you in my opinion.    do not do this trade unless you're also getting bernard or marshall for somebody like hill or hilton. Even if you don't like peyton this year, he is a name that people will give you much more value for than just philip rivers.   I doubt he would bite on marshawn for gio and lacy but it never hurts to try. As far as the initial trade goes, it's definitely possible he bites on it, and I like it. Even for a guy I don't even really like, Lacy is a great buy low  	132
 I love 3D in films and games.  I love VR.  I have a PS4.  Guess what I'm looking forward to.   I've literally never hear anyone say meninism before. This is new to me.    As seen on the front page yesterday.   The PS4's controller last for 4hrs on one charge.  Sounds like your controller was broken mate. I can usually get pretty much a full day of gaming done on one charge, and I don't dim the light bar at all. I guess the amount of vibrating the controller does plays a big part, but since I play GTA Online and Mortal Kombat X the most these days I'd say my controller vibrates a lot.  Edit: Downvoted for...... I got nothing.   The trouble with Jason Statham is this. He plays the exact same character in every film he's in. "The guy that beats up everyone." Don't get me wrong, he's very good at it, but every new film I see him in I just think "Oh, he's doing what he does in every film, nothing new."  But that's just me.   I've always preferred racing cleanly. But when I know I'm up against a dirty driver I'll go ham on their ass. I'm pretty good at racing in GTA and I have this mantra:  There's a difference between a dirty driver, and a good driver who's driving dirty. Got any racing crews I should look up? I've been away from GTA for a while because 18 months of playing it daily burned me out, plus my old crew members all stopped playing, this seems like a good reason to get back into the game I love.    Also If you accidently hit someone off, you have to wait and let them pass you  If I find myself racing someone that seems to be a clean driver I'll try to avoid hitting them. If I do hit them I always slow down for them as a sign that I didn't do it on purpose. Maybe I should look into joining a race crew, never considered that being a thing. I much prefer the racing to things like TDM Capture anyway.   I'm sure you can. But it's hard to kill someone when they've got their sight aimed at the only entrance/exit to the place.   Yeah true, I could have worded it better. But I was fresh out of a conversation with one of those pricks and my anger carried over. I think the name is applicable though. Anyone who considers themselves to be a better human being than someone else simply because of the piece of metal and plastic they use to play video games on, is a retard. They claim "It's satire" and "It's a joke!". Well, it's not a joke to the people they insult and try to make feel like shit.   Exactly. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying that without us "useless peasants" a lot of the games PC gamers love wouldn't even exist, or at least would exist in a worse capacity due to budgetary constraints.    And its not steams choice to put the game on sale its the developers themeselves  Yeah, because it's the best way they can get people to buy their games on steam since games on steam are so cheap they can't possibly charge full price for it. The market is willing to part with less cash per game than the console market. I guess that's the crux of my argument.   Having a game slightly held back graphically is better than having a game majorly held back by a lack of budget, or even having no game at all.    AC Unity (a flop in many ways) and Far Cry 4 haven't been more than 40% off (35.99) on Steam, for example.  Maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but I'm willing to bet that's still cheaper than they've ever been on consoles when bought brand new.  I once saw a collection of 5 GTA games for something like 30. That blew my mind. I've been told many times that PC games are so cheap on steam they actually offset the massive cost of the hardware, the the point of PC gaming actually being the cheaper option in the long run. That's some cheap games right there.   If you don't mind paying 45 quid for console versions, you shouldn't mind paying the same or more for better PC versions.  I disagree. I'm ok with paying 55 (current average price of a new game) on console because I don't have an alternative. If I switched to PC gaming I'd definitely take advantage of the low low prices PC gamers enjoy.  The sales on PSN and XBOX Live pale in comparison to the sales on steam. I don't recall ever hearing a console gamer saying "I have 200 games in my backlog", but it's a relatively common PC gamer quote.  I'm not saying that consoles don't do anything that could potentially harm profit of games such as sales, but that we're constantly being told how much cheaper games are on PC. I'm routinely told that games are so cheap on PC that it offsets the massive cost of the hardware and actually turns out to be the cheaper gaming option in the long run, the game are that much cheaper.  As for used games, I feel this argument is negated by the PC pirating argument. They cancel each other out.    Not really. It's more a case of "We need more money to make better games. And consoles give us the most money. So if we didn't develop for consoles The Witcher 3 would be a shell of what it currently is because the budget would have been much smaller."   Available to the common man in 2030.   Fine... I'll say it if no-one else will.  Ahem.  Dat ass tho.   "This way, if one of us falls, we all fall! Yay!"    If you buy games at release, you would continue to buy games at release  I bet some people would change their buying habits, it's impossible to say. On console we don't have ability to wait 4 months for the price to drop 85% like PC gamers do.    like Starcraft II, with 6 million units sold, which compares well against Gears of War 3's 6.3 million).  I'm willing to bet that Starcraft II had the benefit of being in steam sales, which are known to knock up to 95% of a game's price off. Compare that to Gears of War 3 where the vast majority of copies sold likely went for full retail price or close to it. While the number of units sold is comparable, the price of each unit sold could possibly vary wildly between the two games.  I'm just speculating here but I bet the 6 million copies of GoW3 made way more money (not including dlc or microtransactions) than starcraft II did. Of course I could be totally wrong. There's a lot of assumptions being made here. I guess the point is, games are way cheaper on PC, and therefore don't make as much money, and therefore don't allow devs to get a bigger budget for the next game as much as console sales do.   lack of fees to physical copies  I'm not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying they save money because they don't have to put the game on a disc?  More sells in general  There may be more sales on PC but the games are selling for way less than people pay on consoles with all the constant steam sales going on.  Five GTA games for 20? Yeah, console gamers have to pay a little bit more than that.    Ezio or another assassin would work too, I suppose  Just like Spawn, it's been done before. We don't need another fighting game with him in.     Rain is probably not coming due to him being DLC last time (and them saying previously they don't want to charge for the same character twice in a row)  Boon says a lot of stuff that turns out to be just lies though. I take what he says with a pinch of salt these days.  That said, he's tweeted multiple times "The Rain falls when he may". So, guessin gis all we can do I guess.    I'd love seeing the most hated return if not just to annoy a lot of the fans.  You just admitted you'd be perfectly fine with the only reason to include those characters is to piss off other people who love the game you love.  So you're an asshole?   Can anyone name any guest characters in fighting games that have been in more than one franchise? Obviouslly not including Smash Bros.  Spawn was in the Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2, not sure if he'd make an appearance in MKX.   All I want is Noob. But isn't it too obvious it's going to be Rain, Sindel, Smoke, and Baraka?    They recode/port games to consoles  What about all the games that are ported to PC? It's it 50/50? aren't there just as many ports either way? Also PC games are usually only 5 or 10 cheaper than the console version. Steam sales make games as little 10% of the price of an average console version. PC gamers give developers less money than console gamers, I mean a lot less.   Let's say 100 million console gamers just made the switch to PC gaming overnight. The sales numbers wouldn't be comparable because of the aforementioned cheapness of games in general on PC. Profits would go down and therefore budgets would go down, and games would likely get worse.   The PC sales would rise but the prices of games on steam are so low that even with the increased PC player base the profit margins wouldn't be anywhere near where they are now with console gamers paying on average something like 45 for a game, and PC gamers pay what, an average of 15 per game? Also humble bundles, all those free games have to be paid for on console.   You're right, it doesn't mean I should. but it also doesn't mean it shouldn't. I'm sorry if I offended you.   This is an excerpt from an interview with Marcin Iwinski from CD Projekt Red.  "If the consoles are not involved there is no Witcher 3 as it is," answers Marcin Iwinski, definitively. "We can lay it out that simply. We just cannot afford it, because consoles allow us to go higher in terms of the possible or achievable sales; have a higher budget for the game, and invest it all into developing this huge, gigantic world.  Finally. Listen up PC Master Retards. I know PC gaming is king, anyone who disagrees is an idiot. But the next time you give us console gamers shit because our systems are "Holding back gaming" and "Necessitating the dumbing down of our precious games" Just remember that a fucking huge chunk of the money given to developers from the sale of their games comes from us console gamers. Those precious steam sales you always brag about, the cheapness of the games you're always boasting about, they're not doing the devs any favours.  So the next time you bitch about console gamers ruining your games, just know that without us you wouldn't have half of them at all.  Now let's all get along for fuck's sake.

I found them yesterday when someone posted this and called it "Find Link!"   The multiplayer in RDR had some great ideas, but god damn was it one of the most broken online experiences I've ever had. Sometimes it would be cool, you'd posse up and do gang hideouts. Never really got into the competitive stuff because of the aforementioned brokenness.  And by brokenness, I mean invisible people on bulls that slide along the ground, missing any kind of animation, and being killed by mystery people constantly.  I would rate the single player of RDR a perfect 10/10, and I don't bandy 10/10 very much. But I would give the multiplayer a 3/10 because of how broken it was for me. It would be 1/10 but they had some really cool ideas hidden in there.   So you'd gang up on people who caused carnage but when people come after you for the same reason you run away and hide in a spot that makes you impossible to kill?  So brave, lol.   I can't agree more. I used to always honk my horn as a sign of friendliness, trying to meet people, do missions with them.  But after a while of having people kill you for no reason you really start to lose the will to be friendly. These days I will immediately murder anyone who gets what I deem to be too close. I won't think twice about blowing their car up. I use to worry about paying for their car, now I see it as a minor inconvenience.  About a year ago I became the thing I hated most when playing GTA Online, and I make no apologies. The small amount of bastards in the game have slowly turned everyone else into a bastard.   Yeah, I know what swatting is lol. I was being an arsehole.    I'm one of these people who doesn't read every article on the Internet  I'm also one of those people. But news is everywhere these days. I'm surprised you didn't hear of it.   Thanks for the heads up but... what can we do with this information? I mean, that situation isn't all that common. I guess we just keep playing.   This is old news. I don't see how anyone living in the UK didn't know this last week when it was all over the news.  What pissed me off the most was that people were complaining that it's sexist. Saying it portrays women in a negative light. While it does portray women in a negative light no-one was talking about the fact that they has almost identical ads with men on them. But because they were portraying men in a negative light it's not seen as sexist.  Fucking double standards.   swated?   And then she said , "That is NOT two children wearing a trenchcoat!"   I found Sub-Zero and Marge Simpson.  That'll do.   I would only ever use it if I has permission first, which is fucked up when you think about it.  It's considered racist for a non-black  person to say a word, which is itself pretty racist.  Anyway, yeah, I'd never use it as an insult in any way. I once knew a pair of black twins and we became good friends (this was a few years back). They used to say nigga a lot, so I asked them if it were cool if used it when talking to them. I made it clear that it would only ever be used as a sign of friendship and not as a derogatory term.  They were totally fine with it. They were a couple of cool dudes. I wonder where they are now.   If the Raiden challenge doesn't get released with the new update I'm giving up all hope of it ever coming out.  "Coming Soon" my fucking arse.   It's the premiere of the film Michael produced, or co-produced, I forget.   That's brilliant. At first I thought, ok, I see where this is headed. But the various cut scenes they put him in were great choices. I just want to see Lester dancing like this in the background of every shot the next time I play through the story.   Reddit presents -  How Nightmares Are Born  or  The Arrival of Nope   No faction wars for 2 days now and STILL NO RAIDEN CHALLENGE. I'm running out of reasons to keep playing this instead of going back to Injustice. It's like they want people to stop playing.   This is what I do on both Pokemon and Injustice. People say X is the best character in terms of dps and health, Y is the best character to team with X because reasons.  I literally only use characters I simply feel like using. All my teams are personal to me as a result.   Yes, exactly. And when we don't know if something is true the default position of a rational mind is to not believe it's true until we DO know.  I'm not saying ghosts don't exist. I'm saying that there is no good reason right now to believe the claim that they exist, and so I don't believe it. I could be wrong, but I think it's foolish to believe a claim without a good reason.    It's like Netherrealm went out of their way to make a lot of the costumes in this game fucking hideous.    Fair enough I suppose. It just seems like all the combo videos I see online do the same thing. They show a character doing a combo but done even attempt to try to teach you anything. I guess some of that hostility carried over to this video to. I apologise, you didn't deserve my shitty comment.    My favourite part was when the video explained ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.    You can duck it. But then they do it again and again without giving you time to stand up, walk, and duck again. Yeah you can slide under it but you need literally perfect timing to avoid every bullet.    As a Sub Zero mainer I can confirm that his slide is very punishable.  Anyone know how to counter full auto jacqui's machine gun as sub zero? Tired of being beaten by people spamming that OP move.    This. You can't buy something not knowing what it included (even though it's been publicly available for months) then complain it didn't include something they didn't list.    Good job I think the Russian costumes are hideous.    http://i.imgur.com/PLTZJRh.jpg   Hahahahhaha! It's funny because he's dumb! HAHHAA!   I'm already bored of the single player. I played the story. Dabbled with the towers. But ever since I started gaming online I've found fighting the CPU in fighting games to be really boring and unsaisfying, which is a shame given the amount of single player content on offer here.  If only they gave us a good reward for beating the towers, I might bother with them more often. The complete 50 living towers trophy is gonna kill me.   It's been down for me since last night. I noticed it was down 16 hours ago, and it's still down.   Further proof that troll no longer means "monster that dwell sunder bridges trying to eat children" but now means "Cunt who finds pleasure in pissing people off."   The comment may have not seemed dumb to me at the time. But upon reflection I can see I was making several assumptions to lead me to the point I felt warranted posting. I was dumb to make a comment based on said  assumptions and therefore I consider the comment to be dumb, or at the very least not very well thought out.  I don't mind being proven wrong though, it means I've learned something new. I now know more truths than I did when I posted that comment, and that's a good thing in my book.    Then please disregard my previous comments. They were dumb and unnecessary.    Copied from just a couple of days ago. Impressive.   I feel bad that I eat meat. I mean, I can't justify it. It's immoral.  But fuck 'em, because bacon and steak.   I'd 100% the story, then spend all my time doing missions in GTA Online.   As much as I'd like some story DLC I'm glad to see they're not done with GTA Online. I need a reason to go back there since everyone I played with has left and there's not really much else left that I want to buy. I've got 2 mil sat in the bank, just waiting for something spend it on. Over 42 days spent in GTA Online, I've done pretty much everything there is to do in Los Santos many times each, it'll be nice to have a reason to go back there.  Unless the content they're talking about is just more jobs, most of which I'll never play (capture etc etc). Fewer jobs and more missions would be nice. And I mean missions, not just:  1. Go here. 2. Grab this. 3. Take is here.  That's 99% of the missions in GTA Online unfortunately.   Or, y'know. Yawning.    But hundreds of thousands of experiences, if not more, can't ALL be attributed to mental illness or mistake  Yes they can. Of course they can. Why do you think they can't all be explained by natural means? That's like saying 2 billion people can't be wrong. Yes they can! you just made the appeal to popularity logical fallacy.  The number of people believing something has absolutely no bearing on whether or not it's true.    some of those somethings have been captured on photographs and video  And yet not a single one has been confirmed. Not a single account of anything supernatural in the history of mankind has ever been confirmed as being true. That's why the default position on supernatural occurrences is to not believe it until it's been demonstrated to be true, which is why I don't believe, because every single claim of the supernatural has failed to meet it's burden of proof.    It would be better to assume it exists and try to quantify it, than to assume it doesn't and ignore it  But people aren't ignoring it. People are doing real scientific tests (and have been forever) to see if such things exist. People will always test for those things. BUT UNTIL THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THEY EXIST THE DEFAULT POSITION IS TO NOT BELIEVE A CLAIM. Sorry for shouting but that's the most important part. There is no good reason (word of mouth is not a good reason) to believe ghosts exist. People are looking for them, they will continue to look, but they've found nothing.  If ghosts were even half confirmed it would be the biggest news in the history of mankind. Make no mistake, people are looking, but they've found nothing so far.   You are 100%. There is always the possibility of a method being developed, but until such a thing exists there's no way to verify paranormal claims and therefore no good reason the believe any of them are real things i.e. ghosts.   It's all good then.   Lol. I had no friends with the game, but I met some people online in Paradise City and had a blast trying to complete as many of the 500+ online challenges together and against each other. Fuck. I need to play that game again.                               Seriously. the game has been out for what, two months at this point? And pretty much since launch they've told us the challenge is "coming soon". Stretching the definition of the word soon IMO.  They also lose points for spelling koming with a c.         I want to know if I'm in the top 2000 players (ranked 1v1) in the world, or just on the PS4 k thx bye.         How are your wins/losses presented to other players? If I'm playing ranked 1v1 and I see my opponent's wins/losses, is that their total online wins/losses or just their wins/losses for ranked 1v1? Same goes for other game modes like KOTH.                           I've been doing the souls exploit to be able to have multiple attempts at the test your luck and daily objectives. I notice there's a reward rank for the test your luck and it goes up each day, unless I do the souls exploit, then it resets. My question is this. Is it worth letting the reward rank rack up? I remember a similar thing on Injustice Mobile but the rewards were a joke, even after hundreds of consecutive days. Should I hold out for great rewards or just say fuck it and keep cheating?                  The red spear symbol under the koins earned in the post fight menu, does that represent ranking XP?   Who are you using?  **Bronze:**  Lin Quei, Shirai Ryu, Monk    **Silver:**  Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Farmer Jax  Kano, D'Vorah, Reptile  Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Kenshi   **Gold:**  Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion  Stunt Double Johnny Cage, Sun God Kotal Kahn, Possessed Kenshi  Assassin Kitana (lucky pull!), Bojutsu Kung Jin, [waiting for Raiden]  All the gold cards were attained from gold kombat packs.   It seems Netherrealm are trying to stretch the definition of the terms "temporarily down" and "coming soon".  I know some people are able to play the Faction Wars. Congrats Netherrealm, you almost managed to get an online portion of a game working. Does anyone know how "soon" the Raiden challenge coming? I plan on adding him to Assassin Kitana and Bojustsu Kung Jin but if it's going to be months before the challenge arrives I might as well buy more gold packs.   I had the hatch I app on my phone a while back but got bored and deleted it. Now I see it's got Apple watch support I got it again. But it seems all you can with the watch is look at you hatchi. I can't seem to interact at all. Does anyone know if you actually can interact with it? If you can't in deleting it again.    How do you get them? Seems like I haven't gotten any new ones in ages and I've forgotten how you get them.   So I'm fighting... some tower. the last one in the Kove looking portion of the map. Was it really too much to ask for them to label these things? Regardless.  I'm on fight 4/6, and it's cheap IMO. Firstly I'm forced to use a card I don't own. This annoys me because it messes up the equal levelling I used to go for in Injustice, but I can live with that. The trouble is Cassie's passive. It claims "All Spec Ops teammates have a 25% chance of unblockable attacks." And she's teamed with 2 Spec Ops cards. I don't believe the 25% part at all. In my experience 3 out of 5 attacks they do is unblockable, and this is all 3 characters remember. So I've breezed up to this point, but now because I can't use my own team (and the passive benefits that provides) I need to bring two cards that are wildly OP in order to finish this battle. When you're stripped of your team passives and the ability to block while the computer has both of those advantages the fight is insanely cheap.  The rampant and unpredictable difficulty in the fights in this game need to be addressed. You can be going along just fine then BAM! They give you a fight that's in a different league from the ones that preseded it in the same damn tower. If this was a boss battle I could almost be ok with the cheapness, but it's just fight 4/6.  Cheap.      If his match win animation doesn't include him whipsering ["Anytime..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhCYpnnGoo) to his fallen opponent I'm gonna sow cress seeds into Netherealm's carpets as a sign of protest.   I must say this game doesn't disappoint on the whole. Sure the multiplayer suffers from lag, but the lag seems largely consistent so I can usually work around it. Certainly no worse than MK9 and Injustice as far as I can tell.  The graphics are awesome, not the best I've seen, but definitely "next gen", which is something we've seen too little of since the consoles launched IMO.  Sound design. Top notch! I know they put a lot of work into the sound for the game and it shows. All the right crunches and whooshes are there.  Story mode. The best story mode in any fighting game I've played. Worth playing just for the cut scenes. I'm glad Netherealm put so much time into what is now a largely ignored fighting game mode. I love the fact that as well as each character having their own unique arcade mode ending there's a singular canon narrative to play through that solidifies everything story wise.  Music. Can't complain. It does the job, reminds me of MK9.  Krypt. I think this is a fun way to unlock stuff in a game, best krypt so far IMO.  Basically I'm loving this game more than I was hoping I would. I only have a couple of gripes, but they're small and easily ignored when looking at the game as a whole.  1. No Noob Saibot. My mains are always Sub-Zero and Noob. At least Sub-Zero's good in this game.2 2. Sub-Zero's defaiult costume is ugly as hell! But there's plenty of good ones and the inclusion of the Klassic skin made up for the poor Kurrent one. 3. I miss the avatrs from the old KoTH mode. But oh well.  What do you guys think of the game?      This started today for me. After every fight I just get the MK logo loading symbol, the one that usually precedes the post battle info like koins earned etc. I have to close the app and reopen it.  Anyone else having this issue? iOS   I want to know when to come back and laugh at all the people who waited until it wasn't relevant anymore to get red.                           Title.                           Anyone else really happy that this exists? I've always hated the new Sub Zero design. I don't mind the Kuai Liang and Revenant kostumes but god DAMN the klassic skin is too sexy. Feels great to represent my boy Sun Zero with him looking the way I remember. After giving him the MKII klassic skin in MK9 I love the fact they went for the UMK3 klassic skin this time.  Any other costumes you guys are super happy with?  [For those who haven't seen it](http://insidemk.altervista.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mortal-Kombat-X_Sub-Zero_Klassic_Bio.jpg)                              Probably not. But seriously, when will we get the other half of the game?      I'd love to Netherealm, but you won't fucking let me. Can't they just remove this uncompletable objective until they finally have a product that's ready for launch?            I have a bonus mission "Win 3 fights using a Spec Ops card that you own."  I'm doing the tower where Kitana is on your team and I put Trooper on my team and won 3 fights. The bonus mission shows no progress.  Is this a known bug?   I'm currently up to the Reptile boss. Is there going to be a faster way to earn souls, or at the very least more ways? I know it's the premium currency and they want to make you buy them but god damn they're slow to earn. At this stage I think I actually prefer the "buy characters for a ridiculous amount of gold" system they used in Injustice. At least with that system I always felt like I was earning currency to go towards characters.  I suppose factions will include some way of earning souls. Whenever they actually manage to make it work that is.         I've only encountered two bosses thus far, Kotal Khan and Reptile, and is it just me or are they wildly overpowered?  I mean, I know bosses are meant to be tougher than their henchmen but when you can simply breeze through 6 or 7 fights then all of a sudden hit a wall you can't get past until you seriously upgrade your cards, that's surely an issue? Is there any particular reason (other than to try to hassle you into buying microtransactions) why they would do this?      I was expecting this game to be at least as fun as Injustice but from what I can tell so far it's. It's not even close.  The animations look sloppy in the MK game. They look like they were animated by amateurs. The animations on injustice were crisp, clear, and just better looking, they flowed more realistically.   I call bull on the control scheme. I was told that like Injustice if you tap you get a weak combo and if you swipe you get a heavy combo. Well, so far tapping and swiping have done nothing but activate the same two combos. There's literally no difference between tapping and swiping, meaning that when I tell my character to attack I have no idea what he's going to do. Is this a problem with the game or jut my version? I'd be interested in hearing.  There's so many other little things that injustice did right that MK mobile just does wrong. It's like this game was made before injustice.  How do you evade specials that involve throws? Seems awfully cheap of you can't do the equivalent of blocking them like other specials.  I was expecting something so much better. I was expecting injustice with MK characters. What I got was what genuinely feels like a cheap injustice knock-off. And I don't know how they managed to do that.  I'm still playing the game obviously, I'm having to rely on blind hope that the game actually improves and begins to feel good to play, but if what I've played so far is any indicator of how bad this game is to play, then I'll have to be out, and I don't want to be out.   What are your thoughts on the game so far?   It's happening a lot, but it's sporadic. Seemingly completely random. I've restarted my computer. Looked at the task manager. Looked at devices in the control panel, but saw no solution or even cause. Any help would be appreciated.                     Redundant text right here.                                                   I think I recall reading a long time ago that shattering gear in quick succession reaps bonus shards, or something.  Any kind souls willing to lay out the rules for shattering to maximise rewards? Or point me in the direction of a guide for such activities?            My current favourite team is MKX Scorpion, CCBG, and ABB. The gear I use with this team is as follows.  MKX = Bone Spikes, Mark of the Tiger, and Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar  CCBG = Carbonfiber Mask, Dark Sword, and Nullification Rifle.  ABB = Azarthian Cloak, Icebound Necklace, The Batmobile.  I know I'd be better off using the scimitar on Batgirl as he combo ender does two hits instead of one but I prefer having it on Scorpion.  My question is this. Is the Batmobile gear useless? I play online mode almost exclusively and almost never get any super's charged up. I usually just use my s2 abilities to win the fights, so is the Batmobile useless? Is it really worth it to charge up enough power to use a super (that will do splash damage) when by that point the fight is almost over and the 1 hit super is less effective than the 4 hit s2 ABB does?                                    The title really says it all. I'm logged in right now. Time to make up for lost... uh... time.     	198
 aww, boo hoo, downvote my post. The mural is a lie, there is no jetpack in the game. The mural means nothing it's just somthing Rockstar put into the game for a joke.      P.S OP, how are we suppost to know these things if we are PC Gamers? What if we have never played a N64 before?   Your favourite  game: Zelda Nintendos Harry Potter    I need it for GTA V for my friend and some case keys for CS:GO It will mostly go to the community and my friends list because I am kind. 43,000   peasant   this needs to be in the sidebar   fuk u guis   Cruel Much?

PC Upgrades here in the UK are REALLY expensive.   PSU is brand new. It's a WinPower 500w PSU   I loud grinding noise that gets louder and louder just comes from my PSU randomly sometimes, I have to turn it off in fear, when I turn it back off again it's gone?! What the hell guys? I spent 500 on this PC. If I lose it now, i'm fucked. I'll have to go back to shitty xbox.   Aww, boohoo drown me in downvotes, I don't care. Just because I don't like a game you do, does not mean you have to downvote. or upvote for that fact. Ah do whatever the fuck you want i'm not your mother.   I just needed to vent.

But nobody wanted to be friends with the kid with special needs. ;(   Hmm, the local CCL store sells Wirebrushes   I do, but my paintbrushes are in oil, because i'm an Artist, and the oil preserves the bristles, and cleans them. So I don't want to gunk up my heatsink/PC. I'll buy some Dust-Off tomorrow from STAPLES.       I'm not sure, I think it's the fan because of the dust I can see inside the heatsink. I have not removed it yet, because i'm afraid i'll break the CPU if I remove it. :S   My battlestation is making weird noises, It's like a VRRRR, it keeps getting louder, and louder, I panic'd and shut down the PC from the mains. :( I can't afford a repair! :C   What. TL:DR   I guess the peasants who live in the commonwealth were right about PC Gaming being too expensive.  	56
 Nope.  If you have analog cable, you'll continue to receive it until your provider decides to shut it off.  There is no requirement for them to keep analog service on, but I still have analog service, and ClearQAM.  Note that they could have shut it off back in 2012 if they wanted to.  I get 63 analog channels, and 25 digital ones. :)  TWC actually does *something* right. :)  https://www.fcc.gov/guides/dtv-transition-did-not-require-cable-systems-switch-digital  http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/14/fcc-to-allow-encryption-of-basic-cable-with-a-few-strings-that/  http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/12/news/la-ol-cable-tv-analog-signals-20120611   It looks like a puma against a setting of leaves, and a pole axe.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Armoiries_r%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise.svg   100% of the people who have ever ingested dihydrogen monoxide is either dead, or will die.

I tried to sign on with my TWC ID, but since I'm only an internet/phone subscriber, I don't get shit.  I want channel surfing, that's why I stay with TV service. How I get it, I honestly don't care.  I miss NTSC. :(  I miss rolloff, instead of this new "digital cliff"  Yeah, watching channels in B/W with almost no audio sucked, but better than nothing.  ATSC standards suck. :(  I'd like to bitch slap the asshole at the FCC who made this decision.  Here's my TV Fool:    http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a  I actually get KLEW and K40EE, but K40EE is turning off in a month, since it's still analog. :(   Why I still have traditional service?  Because I can just press "up" and watch something new without having to think about it.  No pre-scheduling, no "does thiis meet your standards", no "upvote".  Just change the channel if it sucks what your watching.  That's why I'll never get rid of TV service.  I'm trying to build a decent antenna, but I need to get this thing called a "combiner".  Fuck, antennas have changed a lot over the last 20 years.  Before, the bigger the better. and adjustable antennas were boss.  Now, amplified antennas are complete shit, and outdoor antennas can be used as indoor antennas?  It makes no sense.  Maybe I should go back to buiding my own like I did in the 90's?   Hmm. :)  Which Intel cards are compatible with this?  Or should I put up a large wifi Yagi?  I don't have an Xbox, (any generation), but I do have a phone, 2 TV's, laptop, and a desktop.   And sometimes they put in the wrong filters too. ;)  Other times, they're completly neglegent, and hook you right up to the line.  Othertimes, you just have basic cable tools, (torque wrench, terminator tool, P-Key), and you have cable access anyhow. ;)   That amplified antenna, (it was about as thick as 5 sheets of paper), didn't work at all.  Even PBS was pixilated, and I couldn't get jack shit with it.  Here is my [TV Fool](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a).  I also get KLEW and K40EE with a $9 antenna.  I have recently purchased the ClearStream1, and I have yet to test it.  I have it on a 6 foot pole, and need to figure out how to mount it on my roof, (without a ladder).   Back in 1999, I did.  But I thought in that movie, humans were powercells, not just a heater?   Thanks!  Does this also explain why when there are a large amount of humans in a room, that room is actually hot compared to the rest of the building?  So humans are like portable furnaces that can walk and talk and breathe?      * Water * Food * Shelter         I don't put on any facade.  I'm 32 years old and independent.  If they don't like my decisions, tough titties for them.   Because it makes good TV.   AIDS.   The amplified antenna that I tried didn't work for shit, but the cheap ass RCA 112F works fine to get 6 channels.   Yes, it was one of those flat antennas that you can mount to your wall, or window, or just set it on a desk.  It didn't work for shit.  I now have a cheap ass set of rabbit ears on my downstairs TV, and get 6 channels.  I have to figure out how to mount my Clearview1 to the top of the roof though.  I have it on a 6 foot pole, I just have to figure out how to get up there without a ladder truck.   My parents and grandparents actually used large ariels mounted on 50 foot poles.  That was the only way we could pick up anything.  I grew up 16 miles from the nearest town with over 10000 people.  I now live in a small town of only 30000 people.  The nearest city with over 100,000 people is over 75 miles away from me.   Dude, I still use my VCR from 1995.   I know.  :(  Here's what I would get it I could put up a 500 foot radio tower, (it's still pathetic):  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3d8230de8efe5422   Groovy  Man  Dude  Sup  Tight  Boss  Awesome  Cool   I call sloppy seconds!   I meant about the antennas.  Nothing has changed since the DTV conversion.        http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a  I actually pick up KLEW, and K40EE, (although K40EE is going dark in July).  I just returned the amplfied antenna for the Clearview1, and I'm going to see how that works.  I just have to set up a mount for it.  I need a bucket, and some gravel.   Yes, I had it plugged in, and it didn't make a damned bit of difference.  I took it back and exchanged it for a ClearStream 1.  I haven't done a channel scan with it yet, but it should work, considering the cheap-o RCA indoor antenna actually works, (and the Clearstream 1 has good reviews on Amazon.com)   Because invisible pink unicorns are always talking.   How is this news? Liberals run on nothing but feelings, logic be damned.   And still applies.      I bought a $9 set of rabbit ears with a UHF loop on it, and an amplified antenna at WM for $49.95,  The amplified antenna can't pick up anything, but the rabbit ears let me pull in 6 channels, (4 of them PBS, ABC (analog), and CBS).  So what is the point of amplified indoor antennas when they don't pick up anything, and actually perform worse than a standard set of rabbit ears?   Probably a couple of hours.   The world land speed record.   Walmart.   Not true at all.  I'm 32 years old, and I'll work doing anything.  "dreams" are for children.  The only thing that matters is keeping the lights on, a roof over my head, and food in my stomach.  Beyond that, I'm not picky what I do.   More aliens.  The ones from Mexico.   Yes, so long as the corpse didn't rot, and leak bodily secretions into the house.  Just croaked and found within a day or so?  I wouldn't give a shit.

The neighbors didn't like explosives too much, and the cops only told me to stop shooting off mortars, [after watching me light up the block for about 20 min]  {Yes, I have a lot of fireworks}.). :D  I shoot off fireworks because our football team sucks so much for the last 2 years, that ANY win is a good win, and mortars get launched, (which is why I probably have the cops called on me).  I'm going to put on a show after the town's 4th july display, Look to Maple Street, and you'll see a show. :)   IT'S LEGAL THAT DAY!!! :)  :)   When I was 12, I asked for a VCP for christmas, because I thought that VCR's were too expensive.

Hell, the pizza guys can't even get the right house, so I don't blame you.  Tell you what.  I have keys to the electricity.  I'll shut them off for you.  (if you let me go back to bed).  Seriously, I do have access to the electric box, and if you let me sleep, I'll shut off their power for you. :)   I know that's very illegal, (at least in WA and ID), so I don't think anybody would be ballsy enough to impersonate a marked police vehicle, but undercovers?  That's easy.  Hell, I already look like a WSU maintenence vehicle, (from the dealership, I didn't get custom paint), minus the orange globe on top.  I can already drive basically wherever I want on WSU, so long as I abide by maintenance vehicle restrictions, it's not hard to get away with driving on "authorized vehicles and pedestrians only" roads, or on sidewalks, or up stairs, or anywhere I want to go.    I've parked for HOURS directly across from the police department, and nobody cared.  No citations, no towing, nothing.  Not even a note.  I just drove like I was supposed to be there.  Of course, I used to work there, and am well aware of how maintenance vehicles are supposed to drive on "closed" roads, so abide by that, and no problems.    Yes, I only did it when I had a good reason to, (wife was 8 months pregnant, and she can't walk up hills without risking falling over).  But without modifications, I can easily pass as a maintenance vehicle at WSU.  I even got Whitman County to drop a couple of "illegal parking" tickets, because I had a pregnant wife who couldn't walk more than 30 yards.  She had door to door service.  I drove anywhere I wanted, just abiding by the maintenance vehicle code.  Park outside the CUB for a couple hours?  Not a problem.  Drive down the chipman trail on WSU?  Not a problem.  I only got "illegal parking" when I using all the powers of dumbassery parked on the steps.  (people were in my way, so I couldn't park on level ground).  (yes, I know it wasn't very smart parking on stairs, because if my e-brake failed, it would cause at least 100 deaths, I got lectured by the judge on that one).  But as long as I wasn't dangerously parked, nobody cared at all, or even noticed my vehicle).   They work fine for me.  So yes, I do.   Yes.  If blue things are appearing red, you're approaching c, and you're going WAY TOO FAST!  (if the 60 mile radius around us survives, you'll get the highest ticket in history).   Cause I was 19 at the time, and had no clue (still don't), what they do with a road kill animal, (well, "almost-kill" [it was parylized when I saw it, so I shot it because it was suffering]).  I didn't want it, so I told them to give it to the battered women's shelter, (hey, they need meat), since I don't want it to go to waste.  Yes, I shot it, but from the front of the vehicle that collided with it, and the deer, it was obvious that I wasn't poaching.  I just had to unload, (not hard, it was a single shot), and give them the spent shell.  I kept my .410, and they sent me on my way.  I'll never forget that "conversation".    "Did you see anything?"  "Yes.  I deer stumbling in the road, and a wrecked car.  These people pointing to the people looking on were in the car."  "Did you do anything?"  "Asked if they were OK.  They don't seem to need medical attention.  I shot the deer."  "I'm sorry, you did what?"  "I shot the deer.  It looked to be parylized.  I shot it in the head and put it out of it's misery.  The deer is over here".  "Sir, what did you shoot it with?  It seems to missing about a quarter of the left side of it's head."  "My SS .410"  The shell is over there"  "OK.  I'm going to need the shell you have loaded, and I need to inspect your weapon"  "OK"  ...  "It seems everything checks out.  Do you wish to keep this animal?"  "No, give it to the battered women's shelter or something.  I don't want it.  I just didn't want it to suffer."  "Here is your shotgun.  Please do not load it, and have a good day sir."   I flip a Uie, and go back to town   Personally, if somebody burst in here, the threat would be stopped, and you'll be chasing somebody neutralized.  (or not chasing him as the case may be).  Hopefully once he realized he had nowhere to run, or use force against, he would surrender and play "spider on the ground", but I'm prepared if I need to be, (legally, I don't violate the NFA, or any state statutes).  If all I have to yell is "HEY!" and they run off, good!  Shit, now the police reaction to me pulling up to WaMu to have my wife get money out of the ATM makes sense.  I pulled up, and I saw several patrol vehicles there, and didn't think anything of it.  Wife got out of the car, and I was sitting in the seat smoking.  Officer walks by and asks what I'm doing, so I told him, "my wife wants some cash from the ATM and she's right there", [literally right in front of me].  He told me to stay in the vehicle, and walked off carrying an AR in a 1pt sling in low ready.  I don't know where the hell he was going, but he seemed like he was on a mission.  Yes, I stayed in the vehicle.  I didn't really think much of it beyond "this is odd".  To this day, I still don't even know what the hell I rolled up on.  The bank was closed, so it couldn't have been a bank robbery.  Training thing maybe?  That's the only thing I can think of.     Just a normal cop car without lights?  Doesn't make me nervous, I've just never seen one before besides earlier today.  I thought it was strange.  I was airing up my tires, and saw it pass by.  It looked strange to me, since I expect cop cars to have a light bar like ambulances or fire trucks.  Emergency vehicles = lightbar, as far as I'm concerned.  I saw one without one, so I wondered why that car exists, (since I never saw one before).  It made me look twice.  I didn't think much of it beyond "Hmm, weird.  33 lbs, 35 lbs .... 50 lbs... OH SHIT!  Pfffffffffff. 44 lbs.  Cool.  On to the next tire."   OK, that explains why you carry SMG's. :)  What do you do if you come across people sleeping who don't know what the hell is going on, and don't even know who you are?  Yeah, I assume you announce "XXX County Sheriff", but what if they are like "OK, why are you here?" and they honestly have no idea why you're there, because they weren't doing anything besides sleeping?  I guess what I'm asking is "what if you get the wrong house?"  Or what if you do have the wrong house, you burst in, and you hear "WHO'S IN MY HOUSE!?  I'M ARMED!  LEAVE NOW!! I'M CALLING 911!"   I don't like the slick top rigs because I could EASILY do that myself (if I had enough money).  I drive a crimson and grey 97 Blazer LT, and it looks enough like a WSU rig that I get no shit if I drive on "authorized vehicles only" roads up at WSU.  I've parked for a couple hours, and locked my rig, and nobody touched it, or ticketed me, or even left me a note.  I look like a normal WSU maintenance vehicle minus the orange globe on top.  I've done nothing special to my rig beyond "buy it from the dealer", but I can pass as a WSU maintenance vehicle, when I'm directly parked across the street from the police department.  The only thing visually seperating me from a WSU Police vehicle?  No light bar, no large aerials, no state plates, and no push bar.  The only thing separating me from a maintenance vehicle?  No orange orb.  But if I wanted all of that shit, if I had about $3000, nobody would be able to tell the difference, (besides the logos of the local police).  [That's not too hard to get](http://www.decaldriveway.com/) if I wanted to.  Just knowing how easy it would be to impersonate a police officer if if I felt so inclined, (NO I DON'T!), and just a normal passenger vehicle can be easily passed off as a maintenance vehicle makes me have reservations about unmarked vehicles.  Hell, I don't even need an orange globe to drive wherever I want on WSU campus, I just have to drive like I work there, and am on official business, (less than 15 MPH at all times, and when pedestrians are present, less than 5 MPH).  Of course, it does help that I used to work there in maintenance, so I know the procedures for driving on "Pedestrian Only:  Closed to traffic except for authorized vehicles" road.  Also, the one time I got pulled over for jumping a red, (didn't run it, jumped it, (treated it as a 4 way, and went for it), I actually purposly went to the center lane, turned on my 4 ways, and drove to the nearest gas station and parked under the fueling area.  I didn't see him, so I didn't know who was trying to pull me over.  I made sure that the stop was on video tape, because I didn't know who was stopping me or why.  (I fucked up, and jumped the red), and got let go).  [not doing that again, and the officer gave me a good reason why]  "What if I was trying to get on to the road?  You obviously didn't see me, so what else could you have missed?"  Want to kill somebody today?"  I had no answer for that, and I don't jump reds anymore.   But what do you use them for?  I carry a sidearm on my person, (so I don't get killed if somebody shoots at me, at least I'll have a fighting chance), and a .410 in case I come across road almost-kill, (I've had to use it before), but why an MP5?  Do you have to do residential breeches or something?  Surely it's not to send roadkill to meet it's maker?  Yeah, if somebody's shooting at you, I fully expect you to shoot back, but why a SMG?  What do you use them for?  (yay for WA, they let you keep roadkill if you want it).  No, I didn't keep it, I told the officer to give it to the battered women's shelter or whatever they do with it.  I only shot it because it was going to die anyways, and I didn't want it to suffer.  My only word to the deer was "sorry".  BANG!  (after I distracted the kids at the scene by having them look at the "pretty mountain, isn't it pretty how all that snow is up there?  Just think about sledding.")   *cough* only the asians, and the seattleites. *cough*  If it snows 2", expect numerous slide offs, and drive EXTREMELY defensively.  (sign says 35, go 30.  Sign says 55, go 45).  Seattleites can't drive worth shit.  Empty roads, and shit conditions?  I actually obey the speed limit. (unless it's foggy, I've went 20 in a 55 before, because I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me, and assholes wouldn't pass, and lined up behind me because I was "making way".  I could barely see where I was going), and still almost got into a head-on.  I found myself in the center lane before a car passed me in the opposite direction, and wondered "why is that car so close to me?"  I had drifted over to the center turn lane, and had it not been for the rumble strips, a very bad accident would have happened that night.  That was scary.  I should have just stopped.   They have submachine guns?  Shit, no wonder why the officer was watching exactly what I was doing when I said "Hey, can I sit behind the wheel?"  His response was "Uhh, sure, just don't start it."  WTF do you need an Uzi for?  AR15's I can understand, (what if you're in a shooting, and you need to "reach out and touch somebody"?  But SMG?  What the hell for?  (honest question).   SWAT uses patrol cars?  I thought they used those converted APC's?  I've sat behind the wheel of one, (no they wouldn't let me even fire it up), and it was cool, but from the "test" I did on the seat, (bouncing up and down on it), I wouldn't want to drive that fucker.  It felt like a really shitty grain truck with bad seat springs. (just sitting behind the wheel and looking around the cab seeing what lacks).  They don't even have an AM radio in that thing!  That rig must be boring to drive. (and hell on your ass).   Do drivers recognize that you're a patrol vehicle when you light them up, or think you're some asshole pranking as a cop so they pull over so assumed asshole can blow by them at highway speeds?  (serious question)    If I got stopped by one of those "concealed light" rigs, I would slow down, call 911, turn on my 4 ways, and proceed to the nearest well lit area before stopping.  No light bar on top?  I'm not stopping.  How do I know you're not some dickhole who likes making people shit a brick for no reason?    In my book, cop cars have lights on the top.  Concealed bars are about one step above some random driver trying to get me to stop for I don't know why.  Undercover vehicles?  (no markings), I'm going to pull over in a well lit area, where there are plenty of witnesses, and I'm calling 911.  Any joe schmoe on the internet can buy red and blues if he wants, and sirens aren't that hard to obtain either.  All you need is [internet access](http://www.thefirestore.com/store/category.aspx/categoryId/528/Emergency-Lights-and-Sirens/).  I don't trust unmarked vehicles.   There's a guy that drives one of those, but his is painted all white.    He doesn't have ariels, or state plates, and has holes where the push bar used to be.  I know that guy, and he just uses it as a daily commute vehicle.  But for some reason, they left the spotlights on it instead of carrying a spotlight in their vehicle like a normal person. He lives up at CCN.  I've pulled him out of the ditch a couple of times, because he drives like shit.   Painted dark blue, and it says "Pullman Police Department" on the side, and gives the business number?  Wouldn't that be VERY illegal?  It was identical to this car, but no lightbar on top.  http://www.pullman-wa.gov/images/stories/Police/ppd_patrol_car.JPG   that would be 34984.   In your house.   Yes, it is. It's also known as the Doppler effect.   I regularly did 1600 SPH, and 5.5 SPI.   Bad enough that I had to speed to a station in town, and couldn't make it to the doors, so I stopped as soon as I got off of the street, and pissed right there in front of god and everybody. I simply couldn't hold it any longer. I was starting to piss in my driver's seat.   Evolution.   That's what the bin next to the quarters are for.   You could leave your house unlocked, and windows open while you sleep, and wouldn't worry about getting robbed.  You could leave your windows down, keys in the ignition, and truck running while going into the store for a little bit, and not worry if your rig will still be there when you get out. The most that would happen is somebody might turn your ignition off, figuring you forgot about it.  If you broke down along the road, people would actually stop and see if they could help you, instead of just driving by and pretending they didn't see you.  Children were expected to behave, and bad behavior in public settings such as restaurants and stores was not tolerated by either the general public, or the parents.  Children could go to the store, or park without parental escort; and nobody thought twice about a child unattended taking a city bus. CPS didn't get involved because you let your children have some independence.  If it was during school hours, and children were seen roaming the street, it wasn't uncommon to ask them "Shouldn't you be in school?" or "Do you need a ride to school?"  If children missed the bus to school, they were expected to walk, (or take their bike), to school; not call mommy and daddy at work to get a ride.  Perpetual victimhood was frowned upon. Yeah, you got a raw deal. Everybody has something to bitch about. Life isn't fair, get used to it.  No participation trophies. You deserve praise because you accomplished something, or went above and beyond the call of duty. Not simply because you breathe free air.   In the game of life, there are winners and losers. Regardless how hard you try, you still may not succeed. You didn't win. Sorry, you lost. Yes, you may have tried. That doesn't make you a "winner in your heart", you are still a loser in the game of life, but at least you lost with dignity.  Please and thank you were common, and expected. It used to be considered common courtesy to hold open a door for the elderly, ladies, infirmed, people in a rush, and people carrying things.   Also offering them a buggy, or taking it back into the store for them used to be a kind gesture that wasn't expected.  It was polite, not "rude", "demeaning", or "mysoganist".  People had a sense of community, and you knew your neighbors, and they knew you. You could ask them for help, and they could of you too. It might be as simple as, "hey, I'm going on vacation for a week, can you water my lawn?" Or something like "I just bought a new couch, and I need help getting it out of my truck. Can you help?". People were glad to help.  Fortunately, I still live in one of these areas. All of America should be like this.   The holey buy-bull and Kent Hovind said so.   Not really, there's people obsessed with exercise.  Exercise isn't a drug.   They are drugs.  *"a medicine or other substance (which is not food or water), which has a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body."*   Good reasons. :)  I'm happy with my VCR.  It works fine for me.   I have my DTV box feeding into my VCR, and from there, into my TV.  It works fine for my purposes.   That explains it.  Thanks!  I saw it driving by today while I was airing up my tires, and I thought it was strange, so I asked here why those cars exist.  To quote NBC:  "The More You Know..." :)   I was a teen when it first came out.  I stopped watching it after a dude was forced to give a BJ, and chomped the dudes dick off, then spit it in his face.  I decided I didn't want to see that, so I changed the channel, (Sat G5, T15, C-Band).    It's worth watching as an adult, but not for kids.  The pacific is gory, but it's good. :)  I have all 3 series on my computer.  Hell, I have enough video on my computer I could run a TV station.   So it's just a normal police car?  Do they even have lights?  I was airing up my tires today and one drove by.  It looked like the FD car, but had the police paint on it.  I thought it was strange.   Ah.  So that's like the boss's company car?           The liberal media lies, and presents a view point that bolsters thier POV without regards to the facts of the case.   What ever happened to just using a VCR?  (serious question)  Walmart still sells blank tapes.  http://www.walmart.com/ip/10980689?reviews_limit=9    Band of Brothers is good.  Have you watched The Pacific yet?  That's good too.  So is Oz.   Well shit.  There's not much there that I would actually bother watching.  :(  Fuck, I hate the DTV conversion. :(  I used to get 13 channels with an indoor antenna. :(         To the East, there are several mountains in the way, (over 4500 feet high).  To the north, there is a change in elevation of a thousand feet, and down in the LC valley where channel 3 is, is a fall of about 2000 feet.  There are basically no broadcast towers to the west of me.  Is it possible to convert a direcTV dish to FreeSat?  Or would I need to put in a new dish?  And if I did this, would I be able to get american TV like ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox, UPN, CW?   Shit. Even if I could put up a radio tower of 500 feet, I still wouldn't be able to pick up much.:    http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3d8230de8efe5422     Using my phone on the toilet.

There are 168 hours in a week.      12 hours of class     12 hours of study     40 hours to work     56 hours to sleep     10 hours to eat     3 hours to keep house     14 hours to relax     Total hours used per week:  147     Total hours per week: 168     Total hours left unused:  21  That gives you 21 hours to socialize.

CHUCK (from kyle's stories)   Only pseudo-intellectuals use the phrase pseudo-intellectual....wait.   Batman   Superman v. Murkah Durkah   Wings   Pka 72 at 18:12 (Sub-ma-fucking-rine)   Well...you can burn trees, but you can't burn steel beams. So the question we should really be asking is, Can steel beams live forever?   A lost dog strays into a jungle. A lion sees this from a distance and says with caution "this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before". So the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. The dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly "mmm...that was some good lion meat!". The lion abruptly stops and says " woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can". Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together". So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...   When did he say that? smells like BS to me.   They are long gone friend...Prank calls, hilarious untold stories, and Wings of Redemption. Those are all done.   No bad at all.

So I can just add it like I do all my other vst's to FL. No alternative method to add it?   Murkah is my favorite host/guest. But where I think many might get confused with my comment is that Wings brought a certain type of spontaneous entertainment and hilaritiy. And, yes most of the time we would laugh at him but that was what cause most of the best moments on the show ever. Seriously go watch some 'Funniest moments of PKA' videos on youtube 90% the funny spawned from Wings. I love Murkah but he's more intellectual and calculated with his sarcastic remarks. Murkah is my favorite host/guest of every single person whose been on PKA but no one truly can replace or replicate what wings did for the show.    ...And I'm Jesus Christ   Satan?...is that you buddy   Can you run that through FL Studio?

 Pink Floyd, baby, best band ever :)  EDIT: Considering that I got downvoted in less than a minute, makes me think otherwise :'(   My favorite song hands down off Dark Side, no question about it. Listening to that solo in the right environment is a border line religious experience. Also the lyricism in this song is so superb, and it's genius for them to do the Breathe Reprise, I absolutely love this tune.   cheers mate   Do you know of any site or anything that can give me a guide or anything like that?   And that is sick, how much would a fella have to pay you to make another one?   Interesting, It seems like if you wanted to know about the real details of the band, you'd have to be already involved in reading music articles and such. I'm sure a lot of people were unaware of the falling out.   It's definitely easy for me to forget and overlook how much the Internet has really revolutionized media and information gathering in our world and that it wasn't to the scale that it is today.   Brandon Flowers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse   As you can see, less than half my artists have had an album come out in 2014, but thats all good. I finally listened to artists that I never really listened to before and I loved them. I might also add youtube links to some songs from these artists :)   * 1) Pink Floyd - knew about them of course, really delved into their material and was blow away, I consider them one of my favorite bands of all-time. I even enjoyed The Endless River, to a certain extent, even though a lot of people didn't as much. I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums   * 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well   * 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom   * 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"  * 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly   * 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project  * 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy. She's my guilty pleasure - come hate me haha   *  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me   * 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig  * 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans. Flicker is my favorite song because I'm an Eyedea fan, so I thought it was a great song. I also started listening to his older discog a bit more, and I think Slug can straight spit fire     I was born in '93, well after the PF break-up, and from what it seems, the PF break-up was popular news and shown in the media. (This could be wrong, I'm not sure how well covered it was by media outlets.) I was just wondering if there was anyone on here that had first hand accounts of watching this legendary band slowly and publicly fall out with each other (I know all the members weren't on the forefront). Basically I want to know how heartbreaking it was to watch Waters and Gilmour fight over something so revered.   thanks man, I'll pm ya next time instead of making a post, thanks for taking care of things though, much appreciated    I use it as my quick reference for the game times and future matches, I'm sorry if I'm unaware of any system that goes into updating (like updated every 2 weeks or such)   Team Baby-Afros!!! Let's fucking gooooo   You're right, that's why I do listen to the entire album when I study, it just flies right on by      Frusciante's guitar in Central is also wicked, that's my favorite song from his solo work   I think they've also used RHCP songs, I can't remember exactly which ones. But I remember Flea was pretty upset for obvious reasons, his music is meant to make people happy and inspire them, not make them go insane. ( Even though the song Easily makes me go insane( in a good way though)) Could anyone be so kind to fact check me on this? I'm on my phone and can't really navigate as easily.   Wet sand for Frusciante,and Alive for McCready are amazing    I'm a mess   No order  * David Gilmour (Never heard anyone manipulate a guitar and sounds quite like him)  * Jimi Hendrix (obvious, also he played a right-handed guitar upside down, need I say more)  * Pete Townshend (One of my favorite older rockers with some iconic moves that I love)  * Mike McCready (Pearl Jam's guitarist, I think he's very underrated, probably not top 5 all time, but he's in my list because I just love his solos)  * Jimmy Page (Double neck motha fuckaaaaassssss)  * John Frusciante ( I can't believe I forgot him in my original group :( ... He's literally one of my favorite people on the face of the planet)  EDIT: Woops I only did 5, so I added the 6th and messed up a bunch of spelling    I like this album more than piper, I still need to give it more listens, but I do find it enjoyable. OBC in my opinion is PFs most underrated album though   Sounds good   Is it Day 56?   Ahhh yes it's an American bookstore actually, I'm not sure how original they are though, I doubt they are original pressings. And good luck mate   You can get Dark side of the moon from barns and noble lol   Ughhh this conversation has come up once or twice already in the past week, please use the search on this subreddit   EDIT: okay, downvote me because I wish for a variety of conversations...   *eating of popcorn intensifies*   ZING!   Word, we're all floydians here, much love homie   Cocks out lads!   I mean, I didn't downvote him, so I assume people are because he just kind of disagreed in a short manner without much of an explanation. Thats not good conversation 101 amigo   Yeah I found this so compelling, I try to share it with people whenever I can   Eddie Vedder is one of my most respected artist's, this 6 minute condensed version of an interview has swelled tears in my eyes so many times. What a great human being.  [Pearl Jam interview with Steve Gleason (former NFL player suffering from ALS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLHPm_8_Yis)    Every verse is so potent      That's like... your opinion man...   Can't forget Poles Apart, or Wearing the inside out, or coming back to life.. shit... the whole album is great   Actually, Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 doesn't really do much for me. I agree that TDB beats The Wall as a whole. And I also agree that Comfortably Numb absolutely outclasses anything on TDB. My favorite part on The Wall is Nobody Home through Comfortably Numb, other than that, I only revisit the album for Hey You, and sometimes Young Lust.   I think it's true about music companies wanting to slap old rock bands names onto an album to make nostalgia money.... but I love The Division Bell, it'd make more sense if it was about The Endless River, but it's not. The Division Bell is a fantastic album that I like more than The Wall. SO YEAH.   Spongebob bubble bowl band anyone? This list is egregious!   I will take you out to Ruth crists steakhouse    LET ME RUB YOUR ASS, GOD DAMMIT   Can I get a trial? It's only fair    Can I rub your ass then?   It seems that both albums are necessary as a precept for Dark Side, however, I'm not sure how OBC would have changed things if released before meddle. It's weird to think that OBC should have been released beforehand, as it has more of the psychedelic feel like ASoS or AHM. Meddle seems almost out of place because it's harder rock feel with One of these days and Echoes. I think if meddle wasn't released then OBC would be looked at with greater regard but I think echoes completely overshadows it. It's too much of a powerhouse song for the pre-dark side era.   I think I just cried for you, the disappointment :(   I haven't delved into their discography yet, any recommendations?   Fizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz   My friend just showed me this song the other, and I love it!!!  I knew I loved it when he said, "and don't fucking move"   I love nothing more than a good use of the word, "fuck" in a passionate song    and yet you don't even give me an upvote -.-   Is this real? I spot a couple footballers in Giggs and Cambiasso. Bertrand del is a bit of a stretch for a footballer, but come on laddie! I also spot a Ramos and Ruiz and oh fuck there's Rambo. AND THERES COSTA (CFC)   FUCK! I GUESSED SHMELLOW   I don't know how else to ask this, so I'm gonna be rather blunt, and excuse my french. But... what exactly is your favorite color?    Quite frankly I think it's way too early to predict the longevity of this album... It's been out for a month. Sure it probably won't be one of the most influential albums ever or ever stand toe-to-toe with other PF classics, but I think pretty much every PF has a time and place for the most part. I think Obscured by Clouds is one of PF's most underrated albums by far, that doesn't mean it's not a timeless and important album in the PF story. I feel like this is a good ending to the historic career of PF, few words are needed and the music speaks for itself.   EDIT: this isn't meant to sound confrontational, I just think its a bit premature to predict what people will be listening to in 2049. Heaven knows I'll be old as shit blasting PF as the 'young thugs' play their beeps and boops   This song needs to be 35 minutes long!   :( b-b-b-but (pun intended) I'll be your substitute   This. This is what I meant to put.   I think I enjoy more than most people on this sub to be honest, I think this album has great moments on each 'side'.  It's what we do is great, sum and skins go so well together, I absolutely love anisina. I also love allons-y 1 through allons-y 2, and then I thought side 4 was really good top, perhaps the best (3 and 4 are tied) however I did find that it's more of a situational album for me than their other albums. I can usually only pop TER while doing hw or studying, but for those situations I think it's a great album.   If we play that kind of D all year, we can make some ripples in the big 12, make some things interesting and get a good bid for the tourney   Open your heart, I'm coming home *cue a solo that gives feels*    Holy fucking defense batman   Bench  Mourinho's personal ass rubber  Old enough not to get Mourinho prosecuted by the police  Signed from abroad, I'm the best ass rubber in the world     Bass 'Colton' Ricks put an end to that belief mighty quickly   The pic of David and Nick makes me sad    you promised not to tell anyone   Thanks man, this should be more than enough to help me delve into it more    That comfortably numb solo has been known to impregnate woman who even just listen to the full thing (Snapple fact, I'm sure of it)   Really really, Blues really isn't a very familiar genre of mine, but I enjoy SVR   Poor David is always stuck with asshole frontmen :/ haha how about we give him someone nice for once?   * David Gilmour - Guitar/Vocals * Roger Waters - bassist/Vocals * Richard Wright - keyboardist * Nick Mason - drums   No... no they would not get along, at least not all of them.   I can dig it, I haven't heard of him. Seems like a great suggestion thus far. Thanks!   A-ha! I love telling people how I go into rock (specifically classic rock). The short answer School of Rock... now hear me out. I was in like 7th grade at the time, probably younger when I first watched it to be honest. But the scene where "My Brain is Hanging Upsidedown" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black did that montage with teaching all the kids about the history of rock and how to play. I don't know... as a young kid learning about music, I realized, "holy shit, there's a lot more complexity to music and influences than I realized." So I began with just a lot of classic rock for many and many years, now I branched out a great deal since then. But Pink Floyd is still the greatest band ever :P   Copper Gone by Sage Francis, underrated angry rapper that used to be a slam poet, this guy's lyricism is next to none.   Okay I have two questions that are pretty short, sweet and to the point. They are also unrelated so don't assume I'm gonna try to make any observations about these fellas.  * Can anyone recommend some really strong electrically driven blues music like Stevie Ray Vaughan? I've heard some other blues, but I don't really attack onto them like I do SVR's, I like guitar that just rips through songs.   * Also, I've only listened to Tom Waits very briefly and saw on here his Rain Dogs album mentioned. I'm listening to it and I'm about halfway through. What should I be listening for in particular. Usually when I listen to new stuff I have it on in the background and just listen to the music, and not necessarily the lyrics. But this seems like an album that I need to listen to the narrative that he generates. So should I give this album more attention, or is there another reason that people have recommended it?   Pink Floyd: Us and Them (as mentioned below), Gunner's Dream, Two Suns in the Sunset, Wearing the Inside Out, Shine on you Crazy Diamond, Dogs of War (not particularly fond of this song, but there's no denying the groovy saxiness at about the 4 min mark), Anisina (off The Endless River, one of my favorite tracks from that album)   CHECK DEEZ OUT HOMIE!   EDIT: Forgot Money    RES"ERECTION"   Nothing says I love jesus while raving with a girls ass grinding on my pork sword   * Roger Waters  * Sage Francis  * Thom Yorke   Most of the Pink Floyd albums would be adequate, but I'm gonna have to recommend Wish You Were Here   Which transitions into another phenomenal vocal moment by Roger, when he screams "this dream is driving me insaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane" he screams insane for at least 15 seconds   Gunners Dream by Pink Floyd. When Roger Waters screams, "but hold on to the dreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeam!" And how seamlessly it transitions into a saxophone is incredible.   Gnarly opening and peaceful track to open up a gnarly album. I think this song is a good preface for TDB   This one is all too true   Ha, I haven't played him yet, what's it like?    I've been playing a lot of ARAMs lately, and there have been champs that I get the option to level my ultimate with and debate whether it's worth it or not. Mainly champs with ults that allow for backdoor abilities such as TF or Panth. I'm sure there are plenty of others, so that's why I'm asking. What are some champs that you don't level up their ult at level 6?   I have fallen in love with this album over the course of this semester, I think this album is perfect for whenever I study or do homework. The only track that I'm not crazy about is Take It Back, and thats because I don't like the chorus that much.   Those are the two highlights for me as well, and then Fearless is the next best song IMO   I'm still delving into their live material, I'm eager to listen to Pulse, I've heard how good it was   Lost For Words 4:00-5:00. Not the best technical solo, but in the context of the song a very clean and appropriate solo, I love it.  Also /u/MaxCHEATER64 would you be interested in doing a similar thing for good vocal performances e.g. Great Gig In the Sky, Gunner's Dream   Come on over to /r/pinkfloyd bud, it's a really great band subreddit I found it out to be   One of the best songs in the PF catalog for me  	91
 Love for the rest of him too!  That stubble...ooooh.   Maybe he feels FAB-uloussssssss!!!!!!  My horse is kind of metro -- he can totally rock a pink saddle pad, and he likes having his hair done.   Alright, some ideas (some of which are already names of other horses that exist in other breeds, but it shouldn't matter).  Though I do like Legolas!  Stand and Deliver, Gestalt (yes, I'm a design nerd), Instant Karma, Out of Bounds, Night Out, No Inhibitions, Bada Bing, Outspoken, Fight Song, Own the Night, Chill Factor, Floored, Unapologetic, Once Again, By Invitation Only, Alliteration, To the Nines, Enthusiastic, Slow Burn, Art in Motion, Shoot the Moon, Thrill a Minute, High Definition, Bold Moves, Artful Move.  As you can see, I have SO many ideas.  If you want me to run with a theme, word, idea, etc, let me know!    OHHHHHH He's a Saddlebred!  No wonder I love him so much, I've been riding Saddlebreds for years.  Now that I look at him again, I can see it in his face.  Well, I'll think of some names!  And yes, it does look like he would have flunked out of "Saddlebred School" due to his movement, but what so many people don't realize is that Saddlebreds make great dressage, endurance, eventing, jumping, trail, EVERYTHING horses.  They may be the peacocks of the show ring, but they should be recognized as the peacocks of MANY show rings!  And he certainly won't have trouble flexing and putting his head in a nice spot for dressage.  I'm glad he found a home with you, he's going to have so much fun learning dressage!   What are the names of his sire/dam?  Sometimes that's a good way to name.  And what breed?  What do you intend to do with him?  Dressage?  This information must be known to achieve a truly kickass name. :)  Also, HE IS GORGEOUS!!!  He is soooooo floaty and beautiful!     I knew I loved tapirs, but now I know why.      YES.  Just...yesssssssssssssssssss.    Thanks for the well wishes.  She's actually doing really well, and I rode her a bit today!     You are both my heroes.   YOU get an upvote because you love forearms and, according to your username, HORSES!  I also love both these things.  I have two horses, I also have two forearms.  This cannot be coincidental.   We use Markell Insurance for both our horses.  Check it out at http://www.markelinsurance.com/Products/Farm/Pages/PrivateHorseOwnerLiability.aspx  I couldn't tell you off the top of my head what we pay for the insurance, but I know it varies depending on how much coverage you need, i.e. what your horse is "worth".  That depends on show record, age, etc.   They have good medical coverage, but now my mare has issues being covered on ANY equine insurance because of laminitis issues.    Great picture!  I'm there right now.  Last day in Venice today after living here for 6 weeks.  Sad day. :(      You are very, very unalone!  I crush on him all the time when I watch The IT Crowd.      I agree, Toalmaster is far more lady-bonerific than Channing Tatum.   You, rulefollower, are not only apparently an upstanding citizen, but also a very attractive man!  This should make it over to r/ladyboners.   I show Morgans, so I switch between huntseat (flat) and saddleseat, but I also do quite a bit of driving!     Oh my, yes.  There are so many things right with this picture.   No, you don't get to go in there, you're just outside the pens.  However, this is still close enough that I have been licked by a wolf and bit in the butt by and ostrich.    I would kill to see what you will do with mine.  I hope you find it in all these comments.     Check out http://www.volunteermatch.org/. You can search by your location and interests.  It's a pretty great site, and I've found some good things through their search.  Also, volunteering at Como Park is pretty fun -- I was on the grounds crew for a while, and planted and weeded by all the animal exhibits.  The giraffes totally loved me. :)         It's not in Hyde Park, but when I was in London I went riding at Wimbledon Village Stables.  My mom and I both rode and had a great experience.  They are proximate to a huge and beautiful park, with lots of wooded paths for hacking.  We got to canter through the forest on some nicely trained horses.  Also, it wasn't anywhere near $150.  We had a guide, and it was just the three of us (the guide, my mom, and I).  So we rode very much for our experience level.  Check them out!  If you can't find anything for Hyde Park, try them instead.  They are a short (20 min) train ride from London.  http://www.wvstables.com/   I remember always feeling bad for the kids with Rose Art crayons.  I was a very aware kindergartner.     I have Ariat Terrians http://www.ariat.com/English/Women/Footwear/EnduranceBoots/Terrain.html?color=SUNSHINE  They are incredibly comfortable, and have had the pair I'm currently using for 6+ years.  I wear them outside of the barn quite a bit too. :)  They are casual looking, so I suppose that has to be ok for you and your needs, but myself and my trainers all have these boots and love them.   Nice to know there's more than one of us on Reddit. :D  Though I'm primarily a Morgan rider, but dabble in Saddlebreds and Hackneys.   Awww yeah, and I don't even like cats!  Change that cat to a puppy and I'll need to change my undies.   I also demand more photos!  What a gorgeous horse!   Oh same.  We should have a St. Olaf subreddit for funsies.  Though I doubt it would be very active.   This scene was filmed at my college.  I had class in that lecture hall!   I see your pony and I raise you me (5'3") on a SMALLER pony!  http://i.imgur.com/SoLVO.jpg     I would snuggle the crap out of him.  And then make out with him copiously.  :)   I ride west of Schamburg in Marengo at Merriehill Farm.  It's about 45 minutes from you, and SO worth it!  They breed and train wonderful Morgan horses!  They do all seats there, and have a beautiful facility.  Lessons are $30, and I think you can do a package deal.  Also, they are wonderful people, and the trainer, Jess is the best!  They have an excellent string of lesson horses for all abilities. Give them a call!  http://merriehillfarm.com/ (watch the video!)   I want one.  Preferably in that tree.   I want a dapple grey Morgan park horse.  Of course, since there are under 500 registered grey Morgans, and most of those come from more western bloodlines, this may be impossible.  But hey, a girl can dream!  So...like this, but grey... :)  http://morganhorseauction.com/images//2009/CenterpieceREF.jpg   I want to snuggle him!!!   There is a movie with Robert Urich from the 90's called A Horse for Danny.  You can buy it crazy cheap on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Danny-Leelee-Sobieski/dp/B000A1IL8M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1330539605 sr=8-1  It is my favorite horse movie!  As a child, I was obsessed -- I think I wore out the copy they had at the video store, and my mom finally got me my own VHS of it.   As far as books, Walter Farley's "Man O' War" is great, even as I grow older, and there is a biography of Cigar called "Cigar: America's Horse" that is very well done.     I don't, but I'd love to try!  Also, yay for ASBs!    She is darling!   Have you videoed her yet?  I've found that when I see a horse for sale, even if there is a picture of them in motion, I have to see a video to really see how the horse moves.  So I would say a) a video of her doing her thing (jumping, trotting, etc) and then a video.  If it costs too much to list with a video on Dreamhorse, put the video on YouTube and link to it in her listing.     Want.  To.  Exist...   What a fabulous horse!  What is he?   Arab was my second guess!  That or Morab.  The stubborn ones are always lovable. :)  Do you still ride Arabs?   Are you riding a Morgan? Looks Morgan-y to me.  SUPER CUTE!!!!   Her sister in law has mad skills!      Awesome man!  As someone who has had 15 teeth pulled out of their mouth to make things right, I know how awesome your victory feels!   Eeeeee!  I give him an 11 out of 10!   See, when I was a kid I thought he was a chicken nugget with a face and a tie, I didn't know he was supposed to be a wrinkly old guy.  When I found out he was a real person it blew my mind.   She is cute, but also beeeeeyooootiful!  Welsh pony?   You could certainly drive in your arena, and learning to drive is part of the fun.  I'm sure someone could show you the ropes!   Hot man, cute dog!  And I love your bedsheets!  They are so pretty.   If you can't ride, could you drive?  I'm not sure if either of your horses know how to drive, and I wouldn't suggest trying to train them to do it yourself, but if a knowledgeable person can start them in harness locally, I'd bet they'd take to it quickly.  Driving can really help with your riding too, since you have to communicate through your hands and voice, and it gives you a great "feel" for a horse's mouth.  	56
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             since the dawn of humans   ;-)   well, what age were you when you realized that you WERE the gender you were assigned at birth?   kids are put on hormone therapy, kids are put on puberty blockers until they turn 18 and can decide for themselves if they want to transition or go off the blockers and let puberty take its course in the gender they were assigned at birth.   there's a link to the journal article itself and Brain is peer reviewed      yes they can be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    dont let the door hit ya, where the good lord slit ya  kthnxbai   prolly that she has a really good plastic surgeon                 	189
 I am quite new to Unity and I am creating a test 3d game. I am trying to use a texture I created but I realised Texture-Tiling is global. So I started importing the texture multiple times to change the amount of tiling. Is there a better way to do this?    I have a question, is this on an Australian server?   Can you give us more detail?   I almost killed myself while reading this.      *Complains about someone killing him when he drew his weapon first*   No, gas is for my V3S Submarine.   Give the recorder to someone else. So that person will hold on to it, and it won't come back.   They don't have a publisher, that's why they go to Kickstarter asking for money.   I guess, I mean if someone like EA were making this, I would believe it would come out.   Why's that?   *Too bad when the game comes out December 2016*   Any help would be appreciated.   That's the point of this picture, It's a TV Channel you can watch from all around of Australia I believe. it just displays a Windows Vista desktop. Too me it seems really creepy, mainly because of the static.   I am really confused about that comment too. Care to explain soggywaffles? Also yeah RecentIdiocy he is talking about Far Cry 4 at the beginning of the game you wait 10-15 minutes and the main antagonist comes back and finishes the game.    TV = "Television"   Any examples on when this happened? Just curios.   No one realised how weird that clothing combination is? A Ghillie Headwrap combined with a pink school girl dress. *Sexy*   Did it make you cry too?   Pretty sure that was The Purge.  	20
 Some of it is semantics - the law differs from country to country. In the US if you had like some kind of hippie love nest (no offense intended) it would be easier to organize it under corporate law than civil union law. In fact there are communes in California that are so incorporated.   A partnership is a contract, usually between two people - it can be a few more - about how to operate a business (or, in this hypothetical case, a household.) More people involve forming a corporation, where stock is issued and there are more set rules, a board of directors, etc.   They took a lot of the outer stone casing of the pyramids - they might have pilfered some of the larger building stones here and there, but not very many. At the time the pyramids were built a canal ran to the site at Giza and the course of the Nile was a good deal closer to the site than in the middle ages, making stone transport a good deal easier.   Yes, but your relationship with more than one other person is fundamentally corporate, not a partnership (I'm speaking in technical legal terms, not emotional ones.)   True... I might fall into that category at times. I consider Lacan a great philosopher but by no means perfect and he sometimes descended to charlatanism - a trait he shared with Freud...   I tried looking online, couldn't find them either. I saw them on a TV documentary on the pyramids a while back - BBC probably, but I can't remember the exact name. You might want to try to contact someone who's an expert on that time period in Egyptian history, probably a professor in Middle Eastern History, or, since they were European engravings, European cultural or art history.   In the engraving I saw (on TV admittedly), it looked like the sand came halfway up the side of the pyramid.    It does, but polyamory could be covered under corporate law (strange as that sounds!)   The "stolen lunch money" theory of Roman expansion is sadly under-appreciated.    Yes, that is how it's argued but the other purpose is there as well, people just don't like to talk about it.   I don't really see the connection. Quasars are phenomena of the early universe. The Quasar Period was long before any sort of life - at least life as we know it - could have evolved. There are no Quasar-like objects in nearby spacetime.   Since forever. The adjudicated mentally retarded and some other classes of adjudicated mentally ill are considered legal minors and are not allowed to wed. You may agree or disagree with this but it is the law most places. These are state and not federal laws though.   I support Universal Civil Unions and getting government out of the marriage business altogether. Every adult should be able to designate one other person as their legal "civil partner," which might be their marriage partner, or a sibling, or a best friend.  This makes any sort of gay vs. incest debate irrelevant and lets the State get back to more important business (hopefully.)   There are engravings from the Renaissance that show the Great Pyramid about half-buried in a sand-drift. No, nothing in orthodox Christianity or Islam says that biblical figures built the pyramids, but in demotic folk religion this belief was common. You will hear it from taxi drivers in Egypt to this day.   As for wanting to make a bigger structure, as I said, it was thought that the pyramids were the work of legendary figures so I doubt anyone thought it was possible. The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt did brag that the Great Lighthouse was a successor to the pyramids. At 450 feet tall it was almost as tall as the Great Pyramid though of course its volume was far less.   True. It did sound like she sent her daughter to a "progressive" school, not a traditional upper-crust or religious private school.   There used to be progressive public schools as well in some areas, but the standardized testing era put an end to most of them.   I know that for some of the time period in question a good deal of the pyramids were obscured in sand drifts.   However, it's wrong to suggest that people in previous times were not impressed by the pyramids. There were a good deal of legends about them, such as that they were built by biblical figures (usually Aaron, Moses or Mohammed), and that they could cure ailments.   As the pyramids were seen as the creations of legendary figures, not ordinary men, their vast size was somewhat taken for granted. In that sense people in those times might have been less impressed than modern people as to the immensity of the achievement.   As someone who teaches in one of those "disasters" I can tell you the admin is even more scared of lawsuits because they have no money. As soon as a lawyer shows up we roll over and give the parents whatever they want, no matter how ridiculous.  And in most of the country, the church school is the only private school option. Seeing as we both seem to have the same opinion of church schools, you may want to consider where all those kids will go if you succeed in demolishing the "government" schools.   Keep in mind not all Lacanians are Zizek fans.   You will find a lot of private schools with endowments that don't really care what parents think - they will always have a line out the door for the snoot factor.  Then there's church-funded schools which also have powerful constituencies that are often indifferent to parent needs.   In my experience public schools are often over-sensitive to parent demands because of a fear of lawsuits or a nasty story on the local news.   She thinks the bullying and political correctness will be less in a private school? Maybe so, but I doubt it.   The golden number is aesthetically pleasing to humans, so it makes sense that a building would be designed that way even if the mathematics behind it wasn't known. I don't know about the meter stuff but they definitely degenerated into "History" Channel tabloid nonsense at the end so I wouldn't give it much credibility.      this is not about Aliens, or any mystical lines and such.  Positing an advanced ancient civilization that had modern or even super-modern technology levels is just as much of a stretch.   I'm not familiar with all the stuff in this movie, but the pi stuff at least was explaining long ago: the Egyptians used circular measuring tools instead of rulers, so pi shows up "naturally" in their structures.      There's a house where I used to live that was half-finished by one of those remodeling shows. For some reason the producers cancelled the episode that family was going to be in and they just abandoned the place and left the family homeless. It was all over the local news and papers and there was fundraising for the family. I don't know whatever became of it because I moved around that time.   You might want to check out the book Weird NJ you might find it in there. I don't remember an abandoned cult town but there was an abandoned town built for midgets complete with tiny houses. I don't have the book anymore or I would look it up for you.   Yep. I've found that people in the South are polite until they find out who you "really are." Then the ugly comes out reeeaaal fast.   No, that's not accurate. The ancient Romans made pasta.   Apparently it's realizing how the dual and non-dual aspects of reality arise from each other, but I am no expert on such subtle states!   If this is the ultimate realization, I'm not interested. Suffering seems pleasurable compared to the spiritual lobotomy this guy apparently suffered.   Others say the non-dual experience is important but it is not the final experience. That seems more likely - and more like a goal worth attaining.   There was a biology professor who did a study that concluded there simply isn't enough nutrition in the NW forests to support a population of large primates unless they came down to the salmon runs, in which case they certainly would have been clearly documented already.  Can't find a link to the study I think it was on a documentary where I heard this professor speaking. University of Washington maybe? If anyone has more info please post.   Awesome response, thanks. Very thorough.   I know the feeling. Just beware that when you meditate sometimes small sensations can seem very amplified because your mind is quiet. I am not sure if chakras are "real" or not in a spiritual sense but I have been disappointed by these experiences in the long run - they seem to be leading to something great then it just fades.   On the other hand some other mediators report quite impressive things that happen after the whole chakra/kundalini experience. I guess what I'm saying is don't get your hopes too high just yet but don't dismiss it either.   Nice, but beware of sensations that are just fabrications of the mind. I have these experiences every now and then as well but don't assume they can be used for healing.    CIA is testing new mind-control rays...         Right, but that was still a bunch of the current plates stuck together. My question was do the plates themselves change over time, not just their positions on the Earth.   I know the oceanic plates get subducted and new ones form, but are the continental plates permanent? Can they split apart, merge, or be subducted as well?    No, the "shocking" part was apparently that Voltaire was against metaphysics and that Godel believed (in his delusional period) that there was a conspiracy to hide these works of Leibniz.   There was interesting stuff in this video, but I feel I have to downvote because:  1.) There was nothing "shocking" in the video whatsoever.  2.) It veered into conspiracy theory nonsense and is apparently part of a huge video series on the "secret history" of the Earth  3.) Ouch, the music!   If you can't find it there are services that convert a YouTube page to an mp3 file.               Interesting. But then why can you be killed by drinking salt water?   Didn't he ever consider that the road atlas in Episode 1 was arranged alphabetically? That would be a much more common-sense reason for an obscure town starting with "Ab..." to be the first entry.   The "absolutist relativism" that is so often attributed to Postmodernists can be easily destroyed as a coherent concept by any halfway with-it college freshman, and already has been many times of course.  However, you'd be hard-pressed to find an actual "Postmodern" philosopher who actually held or holds such an extreme position, it's more of a straw-man position ascribed to these philosophers by their opponents.   Part of the problem is there was never a coherent philosophical school called "Postmodernism," no Manifesto with bullet points nailing down specific beliefs, or anything like that, because after all, what could be more anti-Postmodern than a Manifesto?   So therefore it's hard to point to any ideas that are specifically "Postmodern" in nature. It is/was more of a mood of epistemological skepticism and a style of argumentation than a defined set of positions.      From what i've been told, taxes are unreal in America. What is all that tax money going towards?  Have you seen our awesome military? Also, bloated medical costs and the rich/corporations avoiding taxes through loopholes and outright fraud.   None of the people on trial were in the documentary. In fact the documentary didn't even mention Birmingham. The BBC was baffled not only that the judge banned the doc but banned them from even saying why or who had banned it. That's downright Orwellian.   Edit: And for people who were saying it was only banned until the trial ended, there have been 10-year-plus trials in the past, and we have a government in the US that invented the infinite, undeclared war in order to bypass the Constitution, I can easily see the UK government inventing never-ending trials in order to do the same.      I can see city-states like Singapore doing this in case their local geopolitical neighborhood goes to hell and they can no longer get reliable food imports.    Ah, you know little about alternate universes. *The photograph always changes too* (cue spooky music)         Quite true. Still not sure it belongs on the suicide-prevention go-to list, but your larger point is well taken.      True, but see my comment above to zoidberg   The Federalist Papers (Anti-Federalist Writings preferred)  Haha, was this in there to see if anyone was paying attention? Or do you have a serious reason for recommending it?   Yikes, I will never call myself "depressed" again after reading that.   Google "Hitler's Second Book"   Correct, but the conventional wisdom is that he was trying to contact those in the government who had been pro-German before the war and would be most open to a peace treaty. Besides any peace treaty between Britain and Hitler would be a de facto alliance since if Hitler could have purchased goods or obtained loans from the vast British empire, his chances of winning the war would have been greatly enhanced.   There are several good sources in the Rudolph Hess wikipedia article under "motives for trip" - and one horrible one, a conspiracy theory book published by "Ancient Aliens" type people who claimed the Hess who flew to Britain was a body double  and the real Hess stayed in Germany (!!).  Of course there is also Hess's own statement (under a pseudonym after landing) that he was a friend of the [Duke of Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton#World_War_II.2C_the_Hess_Affair.2C_and_after), and later on that the purpose of his flight was to negotiate a secret peace treaty. Hitler certainly believed that's what Hess was up to and ordered him shot on sight if he returned to Germany (although he may have changed his mind in the highly unlikely even that he returned with a treaty in hand!)   I have noticed this too. However, it is not universal. The fans in my place now go 0 1 2 3 0 (there are two off settings.)    Yes, in fact he wanted an alliance with Britain against the US, where he thought the Aryan blood had been too corrupted by Jews, "Negroes," and other inferior types. And also he thought that two "Continental" powers would always be antagonistic, whereas a "Continental" and a "Maritime" power could work together. He saw both Germany and the US as continental but the British Empire as Maritime. All this and more bonkers geopolitics can be found in [Hitler's second book](http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Second-Book-Unpublished-Sequel/dp/1929631618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1342462243 sr=8-1 keywords=hitler%27s+second+book) as well as some passages in the original Mein Kampf.  Some people in Britain, by the way, thought about an alliance with Hitler. It wasn't just a one-sided love affair. How many people in Britain and how much influence they had in the country is a matter of debate, but Rudolf Hess was almost certainly trying to contact these elements when he flew to the UK in 1941.   What is the distinction between Ur and Sumeria?      Quite right, but you would not expect the kind of correlation that Paulides is claiming. You might expect to find several kids who took their clothes off, and several others who hiked great distances, and several others who couldn't remember what happened to them. What you wouldn't expect to find are clusters where *all* of these things happened to multiple subjects without there being a causative etiology (which is a fancy way of saying, something other than random "patterns" in the data.)         Actually, Paulides is a bigfoot investigator, and probably first heard about these cases while interviewing park rangers about bigfoot. He tries hard to keep the areas of his life separate because he doesn't want to be the "crazy bigfoot guy" who also does missing-persons cases, but his Amazon page gives him away.  Still, the pattern of cases is no myth and they can be verified in local newspapers and police reports. They could use an advocate with better credibility than Paulides. He is ex-law enforcement but whether it's fair or not, his involvement with bigfoot will make many people immediately discount his other work which is unfortunate.   Right, but that 1/3 was down from nearly 90% before the Civil War.      A hundred years ago, a large percentage of women were homemakers.  "homemaking" was a hard job and often included much child care and farmwork. Yes, people still have kids today, but caring for nine or ten as compared to one or two is quite different. Today hardly anyone cares for nine or ten kids without it being an employed position (teacher, child care center worker, etc.) I would not count the housewives of the 19th century as being "unemployed" in the modern sense.   Sort of correct. The tractor and mechanical thresher did force millions of farm workers off the land. They moved to the cities though and found industrial work in the factories which were booming, but when the 1930's depression hit they could not just "go back to the farms" like city-dwellers had done in previous downturns. That's when the starvation and homelessness started.  It's interesting to read about the Great Depression in France where smallholdings, gov't policy and social customs limited farm automation. The Depression was less severe in France (though still bad) because many laid-off workers simply went back to the family farm.   I assume we're not planning on digging mass graves  Don't assume so quickly. I've been reading Ben Franklin's accounts of his trips to England. He had conversations with the upper class where they openly discussed how to start a big war to get rid of the excess population. Eventually they decided (economically) forced emigration to North America and later (legally) forced emigration to Australia were better options, but they considered mass graves. I'm not so sure things are too different today.   It doesn't really matter. If the LLC you created defaults on the mortgage, the lenders still repossess the house. Besides most mortgage lenders use standardized contracts and I doubt they would lend to an LLC.  Someone more experienced in these matters, feel free to correct me though.   No, the one guy specifically said it had aired on PBS and that "you could watch it" (presumably online.) The two guys looked kind of weird themselves and I was too chicken to butt in to their conversation!         It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" and exempted from laws which would have made her throw it out. (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.  Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? I tried asking r/documentaries. Two people had seen it, one thought he remembered the title as "Mad City Tannenbaum," but I couldn't find any reference to that title online. The other could not remember the title.  Further details: The two people talking knew this woman personally, and she seemed to have some mental problems but also some political influence.   That's illegal two different ways (stock manipulation and libel), but as long as you don't broadcast your plans on the Internet, sounds like a good scheme...   Good point. However it seems like most of the people on here are into sociology or social psychology, not the interpretation of dreams. I think you would find more experts over there.   Probably represents the subconscious or something like that. Try r/psychology instead.      You're the Zombie Lenin, get on that job.   Why did they keep making payments on their car? It's not like the repo man was going to come knocking on their door.  If you stop making car payments, the lender gives your license plate number to the police. Especially with the increasing numbers of police departments with automatic plate-scanners mounted on their cruisers, you will probably be found.  Edit: Oh, and I forgot, it is also possible that you will be charged with stealing the car. In your car loan it says if you can't make the payments you must immediately surrender the vehicle. Technically, the bank owns the car until you make the last payment. Trust me, stopping car payments is not a good idea. Better to sell the car and get something cheaper if possible.   There were really two economies in colonial America, one in the South and in Latin America that was more like the old world with huge landholdings and slavery/serfdom. The other was in the North and was really anomalous in world history at least since the early Roman expansion in that ordinary people could and did become landholders, often large landholders.  You can look at the political map of the US in recent elections to see that this divide is still with us to some extent.   was simply the marketplace trying its best to shrink the amount of people competing for work in a post-industrial setting?  more the government than the marketplace, but yes. The other main "method of attack" on this economic dislocation was to create "perceived needs" for goods that people "didn't know they wanted." This is more of a marketplace function.  What happens in 100 years if only 10 percent of the planet needs to be employed to adequately fill the market's labor uses?  Ask your Uncle Karl. Also, there will probably be an effort to bring the population down by discouraging children except among the "chosen."      Remember that 16? It's now your tax dollars.       #3232;\_ #3232; will be an official option.    Conde Nast sells it to Facebook or some other incompetent company that tries to "integrate" reddit with its existing product and fails miserably.   I ask this because the other day I walked into a restaurant with my girlfriend. The maitre d' station was unmanned and beyond it was just a stairway leading down underground. We knew the place was open because I could hear rock music and people talking plus normal restaurant sounds (plates, glasses, etc.) coming from downstairs.   But... there was creepy clown stuff everywhere on the walls in the entranceway and leading down the stairwell. I could also see the edge of a jukebox downstairs and this frightened me too for some reason. I am not afraid of clowns in the least and neither is the gf but something told us to get the hell out of there and we did.   We had to walk blocks and blocks to find another restaurant and now I feel somewhat embarrassed at being such a chicken and running away from a restaurant because of clown stuff on the walls. By the menu outside it looked like they had good food and beer too.   On the other hand, we might have just barely avoided being chopped to pieces by killer clowns. It got me to thinking, who here has had the strong instinct to leave a place for no specific reason but ignored that instinct? What happened then (good or bad)?     Can't find anything by that or any similar name. Do you remember when or where you saw it?   This sounds more like the legendary origin of the [Hata Clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hata_clan) as opposed to the Yamato (Imperial line.). They were supposedly descended from the Qin Emperor who did indeed have an obsession with immortality. Unlike today's obession with "purity," many Japanese clans of the early historical periods proudly claimed (or invented) foreign lineage to make themselves seem more prestigious.   I've always had a soft spot for the Polynesian theory but I must admit most of the recent evidence is against it.  I still think there's a Polynesian influence on Japanese architecture - perhaps spread by merchants which became a prestige form - and on the pronunciation if not the underlying grammar and root syllables of the language. I can't prove any of this, it's just a semi-educated hunch. I used to think Japanese was most likely an Altaic-Polynesian trade creole but this seems increasingly unlikely, especially with the discovery of proto-Japanese forms in Korea.   I think it's pretty well-established that the Imperial line originated with a well-organized and warlike tribe in the Yamato region around 300 AD. Sure, they probably had ancestors on the Korean peninsula 1,500 years before that, but it wasn't like they were a "foreign" dynasty *recently* imported from Korea, a la the Normans in England.   Possibly a sonic boom caused by a micro-meteorite? Just a guess. Metallic grinding noise could have been the rock disintegrating by atmospheric friction.    [Socks are well-known for their inter-dimensional qualities...](http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/90s-ren-and-stimpy-stimpy-invention-u-pick-clip.html)   Derivation of the Poisson Distribution formula and its statistics. I have to re-memorize it every year in case a student asks to see it, which someone does about half the time.   Cool, I've never heard of these before. Thanks.   IIRC, 90% is the upper limit for Korean ancestry of the modern Japanese, not the lower limit. Estimates range from 60-90%, with the remainder being "Jomon" in origin.   Well, if the Japanese are Altaic in some distant respect, the Altaic languages were thought to originate in Siberia, as were the Amerindian languagues. It's quite a stretch though to connect the two, other than through some very basic elements such as Shamanism which is widespread throughout all of E. Asia and the New World.   would be a strong indication that a people migrated in from that neighbor.  *Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin.   No, we eat far less. I remember reading that the average farm laborer in Ireland the 19th century consumed up to 10,000 calories per day. This was part of the reason so much of the population was rural: Farmers ate a good deal of the calories they produced, leaving much less of a surplus than today.   you can trace the migration of Koreans into Japan from the spread of cultivated chestnut trees and later through the introduction of different rice strains   A common misconception. The spread of a material culture does not always imply the spread of large numbers of immigrant peoples. The same rice culture spread from China to Korea, and the Chinese and Koreans are genetically distinct.  There is a strong argument to be made that the Japanese and Koreans are closely related, but not based on the sort of evidence you site.    This is because the author knows nothing of America below the elite 1%.  quickly followed by...  quite unlike their saw-handling knife-juggling fire-eating American redneck counterparts, for many of whom a greasy fast-food burger and a beating at the hands of a semi-drunk parent before bed will comprise the best coddling they can hope for.   the hypocrisy, it burns...      Assuming you're serious... I'm sure if you traveled back in time you would find that Spartans had a greater pain tolerance than other Greeks, but that would be a cultural difference, not genetic. Probably the same story with the Japanese. They are certainly culturally and linguistically unique, but genetically they don't form a separate population.   As for the intestines stuff, I've never head this before, but it sounds dubious. Move to Denver and in a decade you'll have larger lungs. Doesn't make Colorodans a special race of being.   True. Americans of recent generations aren't really used to hearing foreign languages spoken so commonly. There's a sort of instinctive paranoid reaction of "oh, I'll bet they're talking about us." Growing up in a rural area I found this attitude a lot. If an immigrant was seen to be making an effort to speak and learn English, he was accepted a lot faster than if he was seen in public speaking his native language.      Not to mention he was quite racist even compared to the standards of his own time, which is saying something. "Mediterranean" people (like, Italians) disgusted him and of course he was terrified of "Negroes." A lot of this comes out in his writing where this xenophobia gets sublimated into actual "alien" creatures from other worlds.    Presumably, with a better economy relative to other rich nations at that point, the US will be able to attract still more immigrants.   Yep. I read an opinion somewhere that really stuck with me: A person is only a true, ideological "racist" if he would rather have a family of hillbillies for a neighbor than, say, Colin Powell. Few people these days would make that trade.   Tried that, didn't work. I'm starting to think this woman merely claimed she had a documentary made... on the other hand someone on here remembers seeing it (he thinks). Grr...   That's one of the things they were talking about, that it still had electric decorations on it and they were afraid it would catch on fire. I got from the gist of the conversation that the woman in the documentary is more than a little crazy.         I'm thinking specifically of four bubbles:  Japan in the late 80's.  The US in the mid-2000's.  Spain in the late 2000's.  (Perhaps) China currently.   It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.  Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online?   Actually I found downloading the update fixed the glitchiness netflix had been plagued with recently, and it isn't doing any of these things on my wii. Which version wii do you have?   I agree. I personally don't believe that AP is "real" as in scientifically real (it would seem so easy to get hard evidence if it was - just put random words on a piece of paper inside a locked room or something), but nevertheless it is "real" in the realm of experience, and I find it fascinating.  Personally I think AP is a kind of lucid dream but one where the dreamworld is a replication of the room where you went to sleep and it is not easy to change which is a different sort of experience from a normal lucid dream. I had one such lucid dream in college where I wandered around my dorm, then "fell" through a wall and ended up on the street outside. Unfortunately, then I woke up so I didn't get to further explore the experience.                     It's amazing what you can get if you write your congressman... especially if there's a check in the letter. Just ask the Moonies.               [Link is here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyQSzx0ofto feature=related). What do you guys think? I've seen claims like this before but only in the back pages of magazines (like the scammy ROM machine.)      Too bad the online version of the book doesn't have this symbol on it, or maybe I just haven't read far enough yet.      I've always thought that the utilitarian and contractualist ethical schools can be reconciled, at least in part, by adopting the [geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) rather than the better-known [arithmetic mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) as the measure of aggregate utility.   That way, a single person in total privation (like the girl in the Le Guin story who must be tortured in order to provide Utopia for everyone else) would set the measure back to zero.      Or a chip in their ear connected to a guy with a laptop. I think the ease of cheating might eventually destroy chess and make something like Go more popular.   I'm thinking it was in a book - maybe "Outliers" or "Talent is Overrated"   Correct, that 52% is arrived at by counting all words that appear in a given text exactly once. If a non-standard word like "deletable" appears once, it counts just as much as the word "person" which might appear 30 times.  Edit: I just discovered that the Firefox dictionary at least *does* know the word "deletable."   There was a study I read about (can't remember where), which measured the IQs of chess grandmasters, and the mean IQ was actually subnormal to a statistically significant degree. Not terribly so, it was somewhere in the mid 90's, but it put paid to the myth of the chess "genius."   Apparently these grandmasters had spent so much time focusing on such a narrow skill (often from a very early age), that their wider reasoning skills had never developed properly.   Could at least partially explain all that Bobby Fisher conspiracy theory madness. Chess doesn't drive one mad directly, it merely makes shabby intellects believe that they are geniuses in fields they know nothing about.                     If you are in reasonably good shape and pace yourself, kayaking isn't that tiring. You can just drift and paddle to steer, you don't have to paddle like a madman like in competitive kayaking.      The Halloween alternate-reality strip. There is a link in the article, I believe.      Yes, that's what I meant.   It's always been great where I live. I dread the future where I will have to pay FedEx $50/mo. for the privilege of getting my mail while of course my taxes go down not a bit, but unfortunately that's probably in my (American) future.         Morse code      Sounds like the Iron Masks case...   That's not even close to the worst that could happen.  Yep. Back in the landline era, you could get your "lines crossed" and end up listening to someone else's conversation. My mom heard two guys talking about how they were going to defraud some company of millions of dollars. It was no joke they were later on the news being arrested by the FBI.   That's what they always do with the nutty coalition partners in parliamentary governments, make them the tourism minister.      Yeah, same here, and in my opinion the "Lab Animal" was even scarier and the "Pandora's Box" was mighty creepy too. That whole book is still seared into my memory. Major childhood trauma!!      In theory. I'll guess that doesn't actually happen very often. As school discipline is opaque by law (at least in the US, don't know about Canada for sure), the public can't know how this policy is actually being implemented. This is to push up graduation rates, it happens in the US all the time. In many districts the lowest grade you can get for a mark is a 50 even if you never attend class once. That way, you can still "make up" the grade and get to passing by the end of the year.               Yeah, 2000 calories per day is "starving" you. Maybe if you're an athlete. Not if you're a lazy fatass who sits in a hospital bed all day.  Depending on how fat these people are, 2000/day might be a pretty significant calorie deficit even if they are just sitting in bed. Larger mass bodies do take more calories just to keep everything "ticking over." This can be an advantage to weight loss, actually, the fat works in your favor in the beginning, but if a person feels forced into it I can easily see it setting off a panic response (which is why "fat camps" for kids rarely work...)   I've put a coffee cup down on a table, and watched it rotate as if pushed by the handle.  This can happen when you get moisture on the bottom of the cup, I've played around with this phenomenon on glass tabletops a few times.  As for the other stuff, yeah, I'd be interested in that self post!   Try active noise-cancelling headphones, they go around your ear. As long as you don't need to sleep on your side, you'll barely feel them. Some are battery-operated too, so no need for a cord. They can be a bit expensive, however.    Right, but declaring bankruptcy destroys your credit, so if you have the income, just paying the loan is the better option in the long run, and if you don't have the income, you're never going to get that much credit.   If you have the income, why aren't you just paying your loan? Is it worth the opportunity cost of defaulting on credit cards and going bankrupt? I guess maybe some people don't think that far ahead.           But that would be fraud  How would it be fraud? Credit card cash advances are unsecured debt. However, good luck getting a cash advance large enough to pay off a student loan.   It is a local thing. Outside of NY, people still say "in line," though I have noticed an insidious rise in the British "queue," mainly written though, not spoken, and mainly in places that want to act snooty. That's how these language changes often start though.      I think Y(t)/t converges to 1. My reasoning is:  Given the Law of Large Numbers:  E[Y(t)]~=E[sum(x)]  E[Y(t)]~=n*E(x)  E[Y(t)]~=n*mu  E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n*mu/sum(x)  E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n * mu/(n * mu)  E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=1     Y(t) will grow without bound as t goes to infinity. It doesn't have an asymptote. You will always need more and more instances of x (over the long run) for their sum to surpass higher and higher bounds of t.   This isn't a very interesting question the way you've worded it which makes me think you might have missed something in the question. Can you go back to your HW and copy out the problem exactly as it is worded?   Good reply, thanks.  	186
 video games are highly addictive because they are psychologically gratifying--as in, you get immediate rewards and feedback constantly. to state that just because someone of one gender is immune to this mental response is unfortunately misplaced sexism. this means, if properly exposed, any girl can like games. So "hot or not" is on a case-by-case basis, just like it would be with any male gamer, which as it is easy to imagine represent all ends of the aesthetic spectrum.   source: girl gamer. worked at one of the top girly fashion magazine for awhile.

If you're talking on your phone instead of serving me my food; complaining to a coworker about how much you hate being at work instead of checking out my groceries; etc, you're annoying as hell.

Sorry. That's how it works.   Precisely.    It was a tongue-in-cheek, rhetorical question based upon the fact that most Mexicans show little interest in adapting, and want the U.S. to be more like Mexico.   If one dresses, speaks, and acts a certain way, they are labeled as such in my mind.  In my city (Baton Rouge, LA; but New Orleans is worse), GENERALLY SPEAKING, blacks are lazy, low-work-ethic, governmental-freeloaders who do nothing but leech off the system while not contributing.

 He could face a civil trial, but the opportunity for a criminal prosecution is past now, isn't it?     No, I think that there's a clear conflict of interest to have prosecutors prosecuting their policeman colleagues, whatever the race of the victim and policeman.   In this case, the black officer got off for the same reason that Darren Wilson did.  In both cases, it needs to stop.  We need to eliminate this glaring conflict of interest.  My comment about "McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force" was a retort to captrockwelltorrey, who implied that because McCulloch is a Democrat, that somehow exonerates him of favoring the police officer in the Wilson/Brown case.  I was merely pointing out that while McCulloch might be a Democrat, one could make the (equally non-sequiturial) counter-argument that he's white.  I might have more clearly stated my objection with "WTF does him being a Democrat have to do with anything??"  Anyway, that is what I meant.    Contraband search rate:      White: 6.85%     Black: 12.13%  Contraband hit rate:      White: 34.04%     Black: 21.71%  That is racism.  The fact that you aren't convinced says more about your disposition than about the facts.    Because there is a news article documenting each racist cop in Ferguson, right?   These statistics demonstrate things pretty convincingly, but I'm sure you'll still be unconvinced.  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/how-much-racial-profiling-happens-in-ferguson/378606/    and at least partly racist, police force,   Source?  [Officer Dan Page](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/more-audio-surfaces-dan-page-racist-rant-end-times )    So your argument here boils down to "Racist white people" and "Conspiracy"?  WTF?     To the contrary, McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force, betrayed his role as prosecutor, which is to present a case which argues for trial.  In fact, [almost *all* grand juries decide to indict, except when the defendant is a police officer](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ ).  That's not some strange statistical coincidence - it's the expected, obvious outcome when cops are prosecuted by their direct colleagues.                    This is true for almost every article on the NYTimes.  Once you reach the limit of articles for the month, you can't read more unless you put your browser in "private" mode.      Everyone left Slashdot  precisely because of over-zealous moderation, and it's ruining the experience here too.   So r/politics has gotten to the point of blocking the NYTimes now too?    doesn't that indicate to you - as an attorney - that the evidence that the officer did anything culpably wrong was essentially non-existent?  No.  When the defendant is an officer of the law, grand juries frequently *fail* to indict, unlike what happens with everyone else.  So, what happened in this case is  the rule, not the exception.  Regular people go to court, officers get off: http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/   The obvious explanation is that the massive conflict of interest in having your colleague frame the case for your grand jury is producing the expected result.  And that's why there's so much furor over this case --- everyone knows that officers aren't accountable to the law.                   Are Christians more violent than Muslims?  [What do the statistics say?](https://abagond.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/are-christians-more-violent-than-muslims/ )      If I understand correctly, you're proposing to use charitable donations essentially as a form of brand advertising.  The question you should ask is: what are your goals?  Are you trying enhance your brand's reputation?  Or do you need to boost short term sales?  Charity is pretty much guaranteed to perform worse for the second purpose.  As an entrepreneur, you understand that resources are limited, and your route to success depends on getting maximum ROI.    Are you sure your business is at a point where building brand value is more important than expanding the business or boosting sales?  It all depends on the growth profile of your business, and how much brand value is important, and how much giving to a particular charity can improve that.  If you decide in the affirmative, I'd look at this as a kind of advertising campaign.  Will the charity give your business exposure to the right audience?  Will you get constant exposure, or a one-time promotion?  How many eyeballs will you reach?  Over what time?  What are the demographics of the people who will be exposed to the message about your support?  Will they understand what your company does and why they might be interested in the product?  How will you measure success?  What metric will you use to decide to continue the campaign or not?  How long do you have to run the campaign to see the result?    Long running brand awareness campaigns, are harder things to measure than more focused forms of advertising.  20% is a healthy chunk of profits - I don't have figures, but I'd hazard a guess that this level of spending on charity is extremely rare.  Why do you think that is?  My guess is that the market is doing ROI calculations - large businesses with excess cash can afford to spend what to them are small amounts to get a large outcome in terms of brand perception.   My guess is that you're running a relatively small business, so you're going to be spending a lot more, and getting less of the charity's promotional efforts.  Probably not a good deal.  Now, there are probably some good counter examples to what I've said - public radio, for instance, but that is a very particular case.  First and foremost, the "charity" is actually a form of media, and has an actual audience, so this kind of spending is very much like a traditional ad buy.    **TL;DR Don't do it.**   In the middle of winter?   We do get a lot of angry Arabs and muslims out of it.  Go figure - those people are so irrational!  /s   **Submission Statement**  A relatively recent finding by a professor of literature suggests that Mary Shelley's classic was not entirely an original idea.      **Submission Statement**  There's a lot of blame going around castigating the entire community in Ferguson because of some unreliable witnesses.  It's worth remembering what scientists say about the topic --- witness testimony is notoriously unreliable.      At least he can go back to his other job now - hectoring black people about how to behave.   Wait, before we condemn an entire community, how many people were "just repeating what they heard"?   Inference based on reddit username.  That's deep. How did you become so wise?   No, the opposite.   He supports the Palestinian people against the widely acknowledged human rights abuses of the Israeli.  A rock solid liberal position.   America is so backwards.  Carter was the best President of the last 4 decades, genuinely committed to betterment of the world unlike those who followed him.   Independent doesn't necessarily mean centrist.  It can mean disgust with both parties, and that is at an all time high right now.   The Democrats stand for pretty much the same neoliberal policies as the Republicans at this point.  A Hillary nod will only cement that understanding.                                       Doesn't make sense. Charity is directly at odds with the Libertarian philosophy of self-interest.   The title is incorrect. Solyndra was a loss, but...     the program that included Solyndra is, in fact, on track to return profits of $5 billion or more.

Here's a non-partisan link that explains, with a cartoon, even, how insurance works: http://marheninsurance.com/how-insurance-works/  Sorry, man - looks like you're one of those victims of Republican talking points that Gruber is talking about.   TIL; the only valid laws are constitutional amendments.   No, he said that "the stupidity of the American voter" required that the law be unclear about what insurance actually is.  ANY solvent insurance plan requires that healthy people pay in more than they take out than sick people.  That is what a fucking insurance plan actually *is*.  But since Republicans turn everything into a political issue, even that simple fact which follows from logic is somehow a scandal.  Yes, to Republicans it's a huge scandal.  The rest of the world calls this "insurance".  So, yes, he was right on the money:  people who are swayed by Republican talking points are in fact stupid.

You should write a book.    The Koch bros are not the running the GOP and have NO influence over the Tea Party. They are free to support any policies they wish but that has no bearing on how the Right votes.  Now I know I'm being trolled.    Part of the standard Obama playbook - make statements placating the base while running a government that does the opposite.   Seriously?    The GOP is carrying out the Koch agenda, and their agenda is pretty clear: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers    * Repeal of federal campaign finance laws - means that politicians serve the wealthy, and resulting in the US becoming [a de facto oligarchy](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy ).   * Reduction of social services, which reduces the bargaining power of labor.  This results in lower wages and workers rights.     * Against laws that police corporations, but none focused on reducing policing of regular people.  The result of this kind of policy is that corporate profits and property get state protection, but the freedom and rights of regular people aren't protected.     Yet, at the same time that conservatives seek special rights and protection for the owners of property, they want to abridge personal freedoms of regular people:    * DOMA   * Reagan's War on Drugs (which right wing Dems shamefully perpetuated)   * Anti-Abortion regulations   * Anti-athiest laws   * Anti-union laws: http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/g-o-p-platform-seeks-to-weaken-powers-of-unions/?_r=0  The list is so long, it's almost  silly to respond.    Yet, those are the results of conservative policy.   Don't worry, we all prefer corporations controlling our lives.   **Submission Statement**  A NYTimes piece that goes in depth into the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court's decision to take up the challenge to Obamacare.  In fact, everything from the decision of SCOTUS to take up the case when precedent was largely being set by the lower courts to the details of the specific legal issue itself suggest a truly unprecedented action.  Which the author argues is worse, legally speaking, than what happened in Bush v. Gore.            I mean in this sense - economic egalitarianism is a central concept of classical liberal left libertarianism.  That is, obviously, also a central theme of Warren's politics.  Checkout the entry in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Classical_liberal_left-libertarianism.     Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka, and David Ellerman root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and appropriation. They hold that it is  for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others, a condition John Locke explicated in Two Treatises of Government. Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long doing so satisfies the proviso that there remains "enough, and as good, left in common for others."             Hahah - fake Indian.  You are funny.  Please tell more jokes.      By those metrics, wouldn't we conclude that countries with more government programs -- European-style democracies -- are better models?   How about self-reported "satisfaction with life" measurements?   **Submission Statement**  Penned by the Directory of Duke's Islamic Studies department, this article talks about the Muslim way of asking how you are doing:   Kayf haal-ik? or, in Persian, Haal-e shomaa chetoreh? How is your haal?   What is this haal that you inquire about? It is the transient state of ones heart. In reality, we ask, How is your heart doing at this very moment, at this breath? When I ask, How are you? that is really what I want to know.        Agree with everything you say here.  So can the various sides can agree on desired outcomes?  It may be that this just moves the problem to a different place, but I think, it's a more honest approach.    You suggested "Human flourishing".  That seems like a good starting point that probably both left and right can agree on.  So how would we quantify it?  What would we accept as evidence that one system or another leads to the desired outcome?      She's left libertarian, but in America, Libertarian usually refers to the right-wing version.   Rights don't have any basis in physical reality - they are just rules that are made up to support a particular way of life. We don't have a right to land ownership anymore than a beaver has a "right" to dam a river.   So talking about rights is essentially meaningless - or a way of forcing agreement through assertion.  Rather than ask what rights people have - because anyone could assert anything, and they have: a right to healthcare, a right to move freely anywhere, a right to enslave. If we insist on basing a discussion on rights, there's no way to get agreement, unless the participants already agree about the same set of rights. It makes a lot more sense to ask what outcomes we'd like to have, and figure out what rules will support that form of life.

Yet polls show broad support for core progressive issues, even in red states.  http://mediamatters.org/research/progmaj/  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-shows-americans-oppose-entitlement-cuts-to-deal-with-debt-problem/2011/04/19/AFoiAH9D_story.html  http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/blog/entry/its-a-sweep-voters-raise-the-minimum-wage-in-four-states-and-two-cities/  http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2014-11-08/majority-georgia-voters-support-increase-minimum-wage  http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/blog/2014/11/despite-voter-support-wisconsin-minimum-wage.html?page=all   Both parties are equally elitist.  The only difference is whether the people are told vicious lies or sweet ones.   Wow - that is pretty damning.     Turnout is about enthusiasm.                          **Submission Statement**  A list of almost horrifying accidents that we nearly averted, including a scenario not unlike that portrayed in the movie "War Games".  The article is an abridged timeline from Eric Schlosser's book, command-and-control.                                          Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a catch all for many different things.  I can guarantee you that some of them are immune related, because I've done this exact test.    There's no blood test to confirm gluten sensitivity  If you have gluten allergy, you can get some confirmation with a RAST test, which measures serum IgE.  That is, you can get a RAST test for Wheat and compare it with something you're pretty sure you're not allergic to, and see the difference.      **Submission Statement**  Fascinating story of the controversial finding of Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith.  They are back with more evidence.  It's long, but worth the read.                                       http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-online-secrets/201409/internet-trolls-are-narcissists-psychopaths-and-sadists                        She was clear about her goals back in 1992:  ["For goodness sake, you cant be a lawyer if you dont represent banks."](http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/07/15/hrcs-candid-motto-for-democratic-party-represent-banks/ )  And last year, she took [$400K from Goldman](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/11/14/1255675/-Goldman-Sachs-Pays-Hillary-400-000-in-One-Week ) in a single week.   CEOs and top management at many of these not-for-profit hospitals still get paid in millions.  The incentives are there to squeeze workers and skimp on care, just as they would be in the for-profit world.  http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130810/MAGAZINE/308109991   **Submission Statement**  Covers studies which test the idea that greater voter turnout helps the left, and finds an important counter-example to the prevailing wisdom.  Good and relevant for election day.      My wife works in a hospital.  Top management is raking it in.   I've explained why and showed you that they did.  But good "Ignore the evidence" strategy.  Very true to type.   I should have left it at the flip response.  Oy vey.   How is this off topic?         On top of that, there's plenty of evidence showing that Republicans are specifically trying to disenfranchise Democratic voters:  http://www.nationalmemo.com/6-other-times-republicans-admitted-voting-restrictions-are-just-about-disenfranchising-democrats/   You talk about early voting, but it's Republicans who have consistently tried to reduce early voting.  The reason is obvious - they benefit from making it harder to vote.  It's pretty clear that Republicans can't win the voters, so they need to prevent them from voting.    http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-5-4-for-republican-plan-to-limit-early-voting-in-ohio/2014/09/29/9bc0042e-4758-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html    Your response is filled with unsupported accusations.  Democrats are playing a silly little game - evidence please.  And you're claiming they want long lines for their voters?  You're saying their goal is to arrange to lose the election so they can *complain* about it afterwards? The right wing's most brilliant  conspiracy theory yet.     Nice astroturf ya got there.   **Submission Statement**  Another great piece of investigative reporting by Vice.  This uncovers the story of for-profit facilities which offer dubious treatments, refer patients to each other because of kickbacks, and which are largely unregulated.      RTFA  * More voters per machine for minorities * Longer wait times for minorities  What exactly are minorities supposed to "figure out" here, except there's a concerted effort to suppress their vote?

[/u/api gave a great explanation](http://np.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/2j3g14/walmart_proving_once_again_that_they_are_the/cl87fnr )  of the difference between the business philosophies of innovative companies like Apple and Google and ones like Walmart.  It's long, but worth  read.          First two paragraphs.     *Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the "Freedom Party" (Tnuat Haherut) a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties.  It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.*   The current visit of Menachen Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit.  **It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin's political record and perspectives could add their names and support to the movement he represents.**   So please shut the fuck up.   Did you read the article?                     **Submission Statement**  People were always dying around Grandma - her children, her husbands, her boyfriend - so her lifelong state of grief was understandable.

I would name him Derpy van Derpington.    Let me tell you one thing. In this world we are living in, 98 percent of everything that is built and designed today is pure shit.

In particular, some of the poor souls who work in [this one](http://mindshapedbox.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/2-by-helixblue.jpg).    Well, look at it this way, they've already recognized the terrorist 'state' of Israel.  	189
 Rapey.   'Tis the season to be rusty!   Mmmmmm, deliquescent.   Well, yeah, it's hard to grow a lot of it and you don't get much. However, if I'm guessing you're like me, being efficient isn't the point. The point is doing it yourself and having fun. So...  The Saffron Crocus is sterile (due to polyploidy, it's 3n); no seeds. So you can only get more bulbs from vegetative bulb division. If you get a bulb, it will slowly grow into more bulbs over time. I bought one bulb about 4 years ago and I'm up to 5. Sorry, but I'm not willing to part with any of them yet. Check [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0 _nkw=saffron+bulbs _frs=1) in the spring and fall. They aren't too expensive.  They are mostly grown in a Mediterranean climate and require full sun. They are short-day plants and require a specific amount of dark to flower in the fall. [Check the Bible for more culture specifics.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron#Cultivation) Good luck!  Edit: clarity   I'll give you 10 to 1 she's never read the bible.   I would pick and toss (trash not compost) any affected leaves before planting. Then just be vigilant.  Transplants tend to be packed tightly into greenhouses for propagation. These can be hot spots for disease propagation, too. As long as your plants are not as closely packed, and you watch for problems developing, you should be OK.   It's called Alternaria solani, or the causal agent of Early Blight. The angular bull's-eye shape is a classic feature. Nice photo.  Do a good clean-up in the fall to control it. But if you live somewhere humid, or your plants are very close together, it can defoliate tomatoes and potatoes. Copper fungicides are another control for the home-grower.  Good luck!   What are your qualifications?   The viruses don't replicate in this case. They are only the viral shell filled with a sequence we wanted. Viral shells (capsids) are really good at injecting nucleic acids into cells. No replication.    This is really cool stuff. This technique could be used for all kinds of single gene diseases. Permanent cures for some kinds of deafness, color blindness, and cystic fibrosis, among others.  Another related tool could be fight specific, tenacious diseases. If you can make a worthwhile antibody in the lab that targets a conversed antigen of flu or malaria, then transvect that into a host B-cell after chromosomal rearrangement.   Why aren't we funding science more!?!!   Fun fact, if astrology types actually looked at the sky the whole thing would fall apart. There's a 13th (Ophiuchus) because the stars have moved since the time of the Babylonians.  The planet or sun or whatever isn't even in the claimed constellation a bunch of the time.  I don't expect people to re-evaluate world views to often, but if the stars control everything, look up once in a while!   There is a box of donuts in the break room on the 17th floor of Van Hise every Friday morning. Play it like you are suppose to be there, grab a donut, and punch the elevator back down. I've done this a few hangover days.  Be sure to make uncomfortable eye contact with the UW system president (Ray Cross) if you get the opportunity.    I took it my senior year as a relax class. Holy crap. So good. Really a dynamic lecturer. He's a science story teller.   The Bruce Company is solid.  Avoid municipal mulches as they tend to be made from trees around town that have died. Many are maples dead from Verticillium wilt, a disease caused by a fungus. It can easily survive for a year or two and has a wide host range, i.e. it could kill your plants too.   This isn't a joke; it's a legitimate question. This fact has implications for relativity and the fabric of the Universe.   I liked [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/29/268422490/episode-513-dear-economist-i-need-a-date) a lot.   Thanks! I'm up to two.   I have "Free adult man to good home."  But that might only be funny to me.   They are usually biennial and if it's that large in April it is likely to flower this year. Iff'in the transplant doesn't set it back.   Common Mullein, Verbascum thapsus  Yep, a weed.   Since many antibiotics work on bacterial ribosomes (16S), and we have bacterial ribosomes in mitochondria, why don't our cells die along with the bacteria?      I'm so going to enter the family gun package giveaway!!   Neat!  Gymnosporangium rust. This is the telial stage which makes telialspores, which make basidiospores, which infect apples/quince/hawthorn. There are three species and they all looks really similar. They call it cedar-apple rust because you see it on junipers.     	25
 My ex is a shy, sensitive girl who had gone through a rough childhood with an emotionally abusive mother.  We had first met as pen pals in high school, so over the years she had opened up to me with a lot about her past that she had never told anyone else.  We started dating when she moved to the city I was going to school in.  I was studying engineering at a military academy at the time, so with the demands of my school I could only really see her on the weekends.  With the stress of her past, and her living paycheck to paycheck in a rough city, she would break down every once in a while and call me just to try to get through whatever was bringing her down.  One night she called me during the week, and she seemed especially upset.  For some reason I had a light load with my schoolwork that night, so I told her I'd call her right back, took a taxi to the train station and got on a train before I called her.  On my way over she told me just about everything that was on her mind.  It was late in December, but after I got to her apartment I waited outside talking to her until she had vented everything on her mind.  I explained the cars going by by telling her some guys in the next room over were watching a loud movie.  I waited until she told me she felt better before I told her where I was.  She was on the fourth floor, but she ran down all four flights in pajamas to meet me at the door.  We talked in her apartment for about an hour, but, because of my academy's curfew, I had to take a late train back to school that same night.   	1
    No Mr Duck walked in on the bird having a rager. "You betta nod yo' head in my cage you plastic fuck!"  *beat drops*   Haha he's a masochist    Third Eye Blind?         Or maybe none were reported to the police?      Why am I oddly disappointed?   Hmmm idk. Depends on how hard the trip is. I've had acid trips that I wanted to end they were so intense. 12 hours is a long time to trip can't imagine 36 holy fuck   They donate a small amount to actual research and CEO takes a huge salary I think around 700k/yr   I think they all decided to try rowing for the first time that day and this is the result.

Leopard Seals are somewhat of apex predators and their only known predators are Killer Whales...sometimes. Plus leopard seals are fucking huge usually 1,000+ lbs and over 10 feet in length..

Wow you look ravishing today    Hey babe wanna let me wrangle you tonight?   Yeah because you see melted cars everyday lol dumb bitch          Proof?   Haha thanks for clarifying it at the end    I sense some sarcasm here..   Interesting that women are more sexually aroused at the idea of rape then men. Kinda scary also.   Edit: as a fellow redditor pointed out, I guess a better adjective to describe this conundrum would be confusing. Women are more sexually aroused by "rape" however it's more of the characteristics of a legitimate rape that they like. Being dominated, forceful, etc.    Poison dart frog? Put some poison on an arrow and shoot it at someone does that count?   I love how it says "patent pending" like someone might actually infringe upon it       I'm a liability adjuster for a large insurance company and I deal with disputes like this every day. That's why we get as much evidence as we can from both sides. In this case, if I received this video I would just deny liability (if she was a claimant and OP was our policyholder). At best, she could deny liability as well and her insurance company could pursue arbitration. However, once the arbiter receives video evidence that clearly puts her at fault, her insurance company would just write it off as a loss. You can't really charge her with anything because she legitimately may think she wasn't at fault. Criminal charges and investigation by the state attorney General generally occur if she was claiming an accident happened at 'x' time without a police report or any witnesses or evidence to support her claim.  Edit: Also, liability and determining who is at fault in an auto accident is more of a civil issue. Therefore nothing could really be filed against her.   Now I def know you were dreaming ;)      If she's a 6.5 in the office wouldn't she be higher out? I guess depending on the companies dress code    Fuck you guy    And the ice cream?   Parkour* at its finest    Doin' parkour bruh         He is    I guess it's possible...just figured it was shitty quality             http://i.imgur.com/y09qLMR.gif   Wait so is this part of the reason why he does such dumb shit?            Haha the sign for the yard it was located in has a website: autobeyours.com  The sign also said "hybrid cars and parts". Fuck they weren't lying.    They just wanted the fuel efficiency of a Prius with the reliability of a Subaru.          That is so surreal like holy fuck I can only imagine the taxi driver shit himself          You mean her titties are?   What exactly is going on here?   Exactly what I was thinking. He had to be tall because he doesn't look big at all.    http://i.imgur.com/y09qLMR.gif   Top of the morning to ya    Holy fucking shit do not look at those screens on acid       Yeah it'll do that to you..best binge-worthy show    Haha exactly what I was thinking. Saul Goodman to the rescue!    But seriously can't wait for the new show...apparently getting good reviews so far...   It seems like animals with disabilities like this are always the most affectionate, loving creatures. My wife and I were at a shelter once and a German Sheperd was missing one front leg as the result of a car accident. It was the sweetest dog I think I've ever come across. Brings a tear to my eye thinking of that sweet girl...hope she found a good home and is living healthy and free.   What about the one where someone posted a map of the coordinates of a well where a girls remains allegedly were? I think this was a couple months ago...anyone know if anything ever came of that?

At the time, it was so gratifying seeing it shatter into pieces. I've since learned the value of money...RIP Xbox 360   damn you Halo 2 tryhards :(   Just don't die    What a dumb bitch..so sorry you had to deal with that scum kitty :)   You have to swallow them whole, both at once.

If you are aware of a post being a repost, just don't upvote it, IMO... When a repost receives a lot of upvotes, is it not because the redditors upvoting have never seen it before? And find it unique and interesting?   If every redditor had to search Google or KarmaDecay all the time to experience past posts or check for reposts, wouldn't reddit become less relevant?

He went to ECU.  His family is from Eastern North Carolina.  He is happy to be home.     Wake Forest has been in the ACC how long? And they're a relative nobody in college sports.  They had some good basketball and that one Orange Bowl year.  But that is it.    They have the money, but haven't capitalized.        That's the thing.  Just from a "markets"   recruiting level, none of the 4 ACC teams would want another NC team.    And (almost) none of the other 11/12 (however many teams y'all currently have) teams wouldn't want ANOTHER NC team, to concentrate the power there even more.    Seriously though, having SMU and Houston would be awesome for some intraTexas rivalries - TCU, Baylor, Houston, SMU  Why not just add Rice as well and call it the Southwest Conference?

That means there have been....  * Five chancellors (The top person) * Two Athletic Directors (Includes John Swofford, the current ACC Commissioner)  * Four Head Men's Basketball coaches (Includes Dean Smith) * Five Head Football coaches (Includes Mack Brown)  That doesn't include all the other minions needed for something this large.  This wasn't isolated.  But it would be difficult to get a cancer this large in any other school.      Have you not read the details?  They absolute did it.     If they killed a seemingly legitimate threat after they jumped the fence, I wouldn't call that overboard.  But it is way to early to know anything.       There is evidence this occurring in the 1990s.  Julius Peppers as been pinned in it, and he was in the Carl Torbush era.

The Saddleback caterpillar has urticating hairs that secrete an irritating venom.           And looking ahead.  We play Seahawks at home, then Saints on Thursday at home.

But no, they didn't (or I didn't see them) on the first page.    Here is my full screenshotted list: https://imgur.com/a/VlzoX  I'll refresh my /r/all list now.  It was interesting beforehand.  None of them showed up immediately.  It was a couple of pages in before they would appear.        Only one had an "r/" in front of it.  And it wasn't a filtered subreddit that I saw.

But today, after redditing on All/Top, I had a Trees then Atheism post pop through (Both on my filter list).  Now many others on my list are showing up.  I've restarted Chome, but the same thing occurs.   Thanks!   The blue from the flag bleeds over to the Coat of Arms.  But I think it does look better than the clip art.    I guess mine is magical.  But the reason for the post is to give an option on buying a suit (or nice clothes in general) that might be a little too large.  But save money, because it is on sale.    You shouldn't go buy something more than 1 or 2 sizes too large.  Anything larger and your tailor might not be able to help.  And the price to tailor might reach the breakpoint price.  And even then, you can take it too the tailor and let them look at it.  If they can't help you, return the clothes.     It is a little (lot) more complex, especially at the FBS level. But that is a good birds eye view of things.    This might get confusing.  Dayton is in the Football Championship Subdivision.  Division I (your top level) is subdivided into two subdivisions: Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).    FBS has your more well known teams.   So Dayton plays at the 2nd highest level of collegiate football.    Whenever it looks like I struck gold, it usually ends up being Fools Gold.    Arrrgh!   Exactly.  I watched like a quarter of the MNF game last night, before I came out of my brainfart and realized it was on WatchESPN.com.     The key for a good looking suit, is to get a tailor to do his magic on it.  They can also tailor suits that wouldn't fit otherwise.  Let me give you an example.  I recently bought a Brooks Brothers suit for 70% off.  It ended up being around $90 total.  But it was a couple of sizes too large for me.  So I brought it to my local tailor. $80 later, I had a suit that fits/looks good.  The only reason it was $80, was because it was A LOT bigger than what I needed.  I took another suit that was closer to my size and only spent $50.   So I paid $90+$80 for a $300 suit.    This is ESPECIALLY good for the normal sized people out there.  It always seems like the clearance rack is full of plus sized clothes.    --------  They also have repaired numerous things (backpacks etc), cheaply as well.    It never hurts to buy something and take it by the Tailor and see what they can do.  At worse, you'll have to return the item.     Do people not borrow login info from family/friends for WatchESPN.com?    What would it look like if they converted the white background to transparent?    What about someone *improve* their flag?            punishes the P5 schools  I thought G5 is guaranteed a spot. As in that wouldn't punish them.    Wait....This isn't about getting into the 4-team playoffs.  No G5 team will get that, almost ever.  This is about one of the NYD bowl games.   If Marshall wins out, they CAN'T get the New Year's bowl, unless every other possible team stumbles.  Why?  Because if an undefeated Marshall gets in with their SOS, then every team will start to schedule down.   The committee HAS to set a standard in regards to SOS.

Garrrr :(   Then we would be Bleacher Report      Seems like USF doesn't wear green either   Isn't your stadium name the TD***ECU*** Stadium?   I'm gonna need a TL:DR on that!   Which means it is deeper than the coach.  UNC is, was, and will always be a basketball-first school.

Also, the American Athletic Conference isn't listed, and Big East is.  That needs to change.  Along with that CUSA has a lot of new members as well.    Are you the owner of this website?  If so, I have a few suggestions.   * If you choose a certain division, repopulate the conference list with conferences on in that division.  * Have the ability to make each conference a different color, so people can compare schools/conferences.  * Have the ability to choose multiple divisions/conferences to display at once.

 just disassemble it, take the pcb out and wash it with clean water and dry it.  with no electrical current running throughout the board, you shouldn't have any issues if it's just in the water for an afternoon.  plus, the PS3 case will limit the water exposure anyway.   great article, thanks for posting.   I own a pair of Gramercy raw denim that i've been very happy with: http://www.gramercyclothing.com My first pair of raw denim and they've only gotten better with each wear.   BBRY should be fun to trade tomorrow for a day trade, and through the week for swing trade.    You should have rushed to the other door and forced it shut, preventing her from entering.  At which point she would have felt frustration, followed by anger, and finally by affection.     I'm fucking outraged -- she's only 38!?!  For sure I thought she was 50...  	5
 Someone really ought to let the [gameday website](http://gameday.nd.edu/experience/athletic/) know about this. They still have it as a stadium tradition.   Fuck that. You always sing the alma mater.   He really hasn't improved that much since he was a freshman. He had a solid floor as a freshman, but pretty much no upside.   I hate the K. Not that I know what I'd replace it with, but the K looks weird. The Ws and Ls just looked so much nicer.   What if it's petty theft?   Get more in the bank. It's all about the frenzy lucky combo.   What if I learned something yesterday? Am I allowed to post it here?   I've never wanted anyone in a TV show to die more than I do Jesse right now. He just needs to be put out of his misery. That or he, Badger and Skinny Pete need to go get a farm in the middle of Idaho and chill there and watch Star Trek.   And who knows what happened to J.D. McCoy either. West Dillon had a black QB in season 5. Lance didn't like his BFF getting replaced.   I took a Business Problem Solving class in college. Probably my favorite class in my 4 years. Lot of being given problems and finding solutions. We'd bring in guests with problems and then write up memos and presentations about our solution.   I'm pretty sure this happened with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, except for the her not remembering it thing. Have you taken her to meet your Alzheimer's father and then fallen in love with her yet?   It's been this price on Amazon for months.   They're not going to be that successful streaming if they weren't competing at the highest level. It's the same with professional athletes. Someone like Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan made way more money from endorsements than they did from playing. But no one's going to pay you for it unless they were competing at the highest level. No one wants to buy shoes from Michael Jordan the random guy who went to school in North Carolina.   To show off your deceptive speed.   I think I still have PTSD with Crazy Train.   When aren't they?   Don't try to fight Carlo Calabrese. His people will get you.   That doesn't change the fact that Kelly's playcalling is also horrendous.   No I know today. But today is definitely a first from Big Ten refs.   I really thought that was against Robinson. Since when do B1G refs give us calls?   I'm terrified of what the commentary will be like when we play you. I'm not sure NBC will notice there's a game.   I would watch the shit out of a show where Jason Sudeikis coaches in the Premier League though.   In fairness, there's a video on the NBC sports website about Tommy Reese.   The Rex Grossman era Bears strategy.   I've been so spoiled by Amazon Prime. Had to send an Xbox into Microsoft for warranty repair and Fedex ground doesn't compare to 2 day UPS.   Finally something that makes me feel better about We Are ND.   But we need to be able to ask people what time the narwhal bacons so we can feel super cool.   Time for everyone to wear breakaway pants.   Snapchat selfie is the clear winner.   My middle school decided too many kids were looking at porn. They blocked google images. This was 7th grade, so half our presentations were find pictures of something and put them on a powerpoint.  My high school also didn't want people using the internet in one of the computer labs that was only used for computer classes, so they just deleted the browsers off those computers. It didn't take us long to realize you can browse in Windows Explorer.   "Make it so" OP, nerf pls.   I choose to believe you're not married and are actually going out to find a wife, not that you are and she's in another room or something.   If it were 5, I don't think Kmart or Target get any, since I'm sure Amazon is getting plenty, too.   There were middle school valedictorians?   You're not all good at hiding it. We had this super old English teacher in my high school who everyone knew had a flask in her desk. But she'd been there so long that she taught all the Vice Principals, so no one could really fire her.   I work at an IT help desk at a large state school. We also do work for a major community college system. It's amazing how many 20 year olds don't want to call in to have their password reset and have their parents call instead. Joke's on them because they still have to talk thanks to FERPA.   My issue with Weis is that he gets too cute. He wants to prove with his offense how smart he is instead of just using his players who are flat out better than the other team. Granted Kansas doesn't have players like that, so maybe he's a good fit.   Nah, he fails upward. Bama time.   We're already paying Weis to coach at Kansas, I'm sure we'd be happy to pay Kiffin to coach at USC.   I worked at a retail store for a while that had stopped selling CDs. So there was no display for them at all. I would have people ask me to check the back for CDs. Like we just kept all of them in the back so no one could buy them.   I don't care what system you're in, that's pretty impressive for a true freshman walk on.   Michigan sounded like they were going to cancel, too. They were just mad that it got cancelled with us getting 2 of the last 3 home games.   I prefer shitted. Like the midget from Trapped in the Closet.   I had a P.E. volleyball class the morning after St. Patrick's day my freshman year. Out of 30 people in the class, I think 6 or so had to leave class to throw up that day. That was probably the worst volleyball I've seen in my life.   There have been a lot of really inappropriate songs on Kidz Bop. Toxic was another.   It wouldn't have been able to have half those actors, though.   The lack of assists makes me wonder how they were even thinking those could be steals.   I've been hyperventilating since I read it.   And in greater numbers.   So you're 11?   Apparently they don't require the rappers to be nice like they do the girls.   I had a friend do really well with them. Not because he sold that many knives, but he recruited a friend of his to do that who sold a ton of knives. It's all about putting the pyramid scheme to work for you.   Fuck Free World, 313.   I especially find it weird when they say we. Personally I think you should only say we about an organization you've been a part of in some fashion.     I had a friend get asked "you're one of those asians, aren't you?" at a Taco Bell in Alabama. Not meant to be racist or anything. The woman genuinely wasn't sure.   Rolling Rock is also a little above the price point of what I'd consider cheap beer though. I'd go with Natty, Keystone, PBR, and Hamms, with Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light being around the top end of that.   Thug means never having to say you're sorry.   As far as cheap beer goes it's not too bad. I'll take it over natty or keystone.   And at least for Worlds that's in September/October. You're competing with playoff baseball, the NFL and college football. If I own a sports bar, I'm not bumping the end of the regular season or beginning of the playoffs for esports, and definitely not football.   I once had someone complain about how hipsters had ruined PBR because she drank it before they made it cool. I gave her a look and started to question her before she realized the irony of that statement.   I mean honestly, how often does anyone actually use the extra pockets in cargo shorts? I'm not sure I've ever used them in any pair I've worn.   I've driven some automatics with fairly weak engines that still rollback. Sucks in those, too.   Yeah for real, O'Rourke's is the CJ's of Eddy Street.   It's all about the salmon shorts now, yo.   Yeah Papa Smurfs from Between the Buns are probably a better option in that regard. Plus they already sponsor a bunch of minor sports anyway. I have a bunch of shirts from volleyball games that have Between the Buns ads on the back.   I say we go for fuck buckets from Feve. If for no other reason than I refuse to drink a Clover Quart from anything other than a mason jar, and that would get dangerous. Papa Smurfs would also be acceptable.   Also Willow and Wesley Wyndam-Price.   Make it TheYourTube. It's cleaner. Like TheNetflick.   Well I said Catholicism because for example Gordan Gee specified Catholics. Fielding Yost, while it was a long time ago, was definitely specifically anti-Catholic (also anti-immigrant).   One issue is that we don't want to be on the wrong end of a public vs. private school vote. Another is the history of anti-Catholicism in the B1G.   Just because they were amateurs doesn't mean they haven't dedicated their lives to it. College athletes are also amateurs (most anyway), but that doesn't mean they haven't spent most of their life dedicated to that sport.   They actually don't because they're available to everyone. If your school was free you wouldn't have to worry about scholarship limits. That's how Nebraska had such good walk on players for a while. They were pretty cheap in state.   The guy who played him was apparently just as excited. He kept asking when they would film that scene.   I didn't choose the Vayne Life, the Vayne Life chose me.   Runeless: An ESPN 30 for 30 production.   99 Luftballons.   I like to imagine they actually said LOL.   I had a guy on the other team be late because he was making Kool-Aid. It was grape though so it was ok.   I've had a few books that were kind of old that I needed before, I ended up paying $3.99 to ship a book that cost me a penny. One semester I think I spent almost as much in shipping as I did on books, not that I was complaining at that point.    (`)    I can't wait for ranked ARAM.   That's not even the tri state I know of that has Indiana, I consider it Indiana Ohio Michigan, since that's where Trine/Tri-State University is.   Honestly it's lack of talent. The Bulls are ridiculously deep, hence the strong regular season records, but star power wins championships.   Sorry, by that I meant season ending losses, i.e. playoffs series losses, since that's where their success was being questioned.   Catholic theology at the very least has a place for the "righteous pagans". Basically that the people who were good people but were never introduced to Christianity and therefore never had the chance to be saved can still be saved in the afterlife.    In fairness though, in the 3 years under Thibs, there's been 2 losses to the Heat, which imo are understandable due to the fact that Miami is flat out more talented at the top, and one where they lost right after their star and really only major scorer was hurt. They didn't have time to learn to play without him.    Because the Bulls have been showing a tendency to take any opponent for granted for the last 2 years. They basically play every game like it's the finals.   It's not anymore.   Just outside the last decade but the Cha Cha Slide will definitely be one. And the Cupid Shuffle in that same vein. Basically songs that have their own set of dance moves to go with it, preferably said during the song.   Truly the greatest song about [military bears](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twQlpFrm5iM).   5 years ago when minimum wage was still $6.55 Walmart was paying between 7 and 8 an hour by me. Target and Kmart were both paying $6.55.   I think she's got some vaginal hubris.   The second has Urkel though.   Of the 4 girls I've dated, 2 are married, one's engaged, and one's living with her boyfriend. The pattern seems to be marriage 5 years after they date me. I'm like a delayed version of Good Luck Chuck.  I should mention I just turned 23.   Kanye didn't become famous until after 9/11! I sense a conspiracy!   How exactly do you determine the sexuality of someone born 2000 years ago? Not to mention all the time he spent hanging out with prostitutes.   I had a boss last year who would tell all kinds of stories from his youth about stealing cars and drinking and doing drugs, all at the same time of course, and would always justify them with "It was the 70's".   I hope the prime directive doesn't often come into question in your marriage.   I was told to reinstall once. It didn't make me any better.   I enjoy the irony of people complaining about a feminist being important in gaming being the post right above 3 female cosplay posts.  	100
 That's fair enough, I was just asking.  I myself have question I want to ask about ghosts, but I never met a person who is an expert in these matters.    Seriously? XD   Are you a ghost buster or something?   Funny how that actually happened to me a few times before    Should have drawn a dickbutt   Fuck  	6
 Lol that gun is fucked   A fuck ton of girls like a single guy and the guy is indifferent and uncomfortable about it all the time like it isn't happening   Oh you were wondering what it was.   Butts n' tits and tits n' butts   Oh yeah. Harem stuff too lol   It's pretty much SAO with more fan service and more background on how the main character grows.   Yeah it's pretty great lol   People usually call is DanMachi for short though   [Kek] (http://i.imgur.com/Rcqiu3C.gif)   It's a pretty entertaining show to keep up with.       Saw that and shit my pants. Already posted it in the skype chat poser.   I really fucking want it.   I'm just gonna settle with the plastic one to fit my budget for now and to review.    \\_()_/   I mean, it can   Oh I like regular grips too lol  I just like shooting thumb over bore because it's relatively universal and works well.   Depending on arm length and position of the grip? Length of the rifle?   Shooting thumb over bore provides maneuverability without a grip and works for multiple lengths of rifles   I feel like jumping on the opportunity and doing a review will generate me a poop ton of views   I'm ordering some pouches and shit, just a bunch of essentials and I have enough left for a CYMA M870, some shells, and a scabbard.  I feel like if I put up a review of it a lot of people will watch it also.   Thoughts?   k bb I got osu waiting at home 3 xoxo   REEEEEEE~   Just make a joke about OSU lol    yee      feelsbadman   You talked to it and then cried to it?   Shooting thumb over bore looks a little silly, but it makes maneuvering easier and helps with aiming.    Tell your body pillow about it   Oh lol   Free Galaxy MP5k. All I had to do was reinstall the wiring, new motor, and pry out a BB from the nozzle.    All of the bad pictures don't have eye raping filters and all of the good pictures do.   Yeah it's all pretty listenable   I thought coldsteel trainers were santoprene?  Which is like rubbery?   Yeah I love me some good ska rock   Oh lol   What about a regular T1 riser that's the same height?   It's fake and rubber dude   The whole thing looks flawless, and then the riser is just an eyesore.   Weird   0/10 no hentai   *This is my kind of gun*   Lol what time zone are you even in?   I love these videos    Dude nuh uh    Where I work there's all waitresses but they all suck    Uh, no links anywhere?   I can't find a way to do that. My chrome isn't giving me the option.   Person who makes salads, *duh.*   Oh god it's so grainy   Airsoft is banned in Australia, that'd be an easy way to get your stuff taken away   74M   K   ayy    *You wanna see these hands?*      Cool cool man. We're just a chat sub that's kind of a subsidiary to the main /r/airsoft sub.    Yeah they deserve it. They rock.   This was really well put together. Thanks for the great video.   I thought you meant real knife lol   Like /r/mallninjashit style knife or just a nice knife?   Yeah seeing a Japanese dude with an afro was pretty great lol   Oh that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up.    Does kuundere just mean spacey and shit?   Like Mashiro from Sakurasou?      Yeah good point.    I know lol. Just adding that because I didn't want to seem like a total dick. Maybe like, a partial dick.    Oh I wasn't talking about the tent thing. That has meaning behind it and you explained it lol. I was talking about the random pew pews or whatever   k   Oh lol.  Oreimo is good but a little weird.    I feel like this is a joke because I didn't much care for either show.    The paint jobs are cool but the random writing is kind of ugly   This reminds me of the time I gave a friend a sugar pill and told him it was ecstasy.    But you'd agree that an RATech'd out WE is better than a stock GHK right?   I need to stop resurrecting this laptop and get a PC lol   Okay then   Yeah these glasses are way more comfortable to me than my old ones   Oh my jimmies weren't rustled, I just explained lol   Sickles.   One time I saw a picture of a Gameboy Advance on one of their displays. Like, with the batteries and stuff.    Memes   Pepe sun?   I'll do it later, because I'm tempted lol   My computer is no longer kill. No more using IPad for me.   Yusssssss   It's annoying as shit and it's not mine   That's a good tip.   Also, I love my Condor MOPC to pieces. Definitely getting a other for my next loadout.   Condor MOPC is a cheap alternative. If you get the pouches right then it wouldn't look too different.      Oopsy, okay. Thanks for the chill message   I've always had a thing for NSR rail systems.   I need to pick one up some day.   When my hair's like this I use glasses, longer hair/airsoft is contacts.   Then why recommend it for entry level GBBR users?   Better than a stock GHK   Yep.   GHKWEWA.    I would recommend WE and then getting all RATech parts though.   I'm 90% sure it's a unique system      Material and gas efficiency. Not a WA design, WE is better than WA   Is overpriced   He's wrong on most of that stuff   Yeah I've been doing this since 4th or 5th hour lol    Yeah thanks, that was actually pretty reasonable and was a good distraction for class lol. Usually arguments on reddit go to poo, so this was a breath of fresh air    Where's the other parenthesis I'm confused   Well there we are. Also, I wasn't saying KJW GBBR's were bad in any way, just saying that for the money he'd probably looking for a WE.    I can somewhat agree with this, but what OP is looking for is probably a WE M4 Open Bolt.    I was planning on either g-hopping and playing until the internals took a shit, or getting an HPA engine, g-hop, and wide bore combo.    WE's last pretty long stock and are more affordable than KJW M4's. They also have more upgrade options down the road, and have better quality control as of late. Plus, as the one guy said, the reason you see bad reviews is because more people buy them.  If more people buy something there'll be way more reviews of it.    WE doesn't break after a bag of BB's, that doesn't even make sense   Yeah WE has way more high quality aftermarket parts.    Still, why would you wear the bag like that lol   It would be terrible trying to raise your weapon to aim   But with WE the quality control has gone up and there's plenty of good aftermarket parts that you can use to upgrade and make it better than a KJW M4?  As far as I know, there aren't as many decent aftermarket upgrades for the KJW as there is more for the WE. I'd take a stock WE Open Bolt M4 and an NPAS for like 300 or so with the option of upgrading with better parts than a stock KJW M4 for 375 or so.   Also, WE mags are cheaper and aren't too hard to fix if they're leaking.    WE M4, more mags, RATech parts   You just seem to have a shit attitude and he was posting here because he knew he'd get the answer he wanted and it's not a bother?   DAE SIDEBAR GUISE GOSH   Link isn't working for me.   Otherwise, how does it shoot stock? I've been looking into getting/building a DMR and I've been eye balling this gun.  Do you think I could get away with just a new spring and g-hopping it or what?   /r/theydidthemath   You thought changing the aesthetics of a gun made it shoot further?   Are you LevelCap or something?    It'd look really cool if you used some tan goggles   This gun just sounds so terrible just by the words SRC and GBBR together   wat   I like the short one. If a sale comes along I'm very tempted to get one.   Oh don't pull that. UMP-45's are nice and it's hard to see how militia members could get theirs hands on them. It just doesn't fit the look and you know that too.   I was joking. *Gosh.*   Airsoft-SJW is a term that doesn't even make sense. Other than that I agree the hive mind is bullshit and I was just pointing something out.   His gear is too nice looking and the gun is wrong?   Le cumbut masheen DMR guise   Exactly. I wasn't saying his gear was bad or being a dick about it. Just stating what I saw really.   But they can't afford UMP-45's nor do they have accessibility to any   I really like it, I was just pointing out that it isn't specific to anything.   Just random gear is all.   So I was right   You need a kit list, and also this just seems like random gear and a Kenyan flag.   Oh yeah I agree the second is better than the first   I just fixed it. Now I'm sad.   7.62 milimeter. **Full. Metal. Jacket.**   Oh yeah dude I was gonna ask if you wanted to go see it in theater or some shit   I saw the scene with Chris Pratt going through the woods on a motorcycle with velociraptor bros and shit my pants   I knew about it and didn't get too excited until I saw one of the trailers while waiting to watch a YouTube video.  Needless to say I'm going to be checking for torrents every day now or going to see it with a friend. I can't miss Chris Pratt being bros with velociraptors.   *Neither did I*   Partially   Lol that username   Or a Colt C7   Aye  	138
 A few here and there but not every single year.    Most of his movies nowadays r shit but he is one of the biggest stars in the world and people pay to see his movies so theres that. Personally I think he should stop doing comedy and just start being in Dramas nowadays because he is really good at that but that will likely never happen.    I havent seen it but I wish David Ayelo got a nom for Selma.    Probably the stupidest "movie" I have ever seen in my life.    You expect me to watch Berlin!!!!    Most of the time the movies change things like certain plot points and stuff. So no its not if you want to know more about the world and stuff.    I kinda think he killed himself onstage and the last hospital scene is just a fantasy of his or something    Then why did he have conflicts with the director???   God I hope Keaton or Carell wins for Best Actor.    God I wish they would just announce something already quit playing with my emotions!!!!    Yes and yes    I liked it and TBH I have no freakin idea if she is from the future or not.    YES!!!!!!!!!! I am already counting down the days.    Yes    Man that sucks for her LOL    WOW she should have said i wish I had a boyfriend    Christian Bale    you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight???    yes he did but they died a long time ago    So Hitler could understand her.    I kinda think he died there on the stage by really shooting himself and the final hospital scene is just his final thoughts, notice how everything goes good for him in that scene.    Bitches you bitches!!!!!!!!    Well now you know!!!!!!!    Yeah it was good I loved it.    its decided then    How bout Bradley Cooper in there for Best Actor.    Should I watch this tomorrow or Inherent Vice???    The Norton one didnt make that much money so Marvel decided to give up on giving the character his own series.    The Wicker Man 2006    Sutter thinks thats who he is.    that was also a tribute to Opie I believe.    LOL    Unforgiven or The Good bad and ugly those are the two best westerns IMO.    yes it is.    well he said call him so just put two and two together.    Thats what I have always wondered too I mean he just left them in a room with a madman LOL.    It had his phone number on it.    No he wont be nominated even though he deserves it.    Yeah true Sutter kind of retconned some stuff, I wonder if in later years him and Piney grew apart and Clay and JT became best buds thats why TellerMorrow was formed.    That explains why my Netflix Canada site wasnt working last night.    Yeah true but for the shows that arent on netflix too like Community and South Park its better than going to some sketchy website and stuff.    Harkins theaters $7.25 all the time because I am a student. the normal price is $10.25 usually. At AMC its like $5.20 or something.    whoa I literally just watched that movie too!!!!      O okay I get it now. Thanks!!!   No    Yeah some not all of it tho.    Wolverine Origins is no longer canon Fox basically swept it under the rug.    Thank you    True I guess I just wanted Jax to live above all else rather than the typical main character is an antiherro so the final scene is him dying ending.    So I was wondering when JT died and Clay suceeded him as President was he already VP?? Why wasnt Piney VP since he was one of the cofounders and stuff. Just something I was wondering.    I kinda wanted to have it end with Jax getting away with the murders of Gemma, Unser, Marks, and Barofsky. Then he sends his kids away and still stays on as President just a broken man though who finally makes it legitimate.    Too late he has already done that.    Sylvester Stallone    Yes true    Thank you!!!!    Yes I saw that now IO dont have to use Hola unblocker to watch Community.    yeah true but who would ever pay 100 for ads     I like it so far except for the ads I already have Netflix too so I guess my entertainment needs r taken careof for a few months!!! I cant wait til my shows start coming on again in January so I can no longer download stuff and I can just stream them.    Yeah he didnt really leave them with a lot of plausible deniablility.    wow someone loves birdman    So what do yathink the club is up to now??? It is in good hands with Chibs as President but I wonder what kind of adventures they will have now that the teller family is gone basically.    LOL    Spiderman 3    alright Drax    its gay    I wish he would do another Tron but disney has its hands full with Star Wars and Marvel    Twilight because its Gay    Well I want it to be nominated but usually that means it wont get a nom.    Hes a really good actor hope he gets an Oscar some day.    Beat me to it.    After they refused to stream it exclusively in the first place??    I liked it it was really funny, maybe I should rewatch it havent seen it for awhile.    I LOVED IT!!!!!! So glad the terrorists didnt win and i got to watch this IN a Theater. Also Some guy had a seizure while watching it and we all got free movie tickets because of that.    ahhh sorry to hear that.    never    Yes    I believe I mean the battle of the five armies.    I have gotten into a few actually one was wether or not the cartoons and comic were in canon, one was who was better the jedi or the sith and another was darth maul vs darth vader.    Yes Star Wars    Good movie I loved it one of the few that made me cry.    From what I hear the directors cut is exactly 30 minutes longer.    Lots of them.    Interesting    Okay thanks dude guess I will see it on christmas day like I originally planned.    Because I want to.    In my theater it is there for at least a week.    So I really want to see the Interview on Opening Day there is a theater close to me that is showing it but I am still spooked by the terror threats, should I watch it opening day or wait a few days???    Why just why???    There was naked people??    Well whoever gave him the drink is a murderer!!!!!    Oklay that makes sense but wow 20.    20 movies?? Seriously???    Yeah true    O okay interesting.    do they charge you 99 flat?? or is it broken up into monthly payments??    Okay hmm I still havent decided but thanks!!!!!    no    So I already have Netflix but I was thinking of adding Amazon instant too just to see what the selection is like too, should I do it?? It might be worth it just to see all of the HBO shows too.    Cool    He was a terrorist.    This sucks balls    Man I was looking forward to a dangerous visit to the movie theater on Christmas Day. I hope you are Happy Cyber Hackers.    torrents although most of them can be found on youtube    Man I still listen to that song it is on my iphone!!!!    AHHH thats so nice, I wanna reread this book again now.    Yes completely agree.    13 Reasons Why it got me thinking how life is so precious and how people can come and go in your life.    Yes they could do some kind of crossover movie with marvels two teams that would be pretty cool actually.    LOL    What are some of the easiest paychecks for actors in movies???   	111

 I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene    Recently I've been listening to the Highstreet allstars and I've noticed somthing. A lot of their songs use old melodies, like their track freeze is "what do we do with a drunken sailor" 3kings is (I'm spacing right now but it sounds really familiar) and rock that beat is an old Celtic song called "son ar christr" I think it's pretty cool when artists put a spin on classic melodies. I want to find more songs, hardstyle or otherwise thanks in advance :)   I'm still a beginner so don't be too hard on me :)   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fqsax6flnvqwcqd/AABlGrvugc4g-8R_6xj4NNuia?dl=0  QUICK EDIT!: use these how ever you see fit! Just be sure to link me the songs made with them, I'm interested to see what you guys come up with :)   thank you Sam, I always love these story's   EDIT: I love "Lad Riffs" Hahah, Steriophobia, Superstar DJ, Fucking posers (maybe I need to listen to that song again) and Do you wanna ballon? Man... You just made me realize that I need to listen to more old hardstyle    Holy shit... Is that Dio in there?   Yes? :(... It doesn't have to be a kick you worked super hard on    Post a project file and a WAV. Render, doesn't matter what DAW you use and it doesn't matter what kind of kick it is, it can be a normal distorted kick, a reverse bass, a hardcore kick heck I'd even be down for a nice gated kick. I think it would be cool to see how we all make our kicks and maybe help out those who are having trouble. I'm not at my computer right now but I'll post some files when I am :)      Niiiiiiicccce, good mastering on this, I have afew criticisms (if you are the guy who made this) the reverse bass sounds like it could be a little more distorted and while I understand what you are trying to do with the vocals they sound a little boring, maybe you could get a girl friend to do the vocals and give it that aggressive human element. Besides the two things that I mentioned everything else is their, good job on this one :)       [Right here!](http://kinzoku.xxxxxxxx.jp/tmfgh.html)   It is illegal, but only in certain ways (   )      I get really worked up sometimes, at points I'm on top of the world and at others I'm getting my ass kicked by little girls, I've only played EOTSD and Faith Mountan, Meiling always kicks my ass because I can never read her patterns, I remember barely scraping by her once only to be killed before I reached the first boss encounter in the level then having to go to the score screen and have sakyua silently judge me with her dead unmoving eyes and go alllllllll the way back to the beginning, I just want to fight sakyua ;_;. Then in faith mountain Momiji's bullet patterns always make me panic so I end up wasting all my bombs    will the based freq tell us a story? /u/audiofrq plz      and its fixed! thank you!    Oh, sorry I'm not home right now so I couldn't check (the screenshots aren't mine I just used them as an example) thank you :)   Thank you but again that's not what I ment, I'll try to be very specific this time :), ok so normally when you put a pattern in the playlist, the notes show up as a [greyish white](https://audiodestrukt.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/fl-live-playlist.png), I think a accidently hit a key or something along those lines because now when I put a pattern in the playlist the notes show up [colored](http://cdn.mos.musicradar.com//images/Tutorial%20images/Tech/fl-studio-tips/fl-studio-slicer-460-85.jpg), seriously though thanks for your help, I'm learning things I didn't know before :)   Sorry, what I mean is the actual notes inside the pattern are showing up colored like green, purple and blue all inside one pattern    How do I make [this](http://youtu.be/6x5RshIRrno) FX kick? It starts at 0:56 and you can also hear it multiple times starting at 1:55   My main complaint is that you can't set a decay time, meaning that the kick tail could be a minute long if you wanted it to be, otherwise this is a great little Vst. it's got some pretty good presets and one of my favorite producers I:gor worked on it [get it here](http://distocore.net)   Me too, I am also very interested in this    Harmor can also do this    I love how obvious it is that Sam is doing the vocals for this one   EDIT: fantastic reverse bass, a lot of my favorite reverse bass tracks come from Bioweapon/Audiofreq       If you have FL I recommend [this guys](http://youtu.be/nFI2CdFY_3M) tutorials he also makes hardstyle if your interesed (hardstyle kicks can teach you a lot about kick making) also try synthesizing your own kick tails it's alot of fun and it gives it that personal touch    I fucking love this artist, his/her art style is so cool   Ima fite u m8   They had potential, I was a huge fan of live for the night but eventually they just dropped off my radar, I never really liked the girls that much like what /u/Nezzatic said, a bit trashy. They got my attention with United kids of the world but in all honesty it wasn't that good of a song, it felt like Headdy and the girls could have done better and now with the whole rainman thing why even bother, I mean they lost their producer, where do they go from there?  EDIT: I forgot about party monster! Huge fan of that song production was fantastic    I would love to see a video of that   I like it, simple yet refined  Edit: or how about what ever Gabes wife's name is, because behind every God is a Goddess    what should we name her? It should be something elegant, something powerful, something that encapsulates the essence of PC gaming        *desperation for full comic series intensifies*    hmm I don't know much about about ambient but that doesn't mean I still cant help you :) [try this one on for size](http://freesamplepacks.net/dark-ambient-sounds/)         Ah I understand, ok let me re-answer I don't know of any cheap daws but their are plenty of free vst's and sample packs just waiting to be found, check out this sub, along with Google, also what kind of music are planing on making?   we cant link you any torrents on here but do some hunting if you really want to.     oh how dumb of me!! filters, why didn't I think to use filters! (ga!) thanks for the enlightenment friend :D       Thank you, so if I wanted a 3 band one I would just do the same thing except with 3 tracks and I would cut the mids from one?   I know their are plenty of plug-ins/vst's but I'm really interested in making my own, I use FL so if anyone could point me towards any tutorials or explain the process to me that would be fantastic :) thanks in advance    Ohmicide, it's a pretty nice multiband distortion unit but I can never get anything I like out of it.      Lights laugh/face during the laugh...... A sweet cherry on top of a great Sunday also I paused it when I was watching it with my friend and said "that face is someones wallpaper"   DYK that Dan Green did voice acting for bible black?   Or it could be played first given that it's the slowest/saddest so the hype ratchets up as the party goes on, also as a special bonus a plague of gripes set with all grey lights and music consisting of [noise](http://youtu.be/2toGkIfGFVU) and creepy animal sounds   Duuuuude! TBF warehouse party! Everyone wares pop culture/anime/hype shirts and we have a 4 hour party with a 1 hour set for each member, the music and lighting changes for each one  Woolie: all green lights with a set consisting of fighting game themes and rap that ends with the sound of rock salt being poured into something   Pat: red, yellow and orange lights with a set consisting of silent hill music that moves into Irish folk songs and heavy metal  Liam: pink, yellow and light blue lights with a set consisting of j-core, j-metal and anime remixes   And finally Matt: red, white and blue lights with a set consisting of 80's action movie themes, wrestler themes and platinum games ost's also throughout the set you can hear predator growling and for the slow dance with Matt and his wife; snake eater.       Great seeing more of angerfist around here   Wow... I had no idea kidd kaos made stuff like this. I've always loved his hard trance but this is fantastic! Thanks for sharing :)   I was thinking I could set up a plug.dj room and I could do a mix consisting of rap, video game ost's, electronic music and other stuff. Plus we could all chat and have fun. Let me know what you all think :)   I beat peace walker! Now all I need to do is grow a beard and play ground zeros and my indoctrination into the MGS series will be complete! Then the wait will officially begin for me   Is their a cut off year for this? Because if not I can't wait for him to play quantum of solace that game was better then expected    Perfect    Kick making :) as you can probably tell by my flair kicks are a big part of the music I make, weather it be the over driven sound of a gabber kick, the dry dusty omf of a gated kick (gated kicks are commonly used in hard trance), the aggression of a frenchcore kick, the power of a hardstyle kick or the solid thunk of a UK hardcore kick. Theirs something about synthesizing or editing one from a sample pack that is just so relaxing and fun, plus it's so cool to hear how just a little EQing can change so much about the character of a kick   I like to imagine his mom calling him down for dinner while he's in the middle of this.   Mom: (in French accent) Hugo come down and have soup   Him: (in angry french accent) not now mom this mix down is giving me problems ;_;   This is the only [speedcore lable](https://www.speedcore.ca) I know of   Neeeevvverrrr compare yourself to your influences it never helps the creative process at all. Simply keep doing what your doing and most importantly HAVE FUN!   I know what you mean, I just wanted to show the whole sound spectrum so I got a little lazy plus the last few notes of the melody just don't sound right to me (I found some midi online)   Wrestling, my friend just ate it up, he bought so many DVDs, toys and even that wwe car combat game   [heres the patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0) [heres the FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fgqsiw0eju5zhi2/pluck%20test.flp?dl=0) and finally [heres how it sounds](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/pluck-test), enjoy and be sure to link me any songs you've made with it (you don't need to credit me I'm just interested to see what you come up with)    Hey it's cool, the more you know right? It doesn't surprise me that it was figure he loves horror, his monsters albums are one of the many things I look forward too in October    But then theirs [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2yfzlp/nnn_message_gabber_2014_japanese_hardcore_is_so/)   I can understand :P I personally love terrorcore but at points it dose get to be too insane/gross, also was the person you walked out on [this guy](http://youtu.be/dx99U5KcwNQ)   EDIT: I'm supposed to tell you why I like it! I like it because it's fast and it's frantic and some of the people who make it are masters of drum programing. Also it's just diffrent and it shows how you can take a concept like horror and turn it into awesome music! Check out [this mix](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs)   the dark oscillators used to be made up of Luca antolini, technoboy and tuneboy (and afew other people) so check them out   I've seen more and more hardcore submissions get more upvotes lately... Gabber's gaining ground ;)    Ohhh shittt! Good idea dude! Super best animators 1 hour podcast we would finally get to hear 2snacks sexy Brazilian accent, hear Cranky confess how he's a furry and has been hiding it (kind of) all these years and finally hear zone talk about ~~her~~ his dick shading techniques, also I know I'm making a joke but I really want this to happen, like really badly   Or the moans of various cartoon charters throughout only to be hushed by some unknown horror    Also dose zone have a reddit account? If not ~~she~~ he should get one   I already know about POS and Noisekick and I need more! I'm really in love with terror right now, thanks in advance :)   Who would be the super intendant? My money's on RAGE, he would just kick down someone's door and proclaim I AM HERE TO FIX THE LEAKY PIPE! Also if this ever happens I would volunteer to be a writer in a heartbeat    I would like to imagine that all the people who do creepy sex stuff use the dungeon and none of them know that someone else uses it too. So their could be moments of "how did this horse dildo get here?" "What's up with this ball gag?" And a one point their could be an episode where they all meet, it would open with Plague doing some creepy animal thing and Yahtzee would walk in waring his gimp suit and they would lock eyes and then Jole from vinesause would walk in waring a Kermit the frog mask    What if Yahtzee moved in next door, they would think that a very vocal British Australian political journalist moved in    2swood4me   and then above Gav and Micheal is Jon Tron just eching it up all day and a running gag could be they think he's a chain smoker because all they hear coming from the apartment is ECH! ^^^ECH! ILL GET MY SWOOORRDDD DANNY!!!    Round wave crusher   Kobaryo   Angerfist  Noisecontrollers   Ophidian   Round Wave Crusher, he has a new album coming out very soon and he's the the person that introduced me the whole J-core scene. I know a lot of people on here don't like fast music (200 and over stuff) but seriously give him a chance, it takes awhile to get used to fast music but once you do, you will want to hear more! Believe me I know I used to absolutely despise anything over 200. Anyways here's one of my favorite songs by him, the melody is so dark and catchy, may I present to you.... [Voices (in my head)](http://youtu.be/UWaCPTgUNsk) he also did a redo of this on his Unhinged E.P.  EDIT: also You, You just blows my mind on so many levels, he makes really good happy hardcore but at the same time he can do incredibly fast music very well. He also has anime remix albums up on his site for free, check him out at [foryousounds.com](http://www.foryousounds.com)   No problem :)   I sure do! [This is my favorite song by him](http://youtu.be/AHVBBWwB1Io) he also makes hardcore under the name ophidian if your interested  EDIT:[album showcase](https://soundcloud.com/sebastiaan-kleinjan/gazing-long-into-the-abyss-album-showcase)   Fuck yes! Thanks for adding it to the list dude. Also have you ever heard of meander? He's one of my favorite crossbreed artists    Oops, looks like I need to get gud   Your forgetting one genre (depending on if you like it)... Crossbreed, crossbreed is a combination of DnB and hardcore, really cool stuff check out "The Outside Agency" if you want to hear some (they are the founders of the genre) otherwise flawless list dude it's nice to see someone so dedicated to a genre they love   Oh man oh jeez their are so many things I need to do, I need to upgrade my pc, I need to buy more MG's games and I need to send in my PS3 because the disc tray is broken :/   rules of nature?    taken from the dying light video      The vid quality is bad, but the part about the home work made me laugh really hard      One of the better Schranz aragements I have heard in a while! Also for those who don't know... Schranz is a kind of hard techno that focuses on phat, chunky rolling beats rather then the kicks       Fuck I still need to buy peace walker, and then buy ground zeros and then get super hype for September 1   The Simpsons is my favorite anime          to who ever did this.... thank you   Captain were taking on too much lewdness, we may need to start evacuating the crew soon   Not my favorite hardsound album but it has my favorite cover art I mean seriously just look at that shade of pink... Also I should make a confession. I got into Touhou through the musical arrangements I heard on YouTube, weather it be hardcore, jumpstyle, schranz or hardstyle I would listen to it. Also I've only played two of the games, embodiment of the scarlet devil and faith mountan       *gets up from fireplace* what an interesting story also wow Australian born Colombian you must have had a diverse childhood      Maby if we're patient Uncle Sam will tell us the story behind this one   Yes! thank you    I remember it was one of those "I'd like some feedback on this" kind of posts and everyone really seemed to like it, it was a Rawstyle track and a remix (possibly) thanks for in advance!   Dose anyone think their should be a Noisia version of the discovery movie?   I did ;) [heres a link to the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2uw03m/lisa_lashes_alex_kidd_vs_kidd_kaos_nu_religion/)   Hey wait a minute I remember you! Your the guy who asked for hard trance suggestions :D how have you been enjoying it so far?   check out QULT   Heres the [FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/45av9r0srbhrkdd/Devestate%20Dominate%20Eleimiate.flp?dl=0) Right now its just samples from the blutonium hardstyle sample pack, im hoping to make it a lot more and a lot better! have fun with it  :)      This is hardcore ;)   Strobe      Me too man   Believe it or not he actually has a hardstyle alias, sadly he's only [released one song under it](http://youtu.be/0wXZJues_bs)   I'm really hoping for some Gabber in the near future   [Try this mix on for size](http://youtu.be/HIw1DsZD8NA) it's a tech trance mix, if you don't want to listen to the whole thing just look at the track list in the description, all the artsists listed make really good tech :)  And if you want to get into hard trance [heres one of my favorite mixes](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) and a [mix I did](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/exploring-the-dreamscape)   Wow! This is actually pretty good, the kick sounds like it's pushing the melody out of the way a bit but otherwise it's really good   As we all know 16bit broke up awhile ago and awhile later Eddie Jefferys came back as MoodyGood (bless him his sound design is amazing) but what happened to Jason? I remember hearing that he started making trap as "we are the 13" or something like that, theirs even a link to his SC on the old 16bit FB page but it's a dead link :/ so dose anyone know what happened to the guy?   Fuck yes I love angerfist, this whole album is a winner, also did you know that gabber started in the Netherlands? And that the listeners were usually punks and outcasts who were just looking for something to do? Gabber has an interesting history      Stand Name: The Hopeless Pursuit of Remission  Stand Ability: [Quantum Uncertainty](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Quantum_Uncertainty)   Power - C  Speed - C  Range - D  Durability - B  Precision - C  Potential - B   You might want to ask this on /r/edmprouction nice pepole and you will get some good advice :) also I use Vocodex and I really like it      "Teaches ages 12-16 years old" :0.... Excuse me mr. visi- I mean mr. (What ever the visions last name is) I think I hurt my ankle, could you take escort me to the nurses office? *On the way there* sooooo... Whats your go to synth, what distortion modal is your favorite and will you check out my mixtape?   Hello everyone! As the title says I need some help with making a subground kick, Specifically [this one](http://youtu.be/sYZcgn-sJho) it sounds to me like a big room kick with some distortion and some EQing to bring it out a bit, any guesses on how this kick was made would be great! Also if you make subground why not share some info on your kick making process (/u/audiofrq) I'm looking at you ;) thanks much   sure thing dude    Maybe try this? http://www.vitorrent.cc/search/camel+audio+alchemy+1.5   Sure thing dude, I don't know of any but I'll take a look for you. Also *gives pat on back*   Sure thing dude! I'll link you the site where I get most of my Japanese stuff (most of it is physical release only so I have resort to a lot of torrenting/unofficial downloading :/) [here](http://touhourecords.blogspot.com/?m=1) although you can find some stuff on iTunes, if you find it for free but also find it on iTunes buy it to support the artist! unofficial downloading/torrenting is a last resort for me   Here are some artists   Dutch: Angerfist, Neophyte, The Viper, Nosferatu, Endyminion, The Playah and Ophidian  Italian: DJ Mad Dog, AniME, The Art Of Fighters, Amnesys, Nico and Tetta and Meccano Twins  Japanese: DJ Noriken, moro, DJ Sharpnel, Kobaryo, t+pazolite, kenta-v.ez., Noizenecio, RoughSketch, DJ Myosuke and 6th  As for records: Angerfist - The Deadfaced Dimension, Nosferatu - Nocturnal By Nature, Ophidian - Between The Candle and The Star (this one is reeeelly good!), Art of fighters - Words of war, DJ Sharpnel - The Sharpnel sound albums, moro - The Gensou hardsound compilations, If your looking to get into old school hardcore the gabberbox compilations (their fucking expensive though $30 a pop) and if your looking to get into speedcore the Psycho Filth Records 500 over!, 600 over! and 666 over! Compilations, I have 666 over! and it's frickin sweet!   Sure thing man, check out the Japanese Stream Hardcore compilations, Japanese Hardcore sounds a lot diffrent from most Dutch/Italian Hardcore   Mainly the melodys and saw synths, also the kicks, some pepole just really like the aggressive sound   Thanks for the advice. but I still am curious, is their a way to get them to work with FL?   Recently I found out about this --- http://www.phuturetone.com and I was wondering if I could use rewire some how to make the plug ins work in FL or dose rewire not work that way?  Edit: I should probably clarify that I only have FL studio   Ask some one who already has it, I know that producers sometimes keep installs to give to friends. If you don't know anyone with it you will have to torrent it :/   Do you have sytrus?      "Dante chases rage" what?!? Rage runs from no man Rage dose not understand the concept of being chased, the games are rages equivalent of a vacation   "Blanka and rage tell story's to eachother" Blanka: I can't wait to see my mommy Rage: this one time I destroyed a skyscraper just by looking at it..... HAHAHAAA!   This guy gets it       Unf... Those kicks! Also check out the gensou hardsound compilations, there fucking awesome (this song isn't on any of the comps though)      An odd thing to post here but believe me when is say all of these tracks are fantastic despite being so fast, if your looking to get into fast music check this one out along with their 500 Over! and 600 Over! Compilations       holy shit dude! bring snacks because we need to get to the [bunker](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1390/58/1390580499294.gif)     this happened to me also, I shot Sam an email and he sent me the DJ edit and the radio edit. (Sam's a cool guy) just shoot him an email if apple dosn't get back to you :)     stamp on the ground by the italo brothers     nightcore at its most basic level is just any song sped up about 10-30 BPM at that point you get warping and people who enjoy that are people who I distance myself from. on another level people actually remix the track but I'll just stick to happy/UK hardcore     if your an anime fan checkout star driver    man... Matt looks really good with glasses   That was awesome! and then the part with the revolvers, and after ocelot is just like see us later fuckers and peaces out in the dumbest/best way possible   Alright alright alright! Thanks dude   Oh man that cock block ending tho   Fuck ya man! [Spoiler](#s "just to be sure your talking about the fight between ocelot and snake right?")    Quick question for ground zeros... Digital or physical copy, am I missing anything if I buy digital?   I fucking did it! I beat it!  	156
 Was this in the SAS Klan Obliteration server?   It boggles me how people from Western cultures are so tolerant with an outdated culture that doesn't even respect human rights. Swedes really need to open their eyes, because once the 3rd world immigrants are there doing bad stuff, there won't be an easy way to revert the situation.   Yeah I got that problem a few times lately and only a reboot would fix it. So I installed the DirectX on the BF4 redist folder and so far so good.      RemindMe! Oct 18th Download PayDay on Steam!   It wasn't just based on the poorly optimized crap Watch Dogs is. I play BF4 a lot and there were some AMD-related memory leaks that were never fixed, and the game crashed if I tried enabling MSAA. Not to mention AC Unity and Far Cry 4 are coming out soon :)   Yeah I said medium because I kept in mind graphical evolutions like the Unreal Engine 4. Well, I'm glad to know that :)   I had an old HD5850 from when I built my PC in late 2009.  It was starting to suck on games like Watch Dogs and 1-2 months ago I decided to get a MSI GTX 760 Twin Frozr 2gb for 234 (cheapest I could find).   Should I have waited for a price drop and got the 770? Will this card + my i7 920 @stock still run games in medium 1080p 60fps in 2-3 years?   ^THIS. Youtube has such an aggressive compression I have to upscale some videos to 4K for them to look like 1080p.   This is the first time it happened to me. Well, it happens a lot with the ragdoll physics, but not while I'm still trying to kill the dude.   AWS has infinite ammo, I just didn't stop shooting :p      Damn ._. Overly manly grandpa   My grandfather once told me something I consider to be incredibly useful and valuable to me. It was a story, back from the old days when he worked. His workplace had a cafeteria, which sometimes had a full stock of food and beverages. Certain greedy workers noticed this and started taking them home and/or wasting them. And of course, after a while, there weren't enough food and beverages.  "If we use our resources slowly, they'll always be enough.  But if we get greedy and abuse them, they'll never be enough".  Fortunately he's still alive, but since he's 81, I fear it won't be for long :(    I changed the birth date of some friends' Green Cards so they could go to a club (took a copy and photoshopped them). According to them, it worked.   Not being able to hold a conversation. Sucks when I ask a long question and she replies "yeah" or "lol".    Hardline is good enough, but not for full price. It's like a cops   criminals DLC to BF4. I'll probably buy it, but for a VERY discounted price on G2A (25-30).   Rich people sure know how to live.   But if you oppose to it, you're an evil nazi and the cancer of society. This isn't Sweden but I bet they have really similar situations. Where hard working people sponsor the life of those who don't contribute to society...   It would be considered racism if there were blondes touching black kids' skin and hair instead.   Someone link to the thread :p   God bless Vikings and their fast Internet connections.   When people said Internet in the US was bad in many areas, I was thinking of 5-10mb. But certainly not that O_O   Yet another reason to love Norway   Pale girls with blonde hair and blue eyes.   A woman pregnant with triplets was a victim in a robbery, and was shot 3 times in the belly. She went to the doctor and he said although the bullets reached the triplets, it wasn't in a critical zone, and eventually the bullets would come out their bodies. 2 healthy girls and a boy were born.  After 12 years, one of the girls was peeing, when she peed the bullet.  - "Mommy, some metal thing just came out of me" - she said. So, mom explained to her what had happened when she was pregnant. A week after that, the other girl was peeing, the same thing happened, and the mom explained it again.  After another week, the boy was in the bathroom and calls his mom.  - "Mom, you won't believe what just happened!" - he screamed.  - "It's OK son, you just peed some metal thing, wasn't it?" - she replied.  - "What? No! I was masturbating here in the bathroom when suddenly our dog died".   Did he have to disassemble, debug and patch the projector? :)   Model from Google Earth :p   That only happened with Sniper Elite 3, as far as I know. And I'm sure that with G2A shield you'd get this problem sorted out.   PhysX would be nice and it sounds plausible, considering previous GTAs were part of the TWIMTBP program.   They'll probably be enhancing DRM and downgrading the graphics. Bunch of crooks   I'm rather new to the Battlefield universe. I've only played BF3 (singleplayer) and BF4 (singleplayer + 400 hours of multiplayer) and I like the fact they offer modern warfare, but not futuristic (at least, not that much until Final Stand). I just don't care for futuristic games with robots and super galactic weapons and stuff like that. I think Titanfall and COD are already enough when it comes to this matter, despite their differences to Battlefield.   Then again, I might be wrong. I didn't play BF2142 after all. What's your opinion?   Ah I see. Thanks!   Oh, I see. thanks!   Every combination is wrong in Medal of Honor (assuming the missing letter/number if after "DAD"   Someone used Medal of Honor and didn't say anything.   I don't get it?  	37
 What about acid? (low doses)   Temazepam is good. A lot of people actually say Xanax is the most recreational BENZO, but etizolam (pretty sure that's RC, if its not been regulated yet) is considered to be extremely recreational to some but I've heard some people don't feel anything from it but still black out somehow. I also think Midazolam is one of the more recreational benzos out there too but I believe it's pretty sedating and creates a lot of amnesia (they use it as a sort of pre anesthetic). I also believe Flunitrazepam is considered really, really recreational. Basically what I'm getting at is that it all depends on the person and what that person personally wants out of a drug and how they react to it.   Edit: Benzos all in all aren't considered that recreational though, but alot of people obviously do find them recreational.    Promethazine is shit. I don't know why people like to take it with codeine. In large doses it blocks dopamine receptors and is a mild antipsychotic.    [Everyone please send them this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJGl0FQK9Ew)   Good question.   I don't think it's neurotoxic no. I believe oxycodone is derived from the thebaine part of opium.   Are you considering rape, sir?   You either missed out on a good dick suck or you dodged an STI/STD.   Fuck seroquel lol. I take that for the real reasons it's prescribed (schizophrenia) and that shit will knock you out no matter what, and if you have to wake up early for school or work it'll still be sedating as fuck.   I'm a certified reddit doctor and I think it's foot cancer.    It's just the oxy, this is what opiates do that's why people get addicted to things like heroin.    [that was dreadful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjnkV_tsjn0)   Because opiates are better than sex?   Medications have never stopped the cognition decline for me. It feels like I'm developing dyslexia and fucking dementia right now.    You're right, they do get rid of the positive symptoms for a while but they're never completely gone. Negative symptoms have probably interfered with my life more than the positive, I think.   Pretty much just described what basic methylphenidate is also, both have the same effects more or less except ritalin will only last around an hour.    Isn't there images released now that show him with his thumb practically blown off from the recoil of the shotgun?   There was quite a lot of heroin found in his blood when they found his body.    Nirvana is my favourite band and kurt cobain is probably my favourite person that I never knew personally. RIP brother.   Have to keep up the health while injecting some tar.    People say valium but I believe he was prescribed rohypnol.   WAIT, WHAT YEAR IS THIS?   Ethylphenidate, Methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are all my faves.   Not even... Wait, I'm smoking it right now.   I've been on old anti psychotics and new ones, and the current one I'm supposed to take is Seroquel and it feels like a fucking elephant is jumping on your back.   The hard drugs I currently do are anything opiate.    Antipsychotics are completely shit, it's extremely hard to function on most of them, and then when you find a drug that's deemed "illegal" but helps you and you can still function, psychs will still say it'll make you worse.    [After a few months it just becomes as boring as breathing air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0cQSFCSENI)   INTP and pretty much do opiates exclusively.    Not read it yet but I like the title, you like Nirvana?   It's fucking Tuesday here.   Would probably be listed as a Schedule 1 movie.    Not even close.   Okay... /u/iCoy told you why scamming ruins the game and you just replied with, 100% irrelevant, as if you don't care that people get scammed (or you don't think its that bad that it can ruin a game) therefore you probably have scammed people in the past, think about it...   "Scammer spotted" means I molest children, you should work for the FBI.    Scammer spotted.    I remember when I was off for a year and came back, got 1 win and went back to MG2.   Maybe he doesn't get 144fps+ in other games?   Yeah, I use 1024x768 with -freq 75 but 1080p 60hz on my desktop, definitely makes the game a lot smoother.    I don't think I've ever actually seen 2G.    IV morphine is stronger than oral oxycodone, so if OP is willing to shoot some morphine up then it would be: Hydro, Morphine (oral), Oxycodone, Morphine (IV) etc.    Heroin WILL kill you, you don't even need to OD you will just magically DIE because you're using HEROIN, did you know that? We just use things in the hospital setting and sometimes outside the hospital that is around 90x stronger called fentanyl, BUT ITS HEROIN THAT DOES IT NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE ITS ILLEGAL.   Edit: Quote: "Give an addict heroin and there is a chance they will die. Not because of fentanyl. But because they are an addict that is doing heroin."... This whole article is retarded.    Fuck her and fuck this generation that don't give a fuck about anyone else and are so fucking naturally narcissistic... I'm sorry for your loss, it would devastate me if someone I loved died.    Everyone on reddit is a pharmacologist or a dr.    Finally something creepy on here.    [You tried, that's all that counts](http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/86116-At-Least-You-Tried.png)   You should draw more, and maybe in colour?

I may be wrong or misunderstanding here but it said, "The SURVIVAL rate of the current outbreak is around 40%", not the fatality rate.   Holy shit... I thought I was crazy for the longest time, I do this too.    It's not got withdrawals anywhere close to heroin, but the psychological addiction is definitely comparable.   Edit: Might be a stupid question but what exactly is poppers? The poppers I know about are like the solvent things, like "Isopropyl nitrite".   Opium has been used for thousands of years, it should be socially acceptable as much as alcohol but of course it's not because of the propaganda that's been fed to us for the last 50-60 years. Alcohol is such a dirty drug as well (even compared to opiates) because it acts on so much receptors, obviously mainly NMDA and GABA, but there quite a lot of receptors it acts on directly and indirectly.   I don't hope that alcohol comes out of "social acceptance". I just hope that other drugs can enter social acceptance as well.    I have a retarded habit of replying to people before reading the whole thing, sorry, I get what you mean now. They thing is though that you would have to spike someone constantly for months and months before they got psychosis.    You could make a medication up? I know this isn't based on real drugs but a lot of movies, books etc. do it. You could get a collection of what people are saying here and mix them all and make one up based on real stuff? Just a thought.    Psychosis isn't fun...    And not just alcohol poisoning, it can actually kill you when you attempt to stop after a long time of usage.   Fentanyl patches are kinda weird, they have hot spots. Basically one part of the patch can have WAAAAY more than the rest of the patch, and the other patch will have a different "hot spot" than the last. I would cut them up really small and stick them on or something, without a really beafy tolerance there's a pretty big risk of overdosing. Don't fuck about man, fent is around 100x (if not more) potent than morphine.    Alcohol withdrawals don't just make you feel like you're dying, they can actually kill you, it can also cause a form of dementia... I never understand why alcohol is considered socially acceptable.    They sure as hell never look normal even when they get their alcohol. Must be a shitty life when you're addicted to it.    Beer shots, lol...    I wonder why alcoholics sit up and drink all night all day everyday for months and months, kinda like my dad. Are they no longer euphoric or are they still euphoric? I don't get it.    Yo doc, I got this growth on my groin.  Anyway, Abilify is also an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor.    I feel your pain. I'm not on any benzos currently but I'm on a moderate dose of seroquel (after trying a few other anti psychotics) shit will make you feel like you're just a body with no brain or emotion.    Hell, there's been studies out there that say nicotine can just be as addictive as things like cocaine and certain opiates.    Whats wrong with being weird? Much better than boring.    How so? Can you explain at all?   Meth isn't a dirty drug chemically, it's just the way it's made in those random shitty clandestine "labs". It's used in America as a treatment for severe ADHD and possibly severe obesity (if nothing else has worked). The name for it is Desoxyn.    Some people don't know shit about drugs and/or brain chemistry, you shouldn't hate on them for not knowing that stuff but instead you should just try and educate them.    I've never really had a comedown from tramadol, maybe a bit of a headache and nausea but thats it, it's not a stimulant though, it's an opioid with SNRI activity.    They're really good if you've been constipated for days or you need to stay awake for something, or at a party. Other than that, it's such a waste of your day due to the comedown.    For me it's methylphenidate (ritalin) when snorted. That shit also made me look for some powder on the carpet, like a crack head.    He could be a chemist and he makes really pure coke. /u/ex-ALT can you make me some coke bro?   Ritalin (methylphenidate) is insanely euphoric, especially with alcohol but that comedown made me think I had a brain hemorrhage.    You should do it like cocaine, snort lines every hour... This may be flawed.    Try normal methylphenidate, that comedown made me feel like my head was gonna explode. Good drug though.   Do people still think that you can get rid of drugs? We've been taking substances for thousands and thousands of years.   This is so fucked up, holy shit. His mind was literally gone.    It's weird that heroin and morphine are a little different, mainly because heroin really only works because it breaks down into morphine.    You should get that checked out.    Plugging isn't always that great. If you haven't shat in a while then it'll just go into the shit and not work.

Opiates don't really cause organ damage long term, and if they do it's extremely rare. Everyone thinks that heroin, morphine etc. cause liver damage, but that's untrue. Cigarettes are worse than opiates because they have a lot of strong carcinogens in them, which WILL eventually cause some sort of cancer, maybe in 10 years or maybe in 40 years of smoking, but it will happen. Opiates can cause your immune system to weaken, but not to the point of something like AIDS or anything, just minorly fuck up your immune system.   Also, they reason he said it should be legalized is because it would decrease the amount of OD's, yeah there will still be people who intentionally overdose or just overdose accidentally, but it would decrease.

I've not posted here in a while because I've been doing pretty okay, not great not bad, about a 6-7/10 though. But I do have one big problem that I can't get over and that's pretty bad memory loss, I'd say it's gone from mild to moderate pretty fast (a few months) I'm not sure if this is related to schizophrenia, meds or some other health problem (definitely not aging because I'm not old enough for dementia). I'm currently on 150-200mg of seroquel. I get confused pretty regularly, but not soo often, I've forgotten things I've literally JUST done about 2 seconds ago (confirmed by family members), I'm forgetting what to write right now actually, I just don't know really what's going on or happening, but yet I do, it's literally like things will just not hold up in my head, I do something forget it, do something else forget it, It feels like I'm forgetting everything. Someone will tell me to do something and I'll forget they ever even told me to do that a few mins later.   The worst part though Is I just generally feel really confused and as if I'm forgetful in the moment about everything... Can anyone tell me why this is? Is it schizophrenia, med related? Or something else?  I feel it's a lot more than mild forgetfulness, I just know I'm forgetting things really bad because other people are telling me in the moment, and confusion is really bothering me, i feel like I just can't remember most shit.   Anyone help?    Just wondering, what exactly was it that you done?   Oxymorphone has the worst bio orally, it's like 10%. At least hydromorphone is like 30%.

After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately.

Does Max Fisher do any research before publishing things?  Alia Salem added 2 new photos.  March 5 at 9:55pm  Dallas, TX  Edited    Assalamu Alaikum  Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:  I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night.   Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:  -Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago   - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males   - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*  - There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.  - They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.  - The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working. After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:  - They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.  - The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.  - They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.  In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.  Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.  "Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.   https://www.facebook.com/alia.rafik/posts/10153190974039113  https://archive.today/DzhRq                                                                                                            [SUPREME COURT ORDER ON FERGUSON CASES](http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/b6/3b6bcb5c-e8a5-55b3-a7ff-65ad706b328d/54fe2ae3f0889.pdf.pdf#zoom=100 amp;view=FitBH)  [Rockmeyer Resignation Press Pelease](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1683817-brockmeyer-resignation-press-release.html)         [SUPREME COURT ORDER ON FERGUSON CASES](http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/b6/3b6bcb5c-e8a5-55b3-a7ff-65ad706b328d/54fe2ae3f0889.pdf.pdf#zoom=100 amp;view=FitBH)  [Rockmeyer Resignation Press Pelease](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1683817-brockmeyer-resignation-press-release.html)                           From the little information you gave it sounds like you are looking for secular seasonal Hebrew songs for the fall.

       Taken   I guess this advice thread was safe for your work    Only problem is they set the comments to hot and not top   That's exactly why       Did he actually say that?            I'm American and go to a public high school with very little blacks, they're racist here and I can't go a day without hearing a negative tone towards my skin color and I live on the suburbs. I used to go to a very big high school with many blacks and they are just as racist because I'm darker than most.    I'm 100% sure it will, but there's no proof, yet.    Lego movie       Can you buy this?   Can't prove it   There's no vents on top of the ps4 tho       My moms Somalian and every Somalian girl in America I know knows the language but the guys don't speak one word if it. Why?         When I meant quality I meant enjoyment    I wanna give quality entertainment, I don't care about imaginary points    :(                        I've never been vaccinated and I don't get sick often. I'm not saying I'm immune or that it's bad I just never got one so your gonna refuse my education?   Anddddd now I'm jerking off       Day most of America was independent. Some people didn't know yet because news hadn't spread quickly enough but it's when most of America knew    Same thing, doesn't really matter what you call it    I heard that you could permanently change it on your local server      That booty ain't pre-teen  	40
 The same thing happened to me on my birthday. I got multiple bottles of whiskey, whiskey glasses, whiskey stones for keeping it cool and apparently no one had discussed what to get me.   Still unsure about the connoisseur vs. alcoholic part though.    I'm 32 and I never thought that I would wind up working with my dad, but here we are.  I'm now one of the partners in the business and doing very well. Sometimes following the family business can work to your advantage, but don't expect it to fall into your lap. As the son of the boss I have to work twice as hard as others but I'm also the best at my job and most likely to take over. Surprisingly, I really enjoy my work and my dad and I work well together.  I also never could have imagined getting married and having kids, especially since I was never really outgoing. It's highly recommended; best thing I ever did.    I don't know about bison, but with African buffalo the herd is all that matters. Often when one is injured and trying to follow the herd it will be cast out by the other buffalo and even attacked so that it won't draw predators towards the rest of the herd.    The Jackson family, all of them. They are trying so hard to cling to something, but come off looking like the most greedy and uncaring family ever.   Thanks for the reply!   I noticed from your photos that there were no charging stations in Canada.  I know there are none in my area, but did you find any along the way? Hopeful Canadian here.    This is courtesy of Dr. Jack Wheeler from his To The Point News newsletter.   Customer: Hi; how much is your paint?  Clerk: Well sir, that depends on a lot of things.  Customer: Can you give me an approximate price?  Clerk: Our lowest price is our introductory special at $12 a gallon; after that we have dozens of different prices up to $199.  Customer: What is the difference in the quality of the paint?  Clerk: Oh, there is really no difference; its all exactly the same stuff.  Customer: Well, in that case Ill take your $12 paint.  Clerk: Well actually the $12 variety is only available to you on our website. If you want to buy it here at the store youll be charged an additional $20 Customer Convenience Fee.  Customer: So if I go home and get if off the website its only $12?  Clerk: That is correct, Sir--- plus a Credit Card Usage Fee of $6 and then of course there is the standard Shipping and Handling Fee of $14.  Customer: What?!! So, in other words, buying online would cost me exactly the same as what Id have to pay here in the store?  Clerk: I suppose so, but if you buy it here you get to use it immediately. Online purchases take ten business days to get to you, unless you pay the optional $24 Express My Paint fee.  Customer: You have got to be kidding me?!! Arent you?  Clerk: Well no, Sir; but that is academic anyway as right now the $12 paint is completely sold out in both places.  Customer: Thats BS! I am looking at shelves full or the stuff!  Clerk: Ah, but that does not mean that it is available for sale. We sell only a certain number of introductory priced cans on any given day. Oops, look at that! It just became available again at $17.50.  Customer: Cmon! You mean to say it went up while Im standing here?  Clerk: Fraid so. Inventory control changes our prices all the time. I strong urge you to purchase your paint as soon as possible as it could go up again. How many gallons do you want?  Customer: Well, maybe three gallons. No, make that four; I dont want to run out. I assume I can return anything I dont open?  Clerk: Certainly, Sir. The $12 paint is non-refundable, but if you return it within 48 hours you will be entitled to a $4 credit towards the future purchase of another gallon of the same colour paint at the same or higher price.  Customer: That is crazy! In that case Ill just give any unopened can to my brother as hes planning to repaint his home soon.  Clerk: Sorry, Sir, no-can-do! Our terms and CAN-ditions- -- thats a little in-house paint joke--- prohibit paint transfer. It is strictly for the use of the original purchaser.  Customer: But wait a minute; I hadnt spotted those Paint Sale-$9.99* a Can signs over there. That sound like a much better deal.  Clerk: Ah yes, thats from our low cost paint division. That asterisk denoted that the cans are actually half gallons and the price is based on a minimum purchase of two. There is also an additional Environmental Fee of $5 per can; a non-refundable Can Deposit of $3.50; a Paint Facility Charge of $5 and if you want more than one color, the second has a $25 surcharge and the third is $5 extra.  Customer: This is ridiculous; to hell with it. Ill buy what I need elsewhere.  Clerk: Well sir, you may be able to buy paint for some rooms from another store but you wont be able to find the paint for your connecting hall and stairway anywhere but here. And I should point out to you that if you want Uni-Directional paint it is priced at $249 a gallon.  Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $199?  Clerk: Sir, that is only if you paint non-stop all the way around the room and back to the point at which you started. Stairways and hallways are considered unidirectional one way exceptions to the rule.  Customer: So, if I buy the $199 point and use it in my hallways and stairs what are you going to do about itsend some goons in to paint over it?  Clerk: Sir, I believe you are getting it now. But no, please, that would be plain silly. Wed simply charge you a Direction Adjustment Fee plus the difference to the $249 on your next purchase.  Customer: New Purchase?!! No way! I am out of here.  Clerk: We at Skyhigh Paints never forget that you have a choice, so thanks for shopping with us and have a nice day. Bye bye!  And aint that just exactly how it is these days?       Is it bad that the funniest thing about this picture is your ears?  	10
 Newsfire   http://apidock.com/               Speaking from experience, unless you're only translating one or two word phrases, or very simple and unambiguous phrases ("this is a pen"), Google translation, and similar online services, are useless as the translation is more likely to be wrong than right.     Advantages over cron that I can see:  * Access to your rails environment. (Okay, cron could call a rake task that loads the environment. But this is simpler as it's right in your rails project. No need to mess with editing crontab as root.) * Ability to set up and/or trigger scheduled tasks dynamically based on user input.     but changing IRB.conf[:PROMPT][:DEFAULT][:RETURN] to simply "%s" doesn't return the same results as irb_rocket (output on the same line rather than on the next line) I'm making the wrong change?     Built fine for me on 10.5.6   Yes!! A big win for both projects, and most importantly, for the users. Congratulations.   This series of interviews needs a new title. Judging by the content so far, it's aimed squarely at beginners who know very little about Ruby, and mostly states stuff that's widely known from those who follow Ruby at all. That doesn't make it bad, it's just not about "little known ways" to "ruby mastery".    Thinkpad (Lenovo) is the best, IMO. But I've run Ubuntu on Dell and HP laptops too without problems. Forget about the company shipping with Ubuntu; just wipe the drive and install Ubuntu on top--or keep the Windows OS on there and dual-boot if you like.   The main thing is to stay away from certain incompatible wireless and video chipsets. The safest is to pick a laptop that has Intel video and Intel wireless--they're almost certain to work with Ubuntu out of the box.    Personally, I'm happy with prototype and the Rails helpers.   Rails-Footnotes has more info, though I like the bar idea. Maybe the two could be combined.   http://github.com/drnic/rails-footnotes           Love the macros! Maybe I'll actually start writing tests for my apps now :-P    	18
 How Can Anime Be Real If Our Michelangelos Aren't Real   Shut up my mom said it does YOU GUYS ARE JUST JEALOUS THAT IM MICHELLE ANGELINA   Yo tambin, gracias   That was unexpectedly deep   Obvious troll is obvious   My new one did . It still does .   How Can Real Be Jesus If Our Jesus Jesus Jesus?   I bet gay people are gay.   I read your username and thought you were a novelty account that just wrote comments in caps lock, "shouting". I was disappointed.   As an argentinian I was in the verge of having a massive heart attack from beggining to ending. It was incredibly overwhelming.   Mayweather will earn 15 million USD per *round*. Jesus Christ.   u wot m8   Free here in Argentina! Come and watch here, we have nachos and beer.   Jesus Christ Marie, they're minerals   No, that's called being an awkward fuck.   Not with that attitude   It actually does. 78523 is the first "z", 96541 is the second one, and the rest is a square around the numpad.   That sucks, man, sorry to hear that.

This got ~5k upvotes for a reason, not all the people see the posts when first posted. I didn't for example, and I'm fairly sure the vast majority of those who upvoted it didn't also.   Hahaha god, I can't stop laughing. This sounds exactly like my luck.   Say something out loud now or you'll have a really shitty year.  *God I hope you're superstitious*   Omg, I need to show someone this now...    *MOM!*     The looks of it wrongly resembled to me like those pictures, and also the fact that they were 1 athom thick. It's really cool that I was wrong though! I would love to see those in person!   "This moment today, now, this that you are reading, will be a memory 50 years from now. It already is. You are already remembering this, and 50 years have passed. It's 2065 and this present once future will also become a past".   It's not true now in 2015, but it will be sometime. And maybe you'll look back and remember this. It's crazy to think that today, tomorrow, and the next days will be a memory in your head. Time spares no one!   The moment you find out, it's just like you are waiting for him to pop out and say "ha! Gotcha! It was only a joke". It feels so surreal, so impossible. It doesn't seem logical. Alas, such is life, you truly never ever know when is your time.   This is taken by an electric microscope, right? What if we add "with the naked eye" to OP's question?  Edit: downvotes for asking a question? Way to go /r/askscience!   Yeah I did that too and fully regretted it as well, he's a cool dude.    Haha, calling someone gay on the internet. Classic.   Well, I suspected that too, because in spanish at least the option is called "risk your life", but I choose it anyways because fuck it, I believe it's worth fighting those fucking dudes before betraying your friends. Lore-wise I believe that's what Franklin would choose as well.   You're right.    Isn't it perfect that it was voiced by Steven Ogg though? Like in, Steve-O?       You're right. Thanks for pointing that out.   I mean, OP's complaining about a Reddit fanatic that spends every minute of his day here and describes a pretty unique and identificable work situation with lots of details... on Reddit. Yeah, I'm going on a limb and say this is a very fake TIFU. It's obvious that OP knows the *worst* thing he can do (unless he blatantly wants his coworker to find out that he's annoying him) is post it here, doesn't make much sense.   I understood it, and explained it earlier in a lower post.   Then come over to /r/thatHappened, we've even got $200% and $420% real legit stories!   Those two were rethorical questions.   This is why we have /r/thatHappened, to post ONLY legit $100% stories!   The fact that you can't properly contextualise analogies and believe that I'm saying Valve = a SO/person in absolutely every aspect just because I compared exageratedly to prove a point how bashing something you may like again in the future may not be the best choice and interpreted that as me being a fanboy shows me how delusional you are.  I believe that needed more commas, but well. Put a hip hop beat on the background and it'll read better.   Of course it is, that's why I also disagree with the "let's all hail the allmighty Valve". That's exactly why people went to the other extreme all of the sudden, because they were on one extreme to begin with.  If you love anything as obsessively as PCMR did with Valve and NEVER criticise any aspect or bad decision, of course it's going to blow up as soon as they make the first very bad move.  This is why this subreddit has NOT to go back again to love Valve as they were the cure for all known diseases. As you say, it's just a company. I still believe a great one, but a company nonetheless.   Very interesting read! Thanks for the link.   Can't we just point a super high concentrated laser beam (something like 50kw) so we can see with the naked eye the light that bounces back?   The only thing I disagree with was the bashing with "What has Valve done in the few years for us?" and mega-lists of "look at the reasons for how Valve has sucked in the last decade". Those are words you can't take back.    I always felt that they were going to back out from this decision in the first week or two, that's why I didn't engage in bashing the company's name. It's like having a fight with your SO and start spreading that she/him is a shitty partner, that she's a liar, etc, to all of your friends, and then coming back with her after fixing things. The people who you complained to don't forget the things you've said.    Now, they may be true but there was no need in pointing out lists of only bad choices Valve has done and upvoting them to heavens with x5 golds. My reaction was "where was all hatred this last week?", and now "where is all this hatred now?" It's what's wrong with going from loving something, hating it, and then loving it again.  EDIT: TIL: don't use overly exagerated analogies, Reddit likes to interpret things very literally and believes I see a game company as my soulmate.   Very well done! Now that I think about it, Trevor has a certain resemblance to Knoxville   I have not thought of this. Now I can not not think of this.    Fuck, washing your hands with that soap, never again.   Every account on reddit is a bot except you.   Waits 3 weeks   Could it be possible in the near future that videocards come with vram slots? Imagine buying vram sticks   Dont worry, I laugh fully erect too all the time.   Yeah, that e: thing is not going to happen.   And therefore $100    Hey cousin, let's go bowling!   Buenisimo!

Yes   Is it common for RAID 0 to break?   No. Not anymore. /3   For starters, I think Stiller did an excellent job and that he is an amazing actor. I just think maybe the movie would be (in my opinion and to my taste, that is) a little better if it would've been made in a more serious tone, with different casting.  For example, the role Seann Penn plays and how its portraited feels to me spot-on. I think he's a very serious, dark, and interesting character in a movie that has *some* silly-comedy bits, and would be better accompanied by a movie that goes along with that theme.    All of that aside, I think it's an excellent movie. It made me cry, laugh, and it has that "Into the Wild" thing where you finish watching it and want to just go and ride a bike through the world.   I believe that kid is photoshopped there, although its a pretty weird picture even without the boy.   Triggered.   Instructions unclear, penis stuck in red paperclip   I watched it really high the first time, and couldn't believe what I was watching. The music and the photography are incredible. I cried in the part that plays that Bowie's song, in the bar, where he has to decide whether he goes to the chopper or not.    Upon watching it a few more times I believe it's an amazing film but could've been better with better less comedy-like casting. I don't think Ben Stiller was the best choice for that part.   She very clearly told him at the beginning she wasn't interested in anything serious.       500 days of summer helped me a lot to "forgive" my ex for dumping me. I was in a lot of anger towards her, she didn't cheat on me or anything like that as far as I know, but I was very angry still. After the day we broke up I didn't talk to her and I distanced myself completely as I knew it was for the best, but I was still very hurt.     That film made me realize she hadn't done anything wrong. The relationship wasn't the same in a long time and she acted in behalf of her own well being and made the decision she thought was best at the moment, how can I blame her for that? Why should I blame a person for taking a decision that they thought makes them happier? If I think I own that right upon someone, the selfish one is me, not them.      Goddamnit Collin   Are you for real?   *hangs up*   Try me in 17985 years   (   )    Well fuck   I agree but I think it's mostly because there are two groups, the ones that desire to change the banner and the ones who doesn't give a fuck if they change it or not.   I don't see how anybody besides incredibly stupid people could be offended by that joke. It's a joke about misunderstanding the real meaning of the phrase "Jesus died for our sins so that we don't have to *(die for our sins)*".       /* Begin OH MAN */   Queen is bad   Made up?

Mods check every story if it reaches the frontpage, of course this happened.   *Gotta do them all!*   Athlon x3, 4GB DDR2 and 460 SE here, the feels are being felt indeed :(   Thanks! It's really easy to make them,[ here's a tutorial](http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/little-planet-photos-5-simple-steps-to-making-panorama-worlds)   Great panoramas!   I made some polar coordinates out of the 3 I liked more just for fun, they didn't turn out great because these aren't 360 panoramas but I think they look cool still haha http://imgur.com/a/1InQD     *sound*     You think wrong, I've never believed we were in the right to reclaim them, mainly because they have been occupied for about 190 years now, it doesn't make much sense. If you do some reading you'll find out that the war in 82 was only by and for the dictatorial government to remain in power longer, they actually never had the desire to regain the islands.   Wow, didn't even notice that haha. I'm beggining to think I spend way too much time in here, lol   Woosh   You were right!  	105
 I've actually noticed that aswell, my phone takes amazing photos, it is defiantly in the top 2 phones for image quality, yet my friends with i phone 5's get nice insta photos, when you think about it, it's kinda prejudice     Today I noticed on my task bar a strange program opening and closing in a split second, I was quite concerned of what it was, I have never seen this before, I tried grabbing a screenshot of the logo that was being displayed on the taskbar http://imgur.com/KlHmE2o      I also tried clicking on the program to see if any window came up, luckily one did, I managed too get a half assed screen shot of the message, slightly translucent, but readable  http://imgur.com/f1CuXkw      Any help would be so awesome guys   Can't you just place your stun to anti engage?   Straya cunt  	4
 I'm not going to be *that guy* and repeat it.  Basically, /u/IHaveAGloriousBeard, is wishing that it was easier to get housing in the game for the ability to have a space to be creative is what intrigues him about MMOs.  My guess is that they wish housing was cheaper than it is, or didin't require an obscene amount of time to get to the point that you can own housing in the game.   Out of context, it seems as though he isn't miserly but the fact is that he [around chapter 80-ish spoilers](/s "was given one million yen to get out of the mansion and get through the day because he saw Nagi changing.")  Given the money and the chance to, he would help those in need like he did. He still has the debt of 150 million yen. (~1.5 million dollars)   Nope. If you try the trial, you would still have to buy the game. (Which includes a 1 month subscription)   I used to think $15 a month was a lot but when you think about it, $15 is the same as going out to eat lunch once a month or three trips to Starbucks for a lot of hours of entertainment.   I don't see why not, it is the same as if I were to buy the collector's edition right now. Those 30 days are part of the cost of the game and it is no different than buying a month subscription.  So to get more out of it, try the trial and get up to 20 in as many classes as possible (or that you want) and then add the 1 month subscription.   Amagi Brilliant Park   I am not guaranteeing anything, but I saw that back when 2.3 dropped they had a free login weekend where anyone who had purchased the game in the past could play for free so they might have it for 2.5.   PS: I am not affiliated with Square Enix so this is just speculation.   Seems as such, but you would have to make a new Square Enix account according to the restrictions here: http://support.na.square-enix.com/faqarticle.php?id=5382 la=1 kid=70929 ret=main (Also, you wouldn't have your progress from when you had the subscription since you are on a new account.)  One cool thing about FFXIV, that I have gleaned from the trial, is that one character can be all of the classes and they level/spec differently. (Even better is that you can share some abilities with other classes such as being an archer but using the archanist's physick for healing)   Yeah, all of those characters are from [August's visual novels.](https://vndb.org/p95)    Yep, you are right. They always thought that she was a guy because she never talked.   I would imagine that the fantasia potion would allow what it allows now though.   If you have the game, try the free trial which allows you to play up to level 20 on each class and get a feel for it.  NOTE: If you have the retail copy DO NOT get the free trial through Steam for you would have to buy it through Steam to continue.   Something like fantasia would work for in the first episode of the first season one of the characters, Akatsuki, ~~is brought in as a male ninja but she is female~~ through the use of a potion similar to fantasia, she was able to change her appearance to her actual ~~gender and~~ stature.  Also, it is a really good show for MMO players as they use different mechanics such as the idea of cooldowns and effects and what not.    They could be on a mobile device.   Actually, like /u/EnduranceProtocol said, you can flair on mobile. You have to put []\(#request) in the beginning of the body of your post.  I have flaired it accordingly for you.   The app has always been free...   Sometimes I love reddit and the fact the people can have the exact same thought when faced with an image like this.   /r/anime has a really good wiki page about where to start with the Fate/___ Series. You can find the link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate#wiki_where_should_i_start.3F)   Personally, that would be even more confusing to people. While I get your point, it would be too "wordy" to fit as a flair and it would be a pain in the rear for mobile users to type it out.   Probably about $600-700 through various sites like the usual mTurk and PerkTV along with that M Ms promotion where I made about $150 from it.   No problem! I didn't mean to sound as harsh as I did.   [](#meta)  With the recent influx of posts with incorrect flair, I'd like to clarify the definitions of the various flair/tags.   ##Which flair should I use?  Flair type | Description | Example 1 | Example 2 :--|:--|:--|:-- **Request** | Requesting anime based on information you provide | "Anime where the main character stops taking crap from the tsundere heroine and starts to dislike her?" | "I loved Mirai Nikki. Any suggestions?" **Suggestion** | Suggesting anime to others | "Psycho-Pass is a 2012 show written by Urobochi Gen. It is a smart, dark sci-fi criminal story set in weird utopia/dystopia. The protagonist is a rookie cop on hunt for a serial killer." | "If you like Asimov, robotics, or Spielberg's A.I., watch Eve no Jikan" **Manga/LN/VN** | Requests or suggestions specifically about manga, light novels, or visual novels | "Manga in which the characters go to the Moon and has some romance?" | "I enjoyed Katawa Shoujo, what other VNs would be good to play?" **Identification **\* | Help identifying something (a gif, something from your memory, etc.) | "Help me ID an anime with man wrestling a deer." | "Anyone know what anime this GIF is from. It consists of a stylist who is working on a panda." **Question** | General questions about a series| "In what order should I watch Ghost in the Shell?"| "Steins;Gate: English dubbed or subbed?" **Meta** | Posts that discuss the subreddit itself| "Guide to tagging your post with flair"| "Just want to say it's nice to see the consistent suggestion posts and also want to welcome new frequent posters! Keep it up!"  \* When you submit an identification link, choose the `Identification ` flair. When someone answers your question, change it to `Identification ` so that users may know that your question has been solved.  --- To tag your post on mobile, you must have a special code **in the body of your post** when you submit.  Flair type | Code :--|:-- [Request]|**[]\(#request)** [Suggestion]|**[]\(#suggestion)** [Manga/LN/VN]|**[]\(#manga)** [Identification]|**[]\(#identification)** [Question]|**[]\(#question)** [Meta]|**[]\(#meta)**   You have the wrong flair. You are asking/***requesting*** show(s) for someone to watch.  I have changed it accordingly. Also **do not** put the flair in the title for it is redundant.   You had the wrong flair for you are asking/*requesting* shows, you need to use the "Request" flair.  I have changed it for you this time, but please remember to flair correctly in the future.   I'm really new to MMOs in general and I am trying the free trial. I see that if you don't buy the full version of the game within 90 days you lose your data.  If I do decide to upgrade, is there still a time limit for resubbing without losing your data/character(s)? (I'm asking because I am a college student and the semester starts soon. I might have more time over the summer to play which could warrant resubbing but I don't want to buy the game if there is still the possibility of losing my characters)   You could definitely make some money running those sites but you might want to look into selling the stories in example 1, linking to Amazon using an affiliate link in #2 and just having a good site in #3 to improve your income.  I, personally, make some money using adsense on my youtube channel but it isn't much. (That is also my fault for not growing/establishing an identity and not really editing my videos)  I cannot go into, minute, detail about my earnings but I have been paid twice.  You need to earn $100 in your adsense account before you cash out. You can set the type of ads that you want on each site individually. (I think... It has been awhile since I checked my account)   Thanks for doing this and your work throughout the season!   Most of the time when a show in announced at the end of a season, there is a one season gap between the announcement and when it airs. (ie. It was announced at the end of the Fall season so there is a high chance that it will air in the Spring)   I was shocked to see someone doing one of the characters from Payday. (The video game)   I have removed your post for there is a multitude of unmarked spoilers.   Please read rule #3:   Use spoiler codes (see below) and no spoilers in titles. If revealing spoilers is crucial to your post, do so in the body. We reserve the right to ban you if you do not follow this rule.    In the future, you might want to make the post like you did but also, send a link to the moderators to the post so that we can definitely see it.   I, personally, only check in on the subreddit once or twice a day and this would make it easier for the moderators to see and discuss the post.  I have gone ahead and done so there isn't a need to do so for this one.  --- I know I have double commented on the same post, but I didn't want to distinguish the other one since it was my own thoughts.   Personally, and this is just my opinion without asking any of other mods, I think that it should be under "Question" but I can see the need for this sort of flair. (This would have to be up to the mods as a collective to think of how to do it and, more importantly, how to add it to the CSS along with the mobile tagging system)   For some clarification, and this is how I think of it:  * **Request** is used when you are *asking* for a show.  * **Suggestion** is used when you are *giving* show(s) for people to watch.   Good luck, Reddit disapproves and could possibly shadowban you for continual self-promotion.   Something something /r/nocontext    You could always install a bidet in your toilet. Let it run for ~30-40 seconds and you should be good to go.   Unless you use a site that unshortens the link you have no idea where that link is going which creates a larger risk for malware and drive-by downloads.  There is also the fact that a lot of those link shortening sites are used to serve people ads and the person who posts the link gets a cut of the money.   It is going to be packed:  * F/SN UBW continuation  * Knights of Sidonia S2  * Yahari S2  * HS DxD S3 (If you are into that sort of thing)  * Shokugeki no Soma  * Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo  * Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (Haruhi spin-off with the original voice cast)  * Nisekoi S2  * Hibike! Euphonium (KyoAni's new show. [Here is the PV for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6B320TbJk))  * Hello! Kiniro Mosaic  * Gintama (S# whatever they are on now)   The new KyoAni show along with The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. (The new Haruhi spin-off anime)   Someone needs to make the "It's raining men" part a full AMV.   You might want to provide a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker profile/list so that people can get an idea of what you are looking for.  While it is a lot more light-hearted, you might want to try some anime in the "game" genre such as [Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo) or [No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life).   OP, you were requesting (asking for) shows not suggesting (giving) shows to watch.  I have changed your flair accordingly, but please try to select the appropriate one in the future.   Actually this shouldn't be "Suggestion" but "Request" for OP is asking for shows that are similar to ____.   Put that $50 towards your PC build.   [Osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh) is the first one that came to mind. The game is updated at least once a week with new features and bugfixes. What is really impressive is that the game is free, and there is only one guy working on it.   It was first released on September 17, 2007 and the updates have been continual since then.   Now I'm sad... I wonder how it will go from here.  Some speculations and thoughts on how it might progress:   * See how people react to her (Possibly the run in with her actual parents)  * Have the MC grow to love her  * Repercussions due to time travel  * Find a way to avoid the MC's death  * Any/all of the above   Thanks for doing this OP.   Sorry, all I did was reiterate what the [Steam page says.](https://i.imgur.com/30Cyqcm.png)  I've only ever played it on the PS3 when I got it through PS+.   Don't see why not. You might want to use some software to make the PS4 controller seem like a Xbox 360 one for minimal configuration.   You probably could. I was playing dolphin, the emulator, yesterday using my gamecube controller and the WiiU gamecube adapter and windows fews it as a normal controller.   I've heard good things about *Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons* and for $1.49 you can't go wrong. You WILL need a controller since the mechanic is that one analog stick is assigned to only one brother and the other one to the other brother.  Another recommendation that I have for people would be *Kerbal Space Program*. While it is in early access, the developers have been updating it for the past two years and the community has really grown by leaps and bounds so it would be worth it to get it now.   I got:  * Nikon D7100  * AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II Lens  * AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR Lens  * A carrying case  * 32 and 64GB SD card for said camera.  I am really looking forward to learning about and using this camera.   Just don't invite Mr. Nook.   The series is "[Domestic na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/manga.php?id=70941)". The current translator said that he/she would do it up through the third volume of the series. There are 30+ chapters out in Japanese and in English we are up to 11.   If you want work, stick around /r/manga for groups are always looking for new translators. I know of a series that the subreddit is really liking that will be losing its translator soon so you might be able to step in.    It is too early to sleep but I had to go up anyways so that "santa" (ie. My parents) could set up for Christmas. It happens every year, so I am used to it.   Could the guy been of asian descent? I know in Japanese, America is written as  which is "a-me-ri-ka" since they do not have a "ca" syllable. That could explain the hard consonant at the end.   Heck, you could loop the first ten or so seconds and it would seem to be a normal ringtone.   I have removed your post for you are looking for hentai and other NSFW content. This is against rule #4 of this subreddit. I don't make the rules, just enforce them.  You might want to look at getting/playing Nekopara which is coming out on the 30th on Steam (as an all ages version) or the 18+ version which will be released elsewhere online.     As a heads up, you will want to remember to flair your post with the appropriate flair. Since I am able to, I went ahead and did so.  You may also want to link to a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker/list site with what you have seen and liked.   As a heads up, you will want to remember to flair your post with the appropriate flair. Since I am able to, I went ahead and did so.  You may also want to link to a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker/list site with what you have seen and liked.   If the letter was sent in the US, you ought to check the ink stamped over the, well, stamp. That will show you which post office the sender used to send the letter.   There is also the Uncharted series.   Yeah, but wouldn't it make more sense to release it as a free app with ads so that a lot more people would download it within that period of time?   I'd get it, but it seems as though the app has ads even though it is a paid application. To me that is really annoying and if the general idea is that if you pay, you don't have ads.   Something something "Don't do it."  Followed by a post about how that in of itself is turning into a meme.  With that followed by a post with a copy/paste of that story/paragraph/run-on sentence.   Something something "one of us".  Still, I welcome his reviews and insight into the media.   There is also Nekopara, which is coming out on the 30th, that is pretty much the definition of "Moe".   No problem! I went to read the introduction and I saw it. I figured it got past the spell check since it was spelled correctly but it was the wrong word.   One thing you might want to fix in your introduction is that you have "right" when you meant "write".   If it is part of a daily/flash deal during the main sales, it will not go lower. If it isn't low enough for you, wait until the spring or summer sales.   I've been interested in Guild Wars 2 as an MMO since there isn't a need for a subscription but it doesn't seem to be bogged down by a pay to win cash shop like the "free"-to-play MMO's that are out there.  Part of my renewed interest in the game is that it is, currently, on sale over at Amazon and I was given a gift card for there and I could download it. Another part is due to watching Log Horizon which is the story of seasoned MMO players getting stuck in the MMO and their adaption, and the viewer's subsequent introduction, to the world which looks and operates much like an MMO. (It is actually a pretty good watch too, but I digress.)  A few questions I have:  * How is it holding up? (I know it came out a few years ago)  * How friendly is it to a new player? (This not only be how the game is for new folk, but also the reaction of the community to someone who is new)  * How big/organized are the quests/raids?  * What do you think of it?    If you want to see how someone made it into an actual sword replete with a live blade, [Man at Arms did a video about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obw19lRWO-Y)   Man, I hope the person who is doing Daitoshokan is able to keep up the pace. (They are translating ~3% every week! By extrapolation, the TL could be done around the middle of June.)   At least the other passengers could watch the movie, *Gone With the Wind*.   No problem!  It opens with the girls in a sauna replete with nudity and such.   WARNING: The first half of the chapter is NSFW!   I think the original *To Love-Ru* ran in Shounen Jump, so I imagine they can.   For those of you who are confused, here is the TV Tropes link with a description and examples of "tsundere".   http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere    What sucks is that there are maps that, basically, require the player to have a drawing pad/tablet to complete. (You are talking 1000+ pixel "jumps", which is the space between single notes. That is next to impossible to do with a mouse.)  As someone who plays with a mouse it is really annoying to have that type of map on an otherwise good song.   I'm not the person you responded to, but to find out:  1. Ask how early/late you were  2. Go back 9 months.  3. Apply how late/early you were  4. Now you know.   For those trying to find the link since it wasn't a featured article, here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_list/December_2014  Scroll down to December 19th.   How about submitting from a mobile device? If you are in an app or something like that you don't see it.   You'll have to find that on your own as you would, most likely, be downloading it illegally.   I've heard that it doesn't hold any punches in its content.   You might also want to read the mangaka's new work *Domestic na Kanojo* which is being translated at a pretty quick rate for the time being.   I can attest that restrictions on creativity can help spur it. I'm the type of person that can be creative but within a box (restrictions/ideas). Without it, I am useless.   Status update:  I was unable to save the Kerbal as the craft had mysteriously vanished. I have, however, managed to [land on the Mun twice](https://i.imgur.com/q9KGMWk.jpg) and [launch a working satellite.](https://i.imgur.com/lD70NLS.jpg)This is the beginning of the end of my free time.   You might also want to wait/try Nekopara. I've read the demo/trial and it seems to be a fun and light-hearted story. The main game comes out on December 30th.   Good grief.   Sorry, they went out of business a few years ago.   You can't when another program minimizes the screen for you without any warning or consent.   I was time warping to get a maneuver and I had the speed up pretty high (~1000x since I had a day-ish to skip) and all of a sudden ASUS WebStorage decides to tell me that I need to update by minimizing any fullscreen windows.  I was really annoyed as it took me awhile to find a maneuver that did what I needed on that mission and I didn't have an autosave that was recent.  I really wish there was a way to have the game pause when it is minimized.   My main issue with your comment is that you replied rejecting the recommendation that someone gave you. That, in of itself, is against the spirit and idea of this subreddit. There are many on here that would be more than willing to suggest things to people, but if the requester is going to reply back saying something along the lines of "This suggestion sucks" what do you think the suggester would think? It doesn't stop with that requester, what if there was a user who was visiting this subreddit for the first time, or wanted some interesting romance anime, saw this reply at the top?  "If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything." (ie. If you don't like a recommendation you are not obligated to reply.)   Like I said, screenshots won't do this series justice but if you want to be hard-headed so be it, but do not ridicule someone for their suggestion.  This sort of thing could undermine the purpose of this subreddit.  /u/FoleyX90, don't be discouraged from suggesting anime.     For clarification purposes:  * The "x" is for unsolved identification posts * The "check" is for solved identification posts.   I don't think Yuushibu would be a good thing for a 10-year old, let alone a girl.   Remember the phrase "Never judge a book by its cover."? Well, this definitely applies to White Album 2. Just give the first three episodes a try.   There is a reason that it is highly rated.   Thanks for reminding people to flair their posts.    Thanks. It all made sense. I was using the retrograde marker but I was being lazy and had it on the new autopilot system. The main issue I had when landing was that the prograde and retrograde markers would flip when it changed from down to up and vicecersa.   Thanks.  I'll try that in the morning and let you know how it goes.  Do you happen to know of any way to prevent that from happening?   Yeah, I know people have done it before but it took me about 8-9 tries. For the last three times, I kept on forgetting important stuff like landing struts or a ladder.  What isn't pictured is the time I missed the Mun, the time I crashed right into it, the time where I didn't give enough time to decelerate, and the time where I ended up in an orbit around the Mun.  I just got back into KSP last night and now that my finals are over, I'll try to do more and more complicated stuff.   EDIT: This was done in the new update.      Thing is, if /u/The_Dvls_Advocate really wanted to represent themselves as speaking officially, she would have clicked the "distinguish" button under her comment. That changes it from the normal to the green background that mods have.  Source: I am a mod on a few subs and every so often I have to "speak officially" which requires that button/link.   Considering that Sekai Project has the rights to publish Nekopara in English and this "startup" company that no one has heard of now has the rights to the 18+ version in English, one could put two and two together to realize that Denpa is a subsidary of Sekai.   I really need to play/read MuvLuv...   The hype is real.   I'm definitely looking forward to the new user interface for building stuff as it is hard to sift through pages of objects to find the one you want.   Try placing a bid on a game that is less than 10000 gems. It will keep a record of your bid and will hold it for you so that as the auction goes on, where the top bidder gets it every 45 minutes, you could have a bid that wins.   Oh, okay. I haven't spent any time messing around with the car colors so I just listed some numbers to show what I was looking for.   I guess what I was asking/wanting is a way for the game to take the insane colors and find the closest substitute out of the normal range.     I recently played a workshop map and when I finished I got the "Diamond Medal" but looking at the time compared to the gold, silver, bronze, I should have got bronze.  [Here are two screenshots that show what I am talking about.](https://imgur.com/a/iFBwg#0)  ~~Does anyone know anything about this?~~ Also, why didn't I get the bronze medal?   **EDIT: Spoke with /u/Fork-H on Steam and it seems as though it is for beating the author's time.**   Yeah, it could be a simple checkbox in the options screen to normalize the colors which allow it for those who want it but remove it for those who don't.   I recently played online for the first time and one of the players had a negative color on their car which made it really hard to see them or even see past them while playing.  I was wondering if there was a way for force negative colors to be inverted again. (ie. If the color is (-200,-30,-60) then it will be (200,30,60))   WARNING: The "second season" of Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, has some elements that would make it awkward to watch between siblings. (Look up the "Toothbrush scene".) Bakemonogatari is fine, but it would make it hard to continue the series.   It seems as though DenpaSoft is going to be Sekai Project's 18+ publishing name. Odds are they are doing it due to the connotations of a company being on certain sites and having 18+ content for sale elsewhere.   While it is early access, this isn't the developer's first game with these mechanics. Distance is, basically, a super polished and improved version of [Nitronic Rush](http://nitronic-rush.com/) which was, originally, a college project that was released online for people to download and play for free.   I got my last assignment done that I had to do before finals start on Friday. Now I just have to wait for the iterations of the program to finish. (It is just a matter of waiting so I don't count it as work.)   This is really nice of you!   It isn't weird, just a lazy programmer who forgot about timezones. I guess they figured that only people in Japan would access or care about this countdown.   If you read the top comments, the javascript used for the countdown bases itself on the user's current time, not the actual time in the world that it is supposed to end at.   Sorry, I don't download manga so I can't help you here. I know there are apps out there for those who want to side load manga to read.   I didn't either. The only reason I found out is that I went to Japan for two weeks and I wanted to read manga during the evening when I back at the ryokan. For some reason it showed all of the manga on Batoto. (In Japan of all places)   The reason why you feel as though the amount of manga is limited is that the developer has to censor certain titles if you are in the US. (The best way to get around this is to use a VPN that allows you to set your "country" as Japan. All you have to do now is reset the catalog in the app. Once that is done you can turn off and remove the VPN if you want to.)   TL Note: Keikaku means plan.   I wouldn't say that. The vast majority of Nintendo's titles this generation on the WiiU have all been at 60 FPS.  	123
 You know what makes me feel better? Not this. Maybe I can imagine it as a sleepover, but fuck it is hard too.    Cozy?   I don't know whats cooler, this story, or the fact that death has a Reddit account.   This is special.    Thank you so much! :]   Can you feel it? Your thoughts draining from you. There is a slit in your head and everything is starting to leak out and float away. You start to feel all that imagination and those genius ideas of yours become harder to pin point in your head. You just start zoning out instead of thinking about the most interesting things. Actions that were never executed due to the lack of the ideas and thoughts that your imagination spawned in that little head of yours. I cuss and swear but it's all pointless in the end. I go through life everyday losing more and more of what I had. I'm defeated.  I even start to notice that I don't look with my eye's anymore. I don't really see, it's more of a daily grind of usual events that never seem to change guiding me to where I'm supposed to go. It's as if someone is grabbing my hand and pulling me where to go next while I just stare blankly into the ground. I'm lifeless, and my thoughts are leaking. Who I am is leaving me, but somehow I'm still here. My consciousness is rolled up into a fetal position inside my head as it's stripped of everything. I am merely a viewer now, but I just want to leave you with one last thought before I depart.  Who's pulling the strings when we become thoughtless, what guides us, and who or what happened to my head. I mean, you don't just start losing your thoughts by yourself, do you? Is it that I need something to blame all this on or is it just me? I don't know if I should feel scared, angry, or just plain concerned. Something Inside is telling me to just loosen my grip and submit. Something wants me to let go, and you know I could just let go, but I won't.  How could I let go of all this, my thoughts, feelings, memories. As I slowly lose my grip and fade to black, I see that little bit that I have left. I don't want to leave all that behind, because that made me happy when I felt bleak. Just giving up to this dark void? Fuck that. No. I refuse.  I will fight till I die inside. Sure, you can scoop everything I love and hold dear out of my head and just leave me to become a husk, but I am for damn sure not letting you do that easily. I will fight you, whatever you are, and grip as tight as I can to all those amazing child hood dreams and memories that made me smile and laugh. Fuck letting all of that just fade away and fuck you. You will win and I will lose in the end. But, I will love, I will smile, I will look back on those times I had done both, and I will remember. I will remember what it was like to live.  I will live until I die, and I will remember as much as I can before I float away.   It's good to know that things are good :]   Hello 60 year-old woman. Meet my friend, Shotgun.    	8
 Two of this guys posts have made it to the font page, and both of them I saw on Facebook a week ago...   Ok thanks so much. How long have you been riding for?   i live in North Vancouver. i would do my riding here http://www.bikepirate.com/dh-trails/mount-fromme/. i have ridden here before with my norco (bigfoot? haha i forget exactly which model) but that bike got stolen.   Also, i would use the bike for general use(but mainly for mountain biking).   Thanks for the help. i am looking to do some trail riding, as you can tell im  not all that experienced ( with types of biking, i am confident on a bike). which bike would you suggest for trail riding?   	5
 One thing that was always noticeable in the Rebuilds is their relatively "Baby's First Mindfuck" approach to what was originally one of the heaviest mindfucks out there. Because of this, they're very easy to watch (even 3.33 if you aren't *really* watching).       Looks like Mothra is joining [Godzilla's Nike sponsorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oCF-QFuoYs).    In that case, you're pathetic *fifth grade* loser trash.    Put yer back into it, lads!   All joking aside, this is a serious issue. I don't want anyone thinking that I support this, so here's my disclaimer:  I do **not** support Minecraft profile pictures in any way. Just like anime profile pictures, they are for pathetic loser trash. Just stop.       If you don't know who Samus is, that implies:  A: you've never played any of the Metroid games, which are kind of a staple in most of Nintendo's lineups  B: you've never played Smash Bros, clearly showing you really *don't* give a shit about games  C: you've never been part of any real discussion on games, particularly Nintendo games.

I want to imagine Unit-01 combined with the WUNDER to create arc-Unit-01. Then it turns out the black moon is actually a gigantic AT field battleship, so arc-01 fuses with that to become Super Galaxy Unit-01. Then after escaping the instrumentality, they become Tengan Toppa Evangelion Unit-01 out of sheer AT field power.

I usually juggle them with my Utilt/Uair or rely on smashes, but that doesn't seem to be doing the trick.    It's kinda like a failed version of "song"   Anno *says* it's all meaningless, but can you really trust the guy who made the insanity of End of Evangelion?

Every time I fight one in For Glory, I get my ass handed to me unless they screw up by accident.    I've always been of the opinion that Smash Bros is significantly more important than actual political commentary.       Din?   I don't know if that was the podcast, because Amir says it in Date Night and something similar in Dating Apps.    I don't like Destroy all Monsters!.       After Nia turned into the Antispiral, said "hi my name is Antispiral time to fuck yo shit up", and fucked yo shit up, everyone immediately demanded that Simon be held accountable. Why did no one realize that the Antispiral were the ones responsible? Particularly the rational people like Rossiu, who sentenced Simon to death for what the Antispiral did.    Minus any interference from Kamui, Goku Uniforms, or any form of armor, how would that fight turn out? Gamagoori seems like he'd be strong enough with his own size-changing powers to beat Ryuko without Senketsu, but on the other hand, Ryuko is still a force to be reckoned with.   Neither gets any equipment.    Drill La Kill   Unfortunately, it's not quite what we were all hoping for...

If one were to take all the magical girls, from Madoka Kaname to Sailor Moon, and average them out, that would be the first fighter. Keep in mind that the *most* powerful magical girl is probably Madoka, as she became God.   1: how powerful is this average magical girl? Who can she beat?  If one did the same things for mechas, from the glorified forklift from Aliens up to Super Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann (and the Infinity Jeager) that would be fighter number two.   2: how powerful is this mech? What can it beat? Who is its pilot?  3: the two do battle. Who wins? At what cost?  4: Both are competing for the same time slot on Toonami. Who wins?   How dare you?   How did you get Asuka past the name filter? I always get it blocked because of the Russian swear word.    Rick-hundred and twenty minutes?

She's freaking out over the doll in front of the actual thing.

[theres only one kaiju who can win my heart](http://i.imgur.com/Zmg70Ix.jpg)   It's the silliest thing we all noticed the second or third time through Back to the Future. The timeline takes a whole week to catch up to Marty after he almost makes his parents not get hitched. This even seems to contrast the other two movies and how time acts there. But it actually doesn't work this way.   The indicator (the photo in the first movie) is not actually displaying not the future Marty comes from as he changes it, but rather the possibilities of how each subsequent timeline changes the photo. By screwing up his parents meeting, he creates an infinite number of timelines, each of which has a different string of events following the accident. As time goes on, many of these events are narrowed out because that's how time works. Once those are gone, the timelines resulting in his parents not getting married become more and more likely until (at the Dance) Marty's existence becomes so unlikely that he wouldn't be able to save them in any way if it weren't for the fact that he *knew*. So the indicator is the only reason the chance wasn't straight-up zero, and how he was able to create one of the only sequences of events leading to his birth.    One of my favorite kaiju. He definitely needs to make a comeback somehow!   I legit want/need this.    Now that wit was quite quick   fuck off meme  my sentiments exactly.

There's probably a reason for that.    Okay, that's a conscious decision. No one is literate and does that.    How niggardly of them.   Kaworu?    I can tell you're all cows because of how hard we're beefing   There's a reason they call him iron-abs Krabs   One of them has internalized patriarchy.    It's gotta be one of the Pokemon games. Particularly Pearl, Platinum, or Soul Silver, since when I was younger (second or third grade when Pearl came out) I didn't have a whole lot of games. To this day, I consider the core Pokemon games the best game series of all time, since all of them are least an 8/10 for me. Over all the games, I can't imagine I've clocked less than 1000 hours.    No, not really. It's a similar sort of surrealist imagery centering on one woman. The only thing it really has in common with End of Evangelion is the non-pelvic vagina, which isn't really reminiscent of EoE in particular.    It implies this happens after some scenario of End of Evangelion.   HOLD UP. This actually just occurred to me as I write this, but what if that is the outline of an Eva that went down fighting and securing Tunniel. According to people on this sub, Tunniel appeared in the fifteen years after Second Impact replacing Sachiel as the harbinger of the Angels' return. So if Tunniel had to be captured, what if Unit-00, Null, or Rei in 01 managed to take down Tunniel   Things got too real ;-;   She's probably looking at the real world and getting burned by the sunlight, then blaming it on heterosexuals.

RIP      I don't know where in Jersey you are, so I can't give specific recommendations, but my general advice is this:   Try and find a small pizza shop in town owned by an Italian-American couple (preferably named Joseph and Marie, but that's entirely optional). Big-name pizza places like Domino's and Papa John's are usually pretty bad, at least by Jersey standards. New Jersey (as well as NYC and a little bit North into Connecticut) has a near-endless supply of local restaurants who know how to make pizza right. Walking around in town for a bit should yield results.    Such an underrated kaiju. It's a shame he came right after Mechagodzilla and Biollante, because if it weren't for that he probably would have been received better.    Depends on where in Jersey you live. Plenty of responses here have some good NJ pizza, but my general advice is either to use Yelp (or some equivalent) or to find a small, non-chain pizza place by just walking around. Chances are you'll find a good thin-crust pizza with that method.   If you live in or around Princeton, I can personally recommend Conte's and Pizza Star. For Mercerville, I would say DiLorenzo's.    It sure is a good thing I live right down the street from there.   *So* good.       Pretty sure his accent is just a New York accent, maybe North Jersey.    Then why not call it a REDEMPTION ring?   Kanye West, I didn't know you were Peyton Manning.      I haven't seen the new one. Is she ant different than the Annie I remember, aside from maybe fitting the "Dark Knight" a bit better?   I just looked up the colors and she could have an entire hand covered in lantern rings. She'd fit with green, blue, indigo, and violet.    Don't forget Annie's strongest asset: her undying optimism and willpower. It only just occurred to me, but if Bruce is in the Justice League, there's a good chance he could hook her up with a Lantern ring.    The Bride is borderline superhuman in her sword fighting and martial arts skills. Black Mamba/The Bride/Arlene Machiavelli/Beatrix Kiddo/Mommy 10/10      Abbey?   Nice meme!

Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same?   Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction.   Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.

It presumably arrived at the same time as Adams and Lilith, considering Sachiel was still the first angel to arrive for 15 years. And its designation is the *third* angel, meaning it is in fact separate from the Adams and Lilith. And SEELE, holders of the Dead Sea Scrolls, have also confirmed it to be the Third. Both of the Angels who showed up around Second Impact were seeds of life, so if Tunniel showed up around that time as well, that means there's a good chance we're missing a whole other seed of life. It could also explain where the Spear of Cassius/other Longinus came from since Lilith lost hers in First Impact.   	165
 Had to share an office with our Food Service Officer, an O2.  He would sit for hours quietly staring at the same 2 pages from the NAVSUP-486 and no, he was not sleeping.  He went to a conference with our Chief.  He took a run in his dress socks that morning because he forgot his regular socks then showed up at the conference with no socks on.   Chief had to sit behind him where his lack of socks was clearing visible to everyone.    At least once a week Chief would come into our office and tell me to take a break.  I'd always grab my smokes because I knew he'd be in there balling him out for a while.  The worst for me was when he changed into his whites in a small closet that was behind a partition on the other side of my desk.  In all fairness he did ask if this was okay.  He then tells me while he's changing that he accidentally wore dark underwear and would just have to go without!         This has become standard and I don't know why.  Telephones are inherently intrusive.  You aren't asking to be called and you have no obligation to identify yourself when you receive a phone call.  Back in the day, all callers would identify themselves first.  Me, "Hello".  Them, "I'm so and so from/with so and so, may I speak with so and so?" or informally, "it's me Jan".  You never got a call from anyone that asked you to identify yourself first!  Awkward call example.....  *Ring*  Answers the phone, "Hello".  Caller, "Hello, who is this?".  Me, "Who are you trying to call?".  Caller, "I'm trying to reach so and so".  Even more ridiculous examples are,  Me,"Hello".  Caller, "Is this so and so?".  Me, "Who's calling please?"     The bottom line is that calling someone is no different then knocking on someone's front door.  It's polite and moreover safe to identify yourself first than ask for the person behind the door to identify themselves.       You must be younger than 40!   My mother and by extension, my unemployed, mooching brother and uncle that lived with her used the overdraft option to make what essentially were loans that eventually cost me 6000% of the original overdraft fee.    I couldn't just transfer money into her account because it was so overdrawn.  I had to send the money Western Union that collected up to 25%. They played this game when I was still in the military and far enough away that they knew I'd still send money home in order to help my mother.  Not the banks fault at all!

One must first have an intrinsic moral value in order to judge any religion good or bad.      Salad cream has a hint of horseradish and is delisious!   Indian vs Asian, Asian vs Chinese, Tex-Mex vs Hispanic??!!!!!   Looks like a jiffypop    Never add flour directly into a simmering or boiling liquid.  Sorry sean_incali.  It's guaranteed to form clumps and won't properly thicken.    You can either coat the beef cubes with flour before you brown them which essentially produces a roux (preferred and will produce a nice crust) or you can bullf* k it, as we called it in the Navy, by making a beurre manie, which is simply equal parts butter to flour that is mixed well then added by the spoonful.     The thickening ratio depends on how much liquid you use but generally it's 10 to 1, liquid to roux or beurre manie.  So, if you use ten cups of stock then you will need 1 cup of roux or BM.  Cornstarch is different. 1 oz of cornstarch + 1 oz water will thicken 16 oz or 2 cups of liquid.     Beautiful crust on the chicken so don't hide it. Are you ashamed of the veggies?  Bring them out from underneath!  Lots of color going to waste.  I'd plate the chicken at 10 o'clock slightly overlapping some of the veggies then trail the veggies around to form a comma.  Sauce at 6 o'clock with your micro garnish.    Yum!   Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun!  Sorry, got stuck in my head and had to let it out.    Yum!   Is that a full sized burger or a double slider?   The fourth to last one is a pizza with a porpoise.   Where's the final product?      Pillsbury I think.   Looking from the outside, the fact that Christianity is based on an innocent human sacrifice is enough to question its moral or ethical base.  Is it really so much different than throwing a virgin female into a volcano to appease an imaginary God!          I brushed the chops with olive oil then put them in a pan under low-medium heat. After about 1 minute  I upped the temp to med for another 30 seconds and finished at medium-high heat for the last 15 seconds.        For one whole year!   Any one want to challenge me?   Bread, tomatoes, onions, beef/lamb meat mixture, yogurt, cucumbers and spices and seasonings. I could live and survive be happy!     Whole mozz plus a little swiss and fresh grated parm.   I used pizza dough from a can for this first try.  Tasted pretty good but puffed up more than I wanted it to.  Next time I'll use my homemade pizza dough recipe.      I'd hate you for cutting off the tabs that keep the roll in place in order to make the ears.  I hate that people don't know what they're for, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP!   That's so sweet, thank you!   Not only was it the style or custom of the time it would have been considered blasphemous as a Hebrew not to marry and procreate as that would have crossed Gods commandment to be fruitful and multiply.  He would have been considered a very odd duck to say the least!    Before he went to bootcamp.  No jarhead.  Navy blackshoe here.  Field day is commonly used in the Navy too.    That's exactly what I got from Shorts28 reply.   Surprisingly no!  Only a couple of small blisters from the shortening.   He was fine.  He spent 2 1/2 hour cleaning the hoods that night!   I don't because there maybe people/customers that are on a low sodium diet and sodium it so prevalent everywhere.   If Christians were to follow the true teachings of Jesus then they would have to turn their backs on their own families as he and his own followers did.  They wouldn't hesitate to break up families and leave them destitute as the apostles that had wives and children.  They would shun all gainful employment and any material ownership.   If you have a problem with this I'd be more than willing to debate you both philosophically or by verse but the later could become problematic.   My dog tag says that I'm Buddhist so I just went with it!   "Can you make 5 gallons of gravy", we asked the new cook.  He said, "yes!".  He proceeded to blowup our Gaylords!  Seems he decided it was a good idea to add the beef stock straight into the hot shortening............then POOF!  I actually walked in right before he did this but not in time to stop it.  It was like an atomic cloud!     CIVILIAN plastic wrap!  Give me a break!  I understand the war mentality that some of you have but you aren't in the military!    I just wish that people would learn to push in the tabs on the sides of plastic wrap, commercial and residential!      First off, congratulations on your promotion!    Pasta is generally boiled in heavily salted water because it usually contains no salt.  If it's made in-house and salt is already added then you can skip it.    If I'm blanching vegetables for a crudites platter I will add some salt but not "like the sea".  If I'm doing it to set the color or turgidity and then using the veg in another preparation I won't use any salt.    I've never heard that salted water affects the absorption rate but even if it did it would be negligible.    On a side note, there are some vegetables that I will directly put salt on to pull the water out such as thinly sliced cabbage for a wilted but crunchy coleslaw or slices of eggplant before I fry them.    For the time being do whatever your chef tells you to do.    In the meantime it may help to study food science in order to understand the "whys" of cooking.  Understanding the basic chemistry involved will help tremendously; from saving a broken Hollandaise sauce, making pancakes without baking powder or preventing the blueberries from turning green.  It will make you an infinitely better chef!  Harold McGee has written several great books on the subject.    Sounds like you already have good instincts and aren't afraid to question the "wisdom" of so-called chefs.  Just make sure that if you do that you do it respectfully and have the goods to back it up!     Yolk color is mostly determined by what the chicken is fed.  Some yolks from other countries can range from almost white to a deep brownish red.      He won't have a choice.  He'll be in "A" school for about a year and a half.   Just WOW!  Glad you had a sense of humor.  My son would have freaked if he woke up and I was in his room much less measuring it!   You do realize that I'm a retired female Navy veteran and mother LOL!     Thanks for the link.  Never heard of a neckbeard before lol!   That would have only been necessary if he'd decided to join the Chair Force.   He actually adjusted pretty well.  Both his parents and step-father are Navy veterans so he already knew exactly how to fold his clothes in a proper military manner but you'd never guess that by looking at his room LOL!    Thanks for the recommendations.  Looking forward to visiting Chicago!   Definitely sweet!  Made with cream cheese and brown sugar.  I'll be doing a trial run tomorrow.    Pumpkin wontons instead of pumpkin pie.     Going to Chicago for the first time for my son's graduation from bootcamp.  Any suggestions where to go for the best deep-dish pizza other than Uno's?     I read the article then read all the comments below then laughed my ass off!   The comparisons to teamwork in the military and and being able to anticipate and communicate ("behind you!, knife!, hot pan!) in a civi kitchen are spot on.  The military has it's own culture and nomenclature and so does a kitchen.  There is a smooth and rhythmic order to small kitchens that is hard to define along with all the chaotic disruptions that invariably happen.     I liken it to a dance and when everyone knows and hears the same notes and all the instruments are ready then beautiful songs happen.    When you refer to your small station in a kitchen as a battle station, I can relate.     You see, I'm the real deal.  I was a Navy cook/caterer/chef for Admirals/Generals for 18 years on both ships and aircraft.  I'm also a veteran of several civilian restaurants before, during and after my military career.    A Battle Station is not much different then a cooking station.  Mine was in a small room called a Battle Dressing Station.  Although my rate was a cook I knew where everything was and was trained to use it.  We always kept it clean and stocked!  As far as being on your feet for 12 hours, try doing it in Combat boots instead of Crocs.  There is nothing in the civilian restaurant world that compares to cooking in a cramped Navy galley.  The Junior Officer that happens to be your clueless Food Service Officer that insists that the fryer be used for french fries for lunch during high speed turns at sea and your just trying best to stay vertical or the CO that expects the galley to feed 250 people in one hour right after battle stations even though all the cooks were at their battle stations and not in the galley!    Military cooks do it under fire and sometimes we fire back.  Civilians cooks, however, are probably the closest I've seen to military "brothers in arms".                In San Diego they have some great BBQ joints.  Their meat of choice is not typical of anywhere else.  They use tri-tip along with pork ribs.  Other than that, the area is flooded with Hawaiian BBQ,    Were did you imbibe in this carb overload?      Where are you from that you haven't had this before?  Grits, greens or chitterlings I can understand but the rest is pretty much standard American fare.   This reminds me of my past and makes me sad.  Only thing missing is the liter of Canadian Mist.  It will get better 80sPimpNinja!   The chili is spiced with cinnamon and coriander.    It has a kind of Mediterranean flavor packet.  It has always reminded me of the meat mixture used in Moussaka, a Greek dish layered like lasagna with a  mixture of ground lamb or beef, tomatoes, and seasonings,  eggplant slices and a Bechemel sauce.        Chili on rice is very nice! Rice in Chili is very silly.   Texan here and I approve.  Love both kinds!   Yes, and yes it can unless you're on the farm or close to a farm.    If you're reading or asking this then you can look up why milk came to be pasteurized in the first place but I'm guessing you are either too lazy or are a troll.    Pasteurization saved millions of lives and disease in the 20th century when refrigeration wasn't widely available.  Good luck with the raw milk or cheese ; )       Haven't heard wiz wit in 19 years or more!  Truffle oil they can keep!  Just an excuse to raise the price.   PYT, http://pytburger.com/,  in Philly ya'll, or you-in's, or youns or whatever, it's all good!     Had a feeling Reddit would come through!  Thanks!  Almost makes me wish I lived near Philly.  Do you?   I made fresh ricotta about two weeks ago and I also 'ultra-pasturized' it!  What a mess LOL!  Good job on the Legzagna as they call it here in the South!  I too par-boil and towel dry my noodles.      The best I can do is surmise how to recreate it so here goes.  Make some yeast-raised donut or enriched sweet dough.  Fry until golden and let drain.  Brown some ground beef making sure you break it up into very small pieces.  Add a cheese sauce and whatever other seasoning or ingredients you want.  Let cool slightly.  Using a pastry bag with a long but big enough tip, pipe the mixture into the donut like you would do for a jelly donuts.   Brush top with butter or some sort of glaze, maybe honey mustard and sprinkle with chopped cooked bacon.    Unfortunately for my cholesterol level, I'll be trying this myself!    The only thing I know is it's from some burger joint in Philly.  Maybe someone here knows the exact place.   Yes!  Cheese and ground beef.   The last pic looked like the eggs exploded into feathers!   Reminds me of a recipe I made once,  Tuna Twinkie Souffle!      Looks nice!  What's in the ravioli and are they homemade?    Seasoning mixes of all kinds.  Taco, Creole/Cajun, Italian, Chinese 5 spice, Garam Marsala and curry powder all come to mind.  Convenient yes but also awful and more often than not, overly loaded with salt and/or sugar.  Even seasoned salt is better made from scratch.    Some individual ingredients in these mixes are so much better if they are freshly toasted or ground and for some recipes, certain spices should be added at different times in the preparation process.         When my great-aunt moved into a new apartment she found what she thought was a patch of dill weed growing nearby and made a batch of pickles with it.    When I came to visit her she proudly asked us to try her new batch.  OMG!    "What is this!", I said after spitting it out in the trash.  After showing us the patch of 'dill weed' she found we quickly determined it was a type of licorice plant.    I can honestly confirm that Licorice Pickles will never, ever become a trend.    Pumped up for what?  Different songs for different affects lol!   Cheese on french fries is pretty common across the States.  There are variations such as Irish Nachos, cheese over thick-cut potato chips or Frito Pie, cheese and chili over Frito corn chips.  Doing the same with gravy, not a variation.   You couldn't cover tortilla chips in gravy and get away with calling it Nachos.    Poutine; however, is a different dish altogether and a mighty tasty one at that!    With that said,  what's with the burnt onions?  Yuck!   It's a "not so secret, secret menu item".    I can almost smell the salty ocean and the fresh catch of the day on the wharf!    Now you know!   So much chocolate yummieness!  Did you use a chocolate fondant glaze?   May just have to make a special trip!  Far West Fort Worth here.   Where in Texas you at?   Smiling knowingly!   I tried this a couple of days ago and Rks1157 is absolutely correct that it needs no other condiments.  I made appetizer portions since I had hard French dinner rolls on hand.  I also added 1 Tbps. each seasonings shown to 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef.  Here's the result:  http://i.imgur.com/sm1PGpn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/sFSUZwa.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/dcotrvo.jpg     I've been stationed in San Diego and Philly (Willow Grove) so I've definitely eaten my fair share of authentic cheesesteaks.  The closest authentic cheesesteak I found near San Diego was a place called McGonagle's in National City, CA.  They even have the cheezwiz version if you into that but I prefer provolone.    Owners are originally from Philly and their buns are flown in from Amoroso's bakery in Philly.  As close to Pat's or Geno's as your gonna get.  You should drop by and try one before making it from scratch!   My bad.  Correction made.   /\ /\ /\  Right above your comment lol!     That sounds interesting.  Let me know how it turns out.  I would recommend a lighter wine than the Cab I used even with this recipe.  I made it again with a Rose and it was much better and since it had a lighter color I placed some thinly sliced apples on top of the cheesecake in a nice pattern before I added the wine gelee.    He was sportin' a Army cap so.....   Recipe for cheesecake:  Ingredients      Nonstick vegetable spray     1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided use     1/2 pound bacon, cooked, drained, and crumbled (reserve 2 Tablespoons of fat)     1 onion, diced     2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced     2 cloves garlic, minced     Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste     32 ounces (4 large blocks) cream cheese, at room temperature     5 eggs     3 Tablespoons wine vinegar     1/4 cup whiskey     12 ounces blue cheese, crumbled     2 Tablespoons minced chives     Sliced fresh apples, toast wedges, and/or assorted cocktail crackers      Prep Time: 20 minutes     Cook Time: 495 minutes  Preparation  Preheat oven to 200 F. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with vegetable oil spray. Dust with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese. Set aside.  Saute onion in bacon fat until softened and translucent. Add apples and garlic and continue to saute over medium heat an additional 2 to 3 minutes until apples begin to soften. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.  Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, wine vinegar, and whiskey, beating until smooth. Stir in apple mixture, bacon, blue cheese, remaining Parmesan cheese, and chives by hand.  Pour batter into prepared pan and place in the preheated oven. Let bake overnight for 8 to 9 hours (timing is not critical). It should be fairly firm and slightly browned. Remove from oven and cool on a rack at least 1 hour.  Cover the top of the cooled cheesecake with plastic wrap. Place an inverted plate over the top, turn it over, and remove the pan. Refrigerate the upside-down cheesecake at least 1 hour. Reinvert the cheesecake and remove plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.  To serve as an appetizer, cut slices with a knife dipped in warm water and garnish with fresh apple slices, toast wedges, and/or cocktail crackers of choice.  Yield: 10 to 12 servings  Recipe for wine gelee:   To make one 6-inch cheesecake:  Unmold the cheesecake and wrap it in a parchment-paper collar that extends 1 inch above the surface; secure with tape. Pour 1/2 cup of one of the wines into a bowl; if using ros or Pinot Noir, add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Microwave at high power for about 30 seconds, or until the sugar is dissolved. In a small bowl, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of gelatin over 1 1/2 tablespoons of water and let soften. Heat at high power for 15 seconds, or until the gelatin is melted. Add it to the wine and let stand until slightly thickened but not set, about 10 minutes. Pour the wine gele over the cheesecake and refrigerate for about 1 hour, or until set. Remove the paper collar before serving.                I suppose so.     After they were evaluated by our chef we tried one then threw them away.  I'd say they would probably hold for service for 4 to 6 hours in clean water under refrigeration but I'm not sure.  I've heard that the balsamic caviar spheres will last up to a day.    Not necessarily.  Main ingredients boil down to yogurt and cucumbers.  Kind of like whether or not Stroganoff should have mustard or if Chili should have tomatoes or beans.  Personal preference.   No garlic.  Just yogurt, peeled and pureed cucumbers, dill, mint, salt and pepper to taste.    A little less peanut butter and I would eat this.  A Elvis version hot dog!   This, I will definitely make.  Thank you!    Can confirm.  I cooked thousands of strips of bacon this way as a Navy cook except for the wire rack.  Always came out like this.   You are correct!  Not a complete dish.  We were just playing around with MG and our plating techniques at school.       Well damn!  Now I've got to get the veal bones to make my next brown stock in order to make a decent French Onion soup in my neck of the woods. Thanks OP!    It's just regular Tzatziki mixed with a touch of calcium lactate that is carefully dropped by spoonful into a bath of sodium alginate and carefully swirled around until an ultra-thin membrane develops.   Science!! Do, do, do, do, do, do, da, do, do da do!    Closest thing I could find to a ninjadiscojesus!   Some pics of food are not meant to be taken close up lol!  I'm sure it was good though.  I like catsup on scrambled eggs.  This looks more like egg drop tomato soup!   More like this.  http://imgur.com/kPpZJtD    Flank steak is also referred to here as a London Broil LOL!  It's very lean and requires a cooking method usually involving braising if cooking it whole or cutting very thin strips across the grain with a quick saute as in fajitas. Skirt steak or top round could be a substitute.    You could use pork belly but it has a lot more fat so I would brown it off first to render some of the fat away and then braise or slow cook it. Good luck and thanks for the laugh!     Looks like she has the 'balls' in the family!  	111

If it looks good, it makes me happy.   This is kind of an ignorant and generalized post.  Let's not ignore Scripture, please.     **Proverbs 22:6 - "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."**  Furthermore, there are efficient ways to teach children the principles of Scripture and the Person of Scripture, as there are inefficient ways to teach them. There have been a lot of poor tactics that have been historically used, but that does not mean that we throw out the practice altogether.   We applaud teaching children how to read, write, practice good hygiene, and play sports. How silly would it be if we failed to teach them the single thing that matters most?   [**TagPro Profile**](http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/profile/5349fdcc7e7269a515e60426) and [**TagPro Stats**](http://tagpro-stats.com/profile.php?userid=26728)  Over the last few days I played 101 games on a new account. I wish I could have done 100, but if I understand correctly, you have to play over 100 games for your stats to register fully.  For my first attempt, I came out with a pretty solid Win % (75.25). But, as far as I could tell, everything else is pretty gross. ^^Although ^^I ^^don't ^^know ^^how ^^to ^^properly ^^tell ^^good ^^stats ^^from ^^bad ^^stats.  A few stats for those that are too lazy to click links:  ___ * **Games:** 101 * **Wins:** 76 * **Losses:** 22 * **Disconnects:** 3  ___ * **Tags/Game:** 6.020 * **Returns/Game:** 4.634 * **Prevent/Game:** 33.000 * **Support/Game:** 5.604  ___  I played defense as much as possible. I'm clearly not that great as an attacker. Anyways...  Thoughts? Comments? Is this any kind of accurate depiction of a player's abilities? Did I really have to play through ten thousand Rabbit games in fear of receiving a disconnect upon leaving? Halp.   nice encouragement.    I was in this game and I think Raven513 (spelling?) abused his ~~mom~~ mod powers...       I upvoted your comment but that wasn't enough to express how highly I think of you and your comment. My favorite. Great jorb.   I don't know, I happen to think **Juke Juice** might be beneficial. I'm trying to think through all the nuances of such a power. I'd imagine that my instincts and reactions would be quicker. I'd be able to dodge better, jump quicker, and respond speedily, not only run faster.   * **JUKE JUICE** would not help you run faster, but would allow you to get to your top speed very quickly. I guess this would not only be the truth when it comes to running, but when it comes to any sort of movement.  * **ROLLING BOMB** would fill you with "unstable energy", allowing you to unleash said energy on command. When turned on, it would also allow you a single-use invulnerability.   * **TAG PRO** would grant you the power of death, causing the things you touch to quickly wither away to nothing.   Which would be most interesting to have IRL?     Hello my name is staer, and this is Rorro, we are calling on you and your neighbors to take part in an interesting online game called TagPro. We are wondering if you'd be interested in taking the next step. [Wait for rejection, thank them, and go to the next door.]    Some taggers have multiple players in their home (or one player with multiple accounts). I have found it somewhat difficult to switch accounts. Being that log in is through Google, a user has to go to Google or Gmail to change accounts for TagPro.   It would be helpful to have a "Switch User" option in each profile so that it can all be taken care of in one tab.   Great questions! There is a great amount of evidence to a historical Jesus, and they come from both believers and unbelievers. Here are just a few examples:  ###Thallus (52AD)  He was quoted by Julius Africanus in 221AD as trying to explain away the a moment at Jesus' crucifixion:   *"On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun." (Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)*  ###Tacitus (56-120AD) One of my favorites. One of the most trusted historians of his time, wrote:  *"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular."*  ###Josephus (37-101AD) Josephus wrote about Jesus most. He was born just four years after the crucifixion. He would have met men and women that knew of the Christ.   *"Now around this time lived Jesus, a wise man. For he was a worker of amazing deeds and was a teacher of people who gladly accept the truth. He won over both many Jews and many Greeks. Pilate, when he heard him accused by the leading men among us, condemned him to the cross, (but) those who had first loved him did not cease (doing so). To this day the tribe of Christians named after him has not disappeared."*  There are other examples as well, including Lucius, Celsus, and the Jewish Talmud. There are paintings of the Christ in certain caves around Rome, when believers had to flee and hide due to persecution. If you look, you'll find some good stuff. Most scholars agree that Jesus lived. The chasm in belief comes when you get to his resurrection.   Pretty sure TagPro is a 25 year old male law student.   Love these items being implemented in the upcoming release. I really do enjoy this game and community, and want to try to do anything I can to help put in the appropriate fertilizer so that this thing can take off and grow over the coming months and years.   Eh. I disagree. In that logic, any and every rule is just an invitation for people to break it. Doesn't make sense to me. Rules help to provide a safe framework with which to work inside of in a civil manner.    This entire thread is making me laugh. Thank you /u/GrahamMc! Seriously hilarious.  Posting to make sure "Jack MeHoff" is an okay name. Your back up name? "Mike Hunt". Haha. This is too good.  That being said, I 100% agree with /u/quassus - you can do better, man. Come up with something original (and less immature). You can do it. If you are set on something slightly offensive, at least be smart about it. I'll give you a few punable options:  * Mothballs * Ballieber (playing off of Belieber or whatever for that Justin kid) * BytheBalls * Nutz/Nuts/Knutz/Knuts * TuffKnutz * Ovaryaction * SantasSack  But there are also some great less offensive names available:  * Skunk * Meerkat * Riot * LookAtMe * BallKing * Gorgeous   I just imagine that this would make things so much worse.   I value your opinion, but disagree. I hate making the comparison, but that is like saying that everyone who plays League of Legends publicly desires to play competitively, Ranked, or Major League.   I think there are a large majority that just want a casual, fun, and nice atmospheric game to play when bored. I don't think we can offer them that right now.  **Edit:** I read your comment as "players will always be looking for something more." That's not what you said. However, I'll leave my post as I believe the comparison still stands.   Actually kind of like this idea. That gives me the option of "going hardcore and stressing out" in a typical game OR having fun and chilling out in a fun game.   * **Effective Reporting System**  Maybe if someone receives three reports in a single game, they are temporarily timed out. This can help weed out some of the weaker trolls/bad guys.  * **Serious Penalties**  Punish repeat offenders. Longer bans  Permanent bans  IP bans.   * **Name Filter**  I might be alone in this, but I still think it is silly and immature to allow any name under the sun. In my opinion, encouraging filthy names encourages filthy/offensive/rude/coarse language.  * **Honor System**  This has been mentioned and shot down. People should just be nice without an incentive. Sure, but that isnt happening. I think it would be nice to have an honor system with flair awarded to consistently nice and helpful players.  * **Matchmaking**  I know this might come later in the life of TagPro, but some form of degree level matchmaking might help in this. I dont think it needs to be perfect. But this would help to alleviate some of the stress/anger associated with playing on a team full of poor players.  *I'll add more as they come to mind.*   I've seen many people recently suggest that in order to get away from the bad players and filthy hate speech to "just play PUGs instead". I get it. I really do. I thoroughly enjoy PUGs (pick-up games), and while I find them more competitive, I find them to be a lot less stressful. But this can't possibly be the *only* solution!  PUBs (public games) are the front door to the TagPro universe. It is the only arena that most TagPro players will ever see. And it should be an okay place to reside and to flourish. Mumble, PUGs, and competitive leagues aren't for everybody, nor should they be.   I think that there must be some solutions that can be worked into future patches that can help the public community.  I get it, this has been discussed before. But I think something must be done before the community gets polluted to the point of receiving a bad reputation and a bad name.   Can we collect some ideas that might be able to be implemented in the near future that can help move towards a more healthy public environment? I've included some suggestions below.  **EDIT/P.S.:** I'm not perfect at this by any means. I get frustrated often. So I can relate to the aggressor. I just think there are some preventative measures that can be taken so that public games can once again be a fun place to be.   staer   You're awesome. I guess it just needs to be updated in the Wiki. Who could do that?   I wouldn't ever want to bug /u/NewCompte about a bug. /u/NewCompte, rest knowing that I wouldn't flood your inbox, /u/NewCompte, with way too many tags. /u/NewCompte, you can trust in me fully. However, /u/Newcompte, if you ever have the time to update your extension, /u/NewCompte, could you please update?    I know this has been addressed before, but I haven't found a fix.  I've downloaded the [TagPro Sound Chrome Extension](http://redd.it/1tqz4g). It works fine on all servers except for Origin. Under my "Extensions" tab, I see that it doesn't have permission for Origin. I don't know how to change this though. Don't even know if I can.  Is anyone else having this problem? How can I fix it?   (I'll remove the post if you can redirect me to a post with a solution.)   Don't have a mouse. GG.   Defensebot  	44

Anyways, i work at a kids store because I'm 17 and extra cash comes in handy.   I ate Chipotle for lunch and "Mexican" food and i don't mix okay? So i clock back in and start greeting in the front of the store then it happens, my stomach feels as if there is a small chihuahua having a fucking party in my bowels. I started making my way to the back when i just need to pass gas, so i let it propel me but little do i know that there is a small child behind me that just experienced the smell of a bad burrito.  First of all it smelled like a dead whale, second, this fart was loud as fuck, third, i need to change my pants. I look at the kid with horror,  he looks at me with a disgusted look on his face while his mother stares me down with the anger of a bull who just got neutered. She just turned away as she dragged her child. I embarrassingly waddled to the restroom and went commando.   Tldr; Never trust a mexican induced fart.

 im suprised that hasnt been used yet for vi. she has been around for atleast 2 Chinese new years.    as a current aatrox main i dont feel there is much that needs to be changed on him so hopefully what i say doesnt get downvoted because its not a significant change.   1. passive - Aatrox passive could possibly give him bonus attack speed for using up all of his bloodwell given it normally gives him attack speed they could make it so that it decays percentage of actual attackspeed. 2. Q - aatrox Q is a really good engage/disengage however when ever your playing aatrox if you have your passive W up you can get an extremly good poke off just by jumping in and autoing and backing off with no real exchange. this isn't terrible but to fix this i believe that while airborn aatrox shouldn't be able to use his W to switch and make it so that the enemy atleast is given a chance before he flies like a majestic eagle. 3. W - not much to say about this except that if you have passive healing on that it should take away from your blood well as to make sure you are keeping your blood well high. (could even make the blood well heal you based on how full it is) 4. E - this skill is easy to hit and deals a good amount of damage nothing i would change on this because you still use your health to use it. 5. R - this skill is called massacre for a reason and i love the recent change with blood well being filled for what is hit around him however i wouldn't mind if when you activate it will instead of initially increasing his Attack Speed that it would increase based on how many people are around Aatrox   alright hopefully this doesn't sound unbalanced in anyway but i also feel his kit is nice as a brawler.   i just recently started playing more ADC and i find this hillarious. Mainly because of the fact that i have felt like this when i got behind because i had not fully understood the role yet.   I was just talking about this with someone i helped get into league and personally alot of the unfriendlyness can come from not understanding the game. recently the meta has changed alot in favor of tanks and may be changing again soon, for someone new this wouldn't be a problem however they might fear the change in the game that might make their favorite champion not viable. obviously when you first start playing your not going to play against smurfs every game but smurfs can hurt a persons chances of wanting to play.  	4
 God damnit..   Wow..yes, yes you did.    Idk what in-n-out you went to but there is always at least a 15min wait for food because it is so packed..in any of them..the fries are not too great I will give you that, but the burgers are phenomenal! Not to mention not nearly as pricey as five guys either..meat and cheese baby, meat and cheese :) but I enjoy five guys as well.      wait til you try in-n-out burgers..only if you come to the west side of the states tho..   bahahaha      What is your best pickup line and did it work?                  Wait, yea, just checked this guy out....this is total bullshit..he's been posting stuff for the last couple months about work and his "place"...I smell a Karma whore   Hope you have a job..   I would sure hope after only 10 years you could..otherwise you would be a sparkling example of the divorce statistic in this country               So basically you are telling everyone that you have it too...   Original, like ur style..      looks like you have a real winner there. I feel a karma whore coming on, right about now..      if you like post rock music, then take a listen to our new song [Surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRimKa322I)   Take a listen to a post rock instrumental band from San Diego called [Thieves of the American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRimKa322I) they are very powerful and cinematic, much like Sigur Ros..hope this helps :)   Giant panda, Soul position, DJ Alibi, Ugly Duckling, Aesop Rock, Deltron 3030, Hieroglyphics, Souls of Mischief, Kool Keith, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, Eyedea and Abilities, Felt, Living Legends, MC Paul Barman   there is a post rock band called Thieves of the American Dream who do all instrumental music..very cinematic pieces, its been used in documentaries and commercials.. [thieves of the american dream](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream)   Atmosphere, MC Paul Barmen, Giant Panda, DJ Alibi   damn...rip eyedea      When you say wooshy, in what regard? Are you referring to the overheads of the drums or the guitars?   Very cool man! Well if you very get stuck on a mix for a band, let me know I'd love to help out where I can. Keep up the good work and advice!   Ok I appreciate that! I am opening up my DAW as we speak!   Do you do any work with bands or is it mainly production stuff?   Very cool man! What r unrunning in your studio if you don't mind me ask   Definitely do! Sounds like you know what you want to do with it! Keep up the good work!   Oh heck ya man, i have been reading through the past threads and I appreciate you giving quality advice and feedback to people. It's important for people to pass along the knowledge!   Thank you, ya sometimes it is hard to find that balance. With this genre of music there tends to be a lot of repetitiousness and so we try not to do too much of it because without lyrics it can start to get monotonous. Thank you for the feed back tho! Take a listen to our newest song, it is our Frankenstein song with some post rock, math rock and post hardcore influence [Caterpillar Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIdyxmSiV0)   I hear ya, I often hear tracks getting too muddy because of side chains on everything at certain points to make changes more prominent and that bugs the hell out of me. The track sounds great tho man! Crisp and clear    The structure of the song is good and the lyrical content is there, but as at as the mix goes there are a couple things that could be done. I am glad to see you are a fellow logic user tho :) the vocals sound like they could be compressed a little more, just to smooth them out and sit them in the mix a little nicer. The snare also seems to have a bit of a long tail on the reverb when it is hit, or it could be the natural decay of the snare, but either way tightening up a gate a little on it might make it sound a little less muddy..but then again sometimes that's nice to have.   I appreciate that! Did you listen to it in headphones by chance...the stereo image of this song is actually quite big :) now I need to zone out and listen to it again and again haha   Hahaha rad man! I am a rock musician too bt do hip hop stuff on the side so I appreciate where you are coming from and putting this out there! You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more!   This track sounds real good! The drops are solid and the build ups are nice and fluid..I get a little bit of some weird phantom frequencies around the 2-3k range but I am also listening with Grado's and they hear everything too well haha... Maybe try side chaining an low end oscillator to your kick on the drops to give it a little more DROP.. The track is awesome tho man, quite the listening experience!   I like the track very different sounding..the only thing I would say is with the way that the vocals are mixed, very light and airy with tons of reverb, I almost wanted to hear some solid drums in the track, at least something at would drop at some point, just to give the track some continuity...nothing to crazy but a simple electronic beat or a minimal DnB beat would suffice, just because it feels as tho that would keep the interest of the listener a little more, but that's just IMHO. Keep up the good work!   Just listened to the song and I really like the guitar work..it is busy bt not overwhelming which is what I like... I think if you were to find the right drummer for it to keep it busy and interesting bt at the same time able to come back to a solid rhythm, I think the song could have a real math/indie rock feel to it...I am a drummer and would love to record something to it for fun! I will definitely be jamming to it later either way!   [Surface](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream/song/17276298-surface)   Hello fellow music makers! I am pretty much finished with a mix I did for my post rock instrumental band. The song is called Surface. Take a listen and any feedback and/or criticism is always welcome and encouraged!

Hope you enjoy! (If you have headphones, I'd put them on now)   Hey man! Just listened to the song and it has a nice feel when it first comes into the verse bt then it starts to get a little repetitious..maybe break it up with some sort of change in the song..an effect or chorus or something because the verse feels a bit too long :)    The EP sounds great man, there is a lot of room in there for some samples that might be a nice compliment to the song.. Very good sounding and the vocalist has good dynamic! Sounds like a good project to be a part of! Good luck!            I didnt even see the dude on the floor till he started spazing out hahaha                     ahhh, now the context is all making sense! It is way too early for all this.   as did i..   good because I'd be embarrassed otherwise.   no I dont because it is May..   so you made a shit 5 second video of sleeping with your mom...you should have just not done anything..  	66

In the **summer of 2015**, it might be possible that temperatures on the comet will allow Philaes battery to be recharged. "The orbiter will continue with its overflights to receive any signals from the lander once Philae wakes up from hibernation."

 seriously, the "group amnesia" that happens in the first disk bothers me so much. just comes off as lazy writing  I completely agree. And then when Irvine admits he recognised everyone when the realisation comes at the orphanage, it's just like WTF why didn't you say anything on disk one. Its like the writing team changed after the first disk.    Yeah in 8 it started off well but the whole thing in space was just cringe worthy. At least in 9 it was certainly portrayed better.

I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.   Is this Public Domain? Because that General Bulldog kicks ass and needs more stories.

          Yes. You are right. I don't know how that slipped past me. Pretty stupid.    When introducing E Corp to the audience, Elliot mentions that he, after a tough intensive self-reprogramming, now only sees Evil Corp and not E Corp. And after that whenever E Corp is mentioned, they switch it with Evil Corp. It's just that Elliot's perspective is unreliable.    I also have that doubt. Tyrell has a good understanding of Tech. He is smart. He already knew Elliot's name. He doesn't say anything about Elliot's switch of files. And he invites him to the board meeting. Even if he is not an imagination of Elliot, he probably does have some significance in his life.    Alright, so I watched the first episode just yesterday and watched it for a second time today. Some of you guys have mentioned getting a Fight Club vibe from the show. I think this is a possibility.  This might be a spoiler for few of you, so I'm giving it a Spoiler tag :    [To see how legitimate this theory is, lets establish what we already know.   1. Elliot has some mental issues. He is delusional.   2. The entire story is from Elliot's point of view, which is not reliable, because of his state of mind. He mentions that "after a through intensive self-reprogramming I now only see Evil corp instead of E Corp" and then for the rest of the episode, even we see and hear Evil Corp.   3. This is a strong one : Mr. Robot only interacts with Elliot. If you watch the episode again, you will notice that Mr. Robot doesn't interact with anyone else except Elliot. For the most part, no one even looks at Mr. Robot except Elliot. One exception though, he does try talking to the "Men In Black" at the table who are following Elliot.    4. Mr. Robot respected his father, who was a petty thief and is now dead. Elliot was good at talking to only his father. You could say he respected him a lot, like Mr. Robot. But Elliot's father, according to him, died of  leukemia, which he got from the radiation company he worked at.     5. Elliot hates the Society, and so does Mr. Robot. "Fuck Society" as they believe.   6. Elliot is not happy working for his Security Company. He doesn't say it directly, but it's clearly implied that if given a chance to take E Corp down, he would. And Mr. Robot seems to be the guy who gives him this chance.      7. Tyrell Wellick, the Senior Vice President of Technology at E Corp, somehow already knew Elliot's name. It might be that he got his name from his employee ID card. But it's never shown. So that's that.       8. Tyrell also saw Elliot change the file before submitting it to FBI. But he does nothing about it.      9. In the end of Episode 1, Tyrell invites Elliot to his "top 1% of top 1%" meeting, who are probably the board members of E Corp. This could mean that Tyrell was involved in the whole thing from the beginning. It could be possible that he was the one to hire Elliot for the job.](/spoiler)   There could be few other things I missed out. If you guys also noticed something, mention it in the comments.             I think it should be, "Am I as bored as he is?" instead of "..you are?"   Reddit really eats away my productivity.

 I posted part one of this story last night; you should read it here: [Part 1 - Invisibility] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p11q/part_1_invisibility/) before continuing, so you can understand, at least, as vaguely as I do, what happened. It has become more urgent for me to get the rest of this story out there, before I completely forget how I got backor that I had even left ************************* As Diana and Kate attempted to ignore what happened with the phone, and have a normal conversation, I frantically explored the room, trying to figure out what happened.    I was still in the kitchen, thats for sure.  I could see the phones and other accessories which were left behind as the others vanished, and I could see Diana and Kate carrying on as if the falling phone were the only strange thing to happen that night.  But they could not see me.    This could not be happening. I wasnt drunk I wasnt crazy Was I?    *What happened to the others?* I wondered.  *Ive just disappeared as well then, as far as Diana and Kate are concerned.*  I had disappeared from their vision, and presumably, from their memories, as I had witnessed happen to the others who had been in the kitchen after I had returned from the bathroom.    But, if the same thing had happened to all of us, then where were they?  Why was I, effectively, alone?  Then, it hit me.  This all started after I returned from the bathroom, and had seen the profound darkness seeping in from the window.  I looked up at the glass to see the same starless depths; but this time, I could see the rooftops, as lighter shadows in the darkness.  When I had re-entered the kitchen, it had seemed different to me.  It also seemed that I was the only one who had noticed, and that I was the only one who still remembered the others as they disappeared.  Having held the phone up to Dianas face before dropping it in surprise, I realized that they could not see the personal effects left behind either.  Until I had moved one and made a sound.  I concluded two things: the people disappearing must have gone into another dimension, or reality, thus erasing themselves from this one, and I was in between the two, in some strange fog of an existence.  That would explain why I could see some things from both and could witness and remember the disappearances from this dimension into the unknown.    But, how did I end up between the dimensions?  Did the whole room shift to another dimension while I was in the bathroom, or, more logically, as I was passing through the door?  Were the people who disappeared also here, in the room, between dimensions, all alone, unable to see each other?  Or could they actually have gone back to our real, or home, dimension?  If thats the case, why didnt I go back too when I disappeared from here?  Wherever here is...   Was I worried about the wrong people?  Were Diana and Kate the ones in danger then?    *Well if people left behind objects when they disappeared, I wonder if they left behind anything else*  I shook the thought, as it was useless to wonder about the worst case scenarios.    So what determined when someone would phase out of this dimension?  I needed to try and get Diana and Kate out of there.  I didnt know for sure if the others had gone back to our home dimension, or if they had ended up somewhere elsebut in any case, what I knew for sure was that none of us belonged here, in this detached reality.    I hadnt actually seen anyone disappear; I only saw the things they left behind.  I wish I had paid more attention sooner.  Maybe I could have seen how it was happening.  I had phased out, although I was only half-way in to begin with, after I had gone under the table.  Chris clearly also disappeared while he was under that table.    But that didnt make any sense, as  the others had disappeared on the other side of the room.  Could it be from touching the phone?   I had already touched my phone before that.  Maybe my phone was between dimensions with me, so it didnt count.  Maybe Chris took the phone out to light the space under the table.  Do did everyone disappear when they checked their phones?  Can phones not technically exist in this dimension?  Is it like dividing by zero in ours?    Only one way to find out, I thought.  I had to get Diana and Kate to check their phones.    I turned towards them.    Wow; how long have we been here talking?  I thought we were going to a party. Kate seemed a little disappointed.  Diana reached into her coat pocket.  *well that was easy* I thought.  I didnt have to do anything.  She clicked the side button and looked at Kate.  Well, its almost 7:30, so were half an hour early apparently.    I sank down to the floor.  Not only was my theory out the window into the darkness beyond, but, as inexplicable as it seemed, time was still going backwards.    Well what else could it be?  I thought, leaning on the table for support to stand up.  As I did, my fingertips brushed against a keychain on the table.  Suddenly, I felt dizzy again.  I thought maybe I stood up too fast, but no, I hadnt.  I had written it off as crouching and standing too fast when I felt dizzy after coming out from under the table with the phone, but that had not been the case this time.  I had touched something someone left behind.  Like Chriss phone, touching that keychain had made me dizzy.  Was I back in this dimension?    I walked up to Diana.  Kate had gone to the bathroom.  Hey. I said, hopefully.    There was no answer.  Knowing that the others cannot see the artifacts left-behind, I was sure that touching them is what had made them randomly phase out.  Clearly it only works once, or only in one direction.  In any case, I needed to get them to touch something that was left behind.  But how could I do that if they cant see the things?  I crossed the room and grabbed the lighter off of the floor by the sink.  Holding it made the floor seem to rotate and lean beneath me, but I took careful baby steps, using the table to steady myself.  As I reached the table on which Diana sat, legs dangling, Kate returned to the room from the bathroom.  She looked right at me and said Hey!  Im glad youre here.  What are you doing with that lighter?  I thought you didnt smoke.  Diana looked towards me and back at Kate.  Who are you talking to? she asked, perplexed.  Kate looked confused.  I realized what was going on.    Its ok Kate; I tried to calm her.  Just come over here and Ill try and explain what Ive seen so far.    She suddenly looked afraid of me.  Are you a..are you  Her eyes grew wider.  Am I.?  What are you rambling about?  asked Diana, looking concerned.  You cant see her?   See who?  What are you talking about?  I interjected.  Kate, were in between dimensions.  When I got back from the bathroom, I saw that things had changed in here, and people were disappearing.  What? Kate didnt seem to get what I was saying, until she saw the empty shoes and choker necklace to her left on the floor.  EElizabeth?  She choked out.  Who? said Diana.  Kate looked up and gasped at the site of all the random objects strewn about the room, abandoned where there owners had stood.  Although I had made some sort of sense out of what had happened to us, I was left with more questions than answers.  Not just the obvious where did everyone go? question, but  If I wound up between the dimensions because I was not in the room when the shift occurred, how did Kate get in between them?  Just by leaving the room?  Also, if people phased out of this dimension by touching the objects left behind by others who had phased out, how did the first person phase out?  **************  I still dont know the answers to some of those questions, and the answers I do have are quite vague.  Although it didnt make a lot of sense, at least I wasnt alone anymore at that point.    The rest of what happened goes way beyond the character limit, so I guess this is a good stopping point to break it up.  I will post the last part tomorrow.  Its already typed up, so I know I wont forget it.    its when you put so much mental energy into something that you sort of make it real.  See, as you probably know, your energy and intentions have an impact on the world around you, so a tulpa happens when you focus your thought energy on a concept and that energy forms into a manifestation of the concept.     I am normally an advice-giver, but I just wanted to share the experience I had around noon as I was in the kitchen, washing a plate on which to put my brunch.    Now, I have mentioned in comments that I have never been one to "see" spirits and such in the physical/traditional sense. I feel things, I sense things, I know things, I see things in my mind's eye, but I don't physically see them.  I have on occasion seen a bug wander off out the corner of my eye, only to turn and see nothing, but that I have learned is a simple optical illusion/ hallucination from stress and is quite common.  I accepted that explanation just fine, and do not really have a reason to be concerned for that even if it's not.  But, what I saw in the kitchen this morning was different.  It was a black shadow, about the size of a kitten.  I was facing the sink, and the shadow came from behind me.  It had leapt up.  I saw it pass by over my shoulder, by my head, and over the countertop.    The sink and counter-top is not up against the wall; there is a few feet of space behind the counter before the window.  So, this shadow leapt over me and the counter.  Although it was surprising, as I normally cannot see such things, I kept my composure and finished washing the plate, not taking my eyes off of the small portion of floor I could see over the countertop.  I didn't see anything there.  It could have been up against the countertop, or not there anymore. In any case, I was concerned, because, having lived in this building for two months at this point, I had not gotten any impression of any presences here.  I have not sensed anything.  Granted, I have been quite preoccupied with numerous things, but this was completely unexpected.  I wasn't sure what to do, if anything, so I just cooked my brunch and went about my day.  By the way, there are no pets allowed here.  It was like a small chubby kitten in size, but the shape was more like a brush-stroke of black paint, trailing off behind, with tiny nubs at the bottom like feet, but nothing that looked like a head; the top was just a flat contour.  And, I have black hair, which at first instant I thought could have tricked me from the corner of my eye, with the movement over my shoulder, but when it continued over the countertop, I knew that wasn't the case.    I thought I'd share this with you guys and see if anyone who normally can see such things has any ideas about what they may be exactly?   Edit: tl/dr: I saw a dark shadow leap over my shoulder and the counter top in the kitchen this afternoon.   edit 2: I just realized it's probably a tulpa.  I started writing a fictional multi-part story on /r/nosleep last night, and it took place in a kitchen and involved inter-dimensional phasing shrouded in darkness.  So I think I'm responsible for the shadow.  I don't mean I made myself see it; I saw what I saw; I mean, I have this theory now that maybe I generated or attracted it.  Especially given my writing history [see here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/2zuzkb/predictive_poetry/ )   Is that theory plausible?   After reading many of your stories, I have been inspired to share my own.  I was reluctant at first, partially for having to re-live it all in my mind, and partially because, should anything positive come of it, I might have it all stripped away from me.   Anyway, I'm not even sure where to begin.  I guess chronologically would be the best way, or at least, the least nonsensical way to approach it.    *******************  It was 8:35 pm on Friday, February 27th.  I was at a simple party with some friends, acquaintances, and unfamiliar students in a kitchen in my own apartment building but on a different floor.  It was a normal, chill Friday evening with my favorite cider in hand and my ears buzzing with humor and camaraderie.     I'm not sure when I lost touch with reality.  Perhaps chronologically is not the best way to go, since I'm not really sure what that is anymore.  By "lost touch with reality," I don't by any means mean drunk.  Although I have never been drunk, and thus cannot relate or compare, I can assure you that I was not drunk at all.  I mean I  physically lost touch.  It's as if one minute, I was in the kitchen talking to my friends, surrounded by others mingling, and, when I returned from "breaking the seal", as I learned to call it, I had shifted into another existence.     I was still in the building, as far as I could tell.  I entered the kitchen from the same door I had left to use the bathroom, and everything appeared to be normal; the room was still abuzz with chatter, but no one seemed to notice the deep blackness outside the partly-opened window.  Where there had been stars in the sky, rooftops, the glow of light posts, and the shadows thereof, there was now only blackness.  A void so profound, that "black" cannot begin to describe its inky depths.  This was no power outage, as the lights were still on in our building.  There also seemed to be a general haze over the party, like a wispy grey cloud of smoke; although there were no cigarettes lit indoors; it was against our housing agreement.  Perhaps it had filtered in through the window from the depths beyond.  It's as if we were no longer in our city anymore, or even the same dimension.     No one else seemed to notice though, and I was startled from my reverie by my friend Diana.    Checking out the view, huh? she said with a smirk.   I realized that, in my contemplation of the eerie vibe of the room, I had been unwittingly staring in the direction of a mutual friend, as he was bent over looking for something.   I must have looked surprised, because Diana began to giggle and slap my shoulder with one hand and her knee with the other.  She was already quite drunk it seemed.  I smiled, shrugged it off, and walked over to our mutual friend.     Hey Chris.  Oh.  Hey he replied, not looking up from under the corner table.  I had shrugged Dianas comment off so easily because I am not particularly concerned with butts.  Backs, on the other hand  Is everything ok? I said as his back and the rest of him disappeared under the table.  yeah, Im just looking for mah msudfhsdjf ssfkjd.  what?  Im just loodsljflkjsfd msuhdfshduo.  I wasnt sure if it was because of the table or because he was facing away from me, but his voice was getting harder to distinguish from the dull roar of the party.     I turned around to see that half of the others, the people I didnt really know, had disappeared.  I walked back over to Diana; she was now talking and laughing with our classmate Kate, the only person in our group who was shorter than me.  I asked them where the others went.   Diana laughed.  What are you talking about? she asked with a scoff; everyones still here.  As she giggled at my perceived silliness, I realized that, in her state, it just wasnt registering.  Kate, on the other hand, was just as sober as I was; so, I was quite disturbed when she said that she didnt remember there being more people in the kitchen, but if anyone had left, theyd probably gone to the club, since she vaguely remembered someone mention dancing.  Although it was strange that they didnt remember seeing other people, the explanation was at least somewhat satisfactory at the time, although I wish now that Id paid more attention.   I turned around to address my other friend, Elizabeth, who was chatting with a guy I didnt know.  She introduced him as Bradley.  We chattered about our courses and other general topics for a while, and when I finally turned around again, and walked to the other side of the center table, I saw something that made me wish I had gone that way sooner.  Finding a phone left on the table is nothing unsual on its own, but finding a phone on the table, a lighter on the floor, earrings on the counter, keys by the fridge, and an odd assortment of other personal effects strewn around where at least fifteen other people had stood just minutes before.that is pure terror.  I whipped around and made for my coat.  When I pulled out my phone and unlocked it, the screen said 8:30 pm.  But I was certain I had arrived at 8:35, and that had to be at least an hour ago.   Elizabeth, Bradley, Diana, Kate, and about 6 other people were still in the room.  Then, I thought of Chris.  From where I stood, across the room, I had a clear view under the corner table.  The only thing there was a cellphone.   I darted over to Diana and Kate.  Not knowing any of the others names, and in light of her previous refusal to acknowledge that anyone else had even been in the room, also in my mounting hysteria, I grabbed Diana by the shoulders and demanded Wheres Chris?   Who? She asked.  I took a step back.  Chris.our friend?  You were just making fun of me for looking at him five minutes ago.  Youre funny. Diana gurgled as she spoke; she was beyond intoxicated; I was surprised she hadnt passed out.  I dont know what youre talking about.  I turned to Kate, and she was just watching this exchange with a curious expression, still holding the same small glass of soda. I needed to know I wasnt crazy.  Against my better judgement, with a sense of dread and morbid curiosity, I lunged under the table and grabbed the phone.     When I stood up, I felt dizzy.  I must have dove under the table and back up far too quickly.  I waited a moment for the haze to steady before clicking the side button of the phone.  The screen lit up reading 7:55 pm.  Although I was disturbed by this, I was relieved to see the background was a picture of Chris, Diana, and some other classmates at some sort of event.  I rushed over to Diana and Kate to show them.  I saw them talking and laughing like normal.  Diana did not seem to be drunk at all.     See? I said, holding the phone up to their faces.  Right there; thats Chris, and you, and Elizabeth.   But Diana didnt seem to hear me.  She looked sober, but was too busy laughing to even acknowledge what Id said.  I turned to my right, where Elizabeth and Bradley had been standing, only to find a pair of shoes and a choker necklace there instead.   I dropped the phone.   The resulting shatter echoed like a deafening roar on the tile floor, and finally got Dianas attention.  She looked down at the phone.  There was an expression of shock and disbelief in her eyes, as she turned to Kate, who looked equally perturbed.     *Yes*, I thought.  Theyve seen the picture and they know Im not crazy now.     They looked up from the phone to the ceiling, and then looked right through me at the opposite wall.   ...maybe it fell off the table. Kate offered sheepishly, looking at Diana with a hopeful expression, wanting to make herself believe it too. yeahthat must be it Diana trailed off.   I realized then that they were visibly creeped out, but not because they realized everyone was disappearing, one by one, but because the phone had just inexplicably fallen at their feetbecause they couldnt see me.  *********************  I am feeling really drained, so I will have to continue this tomorrow  edit: fixed some spacing issues  edit: here is the link to [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31tekm/part_2_just_a_phase/)   that's interesting; I haven't heard about people having higher charges before.  I've only heard of/ been concerned with auras, energy, and sensitivities.  I've screwed up several overhead projectors in one sitting, but that was on purpose, so I don't think overcharging on purpose is quite the same thing as having a higher resting charge....   this is an old thread from here, but it shows how a lot of kids have talked about past lives, so you're far from alone on that http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d2v7i/parents_of_reddit_what_is_the_creepiest_thing/    dreams offer insight into our subconscious; things that have been bothering us, things we don't want to admit to ourselves, and things that we've picked up on but haven't given much thought to.  It sounds like you have been shaken up by recent events in your life, and facing these events has made you contemplate your own mortality.  It is interesting that you chose to attack the train rather than find out what was wrong and try to better the situation.  Perhaps this means that you are approaching this life event from the wrong angle and it is tearing you apart; you see others carrying on and you on a whole different level, unable to carry on as they do.    Perhaps this dream serves as a sign that you need to approach the situation differently, so that you may come out better/ in one piece.   dreams provide insights into our subconscious; things we are worried about, things we don't want to admit, and things we picked up on but haven't actively thought about.    I don't think it's just about your emotions.  I don't know what you're going through personally, so only you can make this determination, but it seems like you are worried about expectations or decisions you have to make, like everyone is looking to you to come through on that, and that scares you and makes you feel like your world is either falling apart or changing around you.    Perhaps its a big decision which will shape your future?   I second this; /u/friend-killer , if you are sensitive /open to that sort of thing, then things that want attention seek you out more because they know they can get it.  They can sense it (just like how some predatory animals can smell fear). Although these occurrences seem harmless.    I'm not sure what /u/smeefeltz means by getting your charge checked.  I would imagine he or she means getting someone who can feel/sense auras and energies to get a feel for you and see what kind of and how much energy and vibes they can sense from you.  Not sure how you go about finding legit people in person though.   I realized after reading this that the demon (or other thing) was fucking with them the whole time, since it knew they thought the room next door was the suicide room.  The whispers and whatnot that they heard from that shared wall were only coming from there to make them continue to believe that was the room rather than the room they were in.   I also, like others have said, thought Beth could be a ghost or something.  Given now that they never saw her out of the room, I'm thinking Beth may have been a manifestation of the thing, or a shared hallucination caused by the thing.  It's kind of a stretch, but it's possible.  If not, then the thing heard her tell them the room next door was the suicide room, and proceeded to fuck with them like so.    It's just another layer of fucked-up ness about the whole thing.     knowing that you're dreaming is one thing, controlling it is quite another.  When I get consistently adequate sleep, becoming self-aware in my dreams is automatic.  Taking control is another story.  I don't deliberately try to do that much, because it takes some of the fun out of a dream for me; the random adventure is what makes dreams great.  Also, you can't gain insights into your subconscious thoughts, or things you've perceived but didn't consciously acknowledge or admit, if you control the dream.   I have taken control a couple of notable times.  The speaking thing is definitely important.  The best dream I took control of started with my appearing in my old school, recognizing it was a dream, and asking a janitor what year it was.  From there I went on to explore, and gained some insight into what made some of my classmates tick.  I was in control of myself, but I did not try to manipulate the dream itself.  I just explored around as an observer.    The other notable time I took control, I took off flying through a massive library on a griffon, and I lost confidence and began to plummet for a while before I picked up altitude again, but everything felt fake and it was no longer fun or magical.  now, if you are having a bad dream, you need to know how to wake yourself up.  Once you know you are dreaming, the only thing you need to do to wake yourself up is to get off to an area where no one will disturb you, close your eyes, take deep breaths, and count backwards from whatever number feels natural to you.  I use 10, but that may be because figured that technique out around that age.  Use whatever number works best for you.  With 10, I was usually awake by 3 or 4.  Some people say to wake up from a dream, you need to fall asleep, so that may work for you as well.  I hope you can gain some insight and/or ideas from this   The waters were rougher than ever before; I remember that night like it was yesterday.  The water level had risen quickly, and unseen forces lifted me up from behind and tossed me around the waves.  I could see a pirate ship in the distance, battered by the stormy seas, and bearing a large bite-mark on the port flank, perhaps from a run-in with the great white on the horizon.  I could faintly hear the sailors screaming at each other in a panic. IT WAS LARGER THAN ANY CREATURE I HAVE EVER SEEN one pirate yelled.    The unseen force lifted me again, but this time, it poked me in the eye.  Its digits must have been enormous, as just one of them obscured my whole face as it lifted me from the tumultuous waves, placing me right next to the ship.  However, the pirates did not seem to notice me, as they were absorbed in a panic over the thing which had just placed me there, passing closely over the mast. STEADY NOW, SHES COMING BACK AROUND Shouted the captain as he gripped tightly to the wheel, trying to maintain control of the ship. FIRE THE CANNON he screamed as loud as he could, in an attempt to be heard over the thunderous thrashing of the waves. The captains face paled with terror when, instead of cannonballs, water started flowing from the cannons. WEVE SPRUNG A LEAK CAPN one of the crew members shouted. WE AVNT GOT MUCH TIME the captain shouted. To my horror, the ship was quickly swallowed into the shadowy depths.  I wondered if I would be next.    As I tried to swim away against the current, to no avail, I heard a rumble.  Sputtering and gurgling, the ship rose once again from beneath the waves, just as quickly as it had gone down.  The crew, though thoroughly soaked, seemed otherwise unharmed.  They gasped with shock as the massive limb pulled away from the ship loosening its grip.  They had been in its grasp the whole time.  As the water shrank away beneath me, and began to spiral in a whirlpool, I realized I had been picked up by the creature too.  It squeezed me with such force that it knocked the wind out of me with a shrill squeak.  I gasped for air as it relaxed its grip.  Although my back was to the creature, I realized it was bigger than I had first thought, as it rose up to its full height, towering over the waves and the seemingly tiny pirate ship.  Then, I felt it; a sharp, stabbing pain in my rear.  IT WAS GOING TO EAT ME!  Then there was a harsh booming sound, startling the creature to release me.    I landed upside down, head first, onto the green, fuzzy ground.  My heart was racing; but then, I felt a gentle touch cradle me and wrap me in something soft.  It seemed to massage the pain and fear right out of me.  When I emerged, I was completely dried.  Then it picked me up and dropped me into a brown room, with the great white and the pirate ship. Through a crack in the wall, I could see the backs of the smaller and larger creatures as they walked away.  Then the lights went out, there was a loud thud, and we were left to ourselves until the next night.   funny dream; made me laugh out loud.   my ex told me about a weird dream he had last week which ended with my mom hopping onto my back and me running off like a horse into the sunset.  That was freakin hilarious.   Another possibility is that we all just mis-read it/ mis-pronounced it as children, and remember our incorrect pronunciation rather than the real spelling.  It's also possible there are some kids out there who perceive it as Berenstein like we used to...   well she was too drunk at that point to think clearly   well, now, I've actually come to no sleep because most of the stories here are of far better quality than those in /r/creepypasta   truly amazing; the general premise of a roller coaster with secret split tracks to unknown fates reminds me of a Goosebumps book called Horrorland which I read as a child.  Your interpretation of the concept though is much better I think, because it is more true to life (Horrorland involved monsters of the imaginary kind rather than the real, human kind).  I'm sure you've heard of H.H. Holmes and his world's fair hotel?   not necessarily.    The idea that it was a shift in reality implies, as some people in the other linked threads pointed out, that those who always remembered Stain were either moved into this reality with the spelling, or we were all moved into theirs.    If it is about our perception of reality, then those who always remembered Stain didn't experience the shift in perception that the rest of us did, meaning they already perceived the world this way before the event that caused the rest of us to shift to this perspective.  We all perceive things differently, so it stands to reason that some people already perceived it in the Stain way   as far as the second 2 are concerned, read this and maybe get your eyes checked https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31bkpi/meta_psa_see_something_out_of_the_corner_of_your/  Although I have had things disappear and come back, as have we all.   The beiber thing is interesting.  In relation to the first one, someone else recently posted about having seen a movie before it came out so maybe talk to them? http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31cev8/i_saw_a_movie_before_it_even_came_out/   This is mind-blowing.  I used to pronounce it BerenstEEn, and there is no way I would say steen with an a in it.    This is incredibly disturbing.  But I have a theory.  I read about the shifting realities idea, and I think it is much simpler than that.   Reality did not shift; our perception of it did.  (the following theory comes from my experiences studying Criminal Justice and Psychology formally, and science informally, as well as my personal thoughts)  It is a well-known fact that everyone perceives and experiences things differently.  This is why 10 people could witness an event and have experienced it and remembered it in 10 different ways.  This is due to one's perceptual set, or frame of reference.  We all perceive and understand the world differently, in our own unique ways, based upon our experiences and understanding.  (for a clear and simple example, someone from the developing world would experience DisneyWorld fireworks differently than a Los Angeles native).   Although each individual's experiences shape his or her perceptual set, large portions of it are shaped by culture.  So, let's consider our western young-adult demographic as a culture for this situation.    Something caused a sharp shift in our culture's collective frame of reference.  We now perceive the world differently than we did as children (not necessarily just from becoming adults, although that is possible), and thus the shift from Stein to Stain is not a shift in reality, but rather a shift in our perception of reality.  We can find no record of Stein because no matter what we look at, we will perceive it as Stain.  The cause of the shift could be adulthood, 9/11, or anything else which has greatly altered all of our perceptual sets.  Thoughts?   I used to blog mine, back when I consistently got enough sleep to have and vividly recall interesting dreams (meaning High School). From August 2009 to September 2011 I posted 113 dreams.  Many of the ones I posted could easily be adapted into stories, but I didn't edit or embellish them for the blog.  you can check it out here if you want: http://epicdreamadventures.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/scb-dream-7-haunted-house.html   (the link is to one of the more memorable ones)   I've had lots of things like that happen, but the most notable was one time when my family and I were coming back from a road trip.  We had gotten souvenirs for friends and such, and the bag continaing them just disappeared in the car.  It was well in there, so it didn't just fall out.  And even when we cleaned the car out to trade it in, we never found it.  At one point before trading it in, my dad even found a gap/secret compartment under the seat, and the bag wasn't there either.  They just disappeared.   hi; sorry I took so long to get to this; I had an essay due before Spring Break.  Anyhow, here is one for the first story, where the dragon burns down the boat.  http://imgur.com/2bordiM  I noticed the other you've recieved is in black and white, so I left it as such.  Would you prefer they be in color?    It just occured to me that, if this is going to be printed out and distributed to the class, that they could treat them like coloring books :)   it's just the standard human level of psychicness :)   I actually just last week had something like that happen, where my ex and I both, the same night, had dreams which involved me being at his house.  It was weird.    that happens to me too with facebook.  I'll have it up in the background while I'm doing something else, and then I'll randomly un-minimize it just in time to see a message come in.  It's like I could sense I was about to get a message.  Happens almost every day.   Actually I have this all the time; I call it my mental alarm clock.   I always wake up around 5 minutes before my alarm, every day that I have somewhere to be.   I think I adapted this way because being awakened by an alarm is unpleasant and jarring, so I guess this is my subconscious's way of helping me avoid that and wake more gently.   It works even if I forget to set the alarm though, or flip it on.  I still wake up 5 minutes before the alarm time.  I am studying abroad now, and I was afraid at first that I would lose  my mental alarm clock to the time change/ jet lag, but I didn't.  It's not just about waking up though.  I think this works for me because I tend to remember things if I write them down.  Like, if I make a shopping list, then I remember what I need without actually having to look at it.  Same with class notes.  The act of writing things down makes me memorize them.    So, I think the mental alarm clock is related to that, in a general sense, seeing as I don't write down the time I need to wake up...  Do you also remember things just by writing them down?   *sipping the lemonade I just bought* So, how's business going?  Oh, you've made $60?  Good for you. Oh, no I am happy for you, it's just not as much as you think it is.  See, when you grow up, and have bills to pay, $60 doesn't go as far as it does when you're just buying candy and toys.   Time works the same way; it's all relative.  When you've only been alive for 5 years, one year is a fifth of your life, so it feels longer to you.  But when you're 10, like yourself, a year is only a tenth of your life, so it should feel half as long as it did when you were 5.  As you get older and that fraction gets smaller, days, months, and years feel even shorter, because the more you live, the smaller that year is in comparison to the rest of your life.  Thanks for the lemonade      I've never heard of a lighter melting though.  I don't smoke and neither does my family, so that may be why.  It still strikes me as bizarre.    If Olivia is a thing, and not just a series of freaky co-incidences, she seemed to be harmless up until seeking revenge for the insult.  Perhaps, to settle this, attempt to contact her again (sans-Ouija), and see if you get any kind of response.  To contact her without the Ouija (and please never use that thing again;  it invites evil spirits), gather everyone who has seen these events or been part in contacting her before (as best as you can; not necessarily the childhood friends, but the recent ones.), sit in a circle, relax as if to meditate together, then ask if she is there.  and take it from there.  IF she responds, then tell her you are sorry for insulting her (that should come from the friend who said the FU), and then maybe ask what she wants (but in a nice helpful way, do not say "WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?" ; say something like "Is there anything we can help you with so that you can rest in peace?"  I hope this is helpful; Let me know how it goes.   Coincidence or not, the gas and lighter is a dangerous situation.   I believe by vertical and horizontal op was talking about the way the bed was facing in the room, not that it was upright.   thank you :)   I love birds; I have pet birds.    However, I have seen a negative entity once that presented itself to me as a dark bird.  So it's possible.  How high up is it?  Can you see it well?  Can you tell if it is just sitting there or if its looking at you specifically?  You said power-line, so I'm assuming you can't see its' features?  IF it were an entity of some sort, it would not have normal features.  the fact that your parents see it too may indicate that it is not a spirit, but then again, it could also indicate that whatever it is doing there involves all of you.   independent of your dad's experience in particular, to address the issue of sleep paralysis, it is very real, you can induce it on yourself, and it is fucking terrifying.  I have never done it myself, but I know people who have, and I once, last year, had a nightmare in which I was in sleep paralysis;  I was fully aware but couldn't move a muscle or speak.  That was the most terrifying dream I have ever had.  To experience that for real though must be so much worse.  The person I know who has done it was horrified by it as well.    not very exciting um, you were pushed; I'd say that's pretty exciting.  The fact that your mom saw and experienced some of these things too is quite interesting.   well, difficulty communicating and adhering to societal norms is a disability for sure, although many other things lead people to the same problems.  Speech impediments, which are entirely physical, and shyness or even psychological disorders, like agoraphobia, which are entirely mental/chemical.  Its' classification as a disability makes it easier to get the therapy and assistance one needs to improve his or her ability to function in society.  Just like how Jewish became classified as a race despite being a religion; it helps legally with prevention of discrimination, making more laws applicable.    So yes, it is an impediment; the symptoms, when isolated, are not necessarily pathological; the syndrome as a whole is though.  The degree of impediment is what varies.  That's just my perspective from my personal experience.   My brother has grown out of a lot of his behavior/conformity to norms issues (by societal norms I mean understanding that you're supposed to be quiet in some situations, that he should tell an adult if he's going somewhere, that you say hello when someone comes in or you come in, and say goodbye when leaving and so forth).  Those are things that, delayed though it may be, you eventually learn (except in the extreme cases where the person is completely retreated into his or her own world).    Learning to use speech to communicate also came with some maturity I think; to realize that he must put in the effort to train his vocal and oral muscles to make sounds properly in order to communicate to live life.  As a smaller child though, the importance of working on verbal communication is not fully graspable to someone who doesn't fully understand how social interactions work.   that's a good point; I never thought about it in practical terms, like applying it to the so called autism epidemic.  (I'm not saying there isn't one; I'm just saying I don't think it should be called an epidemic).  My brother is autistic; but I never really tried to mind communicate with him much because I didn't want to run the risk of establishing a strong mind link, as I don't want him to be listening in on my thoughts randomly picking up on them, nor do I want to hear his. Especially now that he's getting older.   well now.  I think telepathy is also something we are all capable of, in terms of mind reading and mind communication.  Surely you've tried it at some point?   Pinky: "So what are we doing today?"  Brain: "The same thing we do everyday; try to take over the world!  I've figured out how we can actually do it.....*money*."  Pinky: "What do you mean?"  Brain: "Well the people in power get there by spending enough money, and once they're in power, corporations and interest groups pay them money to see things their way."  Pinky: "oh....what?  How does that help us?"  Brain: "we can use money to spread our message.  See, Net Neutrality laws have finally passed, which at first, I thought was great, because people will be able to see what we post on the web; we won't be censored or throttled into oblivion because big companies paid to have their sites load faster, or because other evil masterminds paid to have their page load faster than ours. "  Pinky: "..so how-"  Brain: "LET ME FINISH!  But, then I realized that, if there was no Net Neutrality, then *we* could use money to make our site the fastest most prominent site on the web.  We'll get all the attention we deserve.  SO WE CAN BRAINWASH THE WORLD!"  Pinky: "so how do we reverse net neutrality?"  Brain: "real simple: by getting people to vote *Republican*."  Pinky: "that's so crazy, it just might work!"  Brain: "we must also convince everyone that Net Neutrality is bad for them; that having the FCC regulating the internet will lead to restrictions and censorship."  Pinky: "so...you want to end Net Neutrality so that we can pay to be internet famous, with money we don't have, so that we can brainwash people; but to get there, we have to brainwash people?"  Brain: "PRECICELY!"  [by the way, a show I used to love as a kid, combined with a topic I am passionate about; I had to write one for you, although this is a devil's advocate pov...so I made it a satire :)]   ah ok; I got a more "born different/ with abilities" notion from the brief definition I read.    Then, I agree with the term; seeing things differently with a more open mind.  	41
 POOOOOOORRRTAAAAAAATUUUUUU!   C'mon, man, you're only in your early thirties.    Be of putting down gun, Sergei. That fish do nothing wronk to you.   No, I'm a human *and* a sandwich.   With a tongue like that, I bet that lion was pretty popular with the lionesses.   I gave you another upvote, so now you have three upvotes which makes you dirty liar.   Vaccinations. Duh.      Also, did you know Sasquatch single handedly increased chemtrails between 2000 and 2012 by more than 300%? Furthermore, it's suspected that the Illuminati have been the driving force behind Sasquatch's actions, providing him with the alien technology to efficiently spread mind-controlling substances via the skies. Open your eyes, sheeple!   Who gives a shit? Either way, he sucked and so did his sucky band.   Why would you upload of video of yourself failing so miserably?

If people are already committed to joining ISIS, this leaflet won't stop them unless someone already used that grinder to make pork sausages.   Some people eat hair. I don't know why, they just do. Hair doesn't digest and gets stuck in the stomach if too much is ingested. This picture shows what happens if you really like to chow down on pony tails and mullets.

 That's horrible legal advice. Look at the source it came from. That's like asking your opponent in a football game what you should do and they say "fumble the ball and let me score a TD."   The downfall is that many of the kids in the program are there because there were ordered by the court to be, as in they are generally troublemakers and there are lots of reports of stealing. Not to discourage you. It's actually a great opportunity. I'm just trying to give you all the information.   Well damn. All right, let's do a breakdown. You have $1000, plus $400 on Amazon. Do you mind saying what city you live in? You need to be in a place with good public transportation (even if you get the car, b/c gas is expensive), that is cheap, and has jobs.  Step 0) Sell everything you don't need. This includes the guitar, excess clothes, everything. If you absolutely cannot part with stuff you cannot carry on your back, you need to find one of those storage rental places that gives you your first month for $1 or some great deal like that. But be careful not to sign a contract for longer than that period. If you end up needing longer than the month,   1) Do you have a laptop? If so, you need to find places with free wifi. Usually McDonalds have free wifi so look there first.  2) Get a library card to waste time, read, and use their computers.  3) The $400 on Amazon is now your food money. They have Amazon lockers that you can get your items shipped to so you don't need an address. Buy small items that can fit in your backpack, and shop cheap.  4) Join a gym. Usually YMCA will give you a membership based on income. Check there first. This is now where you shower, shave, etc.  5) If you don't get the car, you need a place to sleep. Homeless shelters can probably be nasty and dangerous. If I were you, I would buy just an absolute junker of a car off Craigslist to at least sleep in. You can probably get one for $300. If you don't want to do that, start researching nearby shelters. I hear Walmarts are good at letting people sleep in their parking lots, but don't take that to the bank. Otherwise try to find deserted areas that don't look too dangerous. Warning: Don't sleep in the storage locker listed above. It's probably illegal and there are all sorts of dangers of freezing/heating to death, not to mention lack of oxygen if its airtight, etc.  6) Do you have a cell phone? Will your mom continue to pay for the plan? If not, then go buy one of those cheap phones with the pay as you go minutes and only buy the minimum and never text anyone. This is strictly for work contacts.  7) You need an address to put on job applications and where you can receive mail. Buy a PO Box from UPS. They have ones that look like real street addresses (http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/personal.aspx).  8) Now you have all your immediate needs out of the way. And honestly all the above steps shouldn't take you more than 2 days. Now you start job searching. Apply everywhere. You cannot discriminate. It's already likely going to be 2-3 weeks before your first paycheck arrives. Fastfood places generally have high turnover. Put on a button-up shirt if you have one and make your hair look good. You walk in and ask if the hiring manager is working and tell them you'd like to apply. Another good place to apply would be CVS or Walgreens, basically small drug stores. They also generally have high turnover. And this is actually a good time to be applying. There's not a lot of competition from high school/ college students like there is in summer.  9) After you get a job, you want to get a place. Don't waste time finding an apartment you can't afford right now. Go find a rent a room situation on Craigslist. Shouldn't be more than $500 including all bills. And make sure its a month-to-month situation.  10) Now you can start looking at community colleges. I'd start with 1-3 classes you can take when you're not working. Seriously, college goes faster than you know. Think of it as 40 classes. That's all you need to graduate from a 4 year college. Or even start looking at trade professions your community college may offer if you're interested. You already applied to FAFSA, great!! Take any aid offered. Aim to start this summer! You'll be done in just a few years. If you want to transfer to a 4 year college, do your first 60 credits (20 classes at community college) before you transfer. If you take 3 classes each term, and don't skip summers, you'll be done in 2 years + 1 semester. That can be your Associate Degree or your step to transfer to a Bachelors.   While my situation wasn't as dire as yours, I went through something similar, getting kicked out, on 1 weeks notice, when I was 18 and still in high school. I ended up working and taking community college classes for some years before transferring to a 4 year school and graduating with a double major. I'm now on a full scholarship to law school with a fiance and a cat. I'm telling you this so you can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better if you put in the effort. Feel free to respond on here or PM me if you have any other questions.   EDIT: Just saw you lived in rural Pennsylvania. That can't work. You need to get to the closest big city. It looks like Philadelphia is the biggest city in Pennsylvania by a lot. So you need to get there before any of these steps can happen. Try to get a ride from your mom since she's moving, but if not you need to use a tiny bit of your money to buy a bus ticket there.  EDIT 2: Just saw someone from Philadelphia say the job market sucks there. I looked up the lowest unemployment rates in the US and Salt Lake City, Utah is at the top with an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But they have a very small population. The city on the list with the highest population and lowest unemployment rate is Minneapolis, Minnesota or Austin, Texas. I looked at a Greyhound ticket and they're $108 from Philadelphia to Minneapolis or $139 to Austin. They are both big cities with low unemployment rates under 5%.   Do you have any interest at all in the military?  I'm not a huge proponent of the military, but you are low on options and they will provide you with food, housing, medical, salary and seemingly most important to you, some structure in life.  Plus you can learn a skill that might be applicable when you get out.   For anyone on mobile where it's a pain in the ass to get to, the nickname is Cuddly Bear.   I assumed it would be unranked schools, but it's Iowa (27th) and SUNY Buffalo (100th to be fair).  The article suggests this is the ABA no longer requiring the LSAT for up to 10% of each school's entering class and that more schools will soon follow. Article also suggests that schools will likely lobby the ABA for an even higher percentage of students to be allowed in without LSAT scores.  This is all due to dropping enrollment, which dropped another 7% from last year.  The schools will require the students' SAT/ACT, GRE, GMAT, or other standardized college scores in place of the LSAT.      Planning on going to 187 so this is easy.  Edit: I'd obviously buy the UFC to record at home so I can hope to catch myself going nuts.   That's it. I'm buying tickets.   More like, "dude I have this great deal where you'll make $20. Sign this contract real quick."   Not now they won't because they still wouldn't have the votes to override a presidential veto. Now if they get a Republican president and still have a House majority but only between 51-59 Senators, I would highly suspect they would do just what you say.   He's also going for his 16th Zuffa win in a row, same record Anderson set.   His case got reviewed by the Supreme Court. It's over. There's no one else to appeal to. I think I'd be happier running and always looking over my shoulder than spending my time in prison.   I agree 100%, but that does not mean that the decision to do something detrimental to your health would not be a stupid decision. Do you agree with the suicide hypothetical I posted above?   Surprisingly good. I like how they're taking their time to set up for the long run. Taking it kind of slow, but have some powerful scenes so far.   Those people are pretty stupid. Yes, there are a few that won't get addicted after doing heroin for a week, but I'd argue that the health effects of that week alone are enough to make it stupid, much less the likely possibility that you aren't one of the few chosen ones who will get addicted.   Right. And I'm saying that it's pretty stupid to likely ruin your life for that chance.   Not at all. If you just filmed it and the after-effects, it would serve about the same impact as this heroin experiment.   That's not my hypothetical though. It was only what happened here, which is someone doing something extremely detrimental to themselves for a CHANCE they will prevent others from doing the same.   I realize that. I'm saying it's pretty much one of the stupidest things someone could do. You've agreed that it is analogous to someone killing themselves if it prevents others to do so. I also think that's insanely stupid. But according to you, that could NEVER be stupid if you do it with the intention of the public good in mind. I think that's a pretty stupid idea.   So you are completely agreeing with the suicide hypothetical.   You are effectively arguing that if someone does something that is bad for themselves but prevents the general public from doing that thing then it's not stupid. So if this guy were to kill himself instead, say gunshot to the head for example, and that prevented others from killing themselves after they saw how sad his family was, then that wouldn't be stupid, right?   What part of purposely getting addicted to heroin do you not find stupid?   It was a personally stupid idea to knowingly do one of the most addictive drugs on the planet.   Let the door hit you in the face on your way out.   I'm sorry but how stupid can you be to think that's a good idea?   The Way Way Back, The Spectacular Now, The To Do List, and of course Boyhood.   Someone said 17 year old and that it was consensual.   That's like a scandal over jaywalking.   Looks like I'm redditing mobily from now on.   I'm sure that's exactly how it would go but I'd at least be able to prepare some sort of defense compared to the other two options.   Never beach and move from hotel to hotel every week.   Where so I can just never go there.   Typically not. Instead they will track the market rental rate in their area and when the current lease is up, the renewal rate will be at market rent. This sometimes correlates with interest rate increases, but is not caused from these increases, if that makes sense.   It's part of Obama's budget proposal. But the cap has not passed yet. Also, it seems it would be interpreted to mean that it would only apply to new borrowers.   If it's a phone, you just don't go on wifi.   Do you pet them? I'm just unclear on what you do with the wolves? Just looking?  As someone semi-new to the area, I've never been around a wolf and have no clue what to do/expect.   Looks like an even dopier version of Eli Manning behind Bones.   I always see these kind of pictures from up north and think "Gee, it sure would be wonderful to live there," but then I remember you guys actually have winters and how I walked outside in shorts today here in San Diego.   Ah, that makes a lot of sense then.   I don't believe his cut has been released for anyone besides BJ, but correct me if I'm wrong.  Also he works with lesser known fighters all the time and I'm fairly certain they are not paying him more than they make.   There's no way Dolce charges that to the lower tier guys.   3rd year law student.   Your landlord has a specific clause in the lease stating you can't replace your door with one with a lock? That right there should have been a red flag.  You should inquire as to why you are not allowed to secure your things and if you can change that part of the lease, as your safety/wellbeing is being affected.   Get a lock for your door. $15 and 10 minutes to install.   Damn. I even looked on the front page and just must have missed it.   I'm inclined to agree that Rumble is best based on what we've seen of his power in his last few fights. But I kinda feel like he's ranking Rashad above DC and Gus just because he likes to make those to feel bad because of all the crap they've talked recently.  I do agree with his DC over Gus though.      I have no idea about Australian law, but I'll give general life advice. Do you have proof she forced you to write the note to her, such as texts, email, or voicemail? If so it seems unlikely to hold up.  I also am unsure of the damage responsibility.  However if I were you, and were scared for my pets life, I would lie and tell her I had the money and that I will meet her in public with the money if she brings the dog then just take it from her in as harmless way as possible. Let her call the police and attempt to sue you and deal with that later but your first priority should be keeping your pet safe from a seemingly psychotic person.   Thank you so much!   Thanks, I really appreciate it.   Why do you see so many fighters there? Are you in Vegas or LA?   I did call at about 2pm today and those were the only options available.   Yea that's definitely not what I'm saying.   It only gives me the option to say I'm calling about a refund, which is the option I've been selecting, or an amended 1040X. Should I just select the 1040X option?   And in the absence of any contenders, would you agree someone could justifiably get a title shot in a new division?   I can see the difference. However, my point is that you are recognizing that someone can earn a title shot in a division they do not have any wins in.  You are not refuting this point.  I'm merely extending the point to #1 contenders who just lost.   See that's my point. If you are agreeing that someone, ANYONE, could be entitled to a title shot based on their performance in another weightclass, then why not a #1 contender who just lost? I mean to become a #1 contender, they obviously had to have some pretty high level wins, so they are likely going to be competitive in the new weightclass, just as a champion would have.   What about the JBJ part?   Really? Why not, because he has no wins at MW?  What about if JBJ wanted to go up/down to HW/MW for his next fight? Would he also not deserve a shot because of no fights at HW/MW?   Dude. Many people believe Frankie beat Bendo in the 2nd fight and thus was arguably better than the 155 champ. Yea, he didn't earn the fight at FW, but he more than earned it with his wins at LW.  Let me put it this way: if Cormier, who just lost againt JBJ wanted to (and physically could) drop down to MW, do you really think he wouldn't be worthy of an immediate shot at Weidman?   WHERE DO YOU WORK?   I filed my taxes in January 2014 for the 2013 tax year. My refund never came and when I went to Where's My Refund, it said it was still "in process" or something along those lines. After 10 weeks or so, I figured I got audited but I had nothing to worry about. In June, I called up the IRS (forgot what number I called or how I found it) and was told that they were indeed auditing me and that they would contact me before August. That came and went with no contact from them, and I got busy with school. Well now it's January and I need to file this years return but I kinda want to know the status on last years return (and get my refund).  So when I got on Where's My Refund now, it thinks I'm entering for tax year 2014 and doesn't work anymore. And if I call the (800) 829-1040 number I found, it keeps prompting me for SSN, refund amount and filing status, but when I enter those it asks when I filed my tax return, either before January 5th, 2015 or after. When I select before, it just says they haven't processed those yet, but obviously they're thinking of this years tax return and I'm thinking of last years.  Please can someone point me in the right direction?   I filed my taxes in January 2014 for the 2013 tax year.

Please can someone point me in the right direction?   I mean the definition of perjury is lying under oath so yes he would be.   That's exactly my point. Kuhn stands out from the other fullbacks.   How many better FBs can you name?   Haha same here bro, same here.   I mean I get that, but in the article it says Peyton's earned $230MM. I don't follow Peyton's life too much, but I'm sure he lives in a house he's probably paid $20MM or so for, and lives on mayyyybbee $1MM or so each year he's been in the league. After accounting for taxes, which should be about 40% or so, that leaves him with a little over $100MM left, assuming he had no investments whatsoever. Now what in the world would PFM want to buy that he could with $120MM but not $100MM. It just makes no sense. I mean if he invested in US Bonds, yielding some of the lowest interest rates, he'd be nearly guaranteed $2MM each year for the rest of his life.  tl;dr: If he comes back, it's not for the money.   What do you think Peyton would want right now that he can't afford but an extra $19MM will allow him to afford and is worth the risk of another severe injury?  If I had as much money as him, I would retire yesterday from a sport as dangerous as his.   Unless OP's name is Larry.   I nominate Court McGee for best response.   Oh you almost certainly have nothing to worry about. Here's a study on births by pregnancy week. Basically anything past 43 weeks would be extremely rare and a doctor would almost certainly induce by week 41.  http://spacefem.com/pregnant/charts/duedate3.php   We are in agreement that OP should get the test.  However over a 9 month block, months certainly do work on averages. Pick any 9 month block and it will be closer to 40 weeks than 36 weeks.   Months are 4.33 weeks on average, so it's actually much closer to 9 months than 10.   As someone who uses adblock, I think you should put a small banner at the top of the site that explains this, because now that I know, I will disable adblock for your site.   That reasoning doesn't make sense. An interception on 4th and a fumble on 4th down are still turnovers.   I don't know him personally. I hung out with him for an hour or two.   When Tim did his AMA and came on here asking if any redditors wanted to help, I responded. Me and another dude went to Tim's house and played with his dogs and we helped type up his AMA as he dictated. He gave us both plenty of signed gear and invited us to a BJJ seminar he was doing the next day. Pretty cool dude.   Oh man I completely forgot it was vacant.   LOL I was getting downvoted for that?  Such is life in /r/MMA    A couple things to note. 1) Johny was injured when Lawler was climbing his way back up so an immediate rematch wasn't possible. 2) A contender losing and getting the rematch is pretty unprecedented (only happened with Shogun/Machida), whereas a champion losing and getting an immediate rematch happens all the time and is even more justified because the result was controversial   For the record I disagree with the rematch. I think Rory should get the fight.   The federal govt will just give them to you. No need for you to shop around. Don't go private, or you lose all sorts of repayment benefits.  Source: in law school   If you verified there was a problem with the handle it seems likely they weren't lying.  Just keep that in mind when making your offer.   I think that's more 1/3   Is this what Leo was talking about in that scene in Django?   LOL. No, you signing the wrong name on the contract won't hold up in court. You would lose that argument 100/100 times.   W-what is this?   Yea, that's not gonna hold up in court.   When you say fill in the missing parts, do you just mean stuff your teacher mentions that the outline did not have, or do you just keep the main headings of the outline and fill in all the information?    Henry "Mini Tito" Cejudo   Apparently dude just got out of jail.   Would Rodgers be Iron Man?   Said wrestler was supposedly right around 200 pounds, so 12 pounds is 6% of his bodyweight. 5 pounds for Nate at 160 is just over 3%.   Sorry to hijack here, but I just saw Foxcatcher tonight where Channing Tatum is a wrestler and the weigh ins happens, and the dude telling Channing he's 12 pounds over. Mark Ruffalo asks dude how much time they have and he says 90 minutes. I started busting out laughing cause the next scene is Channing biking his ass off on a stationary with a sweatshirt on, and apparently he makes weight cause it shows him fighting the next scene. No idea if that part was based on a real story but it was unreal.  Point being, if that wrestler could do it, Nate could.   Cause it's 12/12   Who would you vote for instead if Hillary ended up being Dem candidate?   That actually brings up a very interesting point. Like right now, if you have a fight coming up in the next 3-4 months its whatever, you'll fight either way. But if they try to schedule you for an event in May/June, would you just get "injured" and not be able to fight until July? I mean really, how many sponsors are gonna stick around until the very last minute? It just makes sense to try to delay at that point.   Where you at motherfucker?!? Don't be scared!   I still stand by my statement than anyone with multiple MVP seasons is a HOFer. I don't care if they only played 2 seasons. I think that alone deserves HOF, but I realize people will disagree with me.  Also, a SB win, SB MVP, and 3 SB appearances. I mean that's better than 99% of all QB's. I definitely feel Warner has earned HOF.   Edit: Let me give you a hypothetical because I'm curious. Say a QB came into the league and had most yards ever in a season, highest completion percentage ever, most TD's in a season, least INTs ever in a season, lead his team to a perfect record and won SB MVP. Then the next season he had identical stats and record, but promptly retired after those 2 seasons. Would you think he deserved HOF then?   In your position, I would do night school if you want to finish your degree. Also, since you're moving soon, you should wait until you qualify for in-state tuition.  Also, welcome (soon) to San Diego! I think it hit 80 today. I got hot walking around in a light jacket. Also, people freak out when it rains at all and forget how to drive.   Let me guess. Punitive damages, jury trial?   This 2014 season. Nearly everyone has him leading.  Also, Warner is looking like a first ballot HOFer, so I don't see how that's a good argument. Yes, there's argument, but if he doesn't make this cut, he'll almost surely be in within the next few years.   They said it last week, when they had Pats #1 after they JUST lost to the Packers. I believe it was something along the lines of "I know how good the Patriots are and nothing I saw in this game changes that."  	104

This stuff is not new; my grandfather was an OB/GYN and used to travel to indian reservations to delivery babies. There have always been people who are NOT bigots, not racists. The line we are fed about the times changing...really what's changing is whether we accept that status quo or challenge it en masse.       It's a gun thing, not a pot thing. Take the pot away, and the gun could still kill ya.                                     This is the third incident involving children and guns since Friday in the Houston area.       ^^ End of story.       Just local NRA chapter head.    A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.  Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.  Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.  Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said.         Kyle T. Dodds was treated for a gunshot wound at the Nebraska Medical Center and booked into the Sarpy County Jail for attempted first-degree assault, making terroristic threats, felony child abuse and use of a weapon to commit a felony. Just before midnight Bellevue police were called to 4128 Bartmann Dr. and learned that Dodds was intoxicated and armed with a rifle. Also inside the home were a woman and two young children, said Officer Laurie Synowiecki, a Bellevue police spokeswoman.               Blame the unnamed contractor. Contractors are the new interns.          Her Facebook page is filled with Bible verses, and information about organizing for the Republican Party.             Oddly similar to how the  GOP caters to billionaires but keeps its own supporters half-witted and clueless.    So no cell phones, but ISIS can tweet and create video montages of massacres? These fuckers flip flop like politicians.                         Yep. Looks like the news will either blame atheism or progressivism, and not the gun that killed the three. No fucking surprise.       "My sister had a right to life," said Jane Dougherty of Littleton, whose sibling was killed at Sandy Hook. "My sister had a right to grow old. ... Nobody ever died from a background check."         That picture reads like something out of a trailer park or an open carry Texas rally. Teabillies are the same all over the world!                         It's a weird thing to feel awkward about though - it's the RIGHT thing to do, even though it's easily mocked and scoffed at. What's better - giving out money? Giving out fast food? Or giving out healthy food?    This divide-and-conquer could result in deaths. Rand Paul should step down. This is very dangerous misinformation that puts the public at dire risk.    This is incredibly dangerous, and he should be forced to resign. Unfit to serve if he can't grasp basic science. This is seriously KILLING PEOPLE; I have a tiny niece who is too young to have received the measles vax. And pregnant friends; anyone know what happens to a fetus if mom gets rubella? FUCK THIS SHIT. Rand Paul is a fucking ignorant info-terrorist and should not hold any public office.    Holy shit. he should step down; that shows a profound lack of understanding of basic science. UNFIT TO SERVE.                            Coloradans bought 36,666 guns last month, according to the states background check report.    Horror.       Worried that the fighting might escalate further and knowing that guns and ammunition were around the house, the 14-year-old started gathering what she could find to hide it.  "(The girl) said all the guns were in easily accessible places," the complaint said. "(She) said that, fearing one of her parents would pick up a gun and use it against the other, she tried to grab all the guns and ammunition. (She) said she put the guns/ammunition she could gather into her bedroom, to get them away from her parents."  Police searched the home and found five guns that belonged to Wright, according to the complaint. A Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith   Wesson AR 5 rifle were in a child's room.              To be fair, that was some sweet honeyed dick.    Same-same. But different.    Same here. I thought of my own child when he accidentally spills something and says "Sorry mom, I spilled my drink"...and how this kid said "I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin."   The adults surrounding those two boys failed them both. I hope the five year old gets massive support and counseling, but I fear that's not something you ever get over. God damnit.       I see stories like this daily, but this one wrecks me. Where is the nationwide PSA? Where are the safe storage laws being demanded by the survivors?? Where is the accountability here? This five year old's life is forever damaged.                                    	100

Just all POV shots, silhouettes, or shots where his/her face is obscured.     Personally, he's the guy from OZ, a million audio books, and the History Channel. One of my favorite voices ever.

But there's a few on there I'm glad I saw.    Not really. It's kind of forced in it's creepiness (the use of b w is a dead giveaway to me that they're trying to be creepy rather than make porn.) It's also nothing like the short story, and the author of the short story called the site lame: http://gadgets.gunaxin.com/interview-nes-godzilla-author/173878   I'll say Psychosis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YugLGMYX030  I think the pacing is great if nothing else, even though it's a long one.

The person on the street, after France, China, the Japanese, and then the Americans called it "this shit again."    My brother insists that Pinkie Pie works better when she's actually a kind of compassionate being. She's supposed to be so desperate for parties and fun because it's the only way she knows to try to make others happy. That's why it's supposed to be so important to her when she gets her cutie mark that her family like her party set up, and that if she only cared so much about candy and stuff she could have just entertained herself. That's also why when no one's around she goes so crazy.   I argued that it makes her too much of a goody-goody and that she needs to have some selfishness and such. She's also kind of stunted and oblivious at the end of the day, and she'd be less compelling if she's so selfless.    That's when it gets the hose again.    I was just listening to an interview about Big Eyes, the movie about those Keane paintings, and they were talking about how Keane was supposed to have both started the idea of selling the story behind the art, not just the piece itself (also there's that commercialism of art aspect.) I've also heard this said about Van Gogh and such. So what pieces rely totally on their intrinsic merits and we have no idea who made them or under what context they were made?    Is she the one that was interviewed on First Person?    The true mark of quality, I guess.   I've heard before the internet, Clerks was supposed to be the most stolen movie. Does anyone know if that's true?      Please excuse me if this feels too cynical or too focused on business for this subreddit, but I've got a manuscript I will soon have edited and if I cannot interest a publisher in it, then I'll have to do this.     I and a friend just got into an argument about Ready Player One. I looked for someone to back me up online and was surprised to learn that there were relatively few reviews that had my back on this.   You had any books where you had that feeling recently?          I don't know, this just doesn't seem creepy to me. It's more like sad or unpleasant.       http://listverse.com/2014/12/28/10-creepypastas-adapted-into-even-creepier-short-films/  Warning: a few of them are based on those video game horror stories that I think even Creepypasta fans think are pretty bad. At least one of those is a parody, one's short, and the third one's kind of okay.    Why is Scootaloo mad?     Just your magic to slightly lift yourself up when you're on the scale. It works for me.    It's the "already famous for it" that makes me laugh the most. The thought that the guy not only is famous, but his girlfriend doesn't know about it and random people are aware of how fast his rise to prominence has been.    Do people give you guff about reinforcing gender stereotypes by associating female players with pink or something like that?    So she gets killed by it too?   Alright, which generation clone is Pinkie by now?    I was just wondering with my friend how much The Interview would have just made Youtube and how that cut compares to a movie theater.    I haven't seen any of these. But I'm going to change that pretty substantially this weekend!    So how much of a percentage would Youtube have taken from that?             Anything of yours available on Youtube in authorized postings?       He'll be sure to cut in enough new scenes to make it six hours long.    I was watching Reefer Madness: The Musical. There's this scene where the main character's love interest is shot in the chest and she's bleeding out. The guy is cradling her in his arms and she reprises an earlier song "We are just like Romeo and Juliet. We're happy, young, and * Cough * Hemorrhaging blood." Now obviously the movie is deliberately goofy, their relationship is clearly unhealthy, and the lyrics are silly. Really, I imagine audience members would usually hate the character singing by design. But I actually welled up when I heard that line being sung. My only excuse is that Kristen Bell is a very good singer and all that, but damn, I bet it would have gotten a laugh if in the movie there had been a cut to a close up of someone watching that scene.    Aren't there four artists for it?   Also yes, I thought it was shit from the first comic.    I think it's the fact he went alone that made it awkward.          NOTE: You don't have to agree that it was a sexist movie, it just has to be one where you would have thought people would complain about it.   I was archive binging and read an old review about Clerks and I was surprised that it hadn't occurred to me that its gender politics are kinda questionable, especially since the indie film world that made Kevin Smith's name is so attached to progressives: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239  Any other movies where you're surprised more people didn't talk about that?    Saturn 3. I don't think it's remembered enough to be hated, let alone popular.       /r/spacedicks      No [The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSEzGDzZ1dY)?   Aren't those 16 mm film projections?    Well, you drive under the zip line, you're going to get this kind of thing!      Challenge accepted: Sombity.    I've had an insanely good year at the movies, since the worst I saw by far was Maze Runner.    That's more Talmud than Christian bible.    These characters are supposed to be idealists, not out for money. They want to actually treat patients.       Isn't it common knowledge now that buying a new car is one of the worst investments you can make and you'll lose thousands of dollars driving it off the lot?    I know it's a stereotype that FA people idealize the idea of having a relationship to an insane extent, but I had a reaction that I think was an example of this that I think most people would think was pretty funny.   I was watching Reefer Madness: The Musical. There's this scene where the main character's love interest is shot in the chest and she's bleeding out.

So yeah, there's a real "that guy needs a girlfriend" moment for you. Yours?     I know that cancer is actually many diseases that sort of get lumped into one category. Let's just say one that would be most feasible for a small, underground organization to make.  This is for a story I'm working on in case you're wondering. Profit margin isn't really an issue since the characters involved are driven by ideology. Also the characters are intended to be chemists themselves and thus can steal and bribe to get materials not normally available.  Thanks for your time.          Yeah, I'm freshly arrived from /r/foreveralone, but this is something I've seen in porn a few times and I've been kind of curious about it lately. To me the stuff smells kinda unpleasant, but some people insist that there's something to the smell of sweat too, so what do I know?    Sorry, OOP apparently meant to post this as the source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W78pPCtt9d8   So? Why should women lower their standards?    Being Dilbert probably doesn't help.    Still better than the results of when Pinkie claimed she was super skilled at making cupcakes.    Another bad breakup, I'm guessing.      He could really relate to the scene where Mason took someone's McCain '08 sign.   Or at least one comic artist is not likely to enjoy it.    That's what Tia has been rated?    I... am... not... a... gun.    The situation she's in now is way creepier than she is.       Deleted scene from The Room.    Sorry, but the sped up foot movements still look kind of silly. I don't know how to make that work, though. Maybe the actress had to be weighed down so that when she ran, it looked more like she's actually running.    I was archive binging and read an old review about Clerks and I was surprised that it hadn't occurred to me that its gender politics are kinda questionable, especially since the indie film world that made Kevin Smith's name is so attached to progressives: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239  Any other movies where you're surprised more people didn't talk about that?       That's at least forty cents too little!   Didn't one of those old games with the ludicrously bad cut scenes have you play as Zelda for it?       This is more like an anecdote than a rant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKbAEmvZyKQ unless he went on about him on Smodcast or something else I haven't seen.    The comment section on that article is hysterical if you're obsessed with the Simpsons.    Well, that's a bit much for being annoyed by overexposure to something they don't like.    Because it's such a well-known film, I hear it bashed pretty often. This  is particularly by parents who are sick of their kids watching it. Online of course there's a lot of bile for it too. I feel compelled to defend it a bit for the reason given in the title, but of course it would kind of be a waste of time.   Blargh.     I think it would be funny for there to be a character in MLP that is actually happy with being alone and Pinkie kinda butts up against the idea (unlike with Cranky where he was unhappy with his loneliness and turned it into bitterness.)      This is just CG?    So AJ and AB are way closer in age than I would have thought?    I don't get this. Is this a reference to something another performer did? Or is it just that a character on a children's show is being unpleasant?    Are the guest rappers worth checking out? I found out about Dan Bull from the Jack the Ripper rap and became a bit of a fan.    It's unlikely that some of them will be accessible in your area, but I heavily recommend these: http://thedissolve.com/features/2014-in-review/851-the-best-2014-films-that-made-under-100000/   I think Visitor Q is less terrifying and more just disgusting.

It's a hardcore Smith purist traveling back from the future to prevent Clerks II and III.    /r/mildlypretty      Has her highness developed resting bitch face?    Huh, I didn't know Hank Azaria was a Disney animator.    Britain waives the rules.    Obviously it barely matters that the characters in MLP are horses, but just around the time I was joining the herd I got a quick gig feeding and watering horses for a family. They really weren't that nice, with only the oldest one being willing to let me pet it at all or anything.   One thing that stands out in my memory about that gig was one night it got horribly cold, like -7. I lost a bit of sleep worrying about how cold they'd be in their stables. Then I showed up and let them out for their feeding, and one of them started rolling around in the snow. I should have been she was okay, but I remember being pissed that I'd  been worrying about this horse and then it felt like she was unwittingly rubbing in my face what a waste that worry had been.             So is this an illustration from one of those Rainbow Dash books that Daring Do is so obsessed with?    Oh my god, as much as I feel prostitution should be legal so that it can be regulated and all that, this sentence made me laugh so hard. I just imagine them all convening on wherever the meeting point was at once, maybe carpooling.    Their comedy sucks ass and in PDP's case his personality seems so calculated and horrible that it's sickening.    Oh hell no, Furries are fine with me. It's guys like PewDiePie fans or TheSw1tcher fans that are fans of something I can't stand.    Learning that there's a lot of overlap with it and fandoms I loathe.

I'm not saying I'm above it or anything. I just know from second hand experience that of course relationships don't solve all your ills. I have to imagine anyone that would settle for me would probably come to resent me pretty quickly. I'm probably not mature enough to adjust to a relationship and at twenty-eight it's probably a bit too late.    Not that I've lived a bad life and this is some kind of tragedy. In fact, sometimes it helps things feel a little better.          I think you mean Room 237732 mooR.  	162

    I honestly don't know why people say this was so tough.  Maybe it's because I grew up playing the old DK and DK Jr games.  Although it was mostly on the NES.   Bond sure has changed a lot since Daniel Craig.   Lesbian seagull   Am I too late to have a comment that hasn't been taken and will be recognized?      Agreed.  Weekends are OK though since there is no work.      Although Back to the Future would be a good direction to point them.  I think in this case the South Park episode where Cartman freezes himself for a Wii would help explain things better.      Thanks.  We weren't looking to sell them.  Just curious if they did have any value but we couldn't find anything online since the box was blank.   My dad got these out over Christmas while the family was home.  The figures are each about 1.5" tall.  It has 2 figures of JFK at the end of it.  The box isn't in the best of shape, but there isn't any information on it to even try to look up.      I took these numbers as total profit made since Nintendo got into the video game scene.  Same with the Sony and Microsoft numbers.   Hmm, that could make it interesting for me to try watching it then.         Me and a friend were sitting in our living room watching tv.  We realized that there were 2 shows on later at the same time that we wanted to watch.  My friend calls my roommate (who is upstairs) to ask him to set his VCR (yes, before dvr was the norm) to record one of the shows instead of one of us walking up the stairs to tell him.   Big Lebowski, Toy Story, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park   Not sure if I'm missing something, but why is the gold N64 only $149, but the standard one is $199?  Am I looking at something wrong?      That was my standard day trying to study when I was in college.  Be at the library reading for about half an hour, take about an hour nap at the table, then study for about another half hour before finally going home.   At least you lived long enough to post the picture.   Wrestlemania 2000 is the one that gets played to this day with me and my brothers.  Although we do have No Mercy as well.   So what does owning a construction company have to do with this?   The 2 digit number on the bottom of an anheuser busch can lets you know what time of day it was produced.  Every 15 minutes is an extra digit for the number.  Example: 2:00 am = 08      He was way ahead of his time.   I have jumped in the lake for the past 10 years, and it has only snowed once during that entire time.  So it seems pretty rare when it does snow.      It all depends on who sees it first in r/new if you ask me.   Guitar Hero was on 2 games ahead of Rock Band because the first game came out 2 years ahead of the first Rock Band.  Not because they came out with multiple full fledged sequels that often.  But you are correct with the spinoffs that Guitar Hero put out in a short period of time.   It's been a while since I've played this, but I thought it was off by one.  So to get the star, you'd actually press the button when the mushroom before the star was in the center of the screen.  and all three rows worked the same way.   Are there only 5 levels to the DK Arcade game?  Or are you just throwing a number out there?  Because I have not been able to get through the arcade game myself.   And I still read it the correct way on here too.   As a bonus, Tom Hanks is still listed as being in the movie!   I'm probably one of the few people that actually played through the entire game.   True   Can't say I'm beta spaghetti pants.  So it looks like the bill would be split 3 ways.      Although they are delicious, I'd say that sour patch kids are one step better.

Except instead of the bear living next door, it lives with them?   TBDBITL!   The summers were great for me back in those times.  My dad is the custodian at my school and during the summers he could take a computer home with him and a copy of each of the games.  That way the computers did sit around dormant for 3 months straight. Hours upon hours of Number Munchers, Miners Cave, Odele Lake, etc.   So why are you digging through your neighbors trash to begin with?   The black one with the big X on it is what I'm referring to.  That would be Xbox.   [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Call) is what I was thinking of.  But I really doubt it's referring to the same thing as the article on here.   Why does the Xbox controller look so pissed to be with all the others?   I think it's sending the signal to space to hopefully contact [aliens](http://qkme.me/3raohs)   I'll have to take some time to look through these to help get ideas for this year.   But why is he in timeout and sitting in the corner?   Woops, I guess I didn't even look at it.  I was looking through posts regarding Ohio State doing a video game themed show from this past weekend and just assumed it was that same show.  My bad.   Yeah, Ohio State does do a different half time show every week.  It surprises me how they can learn that stuff so quickly.  3 weeks ago they did one honoring NASA and Neil Armstrong which was pretty neat too.   From what I read a few months back, I believe they are going to remain their own country and won't be considered part of Fuji.   I think tv executives have already taken care of this question.   I went to a public school and had 61 kids in my class.  A neighboring town has around 35 for an average class size.   So piss comes out of the faucet?   Will Smith and Matthew McConaughey?  How did they get on here?   [Stunt Cycle](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1280 st=2) is what I had.  And I actually still have it in working condition to this day.   I just assumed it was another day when they were there, and not immediately after all the destruction.   I was a little afraid to click on it when i read "chat roulette" in the title.

 Untreated IBD might develop into cancer, but chronic unmanaged cases of IBS are mostly responsible for severe deterioration in quality of life. If left untreated for too long, it can be associated with conditions requiring surgery - like diverticulitis.    Could be.  Bread, Cakes, Whipped Topping, Jams, Ice cream, creamy sauces, chocolate, Noodles ... all these products have emulsifiers and are on the list of problem foods for IBS - as contain combinations of gluten, FODMAPs, lactose and other sugars.   EMI seems to be useful in some but not all cases - text messaging, for example, seems to be useful in diabetes but not body weight control.   What kind of existing and future sensing technologies could be the most useful and effective?  How to navigate the fine line between nagging   intrusiveness versus being helpful and nurturing?   Applies to both new and old (aged) runners. As marathons are more popular than ever, the  average/median time slowed to its current snail's pace - from 3:30 in the 80s, to 4:30 or so. The record for the slowest median time is over 8 hrs.  I saw headlines like "how sluggish newbies ruined the marathon" more than 10 years ago. Yet, Greg Meyer (winner of Boston Marathon in 1983), said If it wasnt for the run-walkers, you wouldnt be finishing in front of anybody.   The article recommends to take walk breaks, that's all. The frequency of these breaks depends on the individual. Some are better in listening to their body than others and don't need such advice, but others might benefit from it.   Edit: Is there a better way to redirect posts instead of punishing the poster? As I understand, Reddit takes away rights to post anything new or repost after a post was downvoted, so I can't repost it.   Also, if you read the comments to this article, some "real runners" did find it interesting - "My own experience of running competitively (25+ years) bears out the evidence in Hottenrott's study.  The walk breaks enable you to change your movement pattern, refuel/hydrate, and reset your thinking."  	5

Reddit made my widget popular, so I own you guys.   Hi, there... I was wrong, there is a way... (which doesn't drain battery) and I already added it, I will ad Google Calendar colors as option and will push in few hours an update with that!   Yes, it have to be in next 12 hours, and it have to be a "not all day one". Also it refreshes every 30minutes so if you add one in meantime, wait 30min. or remove and add calendar to force update.   It will work like that in next or 2.0 update - so matter of days. Stay tuned.   Glad that bug turnouts to be a feature.    Can't get alarms from Android... Sorry. I would love to.  	34

Also you can watch the german documentary ["It began with a lie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW2-vNNWFsE) (Es begann mit einer Lge) with english subtitle... Its about the war in '99.

Kada sam gledao po salu, prvi put sam bio, uhvatila me malo tuga. Ljudi za 700-1900dinara propustaju vrhunski koncert jednog genije muzike, nesto sto vrediti gledati, nesto kulturno nesto fantasticno. Bili su muzicari iz libanona, afrike, amerike i portugala. Vrhunsli umetnici i prijatelji srbije. Skupili smo pare za majske poplave. 4+ sati covece, muzike za dusu. A sala nije bila puna. Kada zamislim onda da je Srbija tri puta za redom punila salu mrzitelja Srba i plagiatora Dina Merlina uhvatila me tuga. Jebiga valjda cemo se opametiti jednog dana. Ja te ljude absolutno ne postujem jer same sebe ne postuju... Od njih, tu sam siguran, nista nema.   Na kraju me taksista vozio do hotela oko 00:15h i koncert je jos trajao. Devojka morala ici. I on me pitao da li koncert jos traje. Rekao da se vrati opet tamo jer vidi da bas kulturni ljudi izlaze, dopalo mu se... Nije on znao ko je zaista Mirko :)  To sam hteo samo da kazem.

 What are you saying? It IS dangerous or not? Very curious about this.  	1
 Great, advice thanks! The SIPPS combined with ISA sounds about what I'm looking for, unfortunately I'm currently in central London so it will be a long time until the house deposit is sorted!    Hi all, I've only recently started to think about what my options are, I'm 22 but I figured the sooner you get started the easier it is in the long run right?   I've already started purchasing premium bonds and have an ISA that I contribute to every month, but I'm confused as to what are the best (flexible) options out there which have a reasonably high gain.  I guess Ideally I'm looking for something I can transfer money too every month and be quite secure. Any help?   Just checked out Realplayer for the first time in years, its actually got a lot going for it, especially compared to QT pro X   Crumble Haggis over our pizza  	4
 Ah, you're also a young one. Shame we've been hit with this so young, right?  My heart rate was in the low 40s as I slept when I was admitted, the food also sucked at mine and I had a mental breakdown at the idea of having 'snacks'. (Though that was mainly because I couldn't hold anything down - still can't, in fact - and felt like I'd be spending 24/7 vomiting or trying to hold back vomit.)  I didn't have to be helped to the bathroom but my dad had to be with me while I showered. And I was supposed to sit in the shower but lol, that wasn't happening.  	1
 An argument based on a fallacy should be thrown out. But a conclusion based on a fallacious argument isn't necessarily wrong.   You don't have to have any logical reasoning to be right, just to expect other people to agree.  I can argue the sun will rise in the East because I farted 12 times. The sun will still rise in the East.   This will affect all lawyers, not just PI lawyers. Those who lose business because of driverless cars will spread out to the other areas.   Well, after reading the comments, I'm scared shitless to watch the whole thing.  Can someone tell me what happens?   I agree but... she ran around topless and snatched a fake baby Jesus. Seems to be a bit of pearl clutching to me.  I think a better response by the Vatican would have been a bit of Christmas levity: fine her, let her go, and call it a day.   _The Metro Spirit_ used to be a great alternative paper. Now it's just a tabloid.   My ex-wife and I both have divorced parents, all four in the same town. Christmas was a gauntlet.   Gorgeous, darling. Gorgeous.   How many Mozarts are stuck at Walmart?   What sort of assumptions?   Hey I'm just trying to offer insight into something you asked about, and I have done nothing but discuss the issue with you in a respectful manner.  No need to be dismissive.   I _can_ distinguish between the two. But I also know that people with power tend to use that power. Keeping the two departments separate does not mean the owner's influence isn't felt: who is hired/fired, who is promoted, who gets invited to lunch, etc.  And then, yes, there are the people who cannot or do not distinguish the two. If you're worried about how the paper is perceived, it's not enough to say, "Well they shouldn't think that." They _do_, and that's the reality that must be dealt with.  _The Augusta Chronicle_ consistently wins awards and that speaks very well of the reporting side. But there's always that nagging thought that supporting the paper means you're supporting the editorial staff (because, well, you are to a degree - you're giving it a platform).  My main point is that the paper is perceived as a whole, facts be damned. This means that the hyper-fringe nature of the editorial staff causes people to shun the news content.   Well, I'm telling you that that's not the perception. Someone moving here from, say, Oregon, is going to read one editorial and immediately form a negative opinion about the paper.  Edit: And unless you're actually Billy Morris, I don't see how you can claim it isn't even _possible_. That's an extraordinary claim.   That's definitely a possibility, and maybe even likely. But when the editorial staff is so obviously *not* reasonable, readers are going to see that throughout the paper.  It's like trying to claim FOXNews isn't O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. Or MSNBC isn't Maddow, Sharpton, Matthews, etc. I understand the difference between news and opinion, but also know that it is impossible to keep them 100% separate in practice.   Can anyone in the industry comment on the issue without condescension?  No, Mr. Mortgage Guy, buying a home isn't a great investment like it used to be. Understanding that is the opposite of being ignorant about investing in home ownership.   It honestly colors every article I read. I don't doubt that the average employee has good intentions but Billy Morris has a Dr. Evil reputation (which is completely supported by the editorials - they're not just "Right", they're "off the radar Right").  It's not completely unreasonable to believe he uses his influence to push certain news stories and not others.  The editorial staff is hurting the overall paper.   Face for radio? Kidding... but it seems obvious that physical attractiveness is a key asset for anyone selling anything on TV.      What explains this?   Bullshit.   Haha, I am horrible at keeping track of redditors but thank you. I responded favorably to that thread. Hating Augusta is _tired_.   Wasn't Broad Street the widest street in the country at some point? Or is that a local legend?   I second the how so (except for the editorial board of the Augusta Chronicle). Our reporters and newspeople are great. I imagine it's a cutthroat business and there's a lot of shuffling as people move up to bigger markets.  And has anyone else noticed the TV reporters keep getting more and more attractive?   Welcome! It's a great little sub. Please post often - you'll find a receptive crowd.   How so? I find it to be quite active for Augusta's size.  Augusta redditors will get out of this sub what they put into it. I post content frequently and encourage others to do the same.  But if there's one thing Augusta has plenty of, it's negative attitudes. Post more if you think it should be more active.   Island Seafood has been selling raw oysters for 30+ years. Johnny's has been doing the same for about half as long.   I'm not sure there aren't exceptions (for preliminary steps that can be taken). Mayor Young seemed to think it was a possibility, and he would know more than just about anyone.   Rented it just to encourage this new distribution model and give a big ole fat finger to North Korea's Dear Leader.  Now to see if it's any good.   I'm not necessarily disagreeing (I was not impressed with the renovation) but I can speak from personal experience that Rhinehart's is not the only place that successfully sells oysters.  There is a large market for them actually (although perhaps not at a restaurant).   I think the line was that the tribe had an historic claim to the land. But, yes, it does appear it was horseshit (a prank on the former mayor).   It's not uncommon for one news outlet to get a scoop. But that is why I posted to see if anyone had heard anything. However, it looks like it was a prank on former Mayor Bob Young (who was filling in for Austin Rhodes).   Oh for Chri... I'm sleeping until the New Year.   Might just be a prank on Bob Young (former mayor subbing in for Austin Rhodes).   Greg Williams, the attorney for the Yakama tribe, just claimed on the Austin Rhodes Show that the tribe will be purchasing Regency Mall and turning it into a casino. It is scheduled to open by Masters 2016.  Mr. Williams further claimed that preliminary permits have been obtained and the city has signed off on it.  Does anyone know _anything_ about this?   Restrain/arrest her? Why should physically attacking her be the first option?   Your attitude is definitely part of the problem. De-escalation should be the goal, not escalation. Physically attacking someone simply because they yell at you is not rational behavior.    deserve a beat down  A beat down for screaming in someone's face? For fuck's sake...   Same for Georgia. I expected "man" to be an option before I opened the link.   Check out the border between [India and Bangladesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Bangladesh_enclaves). It contains the world's only third order enclave.   Easily divisible by multiples of 60 (minutes/hour). It would make estimating time to destination simple relative to other speeds.   I suspect there is upward pressure to 120 km/hr due to the easy math.   I love the suggestion that the boys sleep in your brother's room, and the girls sleep in your room. If your father is being genuine, this will alleviate the problem.  If your father refuses, then the rules are arbitrary and simply a power trip. That means he loses the high ground and it is completely reasonable for you to decline to visit.  Offer to respect him and his rules with a reasonable compromise. If he then chooses to disrespect your relationship and your boyfriend, he has no one else but himself to blame if you're not there.   It's the back right paw that kills me.   I usually try to set the end time for when I expect to leave. Its not perfect but would work well _enough_ for something like this.   The critical program I use at work does not run on Chrome.   Fuck at first I thought that was a wine glass and cringed at the possible outcome...   Right. The brutality and maliciousness of the concept is masked by using animals. If Yahweh demanded human sacrifice, the religion would never have made it.   1102 usually does a block party.  Edit: Oh, not that upscale. More of an early 20s bar crowd.   No it wouldn't. Dash cam, cell phone GPS from everyone in the car, plus their testimony.   It should have been very easy to prove the sign was not a stop sign. Assuming this story is true, of course.   The Senate is the festering sore.   And it's not new.   The best way I've heard it put is this: The job of a defense attorney is to make the prosecutor do his/her job. If you think the defendant is guilty, prove it.  Once you understand that, it's not controversial. The alternative is due process in name only, i.e., corruption.   I need to move.   Women had to give birth in hospitals or they would die.   Not voting is tacit endorsement of the outcome.   10      Perhaps. Perhaps not. What remains true is that it is incorrect to say that terrorists are controlling whether we can watch _Team America_.   Recognizing a difference between a full ban and a ban of one out of many mediums is not pedantic.   That wasn't the original comment. The original comment was that terrorists are controlling *if* we can watch _Team America_, not whether we can watch it one way and not another.  I agree that terrorists are controlling whether we can watch _Team America_ in theaters. But that is a separate issue.   Yes it is. This thread is about _Team America_ and a comment that hackers are controlling what we can watch.  It is undeniable that hackers are not preventing us from watching _Team America_.  While related, _The Interview_ is not the subject of this thread or subthread.   But not via any other medium. I can watch _Team America_ tonight if I want to.   /u/timacles specifically commented on _Team America_:  Theres are 10 other mediums in which you could watch 'Team America' right this moment.  In reply to this statement by /u/EmJay115:  A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see.  /u/SubHumanGarbage then asked if /u/timacles meant that the _The Interview_ was cancelled for "reasons OTHER than the terrorists hackers attacking [Sony]." That's a red herring and is not what /u/timacles stated. /u/timacles stated that the terrorists are not stopping you from watching _Team America_, and that is true.   No, /u/timacles is saying that this statement is false:  A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see.      Holy Hell I never thought I'd see this. Great decision.   The DA should be ashamed. Rule of law? Ha...   I'm only 32. When I was 16, we paid 60 cents per gallon.  Edit: The downvote confuses me. I remember being upset when I got less in "gallons" than I gave in "dollars".    Looks like they're trying to turn the mindless section of the right wing against net neutrality by tying it to government regulation.   If my local newspaper's comment section is any indication, it is working. They are rabid but up until a few weeks ago, had no comment on net neutrality (probably because they knew nothing about it).  Now, it's a "government takeover" and they are armed with talking points. It's fucking depressing.   Sure. But if the federal court system is well on it's way to being entirely paperless, I can't imagine there are many arguments that it can't be done elsewhere.  Originals do not have to be physical (they usually aren't in federal court - the entire official record is electrons).   K-Pax   The U.S. federal court system is overwhelmingly, if not entirely, electronic. You don't get much more "official" for a government document than a court order.  Documents can be e-signed and anything that must be notarized can be done with a stamp instead of a clamp, uploaded, and shredded (not 100% paperless but just about).   What the fuck.  He either cheated or he's a sociopath. Either way, I suggest you get out of that relationship ASAP.   Yep. The price would obviously be a huge factor, though.   "Checks and balances" generally refers to controls _between_ government institutions to prevent abuse _by_ government officials/employees.   It's simple: the police need to be afraid of something. Not in a physical way or anything, but in an accountability way.  Checks and balances still work.   Big Wallet user - got it!   $8 for early adopters. It's worth every cent.   Taylor Swift. She took all her songs off streaming apps but obviously YouTube is too important to NOT be on.  I can now listen to Shake It Off in repeat again.   First Lady?   Costco sells beer.   Can someone who supports what we did and also idolizes Reagan explain how both of those ideas can coexist given this information?   I'm 32... "real" life has apparently destroyed 10 year old me :(    StarTropics  How did I forget that this game existed?   [Dragon Warrior](http://imgur.com/w8fIA)   It's to some degree an Augusta thing. My mom makes pronouncing it that way an art form.  "Woortur." "Woortur."  "Who taught me English???"    wurter  Oh god. Mom...   I live in GA (not in Atlanta) and didn't realize I never pronounce the second "t" until that post.  No one does. Ever.   It's definitely an English word now. We steal words in the best way.    managed to hold out until 2004  I had a friend that felt the same way. Why did you consider this a badge of honor?    You will not be denied employment for holding it (so long as said opinion is not relevant to your job duties).  This is not true.   so brave  Again, grow up. I'm sure you don't think you are a racist. But you are. Thanks goodness humans as a whole are better than you.   The fact that you feel confident the attackers are black with no evidence simply demonstrates you are a racist. Nothing more.  Grow the hell up, man. Race is not a reason to hate someone.   "Conservative" can easily fit that description, though. If you favor "stability, familiarity, tradition", you clearly think that the way things are now is the right way. "Progressive" only means "the one that is right" if you agree that progress is a good thing (which we have defined "conservative" to disagree with).   Nope. You're just jumping to a racist conclusion. Nothing "earth shattering" about that.   Stormfront  Wish I'd never googled that one... those people are awful.   /r/michaelbaygifs/   How the hell does this assertive post based on nothing put speculation have any upvotes?   Source? The article has zero detail about the race of the attackers. Hell, it has zero detail period about the attackers.   CatoPapers  If you're going to astroturf, at least try and be a bit more subtle about it.   I saw someone make a great point about all this. If we're not going to prosecute anyone, then the President needs to pardon everyone who could have been prosecuted.  At least that way we acknowledge that it was a crime.    I've yet to meet someone in their 20s that claims to love it here.  That might be the issue. My peer group is 28-38 (approx.). And they overwhelmingly love it here.      Imagine what would happen if something truly irritated him...  Probably less. He's a bully and probably only picking on this restaurant because he know's they aren't financially equipped to push back.    The easiest way to conceptualize this is to mentally expand the turning section as if it is a cross street at an intersection. As a driver would never turn left into oncoming traffic, your rule should be crystal clear.   Check the user name. Clearly a fair-minded individual.   It's not you racist jackass.   Even with good business young professionals simply don't want to live here.  This is simply not true. I am a young professional and am very social with my colleagues. For the most part, the only young professionals I know that do not _love_ living in Augusta are those who were raised here.   But nearly everyone pays taxes (I can't think of a circumstance where someone lives in this country and wouldn't). Income taxes are not the only taxes people pay.   Looks to me like the top came and is now super sensitive, especially if his bottom clamps down as he's pulling out.   I hope the lack of teeth was a baby teeth thing and not a dental hygiene problem.  Poor child :-(   Legally, there is a concept called the Eggshell Rule which essentially means you take your victim as they are. If someone has brittle bones and you punch them causing them to break 10 bones, you are liable. If they have a heart condition and you scare them causing a heart attack, you are liable.  I'm not sure if NY has a version of this rule but it is common.   Yahoo Maps?   Based on federal law, there are limitations, e.g., sex, race, religion. I know this is a state law map but I bet a good many, if not most, of the states that do not protect LGBT employees do protect employees based on certain criteria.   austronauts  If and when Australia has a manned space program, they must use this term.   Dying city? The overwhelming evidence points to the contrary, with the Cyber Command being the largest piece.   Not paying interest in the context of a subsidized loan is equal to the government paying it. You have money you would not have had otherwise, thanks to the government.

 That's a smart ass-comment.   Det er ingenting du kan gjre.   I'm in Graham right now, but I go to school in Raleigh. All this talk of NC redditors makes me feel less alone.   Your doctor called.  Your medication is available and can be picked up at your earliest convenience.   I did.  However I had not factored in the author's previous note.  I now understand it, thanks to helpful people like Zombiesaurus and not thanks to impudent tards like Zackismet.   I actually don't really get this one.  What was Hanners asking?

If your wedding is half as awesome as your save the dates, I might just come crash it.      The 1990's called.  They just got a call from the 1980's who say they want their joke back.   Even better ideas... Spell out her name with crops in Farmville.  Send her a screenshot. Post videos on her wall of you singing romantic songs. Poke her.  On Facebook.

 Wow this is exactly what I needed! Thank you so much for the in depth advice, I'm going to employ it as best as I can. It reminds me of some bad advice a friend gave me...she got on me cause I said I would "try", and by doing that I am deliberately setting myself up for failure and giving myself after way out. as you said, I'd rather be prepared for the inevitable slip-up than promise to NEVER mess up again and hate myself when I do.  Thank you again. As soon as my situation allows I'll try to find someone in my area who can help!   Middle of South Louisiana? I do believe we may be in the same area! Go cajuns?   Damn I didn't know that! Thanks for the info!!   Thank you, I appreciate the advice! I'll definitely check out that sub and try to get some help.   Man people are fucking jerks. Ignore them, your dog is cute as hell.   This is really impressive but every time I see intricate work like this, I imagine getting really irritated at the Caff cause I just want my damn coffee but the barista had a vision and damn it they will see it through!   Wow humans are fucking gross   Damn I'm an meat eater all the way but this has some sarah mclachlan-level guilt tripping skills.   Best of luck with your recovery! Therapy isn't an option at the moment. I'm unemployed, don't have insurance, and my husband makes too much to get any kind of assistance. Thank you for the adcive, maybe soon I'll be able to use it :)   I'm with you 100%. Working out in the morning is absolutely not an option for me. I had to get into that auto pilot mindset. Don't think about doing it, just shut your brain down, drive to them gym, get changed and get started. After working out like 15 mins you just decided "I'm here and doing it, might as well get it done!". Do that enough and it will become habit, like when you have a day off but find yourself accidentally driving to work anyway? It's just like that. You can do this!! You know you can, you just have to get out of your own way.   (I don't even know if this is the right thread so sorry if it isnt.)  My husband has noticed this behavior, too. For example, today I finished up a Diet Bet and won, so my husband wanted to celebrate with eating ANYTHING I wanted for dinner. I opted for pizza. I got my own large stuffed crust pizza and after restricing ate the whole goddamn thing by myself. I felt so so shitty afterwards, and if I hadn't recently gotten my wisdom teeth pulled I fear would dislodge the blood clots, I would have purged. I've never done this before and couldn't cause vomiting would have caused the blood clots to dislodge.   Anyway I do shit like this sometimes. I don't want to claim I have a problem with a restriction and binging cycle, I don't want give myself excuses or be dramatic about overeating when other people have serious problems...I just can't tell and I don't have the funds to see a professional about this.  Anyone have any tips or resources they're willing to share so I can get my shit together? I'm going to start another diet bet tomorrow and I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I just keep self-sabotaging and getting in my own way.  EDIT: Was missing the majority of a clarifying sentence. Oops. Posting on mobile is hard.   I'm with you. Public shaming and bullying your kid is just going to fuck them up and probably turn them into a jerk and a bully, having learned it's an acceptable way to deal with people.   I box! It's excellent for getting out the aggression and bad feelings. Title Boxing is a great place to start if you're interested.    This is me 100% and the biggest thing that's helped me is DietBet. Bet $30 you can lose 4% of your body weight in a month, and you split the pot with everyone else who did the same. The bet I'm currently in has a pot of almost  $375,000. I just ask myself "do I want cookies or money? Do I want to watch Netflix instead of working out, or do I want the cash?" I heard a radio interview of some guy winning  $400 from a DietBet, and I just lost my job so it's a HUGE motivation for me. I plan just keep doing dietbets till the habit sticks without the money.    That's a good point, makes me think about the controversy when Brittney Spears released If U Seek Amy. A lot of people had a big problem with that.   Man that makes the band name so much better. A riot of kittens. Kitten Riot.   	16
 Peter McGraw, the director of the Humor Research Lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder, has a theory about what makes things funny.  People must be going wild over this field of study.      Submission Statement: Interesting take on the downward spiral of Hulk Hogan's career from All-American wrestling hero to dealing with his current troubles after an appeals court postponed his court battle with Gawker indefinitely.      *[Another meme platitude!]*         He's answering to a bunch of guys telling him his reporting is fake and shit. It's hilarious. I don't know what he expected. He's trying to be nice and they keep telling him to not refer to them as a shrill crowd...while they're being a shrill crowd.       Shameful display.  This article ignores key facts in order to push a preselected narrative.  1) Pao was not subjected to any particular vitriol on being declared interim CEO, nor until after she began implementing questionable and unpopular policies --- such as banning fat-shaming forums while leaving far more foul content entirely alone.  Even geek-famous fat people (Such as Boogie, a popular Youtube commentator) spoke up against this ham-handedness (and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone on the Internet nicer than Boogie).  2) Pao clearly did not care about the racist/sexist slander, and good on her for that.  No matter how justified one might think they were, that is not how mature and intelligent people handle outrage.  Then again, when tens of thousands gather to burn the President in effigy while screaming approval, mocking his intellect, gender and skin color, we call that a public protest and ask the Administration what they did wrong.  (Note: I'm referencing anti-war protests against Bush)  3) The petition is what gained traction in the press, and it is clearly what Pao is resigning over, BECAUSE it got traction in the press and brought attention to her actions.  Your article is smearing over that with faux outrage --- and I notice that your co-author on the piece also references two of his own previous NYT articles about Pao's legal issues as another way to deflect all of this criticism.  The NYT should not be soapboxing for corporate officers they happen to like.  It's as shameful as when one of your Pulitzer-winners recently tied "Bronies" to accused mass-murderer Dylann Roof merely on basis of a photoshopped t-shirt she had no time (or interest) in verifying before publishing reference to.  https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/csz9s6t      Look, I know exactly what you're doing.  You're trying to conclude that Pao was the victim of sexism because people used language like "cunt" or some other insult; your reasoning being that the slur has some reference to "gender" attached to it, therefore, she is being insulted based on her gender.  This doesn't follow nor does it examine the motivations for why someone would begin to insult her.  Do you really, really think people insulted Pao merely for being a woman?  Then you really do need to explain why people stuck up for Victoria.  Are you going to invent something about how people only defended Victoria to give themselves the appearance of caring about a woman?  That's about as uncharitable as you can be, but at this point, going through your history, I don't think you're here to engage with facts or truly analyze why people felt the way they do but to try to go quote farming for your next big "thinkpiece."  The reaction to Victoria being fired is direct contradiction to the story that redditors, etc, are just trying to drive women off the website, or wherever--and all you just did was handwave it away.  Doesn't fit the story?  Then don't include it.  Journalism at its finest.  Why not claim Victoria was let go out of some gender narrative?  It's just as baseless as the other shit you're trying to claim, but that won't stop you.  I'd suggest you don't understand the sarcastic, caustic, and sardonic nature of internet culture where people will say all sorts of offensive things (even racist or, yes, sexist) despite the motivation being different, but I honestly don't think you're that dim and you're doing this out of an ideological basis to give your personal pet issues more advertisement and try to claim they're really the issue you say they are, blah blah blah.  So let's take this about another character that was unpopular; nobody likes or liked George W. Bush, and everyone made comments about how he looked like a chimp; do you really think people bashed him solely because he looks like a chimp?  No, he was bashed because of his policies and other reasons.  People insulted Michael Moore's weight not because he was fat, but because they were motivated by contrary politics or perceptions of his honesty. This hive of bees doesn't care what gender is sticking its hand in the hive; it'll sting flesh regardless of who it's attached to.  You're going to write up a piece referencing sexism and racism on the internet, removed entirely from the context of the conversation, claim "Chairman Pao" references are motivated solely by racist intent and that her being called a "bitch" is because she's a woman above all else.  You're going to slant this, mislead, and then pat yourself on the back for this bit of "activism."  Nobody gives a flying fuck what Pao's gender is.  Are you this big of an idiot where you think there's some widepread male supremacy movement on the internet?  Go on, prove it, then.  And don't use your feelings or humanities crap, use actual social science.  People here are more concerned with reddit generally keeping a hands-off approach to its communities and not favoring any political perspective (even refusing to censor the most vile ones) than the personal identities and the lives of the admins.  So let's drop all the pretenses.  You know you're being dishonest and you're full of shit, trying to drum up attention to pet causes.  Obviously, we know it too.  So what is your goal here?  It's to try to influence the uninformed, propaganda style, to try to get support for your politics  And you're a piece of shit for trying to play that kind of game.  And I'm not going to be polite to you about this either.  Because this entire show of you being "polite" or professional while you farm for vitriol for your next write-up is just to give yourself an air of professionality and respectability you don't deserve, and to give the impression you're trying to give people a fair shake when your conclusions were predestined.  When you're surrounded by your colleagues, drunk late and night in a bar chatting about work, I'm sure the discussion is much, much different.  https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/cszbh31   i took a leak on a script. but it wasn't joe kelly's it was a toilet bowl.    that deadpool novelty account is getting a workout. le dank dankmen.   zow zow zam   ?If their marketing strategy is to have Deadpool "vandalize" actual posters for upcoming films (that they have rights to of course) with his name and likeness... that would be BRILLIANT.

While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.  It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.  The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example.      1 Hora est, for 16 voices   organ in G minor/A major  2 Te Deum for soloists, chorus   organ in A major (Morning Service)  3 Ave Maria, sacred piece for soloists, chorus   continuo in A major, Op. 23/2  - **Te Deum for soloists, double chorus   continuo in D major**  4 Te Deum laudamus  5 Te aeternum patrem  6 Tibi omnes angeli  7 Tibi cherubim  8 Te gloriosus  9 Patrem immensae  10 Tu rex gloriae  11 Te ergo quaesumus  12 Salvum fac populum  13 Per singulos  14 Dignare  15 Fiat misericordia  Of all the nearly forgotten music by Mendelssohn, the most nearly completely forgotten is his music for chorus. Only his songs come close to being as almost entirely ignored, but because a few of them have earned a place in the recital hall, even they have a more prominent place in the repertoire. This 10-disc Brilliant set of Mendelssohn's complete choral works featuring the Chamber Choir of Europe under Nicol Matt addresses this problem even though it may not solve it. The performances are uniformly excellent. The Choir has a smooth tone and superb diction and Matt elicits from them polished balanced and ardent interpretations. Despite the dearth of comparisons, these performances with their clean textures, light tempos, and devout tone are surely as close to definitive as is possible to imagine. For some listeners, of course, this may not be enough to redeem Mendelssohn's heartfelt yet stolid music from obscurity. For others with more open minds, however, this set may serve to introduce a body of sacred works that certainly exceeds any other similar body of works from the same period in terms of skill and sincerity. Though a bit recessed, Brilliant's digital sound is cool and clear.

Now, it's been quite some time since I've last scene the original Kevin Bacon movie about a guy who fights a town with roundhouse dance movies, but watching the remake I noticed something suspicious. Mainly the central romance between Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough is less authentic than the real one between Miles Teller and Kenny Wormald.  If you're not familiar with the remake of Footloose it came out to the acclaim of no one and was promptly forgotten amongst the shit heap shores of remake island with Total Recall and Straw Dogs. It's the same story except Craig Brewer, the director of Black Snake Moan and that shit where Terrence Howard pretends to play a big boy not on the verge of tears and raps and shit, does something I really don't remember in the original film.  I started getting my suspicions when the introductory scenes between Ren Mackormick (Wormald) and Willard Hewitt (Miles Teller) had this strange air of sexual tension. For instance, Willard and Ren sit down for school lunch and Ren begins to tell Willard of his worldly travels. It's here where all my experience reading erotic novels from Anne Rice and Henry Miller have paid off because Willard starts asking Ren to finish the story of the night Ren went out with two Russian women and had them as his sexual conquests.  Why does Willard want to know this? Especially after they just met. When Willard finds out Ren's story is false he's disappointed like he had a bunch of armed thugs rob his spank bank of Ren Mackormick related erotic fantasies.   It only gets weirder from here because every interaction with Julianne Hough is dry and unromantic. He's basically trying to save this psycho girl from trying to kill herself, she attempts to play chicken with a train (like she was gonna win...sorry you don't have roundhouse kicks, Hough) and she's under the impression this means Ren loves her when Ren's true love really lies with Willard.   As the movie goes on Ren learns that Willard can't dance and that in order to challenge the city counsel on the ordinance to make dancing illegal they must have a tete a tete at a car wash where Willard and Ren talk about wet t-shirt contests. But then promptly Ren douses Willard with the car wash hose. When this happens Willard runs around to Ren and they begin wrestling. Perhaps if Craig Brewer had trained his camera a little longer on this scene Ren would have tripped on the water line and Willard would have fallen on top of him. They would have realized that they are in love and embrace each other in chaste french kisses as the music swells and they go off to city to live a bohemian life style. Ren would become a steel worker and Willard a starving artist painting nudes of Zebras and rats with large phallus's on their heads.    But no. Brewer denies us this possibility for more cock teasing and more audience approved heterosexual mating with Julianne Hough, Now a note on Julianne Hough. Hough is amazing looking.  She really nails the part of playing a down home southern preachers daughter rebelling against her father but she also wears small shorts and this is distracting because it's like on some level Brewer knows he accidentally directed Brokeback Footloose, but ended up having to save face by adding this eye candy.   Either way, we then have to sit through tedious montages of Willard learning to dance, and it's in the key scene where Willard dances with Ren's nieces in a line dance rendition of "Let's Hear it for the Boys" that really seals the deal because in between the already extremely homosexual undertones of that scene, Brewer adds inserts of Willard and Ren learning to dance in Ren's garage just as the sun falls down. Ren is teaching Willard to "fist-pump" and it looks as if they are holding each other in a masculine version of a ballroom waltz. But this repeats the formula of the car wash scene in which Brewer has the realization that he made Priscilla, Queen of the Footloose Dancefloor and cuts too soon out of shame.   The movie marches onto the finish, shit resolves and that's how I learned the remake of Footloose is a great movie about two high school boys testing the limits of their sexuality. And if that didn't convince you, the bearback bang bros bus driving scene will.                   I experienced something very similar to this, but probably worse in my opinion - not even a week ago.  On July 1st, I got off work and was doing some late night grocery shopping - not even that late, it was about 10:30pm - at the Kroger near my house, who also supply several of these handicap grocery carts for disabled customers which are usually located in the front of the store. I had noticed that this evening, there was none available, because a disabled woman was walking around on a cane asking for one.   I thought it was strange and was like oh well, must be busy - it is the first of the month. Not very many cars in the parking lot, but I guess people are bulking up for the holiday. So I go on shopping.  Inside the store doing my thing, right off the bat I see 3 people on carts who were clearly not disabled. Of which, one guy was letting his kid, a 7 year old - drive it around, while he walked along side. And this was right in front of the store, in ear-shot of that lady who actually needed a one. They could hear her asking for it, still did nothing - kept on going.  It really pissed me off, but I thought well, maybe they're disabled and it's just not evident. I'll hold my tongue, just do my shopping - get out of here.  So I keep on going, I see a 4th cart - same thing. This time 2 young women, which got my attention when one got up and let the other sit/drive the cart. I just stopped and stared at them like... for real? You know there's a lady up front right now who actually needs one of these and you guys are just riding around on it for fun??? And they went off on me, same way this guy did - "YOU CANT TELL US WHAT TO DO" - I just threw my hands up, kept on walking.  I get to the checkout lane, waiting in the only line they have open - when sure enough that kid that was driving one - crashed into a display right next to me, knocking over a fuck-ton of shit. The parents response? Not no, "I'm sorry" or "oops" or anything even remotely fucking human - they just walked away. WALKED AWAY - cart and all. Leaving all that shit.  My Kroger also has a self-checkout lane, but because I had so much stuff I decided to wait in line. So during my long wait, those 2 women who screamed at me for telling them what to do - they checked out right as I was finishing bagging my groceries. I walk outside and they are plugging it in, one talking to the other about how they better hurry - they're going to miss their bus.  Seriously, that was the most frustrating grocery trip I've ever had. I've never felt like a racist before until that moment - because it dawned on me. Out of the 5+ offenders, they were all black. Loud, and ignorant, and black. And the lady who didn't have a cart who actually needed one? White. I seriously wanted to punch those people, especially the cunt black family that crashed the cart into a display, and the poor white Kroger employee just walked over and started picking it up - like it happens all the time.   I'm never shopping again on the 1st of the month - seriously. It made my blood boil, the whole thing.   https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuoqq7   I can't wait for the day when things stop being about black white and yellow and brown and all that stuff and we can just call assholes, assholes. This black guy pisses me off. I'm a black guy and if I call this idiot out, I'm considered someone that's sucking up to white people, by other white people here on reddit. It's already happened multiple times. When you're a black guy and you call out the retarded behavior of other black people instead of prtending it's reasonable behavior, you're called a coon and a sellout by the same black people do this stupid shit.  And all you white middle class liberals need to snap out of this delusion that it's only a hand full of black people like this guy in this video. Take it from someone who knows. a huge percentage of black people have this guy's fucked up mentality. 75% of black mothers are single (the reason why would make this post even longer) and these guys (including myself) are raised by these women alone so they have to over compensate by acting more aggressive and masculine.I got lucky because my family comes from the country and not the inner city. My mother got her masters degree and became a college professor. I went to private school for the first few years of my life and then got an almost culture shock when I went to public school in the 2nd grade (we were never rich or even middle class, but lower middle class. my mom had to retire early after getting really sick, though she's doing well now). Kids in private school were mostly polite. The "bad kids" were just class clowns at worst. But then in private school, all the kids were cursing and using the N-word left and right. There were fights every other day, and I'm pretty sure in like 3 or 4 instances from 2nd to 5th grade there was always that one student who had to sit by himself near the teacher's desk and he clearly needed to be in a special needs class.  My point is that there are a ton of shitty black people out there and there are a good bit of great black people. The same goes with asian, white, latino, etc etc. When a black asshole is being an asshole, everyone should be able to call him or her out on it without being a white racist or a black sellout. Yes, racism exists, but if we're going to move forward we need equality on all fronts. I actually like it if a white person can disagree with me and argue about something and call me out on something if I'm doing something stupid in person, because they're speaking to me in the same way they'd speak to a white person that did the same thing. But when they decide to talk down to me like I didn't know any better because I'm "just a dumb child like black person" and just pretend like I've done something valuable it's irritating. We'd should not be treated like retarded children who don't know any better. That's not going to fix "racism"  https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuujrx                              Perhaps more than any other filmmaker in recent years, Christopher Nolan has a following. These so called "Nolanites" love to tout the brilliance of his films, and one of the most popular statements has been to call Nolan a modern Kubrick. Despite being a big fan of Nolan i've never quite understood this statement, especially considering Nolan's visual style does not have much in common with Kubrick's. But I think it goes beyond that, and after seeing Interstellar it finally clicked for me what the biggest difference is: Nolan's films lack subtext. It really is that simple. For whatever reason, Nolan wants his characters to say exactly what they are thinking at any given time. If a character is mad at another character, they will state it plainly. The same goes for every single emotion. There is no misdirection, lying, innuendo, or nuance. It's as if Nolan wants to make sure we understand what the character is feeling and doesn't trust us to infer it by context. This doesn't just relate to character feelings, but also to plot and theme. Look at the ending of Interstellar. When he gets to the weird Library near the end, we get it. We're literally seeing it happen. We don't necessarily understand how it's happening, but we do understand what is happening. Despite this, Nolan decided to have McConaughey and Chastain both state out loud to themselves what is going on, multiple times. Why? We already see what's happening, why exactly do we need the characters to awkwardly reinforce it by talking to themselves? This is especially interesting when you compare this scene to the ending of 2001, a film that Nolanites have been trying to compare to Interstellar since the film was first announced. In that famous ending to 2001, Kubrick doesn't explain anything. He just presents it, and leaves the meaning up to your own interpretation. This forces you to think about the film and what was happening, and is key to why the film is so iconic all these years later. This is night and day different from Nolan's approach to a similarly bizarre event. Nolan chooses to explain it numerous times, just incase we were sleeping I guess, and the ultimate result of this is that we get it. There's nothing to solve, and we leave the theater not questioning "oh what did that mean?" but instead saying "huh, that was interesting" and then proceeding to realize all the plot holes in the film. I admit I was in the crowd of people that was really hoping Nolan would finally "grow up" and make a picture that treats the audience with respect, but after seeing Interstellar i've realized he's just not that kind of filmmaker. Which leads to me the "why that's ok" part. You know what? I really enjoyed Interstellar. It was a blast and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences i've had this year. Despite being 2h49m, which is actually longer than 2001, I never felt bored for a single moment. This is the great skill of Nolan...he makes the most enjoyable blockbusters out there. And I accept that. I no longer wish for him to "grow up", because I actually really enjoy seeing his films. Sure, I don't think about them much afterwards and I will never put them on the same level of the great filmmakers, but for pure entertainment nobody does it better right now than Christopher Nolan, and for that I will always be a fan.                                                                                          Bravo Carrey! Brillent. Rely brillent.                                                                              Spoilers obviously, but the shot where Nolan ends his film with the platform rising up with Robin inheriting Batman's lair is exactly the same as Mad Max: Fury Road's ending where Furiosa is raised on hte platform to inherit Imortan Joe's lair.   Bravo Nolan. Bravo Miller.    Agree or disagree idc.  He'd be creepy and dark as fuck....  Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy, but no black people. I mean make it Hor ror.              	197
 My brother is from Sweden. Some places are really pretty! I highly recommend going, if you ever get he chance.   Well that's good.   Where are you?   Cancun is amazing. Make sure to go parasailing!    At least you're creative!   Aw why not?   Any place you have ever wanted to visit or see in person?   Have you checked the game settings? Maybe you accidently turned them down? Stupid question, but it's possible.   Mine is all old and wrinkly even though I tried making the parents and grandparents young. :/   Alright I might be on later today.   No, he does not.   Middle school! I played that in 5th grade but it stopped really quick when none of us got in trouble.   I remember a few months ago when I started playing the game again. I felt so amazing I never wanted to stop playing.   Oops,look what I commented below! Sorry I'm just getting used to this mobile app.   Aww I just got off but I might be on tomorrow if I finish my homework. My gamer tag is Jade Sueta. Just add me and when I get to it I'll accept. See you soon :)   I'm a noob that wants money so if anyone wants to do some missions with me to help me rank up that would be awesome! Leave your gamertag below I will add you in a few minutes. I'm on xbox btw   Yeah especially when they are a low rank or don't have any good guns :/   If everyone's blip is red then that means they have been bad.   What is your favorite color?   If you want to play add me at Jade Sueta. I will be playing on Normal. Mic preffered.    My xbox fell and my GTA got totally scratched but I'll try to buy a new one later today :)   Wow I never realized that I have already completed half of school(not including college, of course). And of course I'm proud of my "manly music". Thanks for asking a question. Have an internet point.   Yes. They are amazing. I'm a girl, but I grew up sort of a tomboy. When I turned 11 I think, I started changing and liking some girly things. But you can never make me not like the Weeknd.   Either P!nk, Ed Sheeran, or The Weeknd.   About 6 months ago.   Oops! Well it's good she is doing better, anyway :)   Aww well I hope she gets better, if there is any way too. It's nice she has such a great son to take care of her:)   Where where you vacationing at? I'm definitely afraid of spiders. All spiders. All sizes. No no no.   How are you doing right now?   Is she doing okay right now? When was her last seizure? How bad is her memory loss?   7th grade. We got our schedule and walked around campus. Super boring.   I got it back. Thanks!   Oh I knew I would have to call someone but Mor's only got added to my phone after I joined 3 different lobbies. Thanks!   The movie changed a lot of things. If it wasn't a book, it would have been a fair movie though.   I made the mistake of wearing pants and I felt like death. AMA   Try bag balm. It really helps.   You can me if you want too. GT: jade Sueta   If you are on xbox add Jade Sueta. I'll be on in a while.   No it's not. First people spawned ufo's but now the hackers like to spawn rocks. Nothing specialz   I have insurance on my car but how do I get it back? I thought if I had insurance on it I could never lose it......   Yeah but with how much people drive around it would get annoying as hell after a few hours.   Woops.   I'm online right now. Add me at Jade Sueta.   Pot shot is really good it gives you 10,000 dollars and it's not that hard. That and definitely rooftop rumble.   This is in easy mode right?   Ha. I love seeing posts from so long ago.   That's great. Naturevideo games. Get out and explore.   It seems like everyone I meet that has a mic just wants to point a gun at my head and make me join the crew. I would rather get shot a million times than join a crew with those douches. But I'm sure sometime I'll find a good crew and some friends. Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I hope you don't get eaten by a bear, and I'm on mobile so sorry if I made a bunch of spelling errors. Farewell, pleasant internet friend.   Cool. If there's ever an opportunity to have more fun, I will always take it. Thanks, I was gonna see if any of my friends had gta5, and now I can't wait to get back to my xbox and level up some more :D. Do you have xbox by any chance?    What exactly will I do with friends? What can I do with them that I can't in solo?   I'm a level 8 and trying to answer this question as well. But if you get one person into a mission lobby with you and keep doing races with one person you can rank up really fast. If you are on xbox I would love to add you and go on some missions together.   So don't be a douche. Got it.    Yeah I have a mic. Alright, see you then.:)   99.9% of people just rubbed their eyes to see if it still works.   West coast. Yeah I'm still on. GT Jade Sueta if you wanna add me I guess.   Xbox sorry I forgot to put that.   Any good ways to earn some money other that glitches?   I noticed this too and thought it was quite funny.   I hear that the higher ranks are going to demolish me. Any tips for a newbie?   Really.   I think I have this. I always seem to want to pull out my eyebrows and eyelashes. I never knew it was a mental disorder.   I have not built any parks but I would love to just free skate on hardcore with someone. I'll be on in a few days to add you.    Bath or shower?   Then go to coolmath4kids. They have plenty of fractions.   But the spiders wanted revenge..   I added you.  :D   I'm twelve and I strongly disagree with that. I wish I got to choose, but I didn't, because people like you think I'm "just a kid" and I don't know anything.   Are you online? We could play?   OMG I'm a girl :O lol  	68

 Congrats on the upcoming nuptials. My husband and I went to Disney for our honeymoon in 2013. It was a great experience. I'm not a Disney expert like a lot of people here, but I'll put forth what I know from both my honeymoon and my research for our upcoming trip.   We also decided to move to a Universal Hotel. We ended up just getting a cab, and I think it cost us $40 to get from Port Orleans to the Crowne Plaza on Universal Blvd. It cost the same amount to get to the airport from the Crowne Plaza. Not trying to keep you from switching hotels, but I'd like to mention that I was severely disappointed we didn't stay at the Disney hotel the entire time. I hated having to repack and move all of our stuff halfway through the honeymoon. Also, I really hated dealing with transportation to the airport when we could've just taken the Magical Express to the airport for free if we had just stayed at Disney. But that's just me; I'm sure others don't mind switching hotels, and I'm sure there are better deals for cabs than what we got.   We went to DisneyQuest about two hours before it closed, when tickets were half price. Even then it was not worth it. Most of the games were broken. The Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster is awesome, but we waited in line for a half hour...then it broke down. The roller coaster simulator is amazing, but I think - and correct me if I'm wrong - they have something similar at Epcot. So, overall, I would urge you to stay away from DQ and spend your money elsewhere.   I would also suggest reconsidering Planet Hollywood. The food really isn't that great.   Downtown Disney is a hit or miss for people. It's a lot of shops and restaurants mainly. They also have Cirque du Soleil, a movie theater, and a bowling alley. I love going there, but for me it's not somewhere I spend my entire day - just the evening for dinner and light shopping. The Lego Store is awesome for bringing out the kid in your. Check out the House of Blues if you're into music. And if you're chocolate and/or dessert lovers, try Ghirardelli. Two words: free samples. I have read DD can be nightmarish with the current construction but I don't know much about that - perhaps people who've been recently can comment on that.   Have you looked into the Boardwalk? I've never been but I'm hoping to check it out when I go in May. It's similar to DD, but I have heard its quieter. It has Jellyrolls - a dueling piano bar - and Atlantic Dance Hall, both of which is 21+ and open until about 2am.   Be prepared for a lot of attention! People saw our buttons and congratulated us. The driver on the Magical Express announced our marriage. When we met characters, the handlers made a big deal out of the fact we were newlyweds. I know some restaurants will do something special if they know it's your honeymoon. They made our table a little more romantic at Tony's - it was sweet. My husband and I got super super super cheesy and we got a pick of us eating the same strand of spaghetti like they do in Lady and the Tramp.   Have you looked into the horse drawn carriage rides? I believe both Port Orleans and Fort Wilderness offer them. They're romantic and relaxing. If you end up going to Downtown Disney, you could take the boat to Port Orleans and do the carriage ride there.   Look at websites with crowd calendars. I'm not certain which site is the best, maybe someone can suggest one, but I think easywdw.com is good. Crowd calendars break down which parks will be most or least crowded east day and basically suggests which day to go to each park. In general, steer clear of MK on Mondays (though I'm a hypocrite for saying that, I'm heading to MK on a Monday because my birthday is on Monday and I'll be dammed if I let a Monday stop me from visiting the park on my birthday!)   My husband and I will be at Pop Century at the same time! This will be our second trip together. I hope your first trip is magical!   I didn't even think about that... God damn you, Kev!!!   It's first grade!   We have way too much time on our hands when the show isn't on. Is it April yet?   He looks awful with blonde hair and absolutely sexy with dark hair. But he naturally has red hair! Crazy.    Yep, midnight EST   I love you!   Well then, thank you for helping my parents keep their jobs (both work for the post office) :)   I just booked Be Our Guest for my birthday lunch in May. I'm really, really, really, really hoping I can get in for dinner instead though!   Stay, with Ewan McGregor and Ryan Gosling.    A few days ago, a house exploded due to a gas leak near where I live. The house was blown to pieces, shockwaves felt for miles. Two people were inside, both lived without major injuries. After seeing this, I have no idea how they lived let alone walked away practically unscathed.   I can stand to watch almost anything. But the hair trap scene in Saw IV? Nope.    I thought I was the only one who does this. I started doing this hard blinking voluntary twitch thing a few years ago. I thought maybe it was a side effect of a medicine I was one - it seemed to start about the same time I started new meds - but after stopping the meds the hard blinks never went away. I also have bad anxiety so I've also thought it could be a coping mechanism for that too. I feel tension around my eyes and it only goes away when I hard blink. I've mentioned the twitch to doctors and they've never heard of anyone else doing this, so I quit bringing it up during appointments. Even though it is partly voluntary I can't seem to stop doing it.    The actors definitely were much too old, but it's never been a huge deal for me. I've been a fan for about 13 years and I only just realized that Snape, Remus, Peter and Sirius were only in the 30s. How it took me so long to realize that is beyond me; I guess the movies just made me "see" the characters as older while reading the books.

God damn you, seventh grade English.    One thing that struck me as odd is that you list your GPA as a 3.90 but you graduated cum laude... If you graduated with a 3.90 shouldn't that mean you would have graduated summa cum laude, not cum laude? Sorry if I'm incorrect.   The commercials are giving me too many feels. I didn't want to go on a feel trip today.   	18

 ..how did Dobby produce a hover charm for Harry to take the blame for?   Harry still got a warning when Dobby used the hovering charm in CoS.      I agree that it got worse with each revision.       There were no wiz or witchards in Little Whinging and they had to use  means of transport that were untraceable. It still makes Nymphadora's packing spell a bit questionable.  The ministry was against Harry after the tri-wizard tourney (esp. Umbridge) so why wasn't a packing charm noted, when a hovering charm was?   Perhaps Albus let the ministry know what was going on.    HA! Interesting. The bible is the best work of fiction.   Yes.    It wasn't all of PJ, but I would love to revisit the Tibetan Freedom show in 97. I even met Ed.   Wiki says that Fluffy, while in the forest for a bit, was sent back to Greece by Dumbledore.   I was in second grade, 1983, and we were lining up to wash our hands before lunch which was back by the place we hung our coats and bags. This girl who was not there that day had left her umbrella there the day before.   Long story short, I picked it up, opened it in the queue, as a result I got two firm swats by the blackboard in front of the class.  The kicker was, the teacher's name was Mrs. Slaughter.      I would assume over time the magic would wear off in both instances.   A: Comet   Paddy and Mick were walking along a street in London. Paddy looked in one of the shop windows and saw a sign that caught his eye. The sign read: "Suits 5.00 each, Shirts 3.00 each, Trousers 4.50 per pair". Paddy said to his pal "Mick look at these prices! We should buy a whole lot of those and when we get back to Ireland we could make a fortune. Now when we go in you stay quiet, okay? Let me do all da talking 'cause if they hear our accents, they might think we're thickos from Ireland and try to screw us. I'll put on me best English accent. "Roight ye are Paddy, I'll keep me mouth shut, so I will. You do all da business" said Mick. They go in and Paddy said in a posh voice "Hello my good man. I'll take 50 suits at 5.00 each, 100 shirts at 3.00 each, and 50 pairs of trousers at 4.50 each. And oyll back up me truck ready to load 'em on, so I will." The owner of the shop said quietly "You're from Ireland, aren't you?" "Well....... yes" said a surprised Paddy. "How did you know?" The owner replied, This is a dry-cleaners."   Well, he was talking about their duel, so it would have been when Grindlewald had the wand of destiny.   Search it on youtube.   I would give it an A-   Damn WB.    Oh noes.    I don't know. All I know is when you watch *The Greater Good* there is a link to help with the kickstarter.   This is exciting! I tear up at the end of *The Greater Good* every. single. time.   I wonder what they could do with the Snape story arc?   Now I'm on youtube searching for *The Greater Good* again...   You're correct. Dropped them off at the front gates, and everyone was staring.    Dumbledore says that he was "a shade more skillful" and that Gellert pretty much gave up at the end.  *Kings Cross* chapter of DH.      That was just a one off due to Sirius being on the loose.  ..and a bit of a hurry-up.   It does take about ten hours.    I agree that it was first Lucius, then Severus. After Lucy fucked up in the DoM though, Riddle had very little love for his general.   I read somewhere that it all boils down to tradition. I've asked this question before, and that was pretty much the consensus.   YES! Or when they tell the cops they are Trevor Lahey or Corey Trevor. HA!  [8.5]  No shit, my FB tag is TrevorLahey   Beg your pardon, but I thought I was allowed to post what was factual.  There is a one hour difference between the two posts, the second is just more in depth.  I'm really not trying to start a row here, just misunderstanding perhaps.    Does that stuff work?   Beg your pardon Miss head, but how is speaking the truth rude?      /u/Obversa is sore because I called her out.      Cheers!   That's it.   Pick your favorite [chapter art](http://i.imgur.com/IJQ13E5.jpg)   All you did was elaborate on what /u/hntjw said an hour before you.   Someone once posted a theory that it involved semen on or near the dead body. That was kinda twisted.   She admitted in an interview that he retrieved it and kept it. "Strong feat for a rat, I know."   Sorry I have no source, but it's fact.   Yes.   ..made me sad.      How will Ricky rickyism his name? Or Bubs even?   I think in the later seasons, they had one of those empty prop glasses that look like they're full, and edited in the ice clinking noise.    Yes, it's confirmed.   [Here](https://www.facebook.com/trailerparkboys/photos/a.232908660130030.59359.183304218423808/836403623113861/?type=1 pnref=story)   I was stoned, just coming off a three hour binge, and I was trying to talk like Ricky. insinuating=inseminating   "You don't have to come at me with a fucking leaf comb!"   He did! I forgot about that. I love Ricky when he finds out who got Trinity pregnant.   Nobody is fucking saying anything about them going to jail at the end of every season?      *cough* Yea maaan..   Ricky takes an eight to ten year old Trinity into the gas and go again, and Jacob is there. Ricky lays his gun on the counter, Jacob thinks he's robbing the joint. Then Trin grabs the gun and shoots it.  My pointer is, he ends up insinuating Trinity so they could make a baby when he is at least eight years older, and he watched her growed up. To me, that is really creepy.   I love the bottle kids!    Here's a few hash coins.   That's good.   No. Albus removed it from Hogwarts. Hermyown stole it from his study after he died.  I doubt she would put it back.   Mine is the clearing stick. Bring that back because it's fucking funny every single time.   It sure is, except the third.   Time turners are not as great a machina as you think they are. She said that after PoA was released, She instantly regretted writing them. I think they're a bit of a bullshit scapegoat if you ask me.   Back to the Future? That franchise was great and all for the 80s, but no. They did not handle time travel very well.    harry does not think to save Sirius a secound time in the Ministary by running to the room of the time turners to set the time back ten minutes to kill Bellatrix  He couldn't have anyway. He couldn't even *crucio* Bella.   I don't have the interview at hand, but She says about five hours, or you are Siriusly messing with human nature.   STAHP IT RON, STAAAHP!   I agree. How long was Fox the Gordon Ramsay network FFS? Everything from the early oughts is now fading into obscurity due to Netflix, HBO, and other cable networks.   I am a Scooby-Doo fan, and that animated show has been hashed and re-hashed into many different series. There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a "jumping the shark" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.  Addendum, I love the Firefly reference. I have not seen one episode of that show, and just recently realized it was a thing.   I live in a fairly rural area of Ohio, and people pronounce the days with -DEE on the end instead of -DAY.   That is exactly who I thought would be charged with the task.   I would assume his body was cremated unceremoniously.         You must iron you hands or slam your ears in the oven, carry on.    Frank and Alice were tortured beyond belief, but refused to (I'm assuming here) to give Voldemort any information.   Uh-uh. Voldemort had vanished October 31, 1981, and Bella, Rodolphus, and Rabastan with the possible aid from Barty Jr tortured Neville's parents. They were looking for information as to where Riddle could be.   What the fuck does that even mean? Two smokes, let's go for being so stupid.   Absolutely, it goes on over the damn hills.   Reason #394 that GoF is the worst movie.   Totally on my dime.   You're right, they do. =o/  Even Mundungus, the filthy git.   Yea, I bet Radcliffe had to do a shit ton of voiceovers for that flick.    Yea, it is supposed to be just the quidditch pitch. 200 meters by 60 meters at best.   This question  is in the common questions on the sidebar in the great hall, you may find what you are looking for there.   I reckon it's because of different directors.   How do you dust it all?    RIP Phil.   This is a troll account. First day.   Is this bullshit? Because I don't really want to do that much work if it's bullshit.   Got your back on that downvote, and I whole heartedly agree.   Classic Worf.   PEANUT BUTTER AND JAAAAAAAAM!   I'm not sure if we ever learned his house, but I would assume he was a Gryff.   Nice.   What did Slughorn ever do that was evil? He fought at the BoH. In case you hadn't noticed Snape was working against Voldemort for over 16 years of his life. Sure Draco was a prat, but he came around in the end.   Not all snakes are evil. Draco, Slughorn, Snape. I'm sure their are others I'm forgetting, but they aren't all evil.   I like that one..   Nothing specific.  I'm Thornquill.   Yup, I just finished that episode, it was written on the back of his neck.   That's it!   Jacob was in season 1, episode 1. He was working the counter when  Ricky told him ti give him two packs of smokes at that convenient store.   Better a rat at the Burrow than a rat in Azkaban.   Man, I was a bit of a bully myself in high school. There were only certain cliques everyone could fit into, and people did what their friends did.  But the fact is, by the time I was 18, I grew out of that bullspit and realized what life is about. I have three daughters, and the three of them are happy and they have gotten nothing but As on their report cards for two years running. (that's top marks for you Brits)  I respect James, because I see a bit of myself in him and Sirius. Someone who learned how to live properly after making a few mistakes.   "It was love, Harry.. it was love."   Year of Darkness.  It's Neville, Luna, Ginny and them while the trio are hunting horcruxes.    Fitting flair.   This is why I drink.    Q was feeding Jean-Luc a line about how he lost his powers, and Picard didn't believe him.   ACME already invented the bat-man wings/costume.   My bad.   That's where I get my rocket powered roller skates.   Isn't the Riddle house in Great Hangleton?   Sure it wasn't ACME?   Hidden camera porn because I like to watch.   Not if you're tethered to a tree.   A: Because he's married.   I figured out which episode it came from. I can't remember the name, but it's the one where Q was stripped of his powers.   I don't see it as much as splitting one's soul but rather shattering it. Each horcrux is a container that holds a piece of a soul, and not directly half of what was left each time.  Otherwise, why would his appearance change.    since Voldemort felt it when a horcrux was destroyed  Only in the film. In the book, Dumbledore says that he isn't human enough to know.   The bar.  	118
 Us too.  Feel ya, bro.   Nope.   Yeah, completely blown.   Forward progress whistles are the biggest hole in the rules right now. Every other week that shit happens and it is usually egregious.   Back shoulder yo dick.   Eli Manning, the scuttling crab.   Just watch out for Ferg Brain.   Everybody loves Cox.   Groovy, man.  Thanks.    Classic That Guy.   You got a source on that?  I tried to read the official rules and never saw it discuss a second returner.   Say something about the Chargers! !!   Yeah, you might be able to lay down across the seats, even (if the arm rests pull up).   Too soon on Vikes.   Cowboys.    Like *Panic Room*?   Was a fumble.   In the scrum they found a Ram had the ball.  Because it was under 2 mins, only the fumbling player can recover the ball and advance it, so they marches it back to the spot of the fumble.  No replay from upstairs.  There should have been? But I don't think there was any clear recovery on camera, so reversal would have been tough.   This game was absurd.    Ha.  Should a gone down.   Idiot announcer.  Time Out means nothing when you run the play clock to 1!   Two knees means Seattle fields a punt with 35 seconds.  Looking grim, but crazier things.   No kidding.   2% better.  Not "much", but I appreciate your point.   Actually just checked. It is at 12%   Obviously.  That is why I asked A question with a strict mathematical value attached.   Ungulates Unite!   TD here makes it rough for Seattle.  Win probably % probably drops under 10% , right?   Fought a ref.    Anyone got the pulse on this John Wick flick?  Garbage fire or reasonable action movie?   What has it gots in its nasty little pocketses?  A delay of game penalty?      Up vote for cryptic Star Wars reference.   That happened to Brandon Stokely once. Bummer.   Yeah, Shingles is awful.  Get your shingles vaccination once you get older people!  Source:  am herpes virologist.   You speak the truth.  Down votes are not warranted.  I hope your team loses, though.   /r/theydidthemath   I actually make it like any sour:  4:2:1. Gin:OJ:Simple Syrup.  Very nice.   Question:  do you like the lighter blue and the silver. Or this royal blue?   That is just because he is not a human.  He is from a race of super beings who excel at defense like it is second nature, and he has not learned the ways of our people.  Yet.   I make mimosas but use gin instead of champagne.  Faster and still great.   Also it appears that the Seahawks are better at home.  You know,  like almost every team.   You had to imagine that the media would slobber over the Seahawks for making the "tough decision" - and then weave that in to any narrative they could.  It's all b.s.  Seahawks made a mistake and did their best to minimize it.  Now they are under performing and the Rams are playing well.   Rams dominating the LOS, plus have quadrupled their sack total for the year.   Also, one sick special teams play.   The bears did this once with Devin Hester (because obv he is returning it!).  But, it got called back for a holding.   This game is for me.  My second favorite play in the world is the fake direction punt return.  My first is the Utah Pass.  Go Rams, Go!   Virologist here, and I just heard a presentation by a gentleman working on Chikungunya (which was great).  I knew the basics before the talk, but was really taken by:  1)  How debilitating the disease can be, 2)  How long symptoms can persist, and 3)  How little we know about it / few treatments we have.  It seems that this most recent outbreak has really swept through the Caribbean, even including Florida. I think it is almost assured to make it to Mexico.  Viruses in the news all the time now . . .   Google, "Jameis Winston sexual assault".  There have been numerous investigations (by the press) indicating that FSU and Tallahassee police likely suppressed and possibly outright ignored investigations into a young woman's complaints that Winston sexually assaulted her.     Damn straight.  Ditto "Broncos".   Umm.  Rapes?  What about the rapes?   There seems to be a huge omission in this thread.   People are bringing up stealing soda and maybe signing autographs and being generally stupid ("FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY!"), but no one has mentioned that he is very likely a rapist?  Possibly multiple times?  The investigations of which were likely covered up by FSU? It would be very foolish to think that this issues won't resonate with NFL GMs, and it likely causes him to fall in a manner similar to what happened with Aaron Hernandez.  I would be embarrassed if the Broncos drafted him.    Tl; dr - Likely rapist will be drafted, but later than based on talent alone.

Yeah, it'll save us the trouble of competing with the Braves for Wild Card spots and Pennants.   throwup sounds   The game tying goal seemed horribly unlucky, too.  Boo.  Oh well, points are points. GG Leafs.   Exactly.  Talk the talk, walk the walk etc.  I mentioned in a comment earlier that these Chargers seem similar to last year's Chiefs, at least with respect to the defense.    Playing Bortles, Smith, Manuel, and Carr will do that for you.  ( I know Carr lit them up - but doesn't that support my argument? )   I am currently reading a biography of Ramanujan/Hardy called, "The Man Who Knew Infinity."  Totally awesome, and could definitely spark a flame of interest.    See, I am the opposite - I think there are places for ties.  Imagine an NFL where there was no overtime at all.  If the game ends in a tie, that's it - tie.  (Obv, postseason would be different.  Since it is so special, I would just go ahead and guarantee one offensive possession per team).  I am just showing the numbers from the years since the realignment, [here] (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1 match=game year_min=2002 year_max=2013 game_type=R playoff_round= game_num_min=0 game_num_max=99 week_num_min=0 week_num_max=99 game_day_of_week= game_time= time_zone= game_location= surface= roof= stadium_id= temperature_gtlt=lt temperature= game_result= overtime=Y league_id= team_id= team_conf_id= team_div_id= opp_id= opp_conf_id= opp_div_id= team_off_scheme= team_def_align= opp_off_scheme= opp_def_align= conference_game= division_game= tm_is_playoff= opp_is_playoff= tm_is_winning= opp_is_winning= tm_scored_first= tm_led= tm_trailed= c1stat= c1comp=eq c1val= c2stat= c2comp=gt c2val= c3stat= c3comp=gt c3val= c4stat= c4comp=gt c4val= order_by=game_date).  Organized for easy viewing:  Year |Overtime Games :---------:|:----------: 2013 |16 2012 |22 2011 |13 2010 |19 2009 |13 2008 |15 2007 |15 2006 |11 2005 |14 2004 |12 2003 |23 2002 |25  Would it really be so bad if there were this many ties every year?  Ties wouldn't automatically be de-facto losses because the half-game in the standings would likely compete with several other teams who have tied.  Additionally, it allows for interesting strategic opportunities late in games, deciding whether or not a tie is sufficient, or if you need to go for the win.    The answer:  zero ridiculous, 100 awesome.   I want all orange ones.  I fear I shall never get them.  Are orange pants too much to ask for in this life?  ARE THEY!?!??!   My life has gone:  Born in Colorado  Move to Utah  Grade School back in Colorado  Undergrad in Iowa (so, I have lived!)  Graduate School in Florida  Now in Wisconsin.  All have their charms.  I miss Colorado for sports and mountain fun.   I am not disrespecting the Chargers at all, but their season has a very Chiefsy feel to it so far.  They punched the world champs in the mouth, sure, but their DBs playing well so far?  Palmer, Smith, Manuel (since benched), Carr (who had a career game), Wilson, and Bortles.  It isn't the stretch of 3rd stringers that the Chiefs feasted on to start 9-0 last year, but it does inflate the effectiveness of their defense, which is why DVOA for them places them a little lower than you'd think.  Again, not taking anything away from them, especially since Rivers is the MVP at the quarter pole, but they remain a flawed team.  Maybe Oliver is the solution at RB, but they are still on their 4th center, and as Chargers, are prone to hilarious meltdowns (it's okay, Bolts Fans, we are too, kinda).  They get to be a little scary for now.  But when we punch them in the mouth they'll see that it ain't easy pacing the AFC West.  Then in December, we'll relieve them of that responsibility for good.   No worries, man.  Just fuckin' with ya.   [Aww, don't be so modest] (http://youtu.be/eF6ZSLDwLhM?t=9s)   It is also currently a very small number of plays that have to deal with this rule, so unless it becomes an issue through frequency, or one high-impact play (like the Navarro Bowman rule), I don't think they'll care enough to alter it.  And, with respect to "ball and feet matter", I meant in relation to positioning on the field.  To score touchdowns, or determine field position, or get out of the endzone to avoid a safety, no one cares where your shoulder is - it should be the same for the LoS.   [Col. Angus?] (http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a7a_1349546320)   lol, ur trippel post is funny lots of downvotes and different   It amuses me that your three triple posts have acquired a different number of negative votes.   I like that all three of your triple-posts have a different amount of down votes.    Nine first downs all day - I wouldn't be happy, either.   We Are 12!   I think this rule needs to be changed in the offseason.  There is no other time in football when the position of the body matters at all (it is always feet or ball).  Not to mention shoulders and fingers and such bullshit.  They should change it to either the feet need to be behind the LoS, or the ball **can not** pass the LoS completely (think of the rule for a Safety).  Also, I don't think you should be able to cross the LoS, come back, and then throw it.  Once the runner has passed it, then the play is a running play and any forward pass will be ruled illegal.  It seems to me that in an era of many burgeoning mobile quarterbacks (Wilson, Luck, Kaepernick, Newton, Smith, etc, etc) this rule will be exploited more and more, and I think it is evident that the Seahawks are looking to exploit this rule in plays designed specifically to go right to the edge of what is legal.  Not hating on them for doing it, it is just an observation.  I mean, after all, they can't call it on every play, right?  (/s)   Came for the AFC West showdown.     I hope whoever loses does so in a heartbreaking fashion.   I saw one that said:  **C**ard  **B**oard  **S**ign  That's pretty okay.   5 minute drill time - Jets' O never touchew the ball again.   Very poor execution this half.  Better step it UP D.   I heard, "IT'S TOO EASY!!!"  Awesome either way.   That catch was actually absurd.   Graphic shows Manning as a Bronco, but not Favre as a Viking.  Just inconsistent and a little funny.   It is known.   Exactly.  Then, he called him Julius five seconds later while watching the same replay.   Dan Fouts.  Usually he is merely annoying, but today he is absolutely intolerable.  Also, he's saying blatantly incorrect things.  On that TD, he said two blatantly false things,  and mixed up the Thomases.   Very simple, actually:  Denver o line is under performing something awful.  Absolutely sabotaging the entire offense.  D lost trevethan, but is playing well.   Better than all.   Yeah, they are being really shitty.   Small sample size.  Talk at the end of the year.   Every player with a goal can say the same.  The whole team has the yips, except Varly.    Okay, I am on fire.  Now what? It's getting real hot.  Pl advdsi   I mean, ideally,  but you don't get to choose when your shit gets tossed.    Source: 43-8.   If you mean in a philosophical way, yeah.  It's kinda Dadaist in how it makes you realize that hockey is meaningless and nothing will ever make you happy.  If you mean literally, then obviously it feels good to have a tongue on your butthole.  Duh.   Very possible.    ITT:  Avs fans too low, Wild fans too high.  No one should jump off a bridge or tatoo, "2015 Stanley Cup Champions" on their neck.  Avs bros, relax, it'll be okay; sometimes you get your shit tossed.     So, it might be hyperbole to say the Avs are losing every 1-on-1 battle, but . . .    My fave from them.  Haven't tried them all yet, to be fair.   New Glarus Spotted Cow.  Wife just drank the last one.  Switching to whiskey.   Avs looked really reticent.  The last five minutes were better, but we were fortunate to get out of that only down 1.   Is it weird that every time I see MAC my first thought is Arnold Schwartzenegger screaming it to a bald black man who is out of his mind with grief / vengeance?   MY FAVORITE PLAYER EVER WAS STEVE ATWATER AND HIS BIGGEST MISTAKE WAS PLAYING FOR THE JETS FOR ONE WHOLE SEASON.   Fair enough, thanks for the perspective.  I hate the Dodgers, too.   Yeah, thanks; I just saw that one.  It confused me because the post title is kind of backwards, and it wasn't the bleacher video that you posted.   Gonna give my two cents here.  1.  Apparently if Kronke move the Rams, he wants to be the only NFL franchise in LA - he will not want the Chargers or Raiders to join him there.  If he is truly adamant about this, I could see the league disallowing the Rams' move to LA, in favor of the AFCW teams.  2.  As for Davis' contention that he will swap to the NFC - that seems very odd to me.  There is such a rich tradition of the Raiders in the AFL and then AFC that I am hesitant to believe that this is anything more than a bargaining chip to get a new stadium for the Raiders.  I mean, Al Davis practically built the AFC, helped with the merger, etc.  To be fair, though, the Raiders have been awful and have a terrible culture of losing in the last decade+, it may be that Mark Davis wants a fresh start, and that could include the realignment.  3.  The Chargers 100% should move.  I get the feeling that a majority of their fan base is in he greater LA area anyway, and I don't think the San Diego die-hards (of which there are some) would completely bail on the franchise if it moved a little north.   4.  Obviously, if the Raiders bail, we get Seattle back.  The Raiders are far more hated as rivals, and it would suck to lose them, but Seattle is a nice consolation prize.  Battling them twice a year would be fun.  5.  If I was given God Powers, I would prefer that the Rams move, Kronke swallows his pride and allows the Chargers to go with him, and the Raiders get a new stadium in the Bay Area.  Additionally, the 49ers become the "Santa Clara 49ers".  tl;dr - Kronke's stubbornness is big, San D and Oakland both need stadiums, and while losing the Raiders as division rivals would suck, Seattle would be a great rival, too.   edit:  also, you should x-post this to /r/nfl.   A fair point, and I don't often pay attention to contract deals and such from other teams - but how many non-max extensions of rookie contracts under the new CBA have happened?  It seems like a small sample size.   Yeah, I know.  You guys fucking pummeled us for like 15 straight years until we became relevant in '77.  The wikipedia article on [our rivalry] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broncos%E2%80%93Raiders_rivalry) is actually put together really well.  In the 60's and 70's, you assholes were 29-10-2 against us.  Fucking brutal.      The stories that I saw mentioned that the language in the new CBA with regards to non-max contract extensions on rookie deals was very, very vague.  So, most likely what happened was they put together a deal that they thought was fine, but the vagaries of the CBA made it not okay, so they had to adjust it.  I wouldn't say that Connely "screwed up" - it was more like trying to get the right form through a government bureaucracy - and filled out flawlessly, to boot.   I say this.  All.  The.  Time.  My wife still doesn't understand.    Oh, I am not saying that he can't get 6 TDs and take the record outright this week - just that it is most likely to happen vs. The Santa Clara 49ers.

Methods I've taken towards my 'side jobs' have even led to discussions, debates, even flat out arguments over the environmentally positive merits of its/their environmental benefits.   I didn't realize that that was what was up for discussion here though.   Everything that needs regulated is regulated.  this statement... hell, even the grammar you used to type it with is... ridiculous, let alone the statement itself.  Let me ask this, if the system *isn't* perfect then how could 'everything that needs regulated' *be* 'regulated' properly?    The fact that you think a back yard gardener needs nitrate control shows how asinine your reasoning is.  I didn't say that backyard gardeners need nitrate control.... though I didn't say they *didn't* either. I think that really just depends, ... and depends on multiple variables of which there are countless different variables coming into play here from neighborhood rules   regs to environmental predeterminations.   What I *did* say was that 'implementations' can scale from the largest farms down to even the backyard gardener.   I've seen fertilizer put on potted plants on someone's deck drip down through the bottom of the hanging baskets into the streams below (think apartments with balconies that back up to natural wooded areas) and cause an excess amount of growth *in* that 'wild area' ... to the same thing happening to the grass beneath someone's deck in their backyard.  I've seen overzealous yard-owners who want their backyard to look as green as the golf course to which it backs up 'over do' their fertilizations in such that their backyard hill ran its runoff into the golf course pond behind it and create algae blooms like none-other *in* said pond.  Hell, my mom used to clean out the backyard pond deal in her backyard when it'd get too much algae in it, let it drain down the hill in the backyard to the sewer pipe area that ended in some wetland deal that's also back there... ... refill the pond, fertilize the beds around it, then a hard rain come a few days later and all the algae from the pond-cleaning combine with the extra fertilizer she too-liberally applied and... ...that 'wetland' deal down below? blew up with algae, weeds, mosquitoes, and all sorts of other vermin...   so, sticking with my original sentiment that even an overly fertilized hanging basket to a backyard garden can benefit from properly implemented runoff management.   (my mom's 'problem' was solved by planting a line of 'pond-crops' (read: cattails and others) in a swale that was cut right at the bottom of the hill running the property line... ...that way the water run off would go into the swale, along with any excess fertilizer and any algae from the water she pumped out of the pond... ...and, when that'd happen, whatever she had growing in that swale would blow up...  created a really nice yard effect, so much so that the neighbors next door and the next one down also implemented the same system (or more continued it) and... it created a really nice 'natural' look to the whole thing.   also drastically reduced the 'vermin' that would result from the wetland deal where it ended (mice, rats, opossums, snakes, racoons, etc).  Jump to farming systems.  Before we switched one of our back fields from traditional corn/soy rotation b.s. to switchgrass... and dug swales into it on contour before the switchgrass seed broadcasting... we had a path wide enough for our 4-wheeler to ride between the rows and the wild area next to it.  ... when it'd rain, the runoff from that field would quickly flow over the path, into the wild area... through it, farther down the hill and into that section of the creek below.  It was really sloppy. Algae would blow up in the stream   creek, the area would become super weedy... riding or walking the field would result in countless bug bites hassles and other annoyances.   We kept the path, but dug a three lines of swales in this ~45 acre field...  on contour, the bottom one running just along the edge of the path, and in such a way that it ran at a slight angle so that the water would 'pool' at a low point in the field...   planted the switchgrass... now it's not an issue.  but, for the first 1.5 years, the swales worked perfectly, the water runoff was drastically reduced as the switchgrass grew and established itself, the water that *did* make it down was caught in the bottom swale, ran to the low point pool and gathered there.... had to put a metal grate over the path so we could ride the 4-wheeler over it w/out getting mud-bath-stuck in it.....  and we planted a bunch of fast growth misc there.  Runoff's not an issue any more that the switchgrass has established itself, the metal grate has since been removed   moved elsewhere on the farm, and the 'pseudo wetland' of runoff has since become a dry area of essential nothingness due to essentially *no* runoff making it there due to the soil absorbing everything that used to.   The woods is no more 'explosive' in growth than any other of the woods bordering the farm... and the stream   creek haven't had algae explosions the same way since.  Point is, from 'industrial agriculture' to 'backyard gardener'... proper runoff management can go a long way.  comfy desk job?   for part of the day? yeah. ...

Most of it  about 96%  is uranium, of which less than 1% is the fissile U-235 (often 0.4-0.8%); and up to 1% is plutonium. Both can be recycled as fresh fuel, saving up to 30% of the natural uranium otherwise required. The materials potentially available for recycling (but locked up in stored used fuel) could conceivably run the US reactor fleet of about 100 GWe for almost 30 years with no new uranium input.    A secondary reason is to reduce the volume of material to be disposed of as high-level waste to about one-fifth. In addition, the level of radioactivity in the waste from reprocessing is much smaller and after about 100 years falls much more rapidly than in used fuel itself.    Several European countries, Russia and Japan have had a policy to reprocess used nuclear fuel, although government policies in many other countries have not yet come round to seeing used fuel as a resource rather than a waste.    but remember, these were world wide events...  and in the 20th century   Well, it's essentially activated carbon (it actually *is* a.c. but from biomass vs coal, so on the one hand it isn't (usually) as porous not activated, on the other, it generally retains the vascular structure of the source feedstock...which proves beneficial in getting nutrients into   out of it)...so it's generally priced accordingly: ~$1/lb ... Though it's better priced volumetrically vs by weight.  That being said, it totally depends on application rates.  Truthfully, it isn't necessarily cost-effective when looked at from a short term perspective..other additives bring a more immediate ROI.  But the medium   long-term effects...benefits...would more than pay for itself.  /r/biochar is loaded with posts about how to both limit any more-immediate negatives that result from the changes it does to the soil, as well how to make its benefits more immediately ROI'able.  That said, you're absolutely correct that poorer soils would benefit more from it, ...and poor soils tend to get more done to them at one time... ...within limits of cost, return, and overall profitability of the crops.  But, I'm of the opinion that it's equally as important, if not more so even, to get it into already high quality soils...to help to *keep* them higher quality...  ...as they're the ones that tend to be both the most relied upon, as well the ones that are worked the *hardest*.  ...*then* work down the line, making the lowest quality soils a lower priority.  Also, higher quality soils *tend* to be worked by more profitable, as well, more likely to be able to afford farmers.  This would give the industry the chance to get on its feet, get the infrastructure in place (as well a wider diversity of understanding how to utilize it), then allow economics of scale to kick in to both lower the price, as well increase the availability to lower quality soils that tend to have lower profit margins.  Obviously the ideal would also be the most likely 'deployment' of it: multiple qualities simultaneously.  But the stuff definitely seems like it provides the 'kick' the world  needs on multiple fronts: energy, soil, food, carbon, water, fertilizer, pesticide reduction, etc   makes perfect sense!   (clearly was being a complete idiot last night when I typed that)  thanks!   Adding it to higher quality soil seems to help keep them 'higher quality' too.

Looking forward to this. Hope it's good.         Gotham is a show with some serious issues. I keep feeling that there's a very good to great show hiding just beneath the surface, but right now it's a bit of a mess.   Be forewarned, there are people who hate the show with a white hot, inchoate rage. The comment section over at the AV Club is filled with these types. I get the idea that they're angry because they want an actual Batman TV show and they're getting this instead.  I find it to be an enjoyable hour of television for what it is.  Sean Pertwee is great as Alfred and the rest of the cast is decent to very good, for the most part.

When Alicia and Will exchanged those sexy e-mails, they were working for Lockhart Gardner, which is a completely different entity than Florick Agos/Florick, Lockhart   Agos.  Anyway, It's established early on that Prady and Alicia are both Dems. In S06E09 we have the DINO (Democrat In Name Only) spot.   In a heavily Democratic area like Cook County, the Democratic Primary is essentially the election, but you still have to have an election. You can't say that the winner is the SA-elect.  Moreover, if the election that was potentially spoiled was the Democratic Primary, there's no way that the Dems could have lost a seat in the state legislature if there was a recount.   Nothing from this whole SA plot makes any sense at all.

I am amortizing the cost of the battery over the amount of energy it could reasonably be expected to produce. How you intend to use the battery is irrelevant. If you have an issue with my calculations, I'd be interested to hear it.   As for your calculations, the numbers you're using are way low. To disconnect from the grid you'd probably need at least two, probably three batteries to account for days with low or no sun. Even assuming you do the install yourself, which wouldn't be allowed by Tesla at this point, you haven't even added in the cost of an inverter to your package.  Unless you really want to get off the grid for some reason, grid connected solar with net metering and energy buyback from your electric company makes a lot more economic sense at this point than buying a $3000 battery.   Your numbers don't make any sense at all.   First, let's forget about the 10kWh unit for now. As noted [here](http://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/teslaenergy?via=newsletter source=CSAMedition), the 10kWh unit is for backup applications with weekly cycling. The 7kWh is designed for the daily use we're talking about.   So, it's $3,000 for the 7kWh unit.  We have a ten year warranty. 10 * 365.25 * 7=25567.5 kWh. That's 11.7 cents per kWh just for the battery.  But wait, how much juice can we get out of that unit every day? 7kWh? No way, unless we repeal the laws of physics.  Tesla states the battery has 92% round trip efficiency. 92% of 7 is 6.44. Then we have to factor in the losses in the inverter. A typical inverter is about 95% efficient. We now have 6.12 kWh or 22346 kWh. 13.4 cents per kWh.  Can we use all that 6.12 kWh every day? Probably not. Cycling a battery down to 0% charge every day is going to kill it way before its time, unless Musk has invented some kind of super new battery. Let's be generous and say we can use 90% of the power every day without damaging the battery. 5.5 kWh per day or 20111 kWh over the battery life. 14.9 cents per kWh.  That's nearly fifteen cents a kWh just for the battery.  That's roughly what grid power costs in a lot of places.  And remember we're not even calculating the cost of the inverter or installation, which is going to be several thousand dollars on top of that.  Plus, I haven't even attempted to calculate the loss of charge capacity over time, which is significant.

Heck, in a lot of places they can't even buy a can of spray paint.   In most states, an adult having sex with a 14 year old is a serious felony that results in serious jail time because someone that age is not mature enough to consent to sex.  Yet when we enter the criminal justice realm, we're ready to lock someone away for the rest of their natural life because of a decision they made when they were 14. To me, that's morally wrong.   Obvious troll is obvious.   He was 14 when he committed the crime. Doesn't that merit a little mercy?      Deadline reports it as "Living On Video", but [this article](http://www.law360.com/articles/648222/hbo-nixes-living-on-video-name-after-tm-challenge) notes trademark issues with the name.          I think a stylus would be nice. There are a lot of Apple-loving artists would would like to do artwork on their iPad.         Reminds me a bit of "The Drive-In" by Joe Lansdale.      I like mine and everyone who got one seems to like it. The keyboard is kinda crappy, so a couple people got other KBs to use with them.  It's a nice tool if you're in a Microsoft environment. You can take it with you everywhere and it's got all the MS apps. The Win8 interface is actually not all that bad on a touchscreen.   This movie was great. I wonder why it didn't get a wider release here in the US. I went to go see it with my wife and daughter at my local art theater and the place was packed.  The story was OK, but the animation was just so beautiful to look at. Every scene was a spectacular piece of art.   I think they've been coming out with new ones roughly once a year.  I bought Surface Pro 2's for my operations group back in March/April of last year and I remember the 3's came out not that long after.   I think that you generally replace lead-acid batteries on a solar installation every six years or so. The Tesla is supposed to last ten years, so not quite twice the lifespan.    It's important to note that less than half of the officers killed in the line of duty were killed due to felonious actions, i.e. killed by a perp. Over the last ten years, an average of 50 police officers lost their lives this way each year.   And the FBI numbers are way low in large part because there is no mandatory reporting.  Canvassing of media reports shows that [at least 1100 people were killed by police in 2014](http://www.killedbypolice.net/kbp2014.html).      The EU is way ahead of us here in the USA with respect to energy efficiency requirements.   For example, I have a high-efficiency, condensing gas boiler heating my home.  I understand these are quite common in Europe, but it took some doing to find someone qualified to install it here.   Here you [go](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+2700+square+feet+in+square+meters)   Eight of [these](http://www.solar-electric.com/trt16vo225ah.html) gives you just over 10kWh. A four by two array would be about 21" deep and 30" wide.    I'm pretty sure an emergency generator is going to be cheaper over the long-term than any kind of a battery backup. A good generator can last for a long time and it has the advantage of keeping your lights on if you lose power for more than half a day.   The longevity might be one factor in Tesla's favor, although lead-acid batteries designed specifically for solar power applications already have pretty good longevity.  While the Tesla solution might be somewhat less trouble than a conventional system, less maintenance, etc, no home house battery is going to be plug-and-play. And if you're already paying to have solar installed, the additional labor to install a battery system is minimal.    Homes in the USA are larger than they are in Germany. The average home in the US is just under 2700 square feet.  Also, a large portion of the US is a lot warmer than Germany and homes there require a lot of air conditioning to stay comfortable from late spring through early fall.   I'm sorry, your point is what, exactly?   As it is, it's still more than twice as expensive as a lead-acid battery setup for your PV system, which is still not economical unless you're planning to live off the grid.   The answer is,  it isn't.   It's smaller and lighter (and prettier), but it's also more than twice as expensive as a lead-acid battery system for your photovoltaic setup, which can be had for around $100/kWh.         My biggest question is why would you pay the premium for Li-Ion for home installation? Lithium batteries are great because they're smaller and lighter, which is great if you want to put them in a car or a laptop, but not very important if you're going to stick it in a closet or in your basement.  A standard Lead-Acid photovoltaic battery setup costs around $100/kWh. The big battery from Tesla is $350/kWh. What's the justification for spending two and a half times as much?   I agree. I generally have issues with endings, even well done ones. But the SFU ending was pretty much perfect.            Actually, the argument is that the 20 year decline in crime levels that began in the 90's can be traced to the elimination of leaded gasoline. In fact, you can look at other nations and see a similar decline in crime levels tracing back to when they also eliminated leaded gasoline.  Since we know the effects of lead on the developing brain, it's an argument that has a lot of credibility to it.      Deadshot was originally more of a [modern cowboy character](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/08/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-275/) before he lost his eye and got the targeting monocle.   So we're probably seeing his origin story here...unless they're just messing with us.    This would certainly be illegal here in the US. I find it unlikely that it would be legal in the UK.  Here's a site to start your search, including a helpline you can call.  https://www.gov.uk/pay-and-work-rights  Best of luck.      I graduated high school in 1984, so picking a favorite 80's movie for me is particularly difficult.  I'd have to call it a tie between Empire Strikes Back and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Oh, and there's no way I'm clicking though ten pages for an 80's movie list, so I didn't bother reading the linked article.       Just FYI, this isn't my photo or my house . It was forwarded to me by a FOAF.   Here's a bit of explanation:  The tenant decided, completely on his own, to attempt installation of a french drain. In doing so, from what I understand based on the adjustor's conversation with me, he took a backhoe and basically unearthed the entire foundation. That made the foundation not have any footing, and voila.   I think the answer is that we need to take direct control of economic decisions away from computers. Computers should be able to calculate, analyze and advise, but only a human being should be able to buy or sell.  I don't know how we'd do this. The implementation would almost certainly be difficult, perhaps impossible. But if we don't, we'll be living in a world where the economy is increasingly dominated by algorithmic decision making and the ultimate result is not going to be good for humanity.                     A mere bag of shells.    Well, I'm sure there will be sports on the broadcast channels, but your wouldn't be paying extra for sports cable channels like ESPN, NFL Network, YES, etc.      Peter Porker: The Spectacular Spider-Ham  	84

The straw that broke the camel's back occurred this past Summer when mom got wasted at a family gathering in honor of my dad and tried to drive home.  She got all dramatic and basically threw my dads ashes(in a can) at my 8 year old son who then completely lost it and was crying hysterically.  Same trip I guess my sister was telling other family members that they've always hated my wife and that she was trying to ruin/break-up the family for years etc.  My wife said that was it - she's done.   my sister and mom are together a codependent nightmare which over the years has tried the patience of all those around them - sis is a recovering speed/heroin junkie but per mom is "always working so hard and getting so much better" and "misses her brother soo much" ad nauseam.   ask a butcher what's in their meatloaf mix - usually a mixture of beef/veal/pork I think.

 You also have to look at the audience. Majority of the Sepang and Singapore audience are tourist/foreigners, especially Aussies. Most would certainly choose only one over the other   What /u/FreakyJk means that with the near proximity, there are higher chances of split audience. COTA and Mexico has a larger location gap, which means that Mexicans that are closer to COTA would choose there instead of the Mexican GP.    Sepang after Singapore? And that's too near the usual slot for Sepang's Moto GP. I forsee my budget for Sept/Oct will be tighter than usual ;A;      he had prosthetic. only the lower part of his foot is crushed so he could still walk    Dunno man. It was awesome to see it the first time, with Vampiro marking out.   But too much of the same thing will make it boring. When I see that gif now for me it's like "yep, a dive and catch"   Because they need someone to fill Bryan's slot on Smackdown ASAP? As I said, it was also because they promised the IC Championship match on ER, but it was cut out due to Bryan's injury. IMO the original original content plan for today was that Renee's segment where she interviewed Rollins   As with the title, could everyone post their wheel settings in this thread? It would be easier if everything in one place compared to separate thread about FANATEC, Thrustmaster or Logitech littered around.  And also a request, could anybody explain the Steering Saturation and Steering Linearity in this game? Getting a hard time to get a 1:1 steering input with the Thrustmaster T300RS   IIRC the world feed (for TV that is) for this year are using SkyF1's commentary. That's what we are getting from Fox in Malaysia.   But true, the individual broadcasters might be a problem, as well as Bernie who seems like an old fashioned chap   I have a feeling the "sudden" decision to have the KotR tournament was due to Daniel Bryan's injury, and the non defense of the Intercontinental title at ER.   This way, they give the viewers a "title" match, give some talents the needed exposure (Neville), give the network an extra network only show, and still keep the title on Bryan until they figure out how long he will be out.   Does all the travelling takes a toll on you?  And which circuit do you always looking forward to go every year? Do you think F1 would be more popular if it introduces a legal pay stream?     It should work, as long as the controller is a directInputDevice compatible         Depends on your location. It was out for me since 4 hours ago      Bloody hell, i never realised that it would lap nearly the same as one would at Spa. And in comparison Mt Panorama is just 6.2km compared to 7km of Spa   http://www.f1technical.net/articles/10862     Gee I wonder which engine manufacturer would want to actually make a V8 after investing so much in V6 Vijay? certainty not the one providing your current engine   hence his drug abuse. WWE seems to be toning Neville's ability down to keep him from hurting himself and rely on painkillers.      /r/firstworldanarchists   Had a chance to get Roman to win the KotR and get him over with marks  WWE does not include him in the tournament, and stick him with Rollins storyline instead  Fuck this company   kayfabe wise, more surface area to throw your opponent in   Dean Ambrose has finally won a PPV Singles Match, stretching back from MITB 2014.      IT WAS YOUR NOTEPAD!   "E C DUB! E C DUB! E C DUB!"   Pretty okay match. I mean it was a spot fest in a mark town, so props to that. But the match did nothing in showing Reigns wrestling ability. It only shows he can take bumps. The tag team match was a whole lot more entertaining than this match in terms of wrestling move and in ring skills.  Interestingly I was more entertained by the Big Show's attitude.   Basically he needs to be what Rocky Maivia did when he turned into The Rock. They seemed similar. Both pushed to the moon, and got chewed out by the fans.   The only difference was The Rock was repackaged into a heel, and made it work, but Reigns did not change, and is still hand held through everything.    "Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!"   nor the fact that most stores activates their games on STEAM as well?      Physics told us it wont happen. To do quick release system for engine would introduce high stressed parts, especially on the drivetrain. That does not include the fact that they need to unplug and replug the fuel line, which introduce danger.   The only real solution would be to make the whole rear detachable. But that would mean a weaker monocoque they wpuld flex and roll and in the end disintegrate the car. To renforce it would mean added weight. And there is no way they would want a heavy car because that would offset any advantage they would have in the first place   Quick, yes. But one minute change? No.    Only the lap times. The speeds is most likely there since there are less aero drags   It takes nearly half a minute to change a front wing. And that't just taking off four pins, taking off the old wing, put on a new one, and putting on a pin again.   An engine much more complicated. Considering that the modern engine now is ICE, where it interconnects to each other, and more importantly connects to a drivetrain that connects to the rear of the chassis. That would at least take an hour of work.   A minute  I doubt an engine change would take that fast   Bray - Undahteika, Harper - Kane?  New tag team playa! Holla holla   While the current dates on his previous contract has been fulfilled, we have no idea if Sting and WWE have an agreement for a future contract. It's all up in the air  That being said I'll mark out if he suddenly appears in LU   They told the teams to not used the tyres in weird ways before the Silverstone incident. And yet they were the ones looking bad after that   weird. I don't think FFB would have any problems.  My settings are Deadzone: 0% FFB Type: Wheel FFB Strength: Med FFB Dampening: 0%  all the others are on default  My steering is the Thrustmaster T300RS + Ferrari F1 Rim   Yes. That's what I thought as well. Pirelli won't want the Silverstone debacle again, as well as the FIA. Imagine a team using the SS at Sepang, and it hit the cliff in the middle of the lap sending the car careering off. Won't be a good PR   Did you change controller type? When you set it at gamepad/joystick, the game change the input based on how long you press/hold.  Changing it to Wheel makes it use analogue input instead   They are really sweet tho, even in kayfabe. Thank god they hooked up before the WWE ban on internal relationship took place   Why are all the other sponsors are kept, while Marlboro is coughing?   Holy shit thanks!   The link to download CTDP 05 from their site is dead tho :/  Only the new mods seems to be downloadable  http://www.ctdp.net/  Edit: Oh, it's actually back up. My mistake  Edit edit: Any way I can get their old F1 1998 Mod tho?   Yeah. The map will have track numbers on them so that they can easily identify and which corner when communicating with engineers  Some teams have them on the steering like so:   http://www.farzadsf1gallery.com/image_upload/diapo_033.jpeg  http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/eur/faq2.jpg  Edit: Found a pic of a map in Massa's Ferrari http://cdn-5.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/1000000/1030000/1034000/1034600/1034625/s8/f1-belgian-gp-2010-track-map-in-cockpit-of-felipe-massa-scuderia-ferrari.jpg   Assetto Corsa. Actually it looks quite good. but the encoding for the video was bad since I selected frame blending in Premiere and quite a low bitrate   It was made by ISI. The base game engine (gMotor) IS a full blown simulator and was used to make: -  - rFactor (gMotor2)  -- rFactor team version, which some teams uses for promo purposes on roadshow. McLaren uses this. Also Formula E road show uses this modded version at all of their races.  -- rFactor Pro, of which some F1 teams like Red Bull and Toro Rosso uses for their simulator.   -- rFactor 2, an updated version of rFactor with DX11 support  - GTR/GTR 2 (gMotor2)  -- Developer of GTR, Simbin/Slightly Mad Studios went on to make NFS Shift and Shift 2 with only some game engine, with graphic updates.   - Reiza Studio's Stock Car Extreme, Formula Truck and Copa Petrobras. (gMotor2)     I'm not even mad. I was just curious ^^;   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKv8k7GnmpY  For comparison, here's how a 2014/15 game looks like. 10 years really do make a lot of difference   After playing it last night I still love it. I just hate that the 16:9 resolution is limited to 1600x900 only without any option to go to Full HD :/  I miss my old mods tho. The CTDP 2005 Mod was one of the best F1 mod I've ever driven on F1 Challenge.   Ah no wonder   With the game voiceover telling it's "Magny Cours" I'd never thought anybody would miss that      It's just a sarcastic joke :/   Won't be long before we see some of the talents on LU appear in NXT   The original is still better   Not blackjack mulligan   David and Devitt are pronounced the same in Japanese,  (Deibiddo). It makes no sense for him to change anything since it won't do anything. What's most likely was the Prince () was added because Fergal (? ?) is weird in Japanese  Wiki also list his name as "Devitt" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Devitt   he was being funny. You need to read the tweet's timeline to get the context   It is. The system switched off.   1997  Nobody on the grid  10 years later  grid full of media   Depends. The token system means that Mercedes still has an advantage, at least until next year. 2017 might be their year tho, and they are looking stronger in each race   GTX MLXXX   Is Raymond Stereo still in the game or do I need to add him with mods?   basically it's like Onions. Onions has layers, PC/computer/console has layers.    I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there.   While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.  Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.       http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1930105-remembering-andre-the-giants-larger-than-life-career-and-complexities  I'll just leave this here      "Shh, I know it hurts man"      I watched it just recently. I think it was on the Network but for the love of god I forgot what show was it    Both new tyres according to live timing as well on the f1 site. Which means they might be going soft - medium - medium in the race      I did. Turns out the network was baby butt smooth using VPN, while my country's cable company decided to show an SD version of WM, and it costs more than the network :/   It's Vine. not twitter video. It's just linked on twitter      yeah, just realised that. Try using Hola and use Malaysia as your proxy. It's not blocked here for some reason      For Mercedes and Ferrari, use Puma as their kit sponsor   I'm waiting for his bad ass biker gimmick   Not legal brah    :   Never knew about this. Thanks!  This is where the Briscoe's ply their trade right? Going to see why WWE wants them so bad     As said, I live in South East Asia. Other than WWE, there are basically no other wrestling program on TV shown. A cable channel did show TNA during the Hogan era, but that does not even last a year.  I am really interested in WWE alternatives, especially LU and was wondering is there a way to view them other than *cough*acquiring it via video sharing*cough*.  Thanks in advance!    Miles better than the force scripted ones that he was fed with. But still not on par with some of the best talkers on the current roster. Even Cena is still a better talker than him.   Given time, he will be as good as Cena. He will never be as good as his cousin tho.   tubthimping by John Cena  djingis Khan by Uhaa nation      as once said by Jay of OSW, Dunn might hate wrestling, but he gave wwe that much needed production value   Because Hunico can speak english, so he and his opponent can communicate better in the ring    Money.

Weird   Anything that Val Venis says   Greetings from South East Asia!  http://i.imgur.com/x8b1Dmu.png  And that is USD 41   Is there a dickbutt in the UPS logo?  Jokes aside, that is awesome. Even Formula E was kinda closed off and I only managed to sneak in on Friday   But.. but... he debuted as the Man's Man  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpPsbkHzrok   Guy still looks like he has a few more years in him, and his in ring performance is still good. I hope he can still have his match with ~~Cody~~Stardust down the line on the grandest stage of them all.   From comparison, I see that a company would use Drew if they need a simple, robust but good looking/modern belt. If they want an intricate, highly decorative belt that has the retro look, they would use Millican/Parks.   Thanks, didn't know that. I took for granted that most belts are made by Millican or Parks  *edit* God fucking damn it Wildcat. They put "Chris Benoit" on the US Title name plate. I can't stop laughing   bad encoding on Fox, combined to their auto bandwith selection for streaming lead to this. Fox also shows F1 in South East Asia, and their 1.2Mbps HD stream on their website looks washed and bad. And even when it's 1.2Mbps, it will auto downgrade to the next lowest, 400Mbps  the moment it detects a bit of lag on your internet.   I discovered that turning off all things running in background, especially torrent, help in keeping the stream at 1.2Mbps.    He is going to TNA. I'm sure   He was over when he did that scripted shoot promo. Look it up   Because the girl is the awww factor?    But I take that WWE designed it, so that it's their own fault that it looks bad?  Also OCC and Millican worked together to make it   http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/10-greatest-championship-belts      nwa has their dome belt. for them the belt has more linage and association with nwa compared to the big gold belt. ironically, wwe also owns the original dome belt   did you guys know that most wrestling belts are done by one guy?  http://www.davemillicanbelts.com/  he does belts for WWE, TNA, ROH and others      He also said that Hamilton's soft lasted only 11 laps while Vettel lasted 14 and can do more   CM Punk is a lead in a harem anime. I actually think it works, and works well   I forgot where someone said this, but if you can hear the ring thuds in WWE, it means that the fans are silent and don't care about the match   https://youtu.be/5PwWjRR6uxo  checo was Banzai'ing, but only one clean overtake happened   im guessing he has low rear grip due to old tyres. GP2 has limited sets per weekend, and some drivers may use them all up in race one leaving them with worn tyres for race 2   someone send OSW lots of beer and tatoo their name and ask them to do it   Remember the Shockmaster?      awesome and good wallpaper material as well. did you render the on track pics? because those those looks damn realistic.  the design is brilliant, even tho most wont adhere to FIA rule and / or make no sense (single pillar for the front wing?) but concept car never meant to make sense.  you should tweet or email this to the Red Bull PR   I bought this set, altho the Ferrari was a tad too expensive   That being said, I bought the Lego 42000 and 42039 Technic set as well   Neville's ear is what makes gravity forgets him   Reigns vs Big Show  Triple Threat feat. Reigns and Ryback  Nope, I just went to sleep rather than waste any energy   Super Dragon   Lines: the thing that Lilian Garcia forgot   Yep. But some of the early WWF/WWE matches were still using aluminium ladders, which flexes dangerously. Hence why they changed it to wood   Mike Awesome's Awesome Bomb (Running Razor's Edge). God it look so dangerous, especially since WCW has a small ring, and the guy on the end of the move usually would nearly get their head hit the turnbuckle   Since Renault is a French team, would the higher management be happy for them to be based in Faenza?   If they do move, (to England's motorsport valley I presume) this would also mean the end of an era to the original Minardi team   I love their accent. "T-Shart" was a hilarious botch   Saying about Cole, not Lilian tho   Cole added it a bit later  "Remember folks, this is a no disqualification match".   Either I did not hear it the first time, or the dub it in the Network replay of WM   Damien Sandow winning a world title   I misread the OP's title as "Indian Movie" and was hyped to see JR in Bollywood :/   i think he's a part timer who helps talen in nxt to learn, and not really having a real run   Depends on Trips honestly. Joe does not really need to prove anything, but WWE loves their superstars to toe the line, hence going to NXT to clean some rough edges so to speak   Remember  Rufus "Pancake" Patterson? I wish they would let him use that character more  	139
    Scientists actually sent tardigrades into space with the mission name "Tardigrades In space" shortened to TARDIS   I can relate to this. Hugs, OP. Sorry you're struggling :(   Hey, I'm a lady and I still think this is a fucking badass apartment. I'd live there happily!   Xioacan old fashioned.    2oz Mezcal   Muddled sugar cube and luxardo cherry   2-4 dash hellfire bitters   Add ice, top with ginger beer   Whoa, this is an old post, haha. Thanks, I guess?   this is awesome, thanks!   I know, but I can dream!!!   The first thing I thought of was how fucking cool it would be to have eyes that see colors/uv/infrared like the mantis shrimp can. THE THINGS WE COULD SEE!   Why would you post a video of yourself throwing a giant tantrum?   clearly!   Gotta keep fighting the good fight! **hugs**   One of my best friends almost died from lupus. Her story is so sad. She is better now, but she has to be really careful lest flare-ups happen. She broke out in terrible hives when we were in Spain together and her throat almost closed up. It was really scary being in a country where none of us knew much of the language during a situation such as that.   [Josh Ritter- Another New World](http://youtu.be/ZsGXWTJ-r_c)   "I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to   The old world to drink and decline   And to pretend that the search for another new world   Was well-worth the burning of mine"     I... have a weird opinion of feel good music, haha.   The one that drunkenly hits on me and when I say I'm not interested calls me a lesbian.   [The Elected: Sun, Sun, Sun](http://youtu.be/WqwcjexDvBQ)   This. Just don't shove faith down my throat and we're cool. I won't shove my lack thereof in yours.   The thesaurus is a great source! Any smartphone has a thesaurus in conjunction with the dictionary app. Type in a word, find something similar.    My favorite word is "absolutely". It may seem silly and common, but the use of absolutely in place of "sure" or "no problem" comes of so much more eloquent.   Depression/suicide awareness. I feel like so many people are depressed but so few people have the tact or understanding to be a supportive friend to someone struggling with depression. So many people give advice but usually all someone wants is to *not* talk or think about their issues. That's what a therapist is for. We just want to be distracted as a way to be cheered up.    Also, eating disorders. There isn't a whole lot of understanding with the kind of addiction and struggle that ED sufferers endure. A lot of people think it's about vanity when it very rarely is, or, if it started out that way, it never is the reason for persisting.    God I love Josh Ritter. Another new world is absolutely gorgeous. Also, The Temptation of Adam...   Saloon!   Boston shaker is the best! I live and work at a bar right by there :)   I got my septum done at chameleon in Harvard sq in the garage. Very clean and professional. This was in '09 and I still have it; no complications, and painless.   Whoa, really?! I always thought it was a healthy alternative to *eating food*.   Smoking.   Dark, malty beer and almond butter... mmmgod yes.   There's a restaurant in Canada called "Signs" that is an all deaf staff where sign language is mandatory for ordering. You could probably work there even if you weren't deaf, I'm sure...   Even better: "What do they mean?!"   Hahaha, true story. I worked as a travel assistant in a call center that sold tour packages to American seniors. I chatted for a good hour with this guy's father! Dude was hilarious and so proud of his kids!   Honestly wasn't expecting the comment to get noticed, let alone be so popular, haha.   Ugh, thank you for referencing Big Mama! I feel like nobody knows her and it's tragic because she's *fucking awesome*!   Right there with you. It's a blessing and a curse, damn it!   Yeah, if it becomes a massive string it can be a little cumbersome.   Night mode is pretty rad. I should probably do that for my eyeballs sake.   So many different platforms I'm learning about!   Well it's not *too far* from the truth.    Ha, well based on everyone elses response, it seems like I'm not the only one. But, you know, it's cool if you feel that way.   I had people trying to get me on reddit for about three years. Now I have no life.   I'll agree with you there. I've gotten to liking the layout in a lot more ways than I initially thought, but there are still flaws that sometimes keep me from commenting/participating.   I refuse to download any platforms for reddit. I already waste too much time here   That sounds awful!   Yeah, it takes time. Now that I'm used to it, I actually quite like the layout.   Yeah, I feel you there... I spend WAY too much of my time on here.   I was coaxed into trying SomethingAwful and used to browse it regularly. It got kind of boring and I ditched any type of forums for a while. Eventually, friends of mine kept forwarding funny/interesting threads and I decided I'd give it a fair shot. Still hooked.   Touch   Hahaha, at least you kept trying! Dr. Pepper is huge in Texas.   That's fair. I can agree with that.   Haha, yeah but for some reason men think the same thing. When I specifically try to give off the "just being friendly, not interested in dating, but you're cool, bro." vibe, a lot of men take it as playing hard to get.    Yeah, gay men seem to have no problem flirting with women and women definitely tend to be okay with it. I think it's just "fun" for the guys and "safe" for the women.   They'd be more likely to have an orgy if they're **all** gay, don't you think? I guess I would consider myself straight because I pretty much only date men, but I enjoy sleeping with women. I prefer not to consider myself any particular sexuality because it's not really that black and white, though. Pansexual? haha...   Ah, I used to work in a cubicle. That shit would *not fly* there!   Thanks for pointing that out! Derp. I work at a bar. There's really no such thing as harassment in bars. I mean, obviously *there is*, but we're all pretty open with being weird and inappropriate. It's best to just roll with it rather than get all uptight.   Eh, I don't think so. We're just very open about our sexuality/sex lives at work. Restaurants and bars are pretty inappropriate by normal job standards.   Nope. I have long hair! It was a lady coworker that said that one to me, haha.   I would love it if that song played in the background every time I had to tell a drunk idiot to please get the hell out of my way while I'm carrying 5 manhattans.  	56
 This should be a Cards Against Humanity card   Honestly I would fund a kickstarter to get this into a like full-length Novel. I crave more. However, I have a question. Why can't Phil go back to the mortal world? Was it the demon thing he did?   [for those who don't get it] (https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSE6WRClO9Ia-Y7ykJPM2e6uCQ7DhW3drph2A94hkzejueMXbhk_w)   Decently sure that's just italicized "Times New Roman"      *upvotes furiously*   I'm hoping so      /u/Stokeez already linked it. So, thank you feller   Don't worry, I gotchu both  I'll download   upload to MediaFire   Yeah I saw that too, interesting. I wonder if that's going on Chance's Solo project.      Speaking of, is there any way you could link them to me? The novels, I mean. Since I don't know your real name I can't really Google it lol. Sorry if it's an inconvenience.   RemindMe! May 27 at 8 PM   This is amazing. It's short, yes, but amazing. You and /u/RPWrites are my favourite Reddit-Writers.   I definitely will be looking into those novels of yours.   Anyone know how long this is going on?   That says AZ-T09*3*, not 5   Thank you so much for having Greats on here! I feel as though that as a brand, they don't get enough recognition in the sneaker/streetwear world.   So I may or may not be making a compilation of this in a file on my computer named "The Devil's Daughter"   You sing it too, but your Grandma ain't my Grandma   I just recently watched this and is currently my favourite Short Film.   Velco Roshes don't exist. Not that I am aware of, at least.  If you're feelin creative, buy a pair and *make* them velcro.   Could someone link that Filling Pieces?   How does one rock Combat Boots like those?  	24
 Exactly - even in the article it was mentioned that it had been going on for several years.   I mailed this story - linking this Reddit post - to Gawker media.       You have a great adviser.   Run away from this PI - do NOT work with such a guy.   Thanks,   Exactly - even after all this these morons are sometimes so full of themselves - it is just astounding.   Not sure if Poe's law.      I am asking on behalf of a friend. Do you guys know of Materials Science departments which have spring Phd admissions? I know of Penn State and UIUC as the only two good schools who do so.  *x-posted on [r/GradSchool](http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/37p4ax/spring_materials_science_phd_admits/)*   I am asking on behalf of a friend.

Penn State for quite a few years have invested in research equipment. Millennium Science Complex facilities rival a national lab today - which is why MatSE is the highest NSF funded department in the nation.    Not completely true - we cannot replace book knowledge - yet. And most MechE, EE and MatSE students are heavily involved in research too. I know of several undergrads graduating with journal publications.    Steidle is being completely torn down from the inside and renovated right now. The thing is - it costs $50M, and moving equipment was a year long job. Similar thing will happen to Fenske after Steidle.

 The thing that I find interesting about atheism is that generally they don't believe in an all-powerful God. What if God isn't all-powerful? Perhaps there is some form of higher-dimensional being who is trying to help life survive in the same way that we humans try to make plants grow etc.  In my eyes it's not God vs No God. There are a lot more possibilities than that.   I said the same about iPads, I couldn't comprehend what everyone else was getting so excited about.   "No Mr Bond, I expect you to die."   http://hashtagfuneral.tumblr.com   "Just put your trousers over there next to mine."   Thank God, why would you stop filming this halfway through?!   I only just saw this comment from you. That's hilarious! I wish I could claim royalties...   I have a weirdly big and perky butt for a skinny guy. It's surprisingly liberating.   www.11foot8.com   What guy?   Adorable store owner tries to work up the courage to ask customer out on a date.  Edit: Thanks for the gold mysterious redditor!   I'm assuming there's a good reason that these sort of things aren't being reported in more prestigious news services (BBC, Guardian etc etc.).   Is this actually much less of a big deal than DM are making out?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tmhysD7NKg   Hey I get health anxiety too! Hit me up if you want to talk :)   I can't believe it either. It looks so simple and not like exercise at all but I definitely felt it in my upper neck!   I don't quite have the same problem as you, but I do have trouble with speaking a little too quickly. To be honest the best fix for me is that I now live with several foreign people, every time they mishear what I say it's a reminder that I need to speak more clearly.   I'd suggest doing something similar. Every time someone in day to day life asks you to repeat what you said, use this as a reminder that you should be speaking more clearly.  EDIT: typo  	16
